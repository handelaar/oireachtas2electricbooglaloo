      <P>I have notice from Senator Reynolds that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to establish an office of his Department in Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim to deal with headage grants and other agricultural matters.</P>
      <P>I have received notice from Senator Sherlock of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need to proceed with reconstruction plans for Kilavullen National School, County Cork, in view of the threat to the health and safety of pupils and teachers arising from the present conditions.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to outline the number of EC Programmes where funding is available for job creation and other employment related schemes, and if he has examined the present situation with a view to getting the maximum financial draw down and the plans he has to make the programmes <Col N="1186" /> more widely available throughout local communities.</P>
    <P>I have received notice from Senator O'Toole of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to establish on an experimental or pilot basis a job sharing scheme for teachers.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Reynolds, Sherlock, Daly and O'Toole as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Reynolds' and Senator Sherlock's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Daly and Senator O'Toole may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>I was disappointed yesterday on Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill that certain information was made available to one side of the House only.  The information related to allocations to voluntary organisations.  It is understandable that Members of Government parties will receive information <Col N="1187" /> from Ministers but I was disappointed that the information was debated without being made available to this side of the House.  We were denied the opportunity to challenge or support it.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to continue yesterday's arrangement regarding speeches &mdash; 20 minutes per speaker.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I call Senator Mooney to resume the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's initiative and the timely nature of this legislation in the context of the changing political face of Europe.  I referred earlier to what I saw as an unacceptable rise in facism in Central Europe and one could not help but remember the infamous Nuremberg Laws of 1934 which excluded a number of ethnic races, especially the Jews, from German society.  While it may seem like a quantum leap from the 1930s to the 1990s, I am sure the Minister will agree that in a democracy we must be ever vigilant to ensure that the rights of minorities and those on the margins are protected.</P>
      <P>What, if any, monitoring system is proposed under this legislation?  Does it differ in any way from the previous legislation? I notice that the explanatory memorandum refers to a right of appeal and a commissioner being established. However, I wonder if in the Minister's experience, companies have attempted to get around the law since 1977 in a quasi-legitimate fashion, in much the same way as accountants indulge in what is euphemistically known as creative accounting in order to skirt the spirit of legislation on for example, tax matters.  I am thinking particularly of the point I was making earlier wearing my broadcasting hat.  On further perusal of my short term contract, I notice there are still disclaimers relating to any obligation on the part of my employers to regard me or any of my colleagues in a similar position as members of staff.  These disclaimers relate to staff benefits.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into too much detail on this, because I am sure there are lawyers who go over every line of staff contracts to ensure that there is not just an advantage to the employer but also an awareness of legislative obligations. I would like to know what monitoring system there is in the Department, other than the actual claims procedure.  Is the law framed in such a way that if employees feel they have been discriminated against, they must then take the initiative and seek an appeal against possible dismissal?  I am sure the Minister will address that in her reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1189" /> I welcome this legislation; it is timely and in keeping with the innovative moves made by the Minister throughout her political career.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House particularly because this is the first Bill to be initiated in this House since I was elected and, as such, it deserves my careful attention.  I was pleased that the Leader of the House was able to adjust the original proposal to allow time between Second and Committee Stages because we will be putting down worthy amendments on this first Bill to be initiated in this House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the principle of the Bill.  It is essential that we should have law on unfair dismissals, and we should keep that law up to date, bringing it into line with changing conditions and improving it in the light of the practical experience.</P>
      <P>The Bill, in its present form, needs some improvement and on Committee Stage I will put down specific amendments. At this stage my comments will be of a general nature.  First I would like to highlight the need for a very careful balance in legislation of this kind.  On the one hand, we must legislate to protect the rights of those who are at work.  In today's conditions we all recognise the value of employment more than ever, and it is right that no person's employment should ever be taken from them without due cause or process.  On the other hand, we must take equal care to ensure that dismissal is possible in those unfortunate cases where it is justified. We must take extreme care not to make it so difficult, cumbersome and costly for the employer to dismiss an employee that it becomes, in practical terms, impossible to dismiss anybody for any reason.  We need to balance these two things very carefully.  We also need to balance our wish to fully protect the rights of employees with the overriding aim of generating more jobs, and of making an impact on unemployment.  We should be trying to ensure that legislation does not discourage employers from taking on more people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> In the 19th century, employers were totally against legislation which gave employees any rights whatsoever.  Those days are gone, thank God, but we have to face the fact that employers are more careful now about taking on people than they were even 20 years ago as a result of the raft of employment legislation we now have in place.  That is one of the reasons employers are more attracted to adding value through technology than to adding to staff numbers.</P>
    <P>I intended, before I started my contribution, to ask if I could share my time with Senator Norris.  We have 20 minutes and I do not intend to use any more than ten or 15 minutes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean we should repeal employment legislation but when we are considering additions to it we should ask ourselves carefully whether they are necessary.  We should resist adding clauses to be on the safe side and ask instead whether additional legislation will increase the already heavy burden of compliance on employers.  Legislation of this kind does not come without a price. We have to make sure we can afford the price.</P>
      <P>This matter is important in the light of British policy on social legislation.  There is little doubt that the &ldquo;social dumping&rdquo; that many feared might happen in Europe is now taking place.  I deplore the decision of the United Kingdom to opt out of the social chapter of the Maastricht agreement.  I foresee many troubles for Europe in the years ahead as a result.</P>
      <P>This attitude in Britain makes it all the more necessary for us to exercise great care in enacting social legislation.  While rightly choosing to row in with Europe in this matter we must make sure that we are not put at too great a disadvantage by British action in the matter.  We need to consider each point in the Bill in this light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to consider the special difficulties which face small businesses especially those which employ fewer than <Col N="1191" /> ten people.  Every small business is a potential force for job creation. Developed economies across the globe have found it easier to create jobs in small businesses than in large ones, particularly in the service industries that are so important to our future.</P>
    <P>Our over-riding aim should be to remove obstacles that prevent small businesses from taking on people, and obstacles which discourage people from setting up in business in the first place.</P>
    <P>The complexity of Irish employment legislation and procedures is a problem for employers.  Some 24 Acts of the Oireachtas, five EC directives and 18 statutory instruments make up the body of Irish employment law.  I may be understating the situation &mdash; that is all the legislation I have been able to find.  In large companies such as my own personnel departments look after company obligations under employment law. Medium-sized companies can afford the services of an organisation like IBEC to guide them through the maze unlike those in the small business sector which offer such opportunities for job creation.</P>
    <P>I started in business over 30 years ago employing eight; I now employ over 3,000 people.  If I was starting with eight people now I might well be overwhelmed by the morass of obligations imposed by employment legislation.</P>
    <P>I have three suggestions to put to the Minister.  She should look at the corpus of employment legislation to see if a slimmed down version could be created for very small businesses, a version which would fully protect the employees but which would be related to the real world in which small businesses operate. Secondly, she should consider publishing a simple guide which would outline in simple language all the obligations and procedures that small businesses need to know.  These obligations and procedures look more daunting and more complex than they are.  Micro-businesses should not have to employ a lawyer to find out where they stand.  Now that enterprise and employment have been brought together in one Department this kind of <Col N="1192" /> activity is appropriate as never before.  I was delighted to hear the Minister for Enterprise and Employment say that the order refers to enterprise followed by employment.  If we are going to encourage enterprise we have to make it attractive for people to start businesses. Employment will flow from that.</P>
    <P>I suggest also that it is now time to bring all employment legislation together in one consolidated employment Act.  I am not suggesting an overhaul of the legislation but its consolidation.  There is an accelerated procedure for bringing consolidated Bills through the Oireachtas so it would not be a major task or one which would impede other legislation.  If ever a consolidation of legislation was necessary it is in this critical area.  I believe enterprise and employment are intrinsically linked and that fact should be reflected in everything we do, including the passage of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  As always, she is a breath of fresh air.  I welcome this Bill which is extremely important and follows on from a number of debates we have had in this House.  I will concentrate on one aspect of this Bill which I regard as historic, that is the inclusion of sexual orientation in its provisions.  I remember the interesting battle we had some years ago to persuade the then Government to include sexual orientation for the first time in the Incitement to Hatred Bill.  I am very glad that the Minister's predecessor.  Deputy Burke saw fit to introduce a sexual orientation clause into Irish legislation on incitement to hatred making it one of the most progressive and far-reaching of such instruments in Europe.  I remember Deputy Burke was heaped with praise by the Irish media and also received congratulations in international fora because it came as a surprise that this country should be advanced and compassionate in its thinking in this area.  It is a position which seems to contradict some provisions of criminal law, although I understand that is about to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the fact that I have on occasion <Col N="1193" /> rebuked the Government for their laxity on rights of sexual orientation, a humane and compassionate policy on the subject has been pursued by a Fianna Fáil Government over a number of years.  A most important instrument, circular 12/88, outlining civil service policy on AIDS was issued by the Department of Finance on 22 June 1988.  This is a model of anti-discrimination protection in the workplace and is one of the most advanced in the world.  I have my copy with me.  It is worth putting on the record as a tribute to the work that Fianna Fáil have done in Government.  This is a binding Protocol throughout the Civil Service:</P>
    <P>Officers who are HIV positive or who suffer from AIDS will be retained in their job for as long as they can perform their duties to an acceptable standard.</P>
    <P>2.  The normal sick leave regulations as set out in Circular 25/78 will apply to staff who suffer from AIDS.</P>
    <P>3.  All details of an officer's health record should continue to be treated in the strictest confidence</P>
    <P>4.  Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or medical condition (e.g. haemophilia) will not be tolerated in the civil service.</P>
    <P>5.  General&mdash;Nothing in this policy statement is to be interpreted as constituting a waiver of management's responsibility to maintain discipline or its right to take disciplinary measures under normal disciplinary procedures.</P>
    <P>That seems to be a perfectly balanced, fair and decent approach and is close to the kind of thinking in the Minister's proposed legislation where sexual orientation is added in the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  Section 6 of the 1977 Act reads:</P>
    <P>Subject to the provisions of this section, the dismissal of an employee shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, to be an unfair dismissal unless, having all regard to all circumstances, there were substantial grounds justifying the dismissal.  (2) <Col N="1194" /> Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section the dismissal of an employee shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, to be an unfair dismissal if it results wholly or mainly for one or more of the following:</P>
    <P>Paragraph (e) now includes sexual orientation.</P>
    <P>In 1977 I approached the Minister then responsible, the former Deputy Michael O'Leary.  He indicated he would be sensitive in his response to this matter but he required me to produce evidence of discrimination.  I found it difficult to do so for a number of reasons.  One is that people at the receiving end of such discrimination normally do not want to make any further fuss about it all.  They want to creep into a hole and die of shame if they are subjected to what is a form of sexual harassment, of sexual orientation being disclosed, or if they are dismissed. Often the last thing they want to do is disclose this to a further party or to be used in a survey or systematic analysis.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a number of cases in which people were dismissed because of their sexual orientation, in at least two tragic cases because the employer fortuitously or accidentally came into possession of the fact that the people involved had tested positive for HIV. On those occasions the employers were extremely careful to ensure nothing appeared in writing to acknowledge this as the reason for the dismissal.  In almost all of the cases, despite some approaches made to the employers, there was no question whatever of reinstatement. Thus, this provision is necessary.</P>
    <P>There is a large number of gay people in this country and their consistent fear is that they will be discriminated against in employment.  This fear emerges, for example, in surveys carried out by the Gay Health Action Group in August 1989.  They reported that 31 per cent of those surveyed said that most or all of their colleagues knew they were gay. This, of course, has to be set against a further 58 per cent, a significant majority, <Col N="1195" /> who thought they would be discriminated against if any of their colleagues knew they were gay.  Even more disturbing, 11 per cent &mdash; 28 people &mdash; reported they actually had been the victims of discrimination at work because they were known to be gay.  This is a small sample. The Labour Court has found in Determination 2 of 1987 that statistical evidence of this kind is sufficient to prove cases of discrimination.  My argument is that although sampling is difficult and the sample taken was small, there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that discrimination exists.</P>
    <P>Gay Switchboard in Dublin has operated since 1974 and has taken over 50,000 calls from all over Ireland.  In its annual report it stated:</P>
    <P>Over the years, a constant theme expressed by a large proportion of their callers was that their colleagues, or more significantly their employers, would find out that they were gay or bisexual.  They fear that should this be discovered, they would be discriminated against purely on the basis of their sexual orientation.  This fear is a terribly real and powerful one... All too often we are made aware of instances where this discrimination actually results, or has resulted, in dismissal.</P>
    <P>This is a very substantial fear, which is having an impact on the psychological well-being of a substantial minority of people in this country.  This is not just a fear; it is something that does, regrettably, result sometimes in highly discriminatory action, including dismissal, in circumstances where it is clear the only reason for dismissal is the sexual orientation of the parties involved.</P>
    <P>In support of what the Minister has done, I will put on the record of the House a register of those many groups and influential bodies who supported our call for such an amendment to this legislation. There is, for example, the Department of Health with the National AIDS Strategy Committee Report.  It is understood this committee has recommended <Col N="1196" /> that the current Civil Service policy initiated by then Minister, former Deputy MacSharry &mdash; which I read on to the record of the House &mdash; should be extended to all public and private employees.  In other words, what the Government has already wisely and compassionately instituted through the Civil Service should be made mandatory, not just in the Civil Service but also for all public companies.</P>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs announced in December 1989 that Ireland should ratify the United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights, which obliges parties to ensure that all individuals in their jurisdiction enjoy certain rights which includes the right to life, liberty, security of the person, freedom of movement and so on.  These rights which are subsequently enumerated include naturally the right to work and an adequate standard of living.  These are basic rights.  When I was campaigning at the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s in support of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association, those were precisely the areas in which the Catholic minority felt particularly aggrieved &mdash; employment and housing &mdash; and so it is for this minority in this country.</P>
    <P>There is much more that could be placed on the record from bodies such as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, the Employment Equality Agency and so on.  I leave the Minister with this final thought.  She has done a very good job.  This is an excellent and enlightened approach and I welcome it because it affects people where it really matters.  I encourage the Government to follow this excellent legislation with another, for which the Minister may not be directly responsible.  There should be full anti-discrimination legislation; then Ireland can proudly take a rightful place among the most progressive nations of Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a representative of those who employ and have succeeded in keeping a few people employed for over <Col N="1197" /> 35 years, I take some comfort from what Senator Quinn said about the differences that exist between big companies and small companies.  Small companies in Ireland are being overwhelmed with legislation which protects, or is supposed to protect, employees.  I have not seen any legislation to protect employers.</P>
      <P>I am not too sure where the impetus for this Bill came from and I am not criticising it.  If it is necessary it has to be introduced.  The media attention in regard to this Bill has been on the fact that it introduces sexual orientation as one of the reasons somebody cannot be dismissed.  There has been no media coverage of any other aspect of this Bill. There was a need to bring in a section regarding sexual orientation in the Bill and there are other items which had to be added.</P>
      <P>The Bill seems to be geared to semi-State and State companies.  Section 3 amends the principal Act and talks about temporary contracts which are extended on a short term basis.  It is suggested that these contracts might be used and extended to get over the technical aspects of unfair aspects of unfair dismissal legislation. People working in RTE and other semi-State companies have spoken of it becoming the norm to have short term employment contracts.  Perhaps the reason for this is that if you have a short term contract you do not have to give statutory redundancy or get involved in various aspects of company law.</P>
      <P>All legislation coming into this House costs money and there is no doubt this legislation will do so.  Every employer is going to have to look again at the costs of employing someone.  They will ask themselves if this legislation will cost them money.  At present, the lawyers will have another field day.  They will analyse this Bill to see how best they can get involved.  Every employer, big or small, has to employ a lawyer if an unfair dismissal case is brought against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noticed in the newspapers &mdash; and I have not looked at any statistics other than those in the Minister's speech &mdash; that about 260 successful unfair dismissals cases are brought each year and <Col N="1198" /> a number of others are thrown out.  A total of 7,751 cases have been brought since 1977 and of these 1,734 were allowed and 2,414 were dismissed.  I have never had an unfair dismissals case brought against me nor do I know of a small employer in Kilkenny, or in the southeast, who has had an unfair dismissals case taken against them.  The majority of cases are taken against semi-State companies and bigger companies generally.  There are about 1,000 such cases per year; about 260 will succeed the rest will be thrown out.</P>
    <P>It is very costly for an employer if a case is taken against him or her in terms of public attitude, employee attitude and trade union attitude.  Often despite a case against an employer having been dismissed I have heard people complain that the employer does not pay staff enough or treat them fairly.</P>
    <P>The point made by Senator Quinn is important; we have to take into account the difference between large and small employers.  We have to give employees the right to work in reasonable conditions but, equally, we must give potential employers the right to employ people on the basis of trust in their businesses. When people are employed on the basis of trust employers and employees will be more secure in their attitudes towards each other and workers will be more secure in their jobs.  There has to be discipline on both sides in any labour relations situation.  The day someone can go to an unfair dismissals tribunal because of a row with a boss &mdash; the day there cannot be a flare-up in the workplace &mdash; is the day employers will stop employing.</P>
    <P>In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, through my experience in business, I saw that people wanted to become employers not employees.  In the motor business and the service industry workers took their tools and set up in business.  Many were very successful.  In those days it was the good employee &mdash; the one who really wanted to get on &mdash; who set up alone.  Nowadays people are not doing that because they realise the minute they enter the workplace as employers, they will be hammered <Col N="1199" /> by legislation and the tax people. Employment legislation goes against the efforts of someone trying to set up in business; there is no incentive for would-be employers.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (a) of the Bill will allow a rights commissioner to award compensation of up to four weeks pay for unfair dismissal in cases where no financial loss has been incurred by the employee.  I cannot see the rationale behind that.  If no financial loss has been incurred and the employee has been reinstated perhaps she or he should be compensated to the extent of four weeks pay?  If someone takes a wrongful claim there is no compensation for the employer.  This may seem a minor thing, but it is not so for a small employer trying to deal with employees when everyone seems to be against the small business person.</P>
    <P>There is an anti-small business attitude in banks and in the social welfare system. People are not setting up small businesses in Ireland anymore and perhaps the composite body of employment legislation is the reason indigenous businesses are no longer emerging.  I appeal for some rights for small business people and I appeal to the Minister to look at the legislation to establish what is a small business.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn said that IBEC deals with small businesses, but it does not deal with any business employing fewer than 20 people.  IBEC is a large business organisation like the CII and the CIF while the small business association is orientated towards businesses which employ ten to 50 people.  Business in Ireland is not about people who employ 50 and upwards; businesses employing between one and ten employees is usual. When we eliminate these small businesses we will be bemoaning losses of 4,000, 6,000 or 100,000 jobs.  The small business person works hard because all assets are usually tied up in the business. Small business persons' houses are probably mortgaged for their business.  They do not go out of business with large amounts of money stored away or because they have defrauded the tax <Col N="1200" /> people.  When they fail in business nobody seems to worry but, unfortunately, they are not being replaced.</P>
    <P>This legislation is important and welcome. But I ask the Minister if her Department could set up some sort of enterprise board to see how small businesses can best be protected when legislation such as is being introduced. Perhaps, small businesses below a certain turnover &mdash; it could be on turnover or numbers employed &mdash; should have a built-in advantage in PAYE and PRSI to allow them to employ someone to advise them in conflicts arising under labour or other legislation.</P>
    <P>Legislation of this type was urgently needed in 1977 and the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 has worked.  This amendment Bill is probably necessary.  However, we are not living in the 18th or 19th century; people who go into employment now realise that employment is not necesarily permanent.  People do not want or expect to work in the same job for the rest of their lives.  We have a mobile workforce; young people want to move upwards. They also want fairness in the workplace but that cannot be achieved by legislation. That comes when people trust each other and 90 per cent of employers in this country trust their employees.  The small number of cases which have come before the Employment Appeals Tribunal since 1977 show that there is no great need for unfair dismissals legislation.</P>
    <P>Our aim should not only be to protect the jobs we have, but to create additional employment.  We need an employment and enterprise orientated society.  Every obstacle placed in the way of enterprise development is regrettable.  I am not suggesting that this legislation is an obstacle, but I speak as a small employer who has never had an unfair dismissals case taken against him.  There is a need for discipline but this should not be incorporated in legislation because this country is overwhelmed with legalities which are not relevant to normal day-to-day work.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Rights Commissioners on their work over the years. <Col N="1201" /> They have provided direct access to essential services and have redressed wrongs which have come before them.</P>
    <P>A considerable number of unfair dismissals cases are taken against larger companies which have professional management expertise.  These so-called professionals who recruit employees are not as good at their work as the small employer who meets an employee on a one-to-one basis to discuss the details of the job.</P>
    <P>I am being a little critical of the Bill but my criticism is intended to distinguish between the needs of larger and smaller companies.  Ireland has a macro and a micro economy.  However, I prefer to talk about small family businesses or businesses owned by one person who employs two people, in contrast to IBEC, CII or CIF who refer to businesses which employ 40 to 200 people as small businesses.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill which deals with sexual orientation.  This was needed for larger businesses rather than for smaller ones.  The main thrust of the Bill is to provide better technical and administrative services and improved protection for workers.  I ask for the same type of protection for business people so that employees may be safe in the knowledge that they work for reasonable people.  In Ireland, people seem to think that employers are crooks.  The attitude that employers are not to be trusted is fuelled by the media who portray employers as crooks.  Employers are generally not like that.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House together with the opportunity to debate this Bill which is amending the 1977 legislation.  Any legislation brought before either House in the present climate must be looked at in terms of how it affects employment and whether it will facilitate the development of entrepreneurial skills and the setting up of businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan is a small businessman who employs a small number of people and both he and Senator Quinn have talked about the situation from the <Col N="1202" /> employer's point of view.  I agree with both of them.  There is a public perception that it is almost impossible to dismiss an employee.  That perception is regrettable.  The Minister of State in her speech outlined surveys which were undertaken after the 1977 Bill was passed to see how businesses were affected by it.  I was pleased to hear her say that the Bill has not reduced the number of people taken on by employers but has probably led to a tightening of the procedures and of arrangements made between employers and employees which has worked to the benefit of both.</P>
    <P>The most important consideration in this country at the moment is employment. We must maintain jobs and encourage people to set up businesses.  I would not like employers to think that it is not worth their while to employ people because of difficulties that may arise. Small employers who face an unfair dismissals claim do not have the facilities or the back-up support which larger companies enjoy.  However, even in the event that a claim against an employer is unsuccessful, considerable worry is caused to the employer who may wonder then if it is worth continuing to employ.</P>
    <P>The Sunday before I was elected to this House I was at Mass in Shannon where Fr. Harry Bohan &mdash; who I am sure is known to most people &mdash; gave a sermon on employment.  He mentioned the fact that everybody blames the Government for not creating more jobs but he said we all need to look at how we can help. He said that anyone with influence in a political party should tell them that State bureaucracy was unhelpful to small enterprises and to people, for example, setting up businesses in West Clare.  He said that every possible assistance was given to the large industrial developments in Shannon, but that this was not the case for small business people trying to set up enterprises throughout the country.  I agree with him and feel that obstacles should not be put in the way of people trying to create employment by establishing small industries.  He also said that people should not begrudge the success <Col N="1203" /> of those who have established small businesses.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 3 which allows for the extension of the legislation to temporary employees of health boards.  This is welcome because many nurses, the majority of whom are women, have for a long time been employed on a temporary basis and were unable to avail of the benefits of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I also welcome section 5 which extends the scope of the Bill to include race, colour and sexual orientation as reasons for unfair dismissal.  I agree with what Senator Norris said in relation to sexual orientation.  As a member of the Commission on the Status of Women we received submissions from lesbian groups.  In one oral submission they spoke, as Senator Norris said, of the fear of their sexual orientation being discovered in the workplace and losing their job.  One of the commission's recommendations, which is included in this Bill, was the inclusion of sexual orientation in the list of reasons for unfair dismissal in the amended employment equality legislation. I welcome this because the fear of being dismissed causes huge problems. Being mentioned in the report as lesbians was all the groups were asking for and was a huge step forward.  That indicates how fearful such people are in their work-places and in their everyday lives.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of Women recommended an equal rights amendment to the Constitution and the enactment of an equal status Act.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, promised he will look at this area.  The Commission recommended that the proposed equal status legislation should make it unlawful to discriminate against any individual on the grounds of sex, marital or parental status. I would like to look briefly at this issue because it is one that affects women.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a teacher in Wexford was dismissed when she was pregnant.  I know it was perceived by many people that she was not dismissed because of that fact; however, it is only women who <Col N="1204" /> will find themselves in that situation, it is only women who can become pregnant. Employments such as teaching and nursing tend to be dominated by women.  The marital or parental status of a women should not be a basis for dismissal.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the inclusion of sexual orientation in the Bill I would like marital and parental status to be included also.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform may act to implement this proposal but I would like to see it inserted in this Bill so that dismissals on such grounds will automatically be unlawful.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 3 which enables the Employment Appeals Tribunal to examine fixed contracts to see if their purpose is the avoidance of liability under the Act.  Such contracts affect many women.  People who are organised and involved in unions do not find themselves going before the Employment Appeals Tribunal as often as people in vulnerable areas of employment; the latter tend mainly to be women because women are concentrated in areas of employment that are less well paid and have the least favourable conditions.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (d) (ii) provides that an employer shall not be allowed to shelter behind an illegal contract to avoid having an unfair dismissal claim brought by a dismissed employee.  I agree with that provision.  However, the Bill as drafted contains no provisions to deal with collusion between employer and employee. The Employment Appeals Tribunal should retain the discretion to dismiss the claim when collusion exists and thus refuse to enforce the tainted contract.  At the same time, they should be able to inform the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Scoial Welfare, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 13 proposes that people employed by an agency and working for a third party would not be regarded as employees of the agency but as employees of the third party.  This could work against many women who are employed by agencies and work as temporary employees of organisations availing of the services of the agency.  They could work for the agency for long periods <Col N="1205" /> but not necessarily remain with particular individuals for more than a year; thus, they would not benefit from this legislation as their terms of employment with third persons availing of the agency's services cannot be aggregated.  Many women work for agencies and I would not like to see them being deprived of the protection provided by this legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation and I welcome the Minister to the House.  I listened very carefully to her remarks when she first brought this Bill before us and I agree with most of what she said.  We must maintain the balance of protecting workers, particularly women, in jobs with low pay and bad conditions, and maintaining employment and encouraging people to employ others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Like most other Members I, too, welcome this legislation which arises from the shortcomings of the 1977 legislation and the necessity to amend it in the light of its operation since 1977.  I agree with Senator Quinn that efforts should be made to consolidate legislation which has been amended.  It is not always easy to consolidate complex legislation and it is very easy in doing so to lose sight of the major issues that need to be tackled.  There has been much dissatisfaction with the operation of the Unfair Dismissals Act and any additional legislation which will eliminate such shortcomings is useful, welcome and timely.</P>
      <P>While I agree with much of what Senator Quinn and Senator Lanigan said about the difficulties encountered by employers, we must not lose sight of the position of employees.  I will briefly highlight three cases that have come to my attention in recent times, where there appears on the part of employers, to have been blatant abuse of their positions and most unfair treatment of their employees.  It is important that we take measures to avoid such occurrences in future.  I will give three examples, one occurred in a small privately-run company; one in a semi-State organisation and one directly involved the former Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> A matron in a small privately-owned hospice was dismissed for no apparent reason.  She was unceremoniously locked out of her office.  She appealed to a rights commissioner who, after long deliberation and hearing both sides, came out firmly and said she was unfairly dismissed and was entitled to compensation.  She was awarded £30,000.  The company did not deny they unfairly dismissed the woman but they did not pay the compensation. She sought legal advice as to how to deal with this.  She was told that if she had brought the claim through the Employment Appeals Tribunal its decision would have been legally binding on the company, but the decision of a rights commissioner was not so.  As a certain length of time had elapsed she could not go through.  Furthermore it was doubtful if the findings of the tribunal could not be made legally binding.  Therefore she has no recourse except to the High Court.  This may take four to five years and she may be told that if she wins her case the company will be liquidated and the business closed down.</P>
    <P>I cite these examples as reason to ensure this legislation affords protection in cases like these.  If there are discrepancies between the operation of a rights commissioner and the tribunal, and whatever the next stage might be, then once a case commences and until it is successfully concluded, the protection of law should be available to avoid situations where people have to undertake costly High Court proceedings which may result in the full award that has been made to the person not being implemented.  The legislation should provide for this situation.  I support Senator Quinn's suggestion that a guide be made available.  In the case I have just outlined, had the person known that the decision of the rights commissioner was not legally binding she could have taken the case to the tribunal in the first instance.</P>
    <P>My second case concerns a skilled employee of a semi-State body, who, because of an injury sustained at work was dismissed from his job while in hospital.  He was advised to take his case to the High Court.  He had a personal <Col N="1207" /> injury claim for injuries received at work which necessitated a stay in hospital.  He took his case to the High Court and was given an award so that the case was duly resolved after about eight years.  It resolved the personal injury aspect of the case but not the unfair dismissal aspect. The employee now has to take up the unfair dismissal procedure at the point at which he left it to undertake High Court proceedings eight to ten years ago.  In these situations we must be satisfied that time limits do not debar the bringing of cases through recognised channels such as the Labour Court.  Similarly the processing of personal injury claims through the High Court should not debar simultaneous claims being taken for unfair dismissals through other recognised channels such as the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>Where people are dismissed from semi-State bodies while unable to work due to injuries received at work and where their claim is eventually settled because the company admits liability, the company should not be permitted to dismiss them.  That practice is not fair or reasonable and legislation should prevent it.</P>
    <P>My third case is interesting because it concerns a resignation under duress brought about by the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, now the leader of the Progressive Democrats.  In the High Court Justice Carroll stated that the performance of the assistant secretary to the Department, who was unceremoniously dismissed from his position by the Minister had been outstanding.  The official had given years of dedicated service and had risen to the rank of Assistant Secretary in the Department.  After his resignation was forced by the Minister he had to proceed through the High Court.</P>

      <P>The justice said it was a sad state of affairs that a person who had given honest faithful service was treated in this fashion by the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, at the time.  What redress is there through the unfair dismissals legislation for a person in that disgraceful situation?  Ministers acting in that fashion should not be exempt from the terms and conditions of the kind of legislation we are debating here.</P>
      <P>I agree and sympathise with Senators Lanigan and Quinn in their views on the creation of unnecessary obstacles for job creation and employment.  We are all committed to the creation of employment but employees cannot be blackguarded. We have an obligation to ensure that does not happen and therefore I welcome this legislation.  I ask the Minister whether under this amendment to the 1977 legislation the three cases I have mentioned will be included.  For example, are people covered if for lack of knowledge of the legislation they fail to lodge a claim within a certain time period?  Will they be denied their entitlements because there are other actions pending in courts, or because Ministers act disgracefully?  Parties should be liable for their actions through this legislation. Similarly, people like those who suffered in the cases I have described should be adequately covered and protected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As Fine Gael spokesperson on Labour affairs I am pleased to speak on the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill, 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill addresses a number of important issues relating to the Unfair Dismissals Act of 1977 and introduces a number of technical and administrative amendments.  Dismissal, especially when unfair, is most distressful and I speak with some experience in the matter.  Senators Daly and Roche may share my feelings. Dismissal affects not only the person involved but also his or her family.  It affects everybody differently.  I understand that one of the most common symptoms <Col N="1209" /> is a sense of rejection.  This is all the more traumatic for a person who has been in gainful employment for a long time.</P>
    <P>Apart from the obvious impact on living standards due to loss of wages and salary, dismissal often results in temporary or long term unemployment. Prior to the enactment of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, employees who were not members of trade unions had little protection under the law.  In the 1960s and 1970s I was the sole employee of my employer and this class of employee is the most vulnerable.  While I never feared unfair dismissal, I nevertheless realised that I had little protection against wrongful dismissal.  I took some consolation from a case during that period and it reminds me of a case that Senator Daly mentioned a moment ago.  The director of a well known institution in Dublin who felt that he was wrongly dismissed brought his case to the Labour Court where he was successful on the grounds that the Labour Court was a patron of the worker.  That was before 1977 when the 1977 Unfair Dismissals Act brought about a significant change in the situation. Employees in non-union employment or poorly organised unions found after 1977 they had some protection against unfair dismissal.  Even those who are critical of the Act agree that employees need legal safeguards against the actions of the minority &mdash; and I stress minority &mdash; of employers who resort to instant and unjustifiable dismissals.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from the discussion document that the 1977 Act has succeeded in reducing the number of disputes arising from unfair dismissal.  My only criticism of the Act is that procedures under the Act were established to ensure informal hearings for workers but these have become legalistic.  The statutory function of a tribunal under the Act is to adjudicate disputes rather than resolve them through conciliation or mediation.  Disputes must be decided through procedures that are fair to both sides but legalism should be kept to a minimum.  I think this point was also mentioned by Senator Quinn.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1210" /> The discussion document refers to a pre-hearing assessment.  These assessments can be called at the instigation of either party or of the tribunal where the case of either party appears to be negligible, frivolous, vexations or unlikely to succeed.  A warning could be issued that if the case were pressed to an unsuccessful hearing costs might be awarded against the party concerned. The discussion document notes that such a system would not be without risk.  Preliminary assessments might take such time as to render them worthless for the purpose of expediting the conduct of the tribunal.  More importantly, the discussion document states that great care would have to be taken not to deprive any worker of a right to have a case fully examined.  The advantages and disadvantages of a system of pre-hearing assessment would have to be carefully balanced but there is some merit in examining it.</P>
    <P>The discussion document refers to the appeal procedures also and argues that legal changes may be necessary in the appeal procedures under the legislation. At present, either party to a dispute may appeal a determination by the tribunal to the circuit Court.  It was originally envisaged that appeals to the court would be relatively infrequent.  However, a significant number of determinations have been appealed to the court in recent years.  As the discussion document states, the purpose of establishing an informal tribunal with industrial relations expertise has, to some extent, been undermined. This is an unfortunate aspect of the manner in which procedures have been adopted under the Act.</P>
    <P>When the Act was initiated a legalistic framework was not intended but has since developed and must be guarded against.</P>
    <P>The ICTU, FUE and the Employment Appeals Tribunal have expressed dissatisfaction with the role of the Circuit Court.  Once it is decided to appeal, the Circuit Court can order a complete rehearing where both parties can call further evidence if they wish and all the issues are opened again.  A further anomaly <Col N="1211" /> requiring reform is the provision for an appeal of a Circuit Court decision to the High Court appeal also takes the form of a complete rehearing of all the issues both parties are free to call new evidence.</P>
    <P>The tribunal is not a court of law and can relax the rules of evidence but when appeals go to the Circuit Court stricter rules of evidence apply.  It is quite anomalous to provide for the rehearing of a case from a tribunal which operates one set of rules in a court which operates under another set.  It is necessary that one has a right of appeal but it should be to a body constituted in a similar manner to the tribunal and which will apply the same rules of evidence and standards.  I intend to table an amendment on Committee Stage for the setting up of such an appeals tribunal.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 5 which extends the scope of section 6 (2) of the Principal Act to include sexual orientation in the list of reasons for dismissal which are automatically deemed unfair for the purpose of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 6 amends section 7 of the Principal Act by allowing a rights commissioner, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Circuit Court to award compensation of up to four weeks for unfair dismissal in a case where no financial loss was incurred by the employee. I favour the tribunal having the power to make this basic award where reinstatement is inappropriate.  I think Senator Lanigan misunderstood that section of the Act which deals with a person who is not reinstated but who suffers no financial loss.  This award would compensate the employee for the unfairness of the dismissal.  The biggest loss an unfairly dismissed employee suffers is due to the injustice of the dismissal and four weeks salary would sometimes be insufficient to compensate for that.  I am pleased to note under the same section that payments to employees under the social welfare and income tax codes can be disregarded.  The Minister has taken the fairest approach to that problem by eliminating them altogether.</P>
    <P>Where an employer fails to implement <Col N="1212" /> an order made by the Circuit Court on appeal or a determination of the tribunal section II allows the employee concerned or the Minister on his or her behalf to apply to the Circuit Court for an order directing the employer to implement the determination.  The Circuit Court is empowered to make an order against the employer which would include the interest on any financial compensation award.  The charge on the interest should be levied at the penal rate imposed by the Revenue Commissioners on tax withheld.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in her speech:</P>
    <P>The emphasis in the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 is the protection of employees from being unfairly dismissed from their employment by setting down criteria by which dismissals are to be judged unfair and by providing an adjudication system and redress for an employee whose dismissal has been found to be unjustified.</P>
    <P>The Minister said she believed the objectives remain as valid today as they were in 1977 and I concur with that view.  After 15 years in operation, this Act has worked well but it is right that it should now be reviewed and that there should be a White Paper discussion document. The amending Bill should be reviewed and a number of amendments to it will be proposed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation which may move towards the implementation of an undertaking given in the Programme for a Partnership Government to review labour legislation to ensure that full protection is afforded against all forms of discrimination, especially against minority or disadvantaged groups.  The programme lists, as Senators know, a series of possible discriminations against which the parties which formed the Government have set their face. These include discrimination based on religion, age, handicap, race, colour, sexual orientation, national or ethnic origin.  The latter is intended to cover discrimination against any self defined class or subgroup, including people with <Col N="1213" /> their own specific identity such as members of the travelling community. All civilised persons must welcome this commitment and also welcome the first step towards the implementation of the commitment contained in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The primary legislation in this area, the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 has served us well.  Prior to the enactment of that legislation few protections were available to the worker faced by unfair, unjust, arbitrary or wrongful dismissal.  The only protection a worker had was that afforded by a trade union and the threat of strike action.</P>
      <P>The Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 provided the worker with legal protection so that dismissal could only take place where substantial grounds justified the dismissal and when the action taken by the employer was procedurally correct. The Act put in place a system for the investigation of claims of unfair dismissal, for certain categories of workers, by rights commissioners and for others by the Employment Appeals Tribunal. These measures were both positive and progressive.  Where an individual was found to have been unfairly dismissed, the Act provided for redress by reinstatement, re-engagement or compensation for financial loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has become fashionable in some quarters to question the unfair dismissals legislation and to suggest that this legislation has, in some way, placed excessive restrictions on employers.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, pointed out that the Act is often used as an excuse by employers to account for their failure to create jobs.  The argument is made that because we have made it difficult to dismiss, we have made it difficult also to hire.  Some elements of that argument have been outlined in contributions today and previously.  This argument suggests an arbitrary dismissal should be the prerogative of one party to the employment contract, the more powerful party, and that society should accept such arbitrary behaviour as the price of job creation. Like the Minister of State, I reject this argument totally and if both sides of the House considered it they would reject it, <Col N="1214" /> too.  The argument is morally unacceptable in a civilised society.  Intellectually, this argument is equally bankrupt.  The disharmony following an unfair dismissal or even the fear of arbitrary unfair dismissal may contribute towards an industrial relations climate not conducive to progress.</P>
    <P>The study conducted by the Department of Industrial Relations at UCD on the impact of the 1977 legislation highlights the value of our unfair dismissals legislation and underlines the positive contribution it has made towards industrial relations.  I would argue that the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 contributed to the industrial peace and harmony which Ireland enjoyed in the 1970s and 1980s and has entitled us to de-escalate a climate of warfare which marred industrial relations previously and which did more economic damage than the positive impact of the 1977 Act could undo.  The UCD study debunked the myth that it has become impossible for an employer to discipline or dismiss a worker whose performance is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Since 1977 a comprehensive and well-tried code of practice relating to control, discipline and, ultimately, to dismissal has been devised and is now well understood by employers and unions.  Instead of the chaos which reigned under the pre-1977 arrangements, this Act substituted a degree of certainty in the workplace.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the argument put forward here, that the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 is, in some way, negative.  On the contrary it has been beneficial to those in employment and has fostered harmonious industrial relations which have led to industrial progress.  Any costs associated with this Act are infinitesimal when compared with the savings of time lost during down time, strikers and so on which the Act has helped to obviate.</P>
    <P>I am, however, less certain that the law and its associated entitlements and obligations are properly understood by workers.  A number of Senators have already mentioned this.  Small firms and companies which are not unionised must be educated on this subject.  In some cases which I hope are a small minority &mdash;<Col N="1215" /> workers do not understand their positive legal position and their ignorance is often shared by their employers.  In my own constituency, constituents have come to clinics to present cases which clearly infringe the law, indicating that both employers and employees are ignorant of the law.  Perhaps the Minister of State, the trade unions and employers' organisations could get together to prepare and distribute a simple guide outlining the rights and responsibilities of both sides in the employment contract.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions continued in section 2 that an award entitles an employee to benefit from any improvement in terms of conditions of employment which may occur between the date of dismissal and the date of reinstatement. We must ensure that a worker returning to the workplace after an unfair dismissal does not become stigmatised, suffer trauma or lose a position or seniority in the firm.</P>
    <P>The fixed term provisions contained in section 3 are welcome.  Contract employment is becoming a fact of life and by dealing with contracts, by fixed term provisions, progress is being made.</P>
    <P>Section 5 extends the scope of the Principal Act to include sexual orientation and that has been welcomed by other speakers.  I wonder whether section 5 covers all forms of discrimination mentioned in the Programme for a Partnership Government?  Perhaps the Minister will respond.</P>
    <P>The provisions contained in section 6 are also welcome.  This amendment will allow the rights commissioner to award compensation of up to four weeks in cases where no financial loss has been incurred by the employee.  Some speakers have suggested that four weeks may be too lenient, others that may be too much.</P>
    <P>Considerable trauma is experienced by those who are dismissed.  Senator Doyle suggested a number of Senators have experienced that trauma recently.</P>

      <P>It helps to concentrate the mind that our tenure is more tenuous than that of most other employees.  We are servants of the people, but we do not have contracts.</P>
      <P>It is important that financial compensation be provided for the trauma of unfair dismissal and I believe that is the point of section 6.  It would be a salutary experience for employers to have to pay compensation even when a worker is reinstated.  Senator Doyle suggested we might keep the impact of this and other changes under review and this is a good idea.</P>
      <P>Section 7 provides that an explanation of the decision of a tribunal or court be given and that is a welcome change.  The reasons for decisions of courts or tribunals often mystify us and it is helpful that they be made public in order that we may understand the operation of the legislation.  Section 8 expands the time limits for notice of appeal and that is also welcome.  The Minister explained that section well.  I welcome section 13 which extends the scope of the Unfair Dismissals legislation to include persons employed through employment agencies.</P>
      <P>As Senator Daly said, we must address the issue of unfair dismissals in the public service.  The general belief has been that civil servants can only be dismissed by Government.  In the case of Ted O'Reilly, the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce bully tactics and unacceptable behaviour by Government were clearly indicated.  I know Ted O'Reilly well.  He was a colleague in the Civil Service and lives in my constituency.  He is well respected in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary and unacceptable in a civilised society that a civil servant of that seniority in position and age should have to go to the courts to seek redress for behaviour which was odious in the extreme.  The Minister did not even have the courage to do the brow beating in <Col N="1217" /> person but delegated other civil servants to do it.  That civil servant had a distinguished career in his Department.  He served the Department and the nation well.  His treatment illustrates that there is a lacuna in the law and civil servants, faced with such behaviour have no protection.</P>
    <P>The civil servant in that case, and in other cases, could perhaps dig in their heels and endure the indignity of a dismissal by Government.  We would probably have had a crisis in the last Government if that had happened because I do not doubt that a bully will always be a bully.  The treatment of that civil servant was odious and illustrates a lacuna in the law that we, as lawmakers, should speedily address.  If there is no protection in law other than court action available to senior civil servants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am making the point that the case, which has concluded in the courts, illustrates a lacuna which still exists in the law.  Senator Daly referred to the unfair treatment accorded to the former assistant secretary and it is not unreasonable to highlight the gaps in the system.  In deference to you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, I will refrain from further discussion of the matter; the point has been made.  The legislation is progressive and welcome.</P>
      <P>I was remiss in not wishing the Minister of State well in her new appointment.  I wish her well and I am sure she will bring the same enthusiasm and distinction to that Department as she brought to the others in which she has served.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should have been a diplomat.  I have some comments to make on this welcome legislation and on the necessity to amend the Unfair Dismissals Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Wexford case has been mentioned <Col N="1218" /> in previous contributions as a glaring example of unfair dismissal.  Senator Honan said the employee was dismissed because she was a woman and pregnant. She was dismissed in truth because she had a relationship outside marriage and became pregnant.  That was a case of glaring discrimination and points up the need to update the legislation.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the probationary period in employment continues to be 12 months.  I am open to correction on this but I have not seen the requirement amended.  Other EC countries have a six month probationary period.  Members who spoke on this Bill earlier gave the impression that unfair dismissal legislation or labour law generally militates against employment and small employers.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This legislation is intended as a protection for employees in a contract of employment with employers.  The rights commissioner, the court or tribunal decides if there has been a breach of the Act or of the procedures.</P>
    <P>The impression was given in a statement by a Senator who employs 3,000 people that such legislation hinders employment.  He wondered if he could have achieved his present level of success had this legislation applied when he started his business.</P>
    <P>The impression given, that labour law militates against employment, is a distortion of the facts.  Employers are, in certain respects, taking advantage of employees who have been in their employment for a long time.  There was a case last week in which a person, after 15 years loyal service was transferred to another Department without explanation. That action was designed to encourage the employee to leave the employment so that somebody else could be recruited from a local FAS office or employment exchange under one of the employment schemes.  Without the necessary legislation to protect the interests of employees that kind of thing can happen.  Employers would argue that the probationary period should be two years.</P>
    <P>Section 3 in this amended legislation <Col N="1219" /> protects the interests of employees with fixed term and fixed purpose contracts of employment.  Such protection is necessary because the new system of contracts being adopted by employers is different from normal procedures for employment. Section 5 of the Bill on the question of sexual orientation has been welcomed by all Members and is good news for the gay and lesbian organisations.  It is only proper that a person should not be discriminated against on account of their sexual orientation.  In section 7 the fine for non-compliance is increased from £20 to £1,000 which should deter employers from non-compliance with determinations of a right commissioner, court or tribunal.  The increase in fine will rectify that situation.</P>
    <P>The Congress of Trade Unions has made a submission with which I agree. I notice from recent figures among the decisions by the Employment appeals Tribunal in 1989, 136 cases were upheld and the average compensation level was £3,232.  In only 30 cases applicants given their jobs back.  That is a trend that is developing and I ask the Minister to examine the situation.  It is unsatisfactory in some instances.</P>
    <P>In the appointment of a full-time chairperson, eligibility should be extended outside the legal profession.  The record will show that there has been a big increase in the number of unfair dismissal appeals.  In 1990 5,969 appeals were referred to the tribunal, compared with 4,523 the previous year.  That is a trend which is developing.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a point which was raised previously.  Provision should be made in this amended legislation to allow people elected to either House of the Oireachtas to take leave of absence from their jobs on their election and protect them from dismissal.  This would ensure that if they subsequently lost their seat, they would still have a job.  I will propose an amendment to that effect. Some, if not all, of the semi-State bodies have this protection and it is very important to provide for this.</P>
    <P>It is time to amend and update the <Col N="1220" /> Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  This legislation protects the interests of people in employment.  Such legislation should not be necessary but many cases arise and it is essential to have the rights of employees protected by law.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank everyone who contributed to the debate on the Bill.  It was interesting to see the progress on Second Stage and to hear the different and legitimate points of view.</P>
      <P>I would like to read into the record of the House the names of the Senators who contributed on Second Stage.  There were 15 contributors which is indicative of the widespread interest in the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill, 1993 in this House.  The contributors were Senators Neville, Hillery, O'Toole, Maloney, Gallagher, Howard, Mooney, Quinn, Norris, Lanigan, Honan, Daly, Doyle, Roche and Sherlock.  I was glad to hear from many old friends who were in the other House and new Senators and to note that they have not lost their vim.</P>
      <P>I am glad we were able to introduce this legislation in the Seanad.  There is a welcome and wide range of views in a Chamber such as this and the debate on Second Stage was a clear indication of that.  Members of the Seanad are elected by county councillors and other elected bodies.  The vocational nature of the representation leads to a diversity of views. One sometimes hears that the Seanad has been too party political, which it has in many senses.  However, Senators are elected from an electoral base which, although narrow, is clearly defined in its representational nature and this is reflected in the wide range of viewpoints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an ease of expression in this Chamber, which is not evident or possible in the other Chamber and which is mainly due to the Cathaoirleach's benign influence.  From time to time he allows an intimate rapport and approach in the discussion of such Bills which the other House, because of its nature, does not allow.  It makes for better debating, an <Col N="1221" /> easier rapport and enables people to listen very attentively to what others say.</P>
    <P>I know the Seanad has made real efforts over the past number of years to be seen as relevant to the democratic process.  The introduction of legislation such as this in the Seanad and the amendments which will be put forward on Committee Stage will enable Senators to express their different points of view.  On the first day the debate was of a more gentler nature; today there was a debate of considerable vigour.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville was the first speaker on the first day of the debate, he was perturbed, as were other Members who spoke later, about what they saw as the too legalistic approach in the unfair dismissals provisions and warned against it. At the time I said it was a matter in which I was interested and that I would bring it to the attention of those who use the various fora whereby redress can be obtained.  It is not in the spirit of the Bill that that tendency should continue.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery on behalf of his party welcomed the emphasis in the Bill on procedural fairness on which there was further discussion.  Senator Neville was also perturbed about the possibility of an employee seeking redress for an unfair dismissal under industrial relations under various headings.  For the information of Senators, redress under unfair dismissals legislation and employment equality legislation has been prohibited since 1977 under a section of the Employment Equality Act, 1977 and this measure similarly forbids it.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville asked about protection under the legislation for employees who had given what they regarded as important facts to politicians in the beef tribunal. While I understood the point being made, it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister of State with responsibility for Labour Affairs, to speculate on the independent performance of the rights commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal, of courts, or their decision in any particular case.  Unfair dismissals legislation provides redress for any employee who is dismissed without substantial cause.  I understand the point <Col N="1222" /> the Senator was making and he was right to express his disquiet.  However it would be wrong to be discriminatory by dealing with a specific case rather than taking the general point of view that redress available is to employees.</P>
    <P>Both Senators O'Toole and Gallagher questioned the procedures proposed in the Bill relating to enforcement hearings by the Employment Appeals Tribunal or Circuit Court following the non-implementation by an employer of an award.  To deal with this issue, I explained the procedures.  There was a worry expressed that both procedures or any number of procedures could be tried and the most favourable followed.  That is not the position.  Section 11 which replaces section 10 of the 1977 Act separates the two procedures and in so doing clarifies the role of the tribunal or court in an enforcement case.  Enforcement procedure arises only where an employer has not followed through on an award.  I could comment at greater length on all the points of view expressed but it would be better to deal with them in a general manner.  I wish to deal with what I regard as the main thrust of the debate because my job is to reflect and to comment on what Senators said.  Different viewpoints were expressed on the tendency of legislation such as this to inhibit the retention and growth of employment and I will deal with this matter later.</P>
    <P>Senators Neville and Gallagher referred to an apparent discrepency between this legislation and the minimum notice legislation. We have found no evidence of this.  If the Senators have knowledge of any determination of a tribunal based on such an interpretation I would be glad to hear it because we can then examine it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole spoke about the continued exclusion of Garda and Army personnel from protection under this type of legislation.  The Gardaí and Army are among a group of public servants excluded from the protection of the Unfair Dismissals legislation for a variety of reasons.  This was touched on by both Senators Daly and Roche when they named a particular assistant secretary of <Col N="1223" /> a Department whom it has been alleged was capriciously dismissed.  It has been alleged that pressure was brought to bear on him which led to his decision to leave. Separate groups like the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces are generally party to separate dismissal and grievance procedures distinct from those provided in this legislation.  I know Senator O'Toole intends to bring forward an amendment on this matter and obviously it is his right to do so.  Our right is to debate the matter when it comes forward. Both of those groups have procedures whereby grievances and other matters with regard to employment can be raised.</P>
    <P>Senator Maloney expressed concern about the small number of cases heard by the Employment Appeals Tribunal where reinstatement was ordered.  This issue is often discussed and it is said that reinstatement is the correct and just solution if an employee is found to have been unfairly dismissed.  That is fine in theory but reinstatement is not always desired because of bruised feeings or feelings of antipathy that may arise between employees or between employee and employer.  This is especially likely in smaller firms.</P>
    <P>The small nature of so many Irish firms may be part of the explanation that Senator Maloney seeks in relation to the small number of reinstatements.  I am sure that the Tribunal in its wisdom makes the appropriate order in each case having regard to the facts.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole drew attention to the revised definition of trade union proposed in the Bill and questioned the effect of that with reference to the Trade Union Act 1971.  I assure the Senator that the proposed deletion is consistent with the definition of trade union in the Industrial Relations Act 1990.</P>
    <P>Every speaker who contributed to the debate welcomed the sexual orientation provision in the Bill.  Senator Lanigan disagreed with the level of media attention which has been given to this matter but that it is natural when a new item is introduced into legislation.  I am glad I was able to have included it in the Bill. <Col N="1224" /> I thank the Senators for their humane response; it is a small and necessary step.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher referred to the need to consider the application of unfair dismissals legislation to apprentices.  She spoke of the welcome inclusion of apprentices in the protection provided against dismissal for trade union activities. Apprentices are covered by the terms of the 1977 Act and this Bill will do nothing to dilute the protection afforded by the original Act.  There are certain limited exclusions in relation to statutory apprenticeships and they are outlined in section 4 of the 1977 Act.</P>
    <P>The question of contracts of employment were raised by Senator Mooney who spoke of his own case.  The Senator was quite right to mention it because this is a forum where an example can be given to illustrate a point in legislation.  I encourage the Senator to use the legislation if he wishes to pursue his point with his employer.  Senator Mooney made interesting observations on the Bill and pointed out the need to be ever vigilant with regard to legislation that affects both employers and employees.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher expressed concern about the lack of information for employers and employees on their rights. This point was raised by other Senators also.  There is a guide available and I intend to discuss it because it was raised specifically by Senators Quinn and Daly. This is a matter to which I have been giving attention.</P>
    <P>It was refreshing to hear Senator Quinn who was a practical exponent of another point of view.  His contribution was mainly on the need for balance with which I concur.  I spoke on that matter on Second Stage as I was aware when I took this portfolio that people had conflicting ideas about employment legislation. My views on the matter are similar to those put forward by Senator Quinn. He mentioned balance, small firms and social dumping which he was afraid could emerge, as well as the need to have clarity and consolidation in labour legislation. Senator Daly also referred to those points as well as other matters.  I intend to dwell on these for a while, informally, so that <Col N="1225" /> we can see the path on which the Government has embarked.  I see no conflict between protection of employees' rights, proper working habits, and a proper working environment between employees and employers.  It is that kind of balance which we have sought to bring in Irish labour law.</P>
    <P>Sometimes the titles we put on Bills lead employers to believe that we are dealing with business which is not actually contained in the Bill.  When I became Minister of State and saw that this legislation was one of the first items that had to be tackled, I felt the term &ldquo;unfair dismissals&rdquo; was not really accurate because it evokes different things for different people.  The original legislation was the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, and what we are discussing here are obviously amendments to that Act.  It benefits employment, the business environment and the country if there is a harmonious, balanced and good relationship between employees' rights and employers' rights. That is what Senator Quinn was saying when he talked about the need for balance. I was disturbed by his remark that he was starting in business again, if he might be daunted by the range of legislation which has since emerged.  I am going to make a real effort to bring about a realignment of differing views because I do not want to see a chasm opening up between employees and employers.  That would not be to anyone's benefit.</P>
    <P>In general we have had a harmonious period in labour relations since the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, and I hope the same will apply in the next arrangement we make.  Since there have not been too many hiccups along the way, we are inclined to forget the periods when there were many major strikes, sometimes sparked off by one employee being wrongly treated and bringing out an entire workforce.  We are inclined to forget the &ldquo;bad old days&rdquo;, and take for granted the kind of protection which we have been able to enshrine in legislation dealing with the Employment Appeals Tribunal and other agencies.  I <Col N="1226" /> am not preaching to anyone but I recognise there are fears.</P>
    <P>We have to do something about clarifying the legislation, providing a simple guide in simple language as distinct from a convoluted guide, and we have to do something about proper consolidation. They are areas that can be looked at and they will help both employees and employers.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris expressed his point very clearly.  I thank the Senator for his comments; he was quite right.  People did not come forward, give their names and say: &ldquo;Yes, I have been dismissed and I think it is because of sexual orientation.&rdquo; To do so would only have drawn attention to themselves at a time and in a climate when it was not fashionable to do so.  I share the Senator's point of view that this will provide a strong measure of protection on the issue of sexual orientation.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan had some trenchant things to say and, nothing that it is a technical piece of legislation, he regretted the media were hyping up the matter. Senators Lanigan and Quinn asked for small firms to be exempt from the small print of much of this legislation.  We have looked into the matter and, while I know the UK authorities are attempting to do that, it would not be possible here because of the Constitution.  These are matters which have to be taken into account and I will give them further thought.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan seems to have misread the Bill when he suggests that the award would be payable in circumstances where the employee is reinstated. Obviously that is not the case.  You cannot get two awards, by being reinstated and receiving money for unfair dismissal.  It is one or the other.  The financial award would be applicable only where the employee is proved to have been unfairly dismissed and where reinstatement is judged by the tribunal as not being the appropriate method of redress.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in Senator Honan's contribution, and I thank her for her work with the Commission on the Status of Women.  I know she had a <Col N="1227" /> considerable input into that commission's sub-committee dealing with business, and this was reflected in her contribution today which was practical and down-to-earth.</P>
    <P>In replying to Senators Doyle and Daly, I would make the point that the Bill is primarily concerned with ensuring that the rules of natural justice are complied with by employers.  It is nothing more or less than that.  We do not intend to affect adversely any employment generating opportunities.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan welcomed the provision for contracts, particularly as it would affect women employees, but wondered about the necessity to include it in the Bill.  On balance, it is correct because it will give better protection to the groups of employees about whom the Senator spoke.  There is confusion and ambiguity because people desperately want contract employment to be included and then they wonder if it will affect people who do not want that kind of employment.  I found Senator Honan's proposals most interesting and I would be interested to hear what she has to say on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Regarding parental status and other matters of discrimination raised by Senator Honan, my colleague the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, is looking at that in the Equal Status Bill and other anti-discrimination legislation which he is preparing. When that is done, we may have to move an amendment to deal with that, but I am not yet sure of the position.  The Minister is certainly working on it and it seems to be a better channel than this one for that type of legislation.  The matter can be looked at later on.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly took up many of the points raised by Senator Quinn.  He then discussed three cases which had been brought to his attention; a matron of a small hospital who was dismissed, an employee of a semi-State company dismissed while in hospital through an injury suffered at work and an assistant secretary of a Government Department <Col N="1228" /> forced by duress to resign.  These cases were also mentioned by Senator Roche.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle made a very interesting contribution.  It was clearly thought out and represented a very balanced viewpoint. He was speaking from the point of view of the employee but did not disregard the employer's point of view.  I found his contribution refreshing, balanced and open.  Senator Roche obviously studied the rationale behind the legislation carefully.  His contribution was interesting in that he discussed the original Bill and its proposed amendment comprehensively.</P>
    <P>The last speaker was Senator Sherlock who regretted the time limit for lodgment of a claim in exceptional circumstances was not brought back to six months.  One group wanted a limit of six months and another a limit of two years so we decided to leave it at 12 months, which is a clear indication of balance in the matter.  We are endeavouring to live in a civilised and humane community.  There is no point in taking any viewpoint to extremes.  This legislation has proved since 1977 that it is not a hindrance to employment.  It has encouraged employers to be more clear thinking and disciplined about employment procedures.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this legislation which would hinder employment retention or growth.  It marks out clearly the rights, duties and responsibilities of employee and employer.  We do not want employment at any cost.  That would not be the correct way to deal with labour matters.</P>
    <P>There is a need to be very clear about what we are doing.  We must avoid the use of jargon.  Employers and employees may be assured that measures such as this are not brought in to be punitive or to be prohibitive.  This Bill is an effort to redress issues which have arisen from the 1977 legislation that require amendments to the Act.</P>
    <P>I intend to take up some of the points raised with regard to clarity of language and consolitation and I will consider the publication of simple guide books for employers and employees on their rights.</P>
    <P>I welcome the contributions from all <Col N="1229" /> sides and I have greatly benefited from their depth and diversity.  I look forward to Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is necessary to ensure that the interconnector pipeline being constructed by Bord Gáis Éireann to link the Irish and British gas grids is completed on schedule.  I am sure by now Senators will be aware of this very important project, approved by our Government in December 1991.</P>
      <P>The project will link the high pressure gas grids of this country and Britain by a sub-sea pipeline, from Loughshinny in north County Dublin, to Moffat in Scotland, at a cost of approximately £290 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pipeline must be financed, constructed, operated and maintained in a manner that helps to sustain and develop the role of natural gas in Ireland and the provisions of this Bill will ensure this <Col N="1230" /> can be done.  Accordingly, it provides for BGÉ's borrowing requirement and for the application of conditions to be laid down by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications relating to the construction and operation of the pipeline during its lifetime.  As I will explain later, it is essential these provisions are put in place as soon as possible. The statutory limit on BGÉs borrowing for capital purposes was last amended in the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1987, when it was increased to £170 million. Expenditure in 1993, on the interconnector project, when added to the board's existing debt, and the cost of capital expenditure, which it must undertake, in the course of its other activities, means that the limit must be raised substantially. We propose to increase it to £350 million in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Gas (Amendment) Act of 1982 increased the limit on that portion of BGE's borrowings that may be covered by a state guarantee, to £80 million.  At the end of 1992, £55 million of BGÉ's borrowings were guaranteed.  One element of the financial package which BGÉ has developed for the project involves borrowings from the European Investment Bank.  These borrowings are available to BGÉ board at comparatively favourable rates provided they have a State guarantee.  In order to cater for this, we propose in this Bill to increase the limit on that part of the board's borrowings which may be guaranteed by the State to £190 million.</P>
    <P>In addition to the borrowing requirements, the question of BGÉ's statutory power to construct pipelines is addressed in the Bill.  Under Section 8 (7) of the Gas Act, 1976 (as amended), the consent of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, given with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, is required by Bord Gáis Éireann for the construction of pipelines.  Conditions may be attached to any such consent. These conditions normally relate to safety standards in construction, maintenance and operation.  The power to impose new conditions appropriate to the operation of major infrastructure like this <Col N="1231" /> pipeline is being provided for, as is the power to revoke any existing consent, if necessary.  The proposed amendment to section 8 of the Gas Act, 1976, contained in this Bill at Section 2, will remove any doubt about BGÉ's powers, to operate and carry out its functions outside the State.</P>
    <P>References to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in Section 8 of the Gas Act, 1976, are being deleted in this Bill. This is a technical amendment to tidy up the text of the Act, as the powers, which were vested in the Minister for Industry and Commerce, under the 1976 Act were, in fact, transferred to the Minister with responsibility for Energy in 1980, by means of a transfer of powers order, which was approved at the time.  These functions now reside in the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    <P>The pipeline is designed to last for at least 50 years.  In that time, there is the possibility that interests in all or part of the pipeline could pass to another party or parties.</P>
    <P>Because of the vital strategic nature of this pipeline, as a main energy link to Ireland, the Government will wish to retain control over its operation.  It is proposed in this Bill to amend section 8 (8) of the Gas Act, 1976 to allow the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to impose a condition on Bord Gáis Éireann, that any transfer of an interest in this or any other pipeline, would be subject to the consent of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and that any conditions, which have been laid down for Bord Gáis Éireann, in regard to construction, operation, maintenance or the transfer of an interest in a pipeline, would also apply to the transferee and to any subsequent transferee.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the main reason for introducing this Bill at this time, is to ensure that Bord Gáis Éireann is in a position to proceed with the Ireland-UK natural gas interconnector project.  There are four main elements to the project. These are: a 30 inch pipeline, which will run from Moffat in Scotland, for 79 kilometres <Col N="1232" /> to Brighouse Bay, on the Scottish coast; a compressor station to be located on the Scottish coast, which will compress the gas for onward transmission to Ireland; a 24 inch subsea pipeline, 200 kilometres in length, which will run from the Scottish coast, across the Irish Sea to the landfall at Loughshinny, near Skerries in north County Dublin and a shore station to be constructed at Loughshinny, from where a 30 inch pipeline will run to Ballough on the Dublin-Dundalk pipeline, to connect with the existing Irish grid.</P>
    <P>The project is being undertaken in the interests of the future development of the natural gas industry in Ireland.  The reasons for it are twofold: first, to afford additional supply security to the main gas markets during the remaining life of the Kinsale Head and the associated Ballycotton gas fields, which to date are our only indigenous supply sources; and secondly, to provide for secure long term supplies of gas into the future when those fields have been depleted.</P>
    <P>Construction of this pipeline is a major undertaking and I am happy to be able to say that progress to date has been excellent.  The project is on target for its completion date in October next and is within budget.  Up to the end of 1992, approximately £85 million had been spent on the project and while the total cost of the project, at about £290 million, may seem high, it is relatively insignificant, when one considers that, over the lifetime of the pipeline, the value of the gas shipped through it will be many times that figure.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive feasibility study of the economic and technical aspects of this project was undertaken by our Department, taking into account cost estimates provided by internationally respected consultants.  The EC Commission and their consultants, also professed themselves satisfied and agreed to grant aid the project.  The Government is very pleased that the bids received from the contractors on this project have borne out the estimates used in the feasibility study, and also the crucial decision to build in 1993.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1233" /> One element of the feasibility study into the project involved sea surveys of a number of possible routes.  These were carried out during 1990 and 1991.  The criteria adopted for route selection were technical and economic feasibility.  The route from Loughshinny to Moffat proved to be the best option, on both of these criteria.  In addition, it also offered a landfall north of Dublin city which will be strategically important, in as much as it will afford a supply from the northern end of the grid to the critical Dublin Market in the event of any disruption to the Cork/Dublin pipeline.</P>
    <P>The capacity of the pipeline and compressor will mean that we can import sufficient gas for our needs after the Kindale Head and Ballycotton fields are depleted.  We currently consume about 2 billion cubic metres of gas per year. Assuming market projections are realised, we expect our import requirements to rise to about 5 billion cubic metres over the next 20 years.</P>
    <P>The design of the compressor station allows for additional capacity, to be added later to meet these projected requirements.  Most of the anticipated growth will be in the electricity generation sector.  We are satisfied that natural gas is an ideal fuel for electricity generation and, with new combined cycle technologies conversion efficiencies of over 50 per cent are possible.  The EC also has recognised this and has recently revoked an earlier directive which restricted the use of gas for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The construction phase of the pipeline project is underway.  However, to get to this stage extensive planning and preparatory work had to be undertaken.  A large amount of surveying and engineering design has been carried out.  In addition, negotiations were undertaken with the local and central authorities involved on both sides of the Irish Sea and with fishermen's organisations, landowners' representatives and other interested groups.  This work was co-ordinated by a small task force comprising officials of our Department together with people from Bord Gáis Éireann itself and its project management office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" /> Contracts have been awarded for the manufacture and coating of the pipe, for the laying of the subsea section and for the onshore Scotland section.  The contract for the Irish on shore leg will be awarded shortly.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed at the level of involvement of Irish firms in the project.  I should mention in that regard that Bord Gáis Éireann has been careful to comply fully with European Community rules on public procurement by advertising contracts Community wide. It is not permissible to give preference to tenders from a particular country or to otherwise discriminate on the grounds of nationality.  In any event Irish firms would not have been in a position to tender for the bulk of these contracts because of the highly specialised nature of the work.  It is carried out world-wide by a small number of firms.  A good example would be the pipelaying onshore which requires very large pipelaying vessels.</P>
    <P>Despite this, a number of Irish firms have been successful in tendering for the less specialised areas and it is expected that in the region of £20 million will be spent in 1993 on Irish goods and services. In fact, about 180 Irish jobs have resulted from the contracts awarded to date.</P>
    <P>The project necessitated an agreement with the United Kingdom Government on the delimitation of the continental shelf in the area through which the pipeline will pass.  An agreement was concluded in 1992, which extended the previous delimitation line between the two jurisdictions agreed in 1988 further northwards.  Both Governments have now approved the agreement and we expect the necessary order to be laid before the Oireachtas shortly.</P>
    <P>A more detailed pipeline agreement with the United Kingdom Government concerning all aspects of the laying and operation of the pipeline between the two countries was initiated by Irish and British officials in 1992.  I expect this to be approved by Government shortly, and when it has been signed, it will be laid before the Dáil for its approval.  The agreement deals with the routing of the <Col N="1235" /> line through Irish and UK waters including those of the Isle of Man, construction standards, the issue of authorisations to the operators, joint inspections, safety and pollution control, emergencies, abandonment procedures and consultations between the two Governments. There will be a four man commission comprising representatives of each Government to oversee the smooth operation of the pipeline.</P>
    <P>In the interest of North-South co-operation we have at all times considered the needs of Northern Ireland in planning for this project and, following consultation with the Northern Ireland authorities, the onshore leg of the pipeline in Scotland will be able to cater for the transmission of gas from the British high pressure system to the offtake point for the proposed Northern Ireland pipeline from Scotland to Islandmagee in County Antrim.</P>
    <P>There have been some suggestions that a single line to Ireland would have made more sense.  I would point out, however, that our project is considerably ahead of the Northern Ireland project in time and progress, and that the provision of gas, and the best means of getting it to Northern Ireland are primarily matters for the Northern Ireland authorities.  As I said there is a good measure of co-operation between us.  Furthermore, I look forward to the time when it may be practical and feasible to forge a link between the two systems &mdash; closing the loop, so to speak, and enhancing security of supply for both Northern Ireland and ourselves.</P>
    <P>When natural gas was discovered in the Kinsale Head field in the early 1970s, it was a time of great volatility in the energy market.  The advent of gas to our energy mix was timely and has helped to reduce our exposure to the uncertainties of that market, particularly the oil market.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann was set up with the responsibility to extract the maximum benefit to Ireland from this indigenous resource and I believe Senators will agree that it has fulfilled its role.  We now have a safe, efficient and profitable transmission <Col N="1236" /> system, bringing gas to the ESB for electricity generation, to industrial and commercial customers from Cork to Cavan and, of course, to domestic consumers in many of our cities and suburbs.</P>
    <P>In 1991 Bord Gáis Éireann returned a profit of £54.9 million on a turnover of £165.6 million and surrendered £28 million in dividends to the Exchequer.  I understand that 1992 was another successful year for Bord Gáis Éireann, although its annual report and accounts for that year are not yet available and I cannot go into detail.  The Exchequer did receive a dividend of £25 million in 1992 however.</P>
    <P>The achievements of Bord Gáis Éireann since 1975 have been impressive. In that relatively short time, we have witnessed a dramatic level of development of the transmission and distribution infrastructure.  A sizeable customer base has been built up with over 195,000 gas customers now connected.</P>
    <P>Natural gas, as a late entrant into the energy scene here compared to other European countries, now accounts for about 17 per cent of our primary energy demand.  It is the first choice for industry within reach of the gas network, as it is for new housing.</P>
    <P>The domestic sector is the premium market and the most desirable primary use for gas.  The volume of sales to domestic customers increased by 16 per cent in 1992 and almost 22,500 new central heating customers were connected in that year.  Bord Gáis Éireann launched a major programme to connect up viable non-gas housing estates in 1991 and this programme is now well under way and has been accelerated.</P>
    <P>We can see, therefore, that the role of natural gas has been greatly expanded over the years.  Initially, the only customers were NET and the ESB and thanks to those contracts it was an economic prospect to develop the reserves in the first place.  We have moved on since then, however, and the penetration into the other sectors has been rapid.  Natural gas has come to be appreciated as a clean and versatile fuel, transported by pipeline, available on tap and requiring no <Col N="1237" /> storage arrangements.  Its existence in the market place has introduced a welcome additional element of competition.</P>
    <P>High levels of efficiency have been attained in modern gas fired plants and improvements are taking place all the time in gas turbine powered electricity generation technology.  The importance of combined heat and power units in industry, in commercial units, in hospitals and other institutions was recognised in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  This is a relatively new area and we are anxious that developments in this technology should be exploited also.</P>
    <P>Questions are raised from time to time about the wisdom of selling gas to the ESB and NET.  The practical situation is that Bord Gáis is contractually bound to take or pay for certain quantities of gas every year.  Even if Bord Gáis does not sell that gas, it must still pay for it.  That is how gas fields are developed everywhere.</P>
    <P>Almost 70 per cent of all gas sales by BGÉ go to the ESB and NET.  If Bord Gáis chose not to sell this gas, while at the same time under an obligation to pay the producer for it, it would be rightly criticised for lack of economic sense.  The consequent shortfall in revenue would have to be made up by borrowings.  I am sure Members can imagine the effect which this would have on the company's finances.</P>
    <P>The kinds of combustion efficiencies I mentioned earlier mean that the use of gas for electricity generation is a very practical and cost effective use of gas. With regard to the use of gas for fertiliser manufacture, it must be borne in mind that BGÉ is bound, by commercial contracts dating from 1976 to 1987, to sell gas to NET which then sells it for fertiliser manufacture.  To disrupt these contracts could result in significant cost.  The signals that such action would send to prospective customers should not be underestimated either.  Added to that is the negative effect on employment that could result from a decision to curtail supplies of natural gas.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the task force on the implementation of the Culliton <Col N="1238" /> report are currently under consideration. It would, however, seem to make no sense to discontinue sales into fertiliser production unless a more beneficial use for the gas in the national interest is identified.</P>
    <P>It has been the policy of successive Governments to implement measures that will ensure we are not overly dependent on any one energy source or on any one fuel.  This Government is no exception.  The lessons we learned in the fuel crises of the 1970s and 1980s have shown us that we need an even balance of fuels so that we can be in a better and stronger position to respond to such eventualities.  As Senators know, most countries have about five primary energy sources &mdash; oil, coal, gas, hydro and nuclear.  The latter, Senators will agree, is not a suitable option for Ireland.  We do, of course, have peat.</P>
    <P>About two thirds of our energy supplies are imported.  Of those imports, about two thirds are oil, either as crude or product.  The introduction of natural gas into Ireland and its subsequent development has greatly reduced our dependence on oil.  Oil still supplies nearly half of our energy needs, however.</P>
    <P>Of course, we would be foolish not to use these fuels as efficiently as possible. Hence the emphasis in the Programme for a Partnership Government on energy efficiency and also, of course, on alternatives and renewables.</P>
    <P>We produce gas and peat, our only indigenous fuels, in about equal amounts and the bulk of the output of each goes into electricity generation.  A major feature of policy over the last few years has been to see that the fuels used by the ESB have as wide and diverse a range as possible.</P>
    <P>One of the many benefits of the use of natural gas in Ireland has been the consequential savings to date of over £2 billion in our bill for imported fuels.  The benefits of gas have also been shared with those who do not have access to a supply. First, there is the payment of dividends to the Exchequer by BGÉ which captures in effect the economic rent for Kinsale <Col N="1239" /> gas.  To date BGÉ has contributed over £300 million in this way.</P>
    <P>Senators will agree, I hope, that gas has therefore become a vital and vibrant part of our energy and industrial policy. The Government is determined to see that its role continues and expands.</P>
    <P>Gas is also an important plank of environmental policy and its environmental benefits are, by now, well known and acknowledged.  It is the cleanest of all fossil fuels and the increased use of natural gas figures as a prominent feature of our national strategy to minimise emissions of harmful gases such as sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide.  We are, of course, bound by international commitments in that regard, particularly within the European Community.</P>
    <P>Air quality used to be a major problem in Dublin.  This has improved significantly in the last few years thanks to the ban on the sale and distribution of bituminous coal and the resulting subsitution of gas in many areas of the capital. The increased gas use in other urban centres where BGÉ operates has also had a beneficial effect on those areas.</P>
    <P>The Government hopes for all the reasons I have outlined, that natural gas will increase its share of primary energy demand to about 30 per cent over the next 20 years.</P>
    <P>We now have a gas industry which has made great strides over the last seventeen years and which has the potential for future development.  Our current native resources, however, are finite.  We hope that further reserves will be identified in our offshore.  Nevertheless, prudence dictates that we should take no chances. It was against this background that the decision to build the Ireland-UK gas interconnector was made.</P>
    <P>With an interconnector in place Ireland will no longer be a stand-alone grid, dependent on a single supply pipeline and a single source.  An integrated energy market is one of the goals of the European Community and while initially we will be connected only to the UK, giving us access to the North Sea and Norwegian reserves, eventually we hope <Col N="1240" /> to connect with the wider European grid. We will, thereby, be able to enjoy the benefits of greater competition and greater security of supply which the single energy market offers.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann is currently in the marketplace for long term supplies of gas and Senators may well ask why we should have a pipeline in place before such a contract has been concluded.  As a matter of fact, the pipeline will earn its keep from day one by providing security against any interruption of our supply line to our indigenous reserves at Kinsale. It has long been a cause of concern that there is only one source of supply but when the pipeline is in place, we will be able to avail of a security gas agreement, the first of its kind in these islands, which was completed last year between Bord Gáis Éireann and National Power, the largest of the fossil fuel burning generating companies in the UK. Under this innovative agreement, Bord Gáis Éireann will have access to supplies at short notice if and when required.  The agreement is for a five year period from November of this year.  This arrangement will give Bord Gáis time to put in place a longer term supply agreement.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to say what the cost of imported gas will be for Bord Gáis Éireann, or the ESB, but it will be related to the market price in the UK, which is, of course, higher than the price of Kinsale gas now.  We can be assured that there will be no problem with supplies of gas for generations to come.  For example, Norway has over 60 years of reserves at current levels of production and Russia has 40 per cent of the world's known gas reserves, most of which is untapped.</P>
    <P>While we have decided to proceed with interconnection, we have also taken steps to encourage exploration for further commercial finds in our offshore.  An exploration agreement was signed in 1991, between the previous Minister for Energy and Marathon Petroleum, the company that developed the Kinsale and Ballycotton fields.  That agreement provided for seven exploration wells to be drilled over a five-year period commencing last year.  While the first of those <Col N="1241" /> wells was disappointing, we hope for positive results from the rest of the drilling programme.</P>
    <P>At the same time BGE completed an agreement with Marathon for the installation of additional compression on the production platforms which will enable the parties to recover and bring forward in time an additional four billion cubic metres of gas.  This gas, which is equivalent to two years supply under the existing Kinsale Head contract, will be used in the period to the end of 1996. This gas might not otherwise have been recovered and as a result Bord Gáis Éireann does not now require imports of large quantities of gas before 1996.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act 1992 included provisions for the enactment of special petroleum taxation legislation, which, for the first time, clarified the tax &ldquo;take&rdquo; from a field development, and set it at a level designed to attract exploration investment to Ireland, while still ensuring that Ireland would share in the benefits which would arise in the event of another find.</P>
    <P>In addition to these measures, a review of the licensing terms for exploration and production activities, carried out last year, resulted in new modern and progressive licensing terms appropriate for the conditions of today and of the coming years.  These new terms were launched recently.</P>
    <P>All of these measures should have the effect of bringing about further activity in the Irish offshore by making this country a worthwhile location for international exploration investment.  I am hopeful that an increased level of exploration activity as a result of this package, and indeed as a result of this pipeline, will lead to further commercial finds.</P>
    <P>We must, nevertheless, be pragmatic. It would not be prudent simply to take for granted that we will have sufficient discoveries of indigenous reserves on steam in time to cater for increased demand and to replace our current supplies as they begin to taper off.  We must make adequate arrangements to assure supplies long into the future and if this means imports then so be it.  Even if we <Col N="1242" /> do find significant reserves in the near future, and if some of that gas is in excess of our own needs, the interconnector will allow us to export that surplus.  That facility is in itself an incentive to exploration as prospective producers will be reassured that they will not be restricted to the relatively small Irish market.</P>
    <P>I have explained the importance of the project to Ireland.  However, it should be noted that the interconnector is also of significance to the European Community. As I have already explained, the EC is anxious to see the completion of the internal market in energy.  The commission sees our pipeline as an important link in this strategy and as a consequence we have been able to secure EC funding for the project at a rate of 35 per cent of approved cost, from the Commission's REGEN initiative.</P>
    <P>In its strategy to open up the markets for gas and electricity, the Commission has identified the following as key objectives: price transparency; rights of transit for large utility companies, and third party access.  The first two of these have already been put in place by means of Council Directives.</P>
    <P>The issue of third party access to the transmission network is sill under discussion and we will, of course, comply with whatever proposals emerge.  It is our intention that the needs of the Irish gas and electricity markets will be taken into account fully in the development of such proposals.  In any event, it would be our intention that, subject to considerations of security of supply, access to available capacity should be afforded to large users such as the ESB, and to producers either for their large customers or for export.</P>
    <P>As the ESB will be, at least initially, the largest customer for gas through the pipeline, it was put to both boards that the ESB might take an equity share in the pipeline.  This did not come to pass, however, as Bord Gáis and the ESB were unable to agree terms for such participation. Bord Gáis Éireann also had dicussions with other potential joint venture partners but no firm offer has emerged.</P>
    <P>This means that Bord Gáis must now <Col N="1243" /> undertake the financing of the project itself.  In the absence of a suitable equity partner as of now, this means borrowing. I want to stress at this juncture that there will be no Exchequer funding for this project.</P>
    <P>In its passage through the Dáil, the Bill elicited a full and frank debate on the substance of the Bill itself and on related gas and energy issues.  I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the Deputies for their contributions.  Concern was expressed over a number of issues, some of which I have addressed here today.</P>
    <P>A further concern raised was in the area of safety and security.  I can give this house the same assurance I gave in the Dáil that there is no extra risk to the people of Loughshinny, or of north County Dublin arising from the existence or the interconnector in the area.  The pipeline has been designed and is being constructed to the highest international standards, and cannot be operated until it has been certified as fit for the purpose for which it was intended.  When the pipeline is in operation a system of regular inspections will be put in place.  Adequate precautions are being taken to avoid the risk of accidents and a sophisticated system of isolation valves will be installed at both shore stations.</P>
    <P>We are very aware of the security issues relating to the pipeline, both here and in Scotland.  There will be liaison between the Garda Síochána and the police force in the UK throughout the lifeline of the pipeline.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to restate the importance of the gas industry to Ireland and the vital nature of the interconnector project to the future of that industry.  As the proposed legislation before us today is necessary for the completion of that project, I therefore, commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Second Stage debate and to completing all stages so that we can proceed with this major project which is of vital national and international importance to Irish economic activity in the years ahead.</P>
    <Col N="1244" />
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the welcome I received when I came to this House and I look forward to a good working relationship with other Senators.  As the only Senator from County Mayo I will be raising certain issues here during my term and would welcome co-operation from members.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well as Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  As a west of Ireland man I hope he will look favourably on the west&mdash; we may even get natural gas in the west.  I welcome in principle the Gas (Amendment) Bill, 1993 as it is necessary to provide for the supply of natural gas through an interconnector pipeline from Moffat in Scotland across the Irish Sea to Loughshinny in County Dublin.</P>
      <P>The interconnector project currently under construction, extending approximately 147 miles and costing in the region of £290 million, is one of the most important engineering feats ever undertaken in this country.  The project has been undertaken for a number of reasons.  First, to secure the supply of gas by providing a link into the existing system north of County Dublin.  Second, to secure a supply of gas following exhaustion of the Kinsale gasfield after the year 2000 and to meet additional gas needs which might arise before that year.  It will also allow Ireland to benefit from the integrated European natural gas network.  In the long term the interconnector will provide an opportunity for exporting any surplus supplies of gas to the UK and to mainland Europe should further reserves be discovered off the Irish coast.</P>
      <P>I am delighted all the engineering and design work for this project has been undertaken in Ireland and that approximately 60 per cent of the design team are Irish.  I understand that total employment figures during the construction phase of the project will amount to almost 800 with additional 200 to 300 employed indirectly in engineering-related work, port and docks services and in the transport and servicing of the lay barges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considering the number of jobs <Col N="1245" /> involved I am disappointed Bord Gáis Éireann awarded a major contract to a consortium to carry out the work in Scotland. The consortium, Wood Bredero, submitted two tenders to Bord Gáis Éireann for coating or wrapping of pipes. There was a possibility that work might be undertaken in County Cork but the chairman of Bord Gáis Eireann, in accepting the Scottish-based tender, stated that the decision was based on a difference of millions of pounds in expenditure. I accept that Bord Gáis Éireann are subject to EC regulations on tendering and value for money.  Nevertheless, one has to ask why an Irish company could not have been grant aided to allow it carry out this work.  It could have resulted in the creation of almost 300 jobs.  In these crisis times of unprecedented unemployment it is unthinkable that an opportunity such as this could have been allowed to slip from our shores.  It is regrettable that arising from lack of foresight and determination, a project of this size did not result in a greater number of jobs for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The interconnector is a vital link to the European gas grid.  Bord Gáis Éireann has been concerned for some years about its security of supply, especially as it has signed up many major Irish industries for guaranteed supply contracts.  The Kinsale Head field will run out in the year 2000 under current depletion rates, with the smaller Ballycotton field nearby exceeding its life by just over one year.  Unless there are other natural gas finds in the Celtic Sea, Bord Gáis Éireann could face a major supply problem.  The obvious answer is an interconnector such as this to the British grid.  The five year programme between Bord Gáis Éireann and the UK power generating company will enable the company to ensure that a secure gas supply will cater for the domestic, commercial and industrial sectors should there be any unexpected shortfalls in supply to any of these sectors from October 1993.</P>
    <P>The decision to build this gas interconnector between the UK and Ireland is a major and irreversible decision taken by the Department of Energy.  It will have <Col N="1246" /> a substantial influence on the direction of all future energy policies for this country. Though funded from the EC by approximately £85 million, its total estimated cost of £290 million will undoubtedly have an immense influence on energy prices in the future.  It is important therefore that we should be confident that the decision to proceed with this project is the correct one.</P>
    <P>I regret that the results of the cost benefit study on the interconnector which has been carried out have not been released for study and scrutiny.  It is vital that an investment such as this is subject to serious and rigorous economic analysis by all interested parties.  Can the Minister explain why this cost benefit study has not been released?  The case for investing in an interconnector pipeline has to be based on the standard arguments of cost and profitability.  Searching questions must be asked.  Does the construction of an interconnector provide primary energy at a lower cost than any other alternative source?  What are the economic consequences of building it?  Does the development of the resource to serve the Irish market maximise the return on the investment?  Another question which must be considered while discussing this Bill is whether it is appropriate to vest ownership of the pipeline solely in the existing State owned monopoly supplier of gas?  It is interesting to hear the Minister outline that the ESB and Bord Gáis Éireann could not agree.  It seems to be a common occurence in this country for these bodies to disagree.  Our county councils have had experience of CIE failing to agree with the local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is wise to ensure a continuous supply of gas after domestic sources are exhausted. It is not appropriate when the Kinsale grid is finished to replace gas by other primary energy resources such as oil, coal, or peat which is also running out. We are led to believe that there is only 20 years of peat supply left in the bogs. He must investigate the possibility that the provision of the interconnector might be a viable investment project for a major sector consortium.  The Government never appeared willing to contemplate <Col N="1247" /> putting the pipeline out to private sector tender.  Why was the market not tested?</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann has indicated that the cost of building the interconnector will absorb most of its profits for several years to come leaving little or nothing for the Exchequer.  What this really means is that it is the taxpayer who is investing in the interconnector.  Surely as taxpayers it would be preferable to have Bord Gáis Éireann continue to return dividends from its profits to the Exchequer rather than have those dividends invested in a project which has not been subjected to the test of market viability so that there is no way of ensuring that the funds are used well.</P>
    <P>Doubt and uncertainty would be eased if Bord Gáis Éireann could finance the pipeline by share issue in a subsidiary pipeline company.  At least this would prove commercially viable.  As it stands the taxpayer has no guarantee whatever that this investment will earn an acceptable return.  Indeed the history of equity investment by the taxpayer in Irish semi-State companies has not been a happy one.</P>
    <P>Sections of this Bill, providing for an increase in the limit of State guarantees of Bord Gáis Éireann's borrowings from an existing level of £80 million to an exorbitant £190 million does not inspire confidence in the project's profitability. However, some economists would argue that the profitability of Bord Gáis Éireann must be judged on its contribution to ESB and NET, and thereby its contribution to employment in these sectors.</P>
    <P>It is important while debating this Bill to examine the cost to Bord Gáis Éireann of supplying NET and the ESB with gas, and the effect of these supplies on the viability of this project.  At the moment the ESB uses 45 per cent of Bord Gáis Éireann's gas output and pays half the price paid by residential and commercial consumers.  For example, the residential sector pays between 33p amd 70p per therm; the commercial sector pay between 21p and 38p per therm while the ESB on average pays 17p per therm. <Col N="1248" /> When the interconnector is built it is a certainty that the costs of gas will increase substantially but Bord Gáis Éireann will always have to keep its prices competitive with oil prices or it will lose some of its market share.</P>
    <P>It is neither feasible nor fair to expect residential or commercial consumers to subsidise the supplies of Bord Gáis Éireann to the ESB and NET.  It can now be reliably stated that when the interconnector is in place, Bord Gáis Éireann will not be able to sell at its present prices, or anywhere near them, to either the ESB or NET.  What will be the outcome? The ESB can easily switch to oil but NET will have a serious problem because at present it is only kept alive by courtesy of cheap gas.  If as I predict, NET will have to cease operations when Bord Gáis Éireann becomes dependent on the interconnector for bulk supply, should we be propping it up in the meantime?</P>
    <P>NET pays less than 20 per cent of the price paid by industrial and residential consumers while the ESB pays 34 per cent.  NET's allocation of gas is almost as large as the total supply sold to the residential and industrial users.  This account is central to the justification for spending nearly £300 million on the gas interconnector.  Gas supplied to NET costs BGÉ 400 per cent of the price it could secure in the market.  In fact BGÉ is foregoing 70 per cent of the financial returns it could make by selling as it now sells to NET.  In other words, NET is burning our gasfields.  The same applies to gas sold to the ESB but the margin of waste is about half of that in the case of NET.</P>
    <P>BGÉ by selling at the present rate to ESB and NET, is advancing the date at which existing reserves will run out and bringing forward the date at which we will be dependant on interconnector supplies. Without ESB and NET, the lifetime of the Kinsale and Ballycotton fields could be nearly trebled.  It is estimated that we would not then need the connector until the year 2010 and the saving to the economy would be in millions of pounds.  The savings can be estimated by comparing the cost of interest payments if the project <Col N="1249" /> starts now and the cost of interest payments if it did not start until the year 2005.  We are faced with a 12 year interest payment on a borrowing of £290 million. Economists have estimated that this will cost around £170 million.  One has to seriously question the decision to invest immediately in an interconnector considering that this early start could cost £170 million.</P>
    <P>Several arguments have been advanced for the interconnector apart from the economic argument.  Environmental protection requires the continuous use and supply of gas.  It is clearly a more environmentally friendly fuel than others.  Emissions from the production of gas based energy products are lower than when burning coal or oil.  In a period of immense interest in environmental protection it is wise to encourage and ensure greater use of gas.  A domestic reason also exists for the continuation of gas supply.  BGE has had outstanding success in capturing the domestic heating market.  Many householders have converted to natural gas involving in many cases substantial structural work the cost of which was borne by the householder. If gas became unavailable it would be impossible for domestic gas users to change to oil without incurring major expense.  Consequently BGE has acquired a powerful lobby for its intention and for the building of the interconnector regardless of costs and benefits.</P>
    <P>The interconnector will ensure energy supply diversification.  Inevitably the country's energy supply is less exposed to interception if it has several rather than a few primary energy sources.  The Bill envisages that BGE will finance and operate the interconnector.  In other words BGE will have a monopoly on supply from the interconnector which prevents any possibility of competition. This will enable it to engage in the cross subsidisation involved in supplying NET and ESB.  Third party access which is not covered in this Bill will have to be seriously considered by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1250" /> When all aspects are taken into account the case for the interconnector probably weighs in its favour.  However, the project should have been open to more public economic scrutiny.  Will the interconnector provide primary energy at a lower cost?  The answer to this question has to be in the negative.  Who will bear the cost and will some users continue to receive gas at uneconomic prices?  Will the price increases start in 1994 or later? What effect will dearer gas have on industry and consequently on employment? Is it good economic sense to continue subsidising NET and ESB resulting in an urgent need for this expensive interconnector? BGE must come clean on the price per unit charged to all users.  A price publication system should be established, reporting average prices paid by various representative categories of industrial consumers.  It is regrettable that, in market terms, BGE made no effort to look for equity to finance the project and thereby to obtain an indication of the project's economic viability.</P>
    <P>The decision to proceed with the interconnector has clearly been made in the interest of securing a supply of natural gas in the long term given the projected exhaustion of the two fields currently operating at Kinsale and Ballycotton. Nevertheless, the fact remains that work on the interconnector is commencing quite early relative to the projected depletion of our present reserves which will have implications for the viability of the project in its crucial early years.  The Culliton report recommended that the option of private participation in the financing and operation of the pipeline be fully explored and the operation of the pipeline should offer maximum economic benefit to natural gas consumers in industry and elsewhere.  The report also stated &mdash; and I support the view &mdash; that some private funding could avoid and reduce the need for significant investment at a risk to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to make a special case for the supply of gas to the west of Ireland.  The gasline should be extended from Cork to Limerick to Galway and on to Sligo and the northern gasline could <Col N="1251" /> be extended from a point in County Antrim to Derry and Letterkenny and on to Sligo.  The west is already disadvantaged and it will be further disadvantaged in farming and industry if other parts of the country have access to cheaper energy sources than those available in the west.</P>

      <P>I compliment and congratulate Senator Burke on his maiden speech.  It was excellent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Burke on his maiden speech and welcome him to the House.  He is following in the footsteps of former Senators Staunton and Martin J. O'Toole and of other fine people from County Mayo.  I know he will be dedicated and hard working as they were and I look forward to working with him over the next four and a half years in the 19th Seanad.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy N. Treacy on his appointment as Minister of State.  All Senators agree that he is a great choice for the position.  His contributions, interest and commitment to Seanad Éireann have been appreciated and I was delighted to hear his contribution on this legislation.</P>
      <P>The legislation is basically a guarantee that when the Kinsale gas runs out there will be another source of gas available given the work done in bringing a gas supply to most parts of the country.  It is only reasonable to assume that the gas will not last forever and the chances of another find are highly unlikely.  Some 40 per cent of the total gas resources in the world are located in Russia and much of that remains untapped.  Gas resources available to us from other parts of Europe including Scotland and Russia will guarantee a supply for the next 50 years. Gas is environmentally friendly and cheap and it has become the most popular fuel used in new houses and industries.  I welcome this legislation and I am pleased that the EC is playing its part by providing 35 per cent of the cash required to put this £290 million project in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the news that the Department <Col N="1252" /> of Energy is, employing Irish firms where possible while ensuring that tenders are invited from our European partners so that everyone is given an equal opportunity.  We must bear in mind the specialised nature of this industry where specialised vessels are required for the placing of the pipeline.  We can only supply a certain amount of the expertise required for a job of this magnitude. I am delighted 180 jobs have been created and that £20 million has been invested in this project by Irish firms.</P>
    <P>Since the discovery of gas off the coast of Kinsale we have saved £2 billion on imported fuels.  This is a considerable sum of money, especially in times of recession.  Imported fuels only provide 17 per cent of the energy required in this country, however.  I am delighted that it is Bord Gáis intention to increase its supply of energy in Ireland to 30 per cent in the future.  Ireland's prospects are good if we can reduce our imports and increase our exports.  Future economic growth depends on low interest rates, low inflation and a balance of payments surplus.  The conditions now being created are favourable and enticing to exploration companies which will ensure greater interest on the part of companies in gas and oil exploration here.</P>
    <P>I recall the mineral find at Navan in 1970 which resulted in a considerable number of jobs.  Many families from areas such as Castlepollard and Delvin returned from Canada with expertise and contributed greately to the setting up of Tara Mines.  Additional finds of gas would be a tremendous bonus now that construction of the pipeline has commenced and the initial cost have been covered.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Senator Burke's contribution.  He mentioned the price the ESB and NET are paying for gas in contrast to public consumers.  The ESB are paying 17p per therm.  A number of industries are suffering as a result of high fuel costs.  We are seeking growth, both in employment and revenue, in the tourist industry and cheaper gas might be made available there also.</P>
    <P>Indoor tourist attractions which include <Col N="1253" /> galleries, museums and so on are finding it increasingly difficult to make profits. Despite financial constraints indoor tourist activities must be further developed.  However, high fuel costs are making progress difficult.  Perhaps the Minister for Energy and the Minister for Finance might address this in future financial legislation.  A conversion to gas would be worth considering if it would be charged at 17p per therm.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the gas pipeline could be extended to Tullamore, Mullingar and Longford, major midland towns striving to maintain industries.  Mullingar has not experienced any decentralisation because of its proximity to Dublin.  The extension of the gas grid to that town would reduce energy costs there.  I ask the Minister of State to examine this possibility.</P>
    <P>There is a train service to every major town in Ireland.  Is there a possibility that the gas pipeline could run alongside the train track?  It would not require the permission of landowners because the line is owned by another semi-State body and with one agreement many towns could be connected to this energy supply.  Many towns will be making representations to the Minister of State including those in his own constituency.  These towns would welcome a natural gas supply.  Perhaps some research might be carried out to see if this suggestion is feasible.</P>
    <P>The ESB provides a great service and I do not agree with Senator Burke's view on this matter.  It employs large numbers of people and takes the excess of fuel acquired by BGÉ.  The ESB is doing a good job, both for Bord Gáis and NET, by keeping down fuel costs.  These two great semi-State companies are working hand in hand.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis could become a major employer because gas is the energy supply of the future.  It is environmentally friendly and this industry will expand at a greater rate than we could possibly realise.  I look forward to the passage of all Stages of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I am <Col N="1254" /> always impressed by the enthusiasm and confidence that the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, brings to legislation he presents to the Seanad.  This Bill is a noncontroversial measure but some points require clarification which I am sure the Minister will provide in his response on Second Stage.  Senator Burke made a number of points in the course of an excellent maiden contribution.  He raised the question of a return on the investment and wondered why a cost benefit study had not been made public.  These are important questions as, in order to have a balanced discussion on a matter such as this, it is important that all relevant information be made available.  I am sure the Minister will explain the omission.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke expressed concern that there was no guarantee that the investment proposed would yield a profit.  That is a subjective issue and can be judged from different perspectives.  Nonetheless, it is a valid question and I await the Minister's response.  The Senator referred to the fact that NET receives its gas at about one fifth of the price that is charged to the ordinary consumer while the ESB receives its gas for about one third of the retail price.  Senator Cassidy also mentioned that matter when he asked for a similar concession for the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>I have never been satisfied with the application of selective subsidies to particular industries.  The payment of a subsidy to one type of industry and its non payment to another is unsatisfactory in the long term.  Senator Cassidy said that the benefit to the economy of the Kinsale gas field has been a saving of about £2 billion on the cost imported oil, coal and other materials for the generation of electricity. It could also be argued that a substantial part of that £2 billion has been an indirect subsidy to two major state companies, NET and the ESB.</P>
      <P>Senator Cassidy made a valid point when he suggested the use of railway lines as routes for gas pipelines to a number of our larger towns.  It is a worthwhile idea and should be considered by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are provisions in section 3 of <Col N="1255" /> the Bill which empower the Minister to attach conditions to the sale or transfer of part of this structure to other bodies. If the Minister has power to attach conditions, the observation of those conditions requires that the Minister have authority to impose sanctions if conditions are not met.  On Committee Stage I will question the capacity of the Minister to apply sanctions to ensure that conditions are observed should ownership of the structure pass to bodies that are outside the jurisdiction.  In the absence of information to the contrary, I am of the view that it would be impossible for the Minister to attach conditions or impose sanctions should ownership pass to companies or persons outside our jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I support the proposal to raise the borrowing capacity available to Bord Gáis as the company has been a success story since 1975.  I also welcome the establishment of the connector pipeline between the UK and the Republic.  I hope, as the Minister said, that in due course a pipeline across the Border will be installed.  The connector pipeline between the UK and the Republic is a further welcome step on the road to economic co-operation which we should support.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed us that the project is on target for completion and, unusally perhaps, has remained within its budget unlike some past projects involving State and semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>Although the connector between the UK and the Republic is a worthwhile development it also implies that the necessity to import gas will be a reality in a few years time.  Whether we import it from the UK, the EC, Norway or the North Sea fields it is implicit in this measure that we are preparing for that eventuality.  In the meantime should additional supplies of gas be discovered off the coast the connector will enable us to exploit that resource to the economic benefit of the nation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I am anxious that the questions raised by Senator Burke be addressed.  I am also anxious to <Col N="1256" /> have a more detailed discussion on the power of the Minister to attach conditions to the disposal of parts of the development.  I accept we can deal with these questions on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy, to the House and I am glad Senator Howard shares my belief that the Minister has brought a great deal of enthusiasm and energy to each portfolio he has held.</P>
      <P>I wish to begin my contribution by paying tribute to the people who bring the gas ashore, the workers on the Alpha and Bravo platforms in the Atlantic, off our coast.  It is a most difficult and dangerous task as we know from some of the disasters that have occurred in the North Sea.  It is fitting before I speak about the contents of the Bill itself that this House recognise the valuable role played by the workers on these platforms in ensuring the supply of this energy source of which we are all so proud.</P>
      <P>BGÉ is a very good example of a State company.  It is also a very good example of sound policy on the part of the Department of Energy.  The working relationship with BGÉ and the far-seeing policies of the Department of Energy have ensured that we benefited greatly from the discovery of gas and also that we plan for the distribution of gas throughout the country.  We are now looking towards the strategic objective of ensuring gas supplies for the foreseeable future.  The discovery of gas and the method by which Bord Gáis Éireann and the Department of Energy utilised it has changed the energy profile in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is probably forgotten that in 1984 the gas industry was in tremendous difficulty. The Cork gas company was essentially bankrupt and the Limerick, Waterford, Wexford and Dublin gas companies eventually wound up in receivership. There were also others of which I think Kilkenny was one.  There were substantial rumours in Cork at that time that Bord Gáis Éireann's headquarters would be moved from Cork to Dublin.  I was very glad that when Frank Cluskey resigned as Minister for Trade, my own <Col N="1257" /> party leader who was the then Tánaiste took over as Minister for Energy in the subsequent Cabinet reshuffle.  Not only did he stop speculation about the transfer of Bord Gáis Éireann's headquarters to Dublin from Cork but he also appointed a most competent Cork man, Pat Dineen, as chairman of the company.  I believe he played a significant part in the development of Bord Gáis Éireann.</P>
    <P>As I said, the gas industry was in a state of chaos in 1984 which it is easy to forget now.  It ran into trouble for various reasons including the oil crisis and the enormous increase in the cost of feed-stocks which made those companies completely unviable.  In many cases they were quite unsafe in their transmission of gas through the streets and we had experiences of that in Cork and Dublin. When Bord Gáis Éireann took over these facilities which in the case of Dublin gas cost over £50 million it contributed a great deal of expertise and knowledge. These facilities are now run locally and are extremely successful with a very high safety record.</P>
    <P>The work of these companies in providing consumer utilities should be recognised because prior to that the age profile of the gas customer was very high.  Many customers were old people who had no other method of cooking and in some cases no other method of heating.  The rescue and rehabilitation of those companies by BGÉ, in co-operation with the Department of Energy, was a model of how the State should act in certain situations and they should be congratulated.</P>
    <P>Among the developments which occurred during the 1980s was the building of the compressor station in east Cork, which cost £20 million, and the pipeline to Dundalk.  An important fact about the interconnector between this country and the UK is that the pipeline is on the Border to a large extent and can be fully utilised in the future, when security considerations allow the loop to be closed.  The sooner that happens the better.  I wish some of the &ldquo;patriots&rdquo; who persist in interfering, as they did with the ESB grid on the Border, would learn <Col N="1258" /> that it cost this nation many millions of pounds and that their &ldquo;patriotism&rdquo; stymies the growth of this country.</P>
    <P>The pipelines were put in place and we are now taking the next logical step because the gas in the Kinsale field is a finite resource.  Woe betide a country which does not have the foresight and the wisdom to look beyond that finite resource and to secure supplies from wherever they are available.  As the Minister stated, gas is available in Norway and Russia and it is safe to say that the future of gas in Ireland will be secured by the building of this interconnector. This was also mooted by Pat Dineen when he was chairman of Bord Gáis Éireann and to be quite frank, I think it should have been built sooner, because of increased building costs and so on.</P>
    <P>The Gas (Amendment) Bill 1993 has been carefully crafted.  It does not give <i>carte blanche</i> to Bord Gáis Éireann.  It is quite careful and in many cases quite conservative, in its approach.  As I stated earlier, the contributions made by the workers of BGÉ the workers on the platforms, people like Pat Dineen and Michael Conlon who is the present chairman of BGÉ &mdash; he would be familiar to you, chairman, as the former county manager of Cork &mdash; and the contributions made by Cork people to the development of BGÉ and the gas industry should be recognised.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the Bill. I think it is a necessary one and, as Senator Howard said, it is non-controversial. We may argue about the details but we can discuss them later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I welcome the Bill.  I would like to extend a particular welcome to the Minister of State of the Department of Energy, Deputy Noel Treacy, on what, I think, is his first visit to the new Seanad and to wish him well in his new, onerous and exciting duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interconnector project and the associated borrowing guarantee is fundamental to this debate.  As the Minister has said, it is a major project and is crucial to the future of the gas industry.  The Bill <Col N="1259" /> provides that borrowing guarantee for the construction and operation of the interconnector and it is welcome news that no Exchequer expenditure is required.</P>
    <P>Although Bord Gáis Éireann is operating very successfully it is dependent on a single pipeline and the interconnector will provide security of supply and remove that dependence on the present sole pipeline.  The point should be made that this pipeline will immediately provide value for money.  It will secure against interruptions and with the agreements which Bord Gáis Éireann has worked out with National Power in the UK, we can have access to additional gas supplies thorough the interconnector even at short notice.  The maintenance staff on the existing pipeline are doing a good job but it is true that any extended interruption of the existing pipeline could be very damaging to the company.  The interconnector will secure against that situation.</P>
    <P>Exploration is under way for additional gas finds, and some hope has been expressed in that regard.  If we are in the fortunate position of having a surplus, then we can export natural gas.  The Minister is actively monitoring and pursuing incentives for exploration and the technology is improving in this area.  It is a measure of the additional compression of technology that an extra two years supply has now been obtained from the Kinsale field.  This might not have been recovered otherwise.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies when it reported on BGE in 1985.  I wish to make a few points about the situation at the time, because it illustrates the progress of BGÉ since then.  For example, one of the recommendations made by that Joint Committee was to appoint a representative to the board of Dublin Gas and they are now an integral part of a national distribution network since their assets were purchased by Bord Gáis in 1987.  Another recommendation was that Bord Gáis, with its management <Col N="1260" /> expertise, should provide aid to weaker utilities around the country.  These have also been incorporated into the national network and, therefore, have the benefit of BGÉ's organisation on an integrated national basis.  Bord Gáis was transformed from a gas distributor with a small customer base to a large company with 195,000 customers and they supply 17 per cent of the primary demand for energy.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly highlighted in his speech that natural gas is clean.  It is also versatile, competitive, has saved us £2 billion on our import energy bill and has greatly decreased our dependence on imported oil.  The company is efficient and I would like to pay a tribute to the dynamic leadership of its chairman, Michael Conlon, his colleagues on the board, the management and all the staff who have contributed to its success.</P>
    <P>Natural gas is safe, efficient, and profitable, and clean.  Clean fuel is currently an environmentally sensitive subject and there is an EC directive limiting sulphur dioxide emissions to 124,000 tonnes per annum.  As I understand it, we have given an undertaking to support the Helsinki Protocol, which will reduce this limit initially to 82,000 tonnes per annum and eventually to 75,000 tonnes. To achieve this objective, using natural gas for power generation will be essential. In this case it will contribute, directly and necessarily, towards meeting our international obligations in reducing these emissions of sulphur dioxide.  The banning of the sale of smoke-producing fuels has helped to reduce the smog problem; so has the wider use of natural gas.</P>
    <P>I understand that Cork is experiencing a smog problem similar to that once experienced in Dublin.  Perhaps the Minister would consider extending this legislation throughout the Cork city area.</P>
    <P>In 1991, Bord Gáis Éireann made a profit of £54.9 million and £28 million of this went to the Exchequer.  Dividends to date have reached the sizeable sum of £300 million, and I want to repeat that no Exchequer funding is required.  In the absence of a suitable equity partner, the funding for the interconnector must come from the company's own resources and <Col N="1261" /> borrowings, which are underpinned to an extent by the guarantee included in the Bill.  Obviously, the design life of this interconnector is going to see many of us into the next world.  Senator Howard raised the question of Ministerial approval for those who may buy into the ownership of part or all of the pipeline.  I assume the Minister and his Department know that approval will be an essential requirement before a part or whole ownership could come from an outside source.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn briefly to the role of the European Community, and to emphasise that this interconnector was seen as an important link in the completion of the Internal Market negotiations. It provided the basis for getting grant aid amounting to 35 per cent of the approved cost and that is welcome.  The financial support is a tribute to the Government for the imagination shown in pursing this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that one of the objectives of the Internal Market should be third party access, but that the directive relating to this has not concluded yet.  We have a type of fluid situation at present.  For a fee, third parties can use the gas transmissions and distribution system to sell gas to their customers and this could have implications for Bord Gáis Éireann's future financial situation. May I point out that this might lead to the loss of premium business the creaming off of the most profitable business to competitors which would lead to a loss of profits.  In a worse case scenario, the shortfall might have to be met by the Exchequer.  The company has undergone considerable growth and success but there are vulnerabilities.  The price of natural gas is linked to the price of oil and oil prices are low at present.  Since oil prices fluctuate, so does the price of gas.  Because of the Kinsale gas field, both Bord Gáis and their consumers pay a lower price than in other countries but we may not always be in this position.  If we did not have the Kinsale gas field, Bord Gáis Éireann would be a loss making company now.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future, Bord Gáis are <Col N="1262" /> doing a good job and the interconnector we are talking about today will enhance its future.  The company has made considerable progress in controlling costs and achieving efficiency.  Since there is a sparse population outside the cities, there is an ongoing challenge to increase sales while, at the same time, controlling costs, particularly in a post-Kinsale situation, although I hope we will find other deposits off our coasts.  I support the Bill and wish it a speedy passage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I thank him for a most comprehensive and informative summary of the Bill.  I welcome the Bill which will produce very positive benefits at no cost to the Exchequer.  It is seldom that legislation can be proposed or discussed in this House or in the Dáil which does not have huge financial implications for the Exchequer and, ultimately for the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>The interconnector will allow for additional supplies, as the Minister said in his speech, and this is highly commendable. A large amount of money has been spent on the Kinsale and the Ballycotton gasfields but it would have been extremely shortsighted to have presumed those fields would supply our energy requirements forever more.</P>
      <P>This legislation will ensure continuity of supply, in addition to which we need to be sure we are getting value for money. The Minister stated that this project was costed beforehand and that EC consultants professed themselves satisfied to grant aid the project.  Preliminary costings indicate that it is on target and will be completed within its projected budget. The measures proposed in this Bill will ensure continuity of supply, value for money and will entail no additional cost to the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that gas is being used increasingly for electricity generation which is welcome since as the Minister said, the nuclear power option is unacceptable to the population of this island.  There are various options available to us for the generation of electricity. <Col N="1263" /> Gas is a particularly good one and I favour its use.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the choice of tenders for the interconnector, the laying of the pipeline and the onshore aspect of the project.  The Minister must abide by EC guidelines, in relation to tenders but it is worth mentioning that while we may not get the contract, or even the onshore part of it, there is a direct benefit to Ireland in that £20 million will be spent on Irish goods and services.</P>
    <P>We had a long debate in this House last week on Northern Ireland and on British-Irish relations in general.  This project is an example of co-operation between Britain and Ireland and if difficulties can be surmounted in projects such as this then I believe peace and stability on this island may be achieved gradually by means of economic co-operation between the two countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech mentioned that there will be a four man commission comprising representatives of each Government.  I am sure the Minister meant four persons.</P>

      <P>As a number of speakers have said it would be absolutely ridiculous to depend for our energy requirements on one source.  It is inadvisable to be either oil or coal.  Gas is a welcome addition to our energy resources.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers stated that Bord Gáis Éireann is a success story and that is good news.  The Minister highlighted the fact that in 1991 Bord Gáis Éireann returned a profit of over £54 million and surrendered £28 million in dividends to the Exchequer with a further £25 million in 1992.  So far this Bill is positive and receives my full support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aspect of gas supply I have been most involved with in my constituency is domestic use.  For the last two years I have lobbied Dublin Gas on behalf of my constituents for an extension of the gas grid to large areas of County Dublin.  I am <Col N="1264" /> pleased to say that Dublin Gas responded magnificently and any criticism made of the former gas company cannot be levelled at the current organisation.  Marketing promotions are carried out in estates and within weeks people have been signed up.  I signed for domestic conversion to gas recently making the change from LPG, an extremely expensive fuel but one of the few options available until recently to those who did not want to use bituminous coal or oil.  I thank the producers of LPG but I am glad to make the change over as are many of my constituents.  I regularly receive calls about conversion to gas &mdash; when one estate is connected other estates immediately want to be connected.  The terms offered by Bord Gáis are very competitive and they have various credit schemes also which are probably interest-free. I compliment Bord Gáis for operating successfully and efficiently in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why anybody would criticise Bord Gáis for selling large amounts of gas to NET or the ESB. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten me on that.  It seems eminently sensible to sell on an expensive product if there is insufficient domestic demand.  It would be utterly stupid for Bord Gáis to refuse to contract this energy to NET or the ESB.  Bord Gáis is behaving in a competitive and sensible way by making its excess gas available to other commercial users.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech referred to fuel dependency.  There are only two indigenous fuels in this country, peat and gas, and the peat market is limited.  The discovery of gas has opened up the energy market in a desirable way.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery referred to the fact that the discovery of gas has reduced our dependency on imported fuels by £2 billion. This is a substantial saving and I would like to see it channelled into further development.</P>
    <P>The environmental benefits of gas are evident.  Several years ago I found it difficult on occasion to drive into my estate at night because west county Dublin which contains large housing estates and <Col N="1265" /> some areas of north county Dublin were frequently enveloped in smoke.  This was due to the type of fuel then being used. The ban on the use of bituminous coal has alleviated much of the smog problem but unfortunately, alternative fossil fuels create their own problems.  I have had numerous complaints from people whose fire grates literally went on fire although those problems have now been sorted out.  The results of the changeover from burning bituminous fuel can be seen and felt by people who are asthmatic and have bronchial problems.</P>
    <P>The obvious reason for this Bill is that we may have a finite source of supply.  To have spent huge amounts of money laying pipes throughout the country and making the connections in various suburban estates, not to mention the ESB and NET who are users of the supply, and then to have sat back and hoped it would continue to pump out gas to meet our needs, would have been extremely bad management.</P>
    <P>We have had other debates in this House on crises in various industries where management was called into question. The reason for this legislation it would seem to me is that management has been extremely far seeing.  Management realises there is a chance this supply may not last as long as we hoped and it has looked around for alternative sources of the same fuel.  To ensure continuity of supply, the Minister has put before us not an Exchequer borrowing requirement but a system whereby the Exchequer would guaranteee loans while Bord Gáis Éireann would be responsible for the cost of the work.</P>
    <P>If we were to start building a road in, say, my own constituency in Blanchardstown, not knowing where it was going, and continued laying tar and cement in the hope of getting somewhere, we would all be accused of being extremely foolish.  This illustrates the problem of finite sources.  Bord Gáis Éireann knows it may run into difficulties, and rather than coming back when it is too late and saying the infrastructure has been provided at a very high cost and people's expectations cannot be <Col N="1266" /> realised, it is looking to the future to ensure there will be continuity of source and supply.</P>
    <P>I am worried that cost is not guaranteed. I know the cost to domestic users is extremely competitive and is one of the factors that many domestic users are changing over to gas.  I hope the Minister will watch costs closely and I would like an assurance on that.  Hopefully the large reserves in Russia and Norway, mentioned by the Minister, will act as a factor in keeping costs down.  I do not want my constituents coming back to me in three or four years time saying the cost of their gas has doubled or trebled.</P>
    <P>The Minister said we are committed to future exploration which will ensure that the cost of gas is kept at an affordable level.  We would be extremely negligent not to pass this Bill today allowing for continuity of supply.  The fact that the Bill does not involve the State in borrowing makes it welcome in my book.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledges that safety is a factor.  In north County Dublin there are understandable fears about landfill sites for the disposal of domestic waste. The Minister has given a commitment to ensure the safety of people living in Loughshinny and Ballough.  Large market garden areas in north County Dublin are already connected to the natural gas grid and this has contributed to economic growth.  I do not know of anybody who has felt at risk because of this pipeline.  I spent all my childhood in the inner city and everywhere you looked there were pipes being dug up yet we did not feel we were at risk and I am still alive to tell the tale.  I welcome the Minister's assurances on safety and security in Loughshinny and other areas.  I have no hesitation in welcoming this legislation and commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have two major problems with this Bill which raise questions of principle that go far beyond this legislation.  My first problem is with timing.  This Bill has come before the Oireachtas too late.  The project that gives rise to it &mdash; the building <Col N="1267" /> of the gas interconnector to the United Kingdom &mdash; is already fully committed. The work has already begun, so that Oireachtas is not being asked to approve this decision; it is being asked to rubber stamp it.  What we are being asked to approve is, in effect, retrospective legislation.</P>
    <P>There is a pattern to this which I recognised and observed long before I was elected to this House.  There seems to be a widespread acceptance of the notion that as long as the Oireachtas eventually approves it, it does not matter when that approval is given.  That is not so because timing is the essence of important decisions.  Such an approach shows no respect for the Legislature so I want to protect against it both in relation to this Bill and the general principle involved. If the Legislature is to be a scrutineer of the actions of Government, we have to get away from the practice of bouncing the legislators into making decisions and presenting it with one <i>fait accompli</i> after another.  It would not be so bad if this 11th hour approach was used only on matters of relatively little importance but it happens on matters of considerable importance which involves spending very large sums of money.  This Bill is a case in point.</P>
    <P>The second problem I have in relation to this legislation involves the amount of spending.  We are talking about increasing the asset base of Bord Gáis Éireann threefold, turning it from a company with assets well under £200 million to one with assets of approximately £0.5 billion.  That is a fundamental turning point for any company.  We are talking about more than doubling the borrowing powers of the company from £170 million at present to £350 million under this measure.  I do not know how other Senators look on a sum of money like that, but to me it is not chicken feed.</P>
    <P>I am continually surprised that very large sums of money seem to be treated with less than full respect.  It is a vast sum of money both in itself and as a proportion of the total indebtedness of Bord Gáis Éireann.  These are not the <Col N="1268" /> kind of borrowing powers to let through on the nod, even on the day of a world cup match.  We are talking &mdash; and this is where I have the biggest problem &mdash; about vastly increasing State guarantees for Bord Gáis Éireann borrowing.  This Bill asks the State to guarantee another £110 million borrowing, on top of the £80 million of State guarantees already in place.  It represents a massive increase of the order of 140 per cent.</P>
    <P>Let me state my position very clearly about State guarantees for the borrowings of commercial semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>I believe there should be no guarantees at all.  When the central Exchequer borrows on its own behalf then of course the State guarantee is right and proper. It is in effect a statement of what stands behind that borrowing.  When a commercial State company borrows the situation is totally different.  What should stand behind that borrowing is the commercial viability of the project for which the money is being borrowed.  If the project is commercially viable then it should not need a State guarantee.  If it is not then it should not be undertaken in the first place.</P>
    <P>Borrowing against the viability of a proposition is an important reality check and subjects a proposal to the scrutiny of people who are very hard headed about lending money.  They will only lend where they believe the project will repay by producing enough return to pay the annual interest and eventually the capital itself.  A State guarantee deprives us of that safeguard; the lender does not then have to worry about the viability of the project but will get their capital back at the appointed time.  However, if the project flops it is the State that will pick up the bill.  That makes it easy for the lender and easy also for the State company which wants to spend the money.</P>
    <P>This guarantee approach does not make it easy for the State and when we talk about the State we are talking about the nation's taxpayers.  It makes it very easy for the State company because they know that the State is a soft touch in this area and that State scrutiny, including <Col N="1269" /> that of this House, is far less probing than the scrutiny they would have to undergo in the absence of a State guarantee.</P>
    <P>The Minister, State companies and the Department of Finance will say that State guarantees allow the company to borrow money at a rate which is lower than the market rate.  We have heard that before and it is a very shortsighted way of looking at cost.  We pay a high price for the sake of a percentage point or two when we forego the discipline of submitting projects to independent commercial scrutiny.  The State takes on, often blindly, risks which turn out to be bad.  For my money &mdash; and we are dealing with taxpayers' money &mdash; I would prefer to pay a little more interest on a sound investment than pay a bargain basement price for a loan I could not get unless I took all the risks.</P>
    <P>This lazy State guarantee approach gives us the worst of both worlds.  On one hand we throw away the possibility of having the investment scrutinised by commercial criteria and on the other we scrutinise it ourselves with a touch that is lighter than a feather.</P>
    <P>The Minister reminded us of the need for confidentiality but some points require clarification.  Have we seen the details the commercial lender would demand to see?  Have we seen a cost benefit analysis of the project?  Have we seen revenue forecasts?  Have we seen forecasts of how much it will cost to repay these loans and a timetable for repaying them?  Have we seen a forecast of the impact these charges will have on Bord Gáis prices during the rest of this century and beyond it?  Have we seen a forecast of the impact these prices will have on the future overall demand for gas?  Have we heard the reason this project is being undertaken now rather than in three or five years time other than the obvious reason that there are European Structural Funds available for it?  These are just some of the questions to which a commercial lender would demand answers before putting money on the line and the questions which this House should also be asking.  I am asking them now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> Placing taxpayers' money on the line through the medium of State guarantees for commercial undertakings is thoroughly bad practice.  We should force State companies to face up to the commercial realities of the marketplace and if we did, our State sector would be healthier.  As it is, we are setting a series of time bombs ticking to be dealt with in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an t-Aire go dtí an Teach seo.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is very important that we develop an alternative energy resource so that if in years to come the Kinsale supply runs out, we will have an alternative supply and the work done on the main pipeline will not have been in vain.  It is also important that we do it at this time, when EC money is available, because otherwise the taxpayer might have to bear all of the cost.</P>
      <P>In the mid-1950s I started selling bottled gas which was new at the time and I have always found gas to be a clean efficient fuel.  The Minister referred to a five year project to offer a gas supply to customers in local authority and private estates which are not connected to the gas network at present.  Has he any intention &mdash; as he is a west of Ireland man himself &mdash; of including the west in the project?  We in the west and north west experience a handicap because for some reason no gas supply or pipeline has gone west; they are all concentrated in the eastern part of the country.  This puts the west in a more disadvantaged position when competing for business and industry because we have to continue to use oil or electricity.  It is important that this gas supply be extended to all of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know whether any work has been done at EC level to ensure that we get funding to extend the pipeline right across Ireland.  We have many industries in the west, and many uses for gas.  It is sad that the west is being ignored in this matter.  If gas were found off the west coast or anywhere else in the country it could be exported by means of this proposed interconnector.  That is why it <Col N="1271" /> is important to link the west to the gas pipeline.</P>
    <P>I see great opportunities and improvements for Ireland in this interconnector. The State guarantee means BGÉ is paying between 2 per cent and 3 per cent less interest.  On the amount of money being borrowed, that is a significant saving.  It is important that we give the State guarantees.  However, while the State is only giving a guarantee we should ensure the company does it work properly and is able to meet its commitments.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and I commend it to the House.  However, I would like to know if the Minister has any intention to extend the pipeline west of the Shannon because it is badly needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me thank all Senators for their interest in this Bill and for their contributions to his very important debate.  I appreciate the support given by Members of the House to this Bill.  It reflects their recognition of the importance of the Ireland/UK gas interconnector, to our security of supply and, indeed, to our overall future energy supply stategy.  The interconnector project is a major and exciting project and heralds a new era in Irish energy policy. A number of points have been raised during the course of the debates in this House and Dáil Éireann which I would like to address.</P>
      <P>With regard to the number of Irish people employed on the project, not all of the contractors on the project have been announced by BGÉ.  Those contracts which have been awarded to date have resulted in about 180 Irish jobs. There may well be more Irish jobs as other contracts are awarded later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This project is attracting substantial EC grant aid under the REGEN Initiative. It is important that BGÉ should comply with EC requirements such as those on public procurement.  For example, the BGÉ board took a commercial decision on the basis of cost to place the contract for coating the sub-sea <Col N="1272" /> pipe in Scotland.  Not to do so would almost certainly have been open to question by the EC, and it would have increased the project cost.  People will have to decide whether they want free competition and strict commercial criteria to apply to this and other projects. If they do require this free competition, they cannot also ask for large subsidies to be given to Irish firms to compete for work on any project against more competitive firms from abroad, many of whom employ Irish graduates and skilled Irish workers.  I assure the House a comprehensive feasibility study of the economics of this project was undertaken by our Department.</P>
    <P>This study was based on the cost estimates provided by internationally respected consultants.  This again was examined by the EC Commission and by their consultants in turn; so it was examined not once but twice at the highest levels.  The European Community, their consultants and the Commission professed themselves fully satisfied and then agreed to grant aid the project.  I am pleased that the bids received from the contractors on this project bore out the estimates used in the feasibility study and that it was decided to build in 1993.  The quotations received have confirmed that the BGÉ budget figure of £290 million for the project was not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>As far as the financial package is concerned, apart from the EC grant assistance, BGÉ will fund the project through borrowings.  That will result in additional borrowing of up to £200 million.  Details of these borrowings which are now being arranged are subject to commercial confidentiality between the Board of BGÉ and the financial institutions concerned. Senators will understand it would not be proper for me to go into such details here.</P>
    <P>The project is currently on target and within budget.  This is the ideal year to build this pipeline.  Prices have never been keener.  Competition for contracts has been intense.  There has been a very good record in the execution of gas infrastructural projects.  I can assure Senators <Col N="1273" /> that this project will be no exception and that costs are being tightly controlled.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this is an excellent project, both from an economic and a national point of view.  It is a strategic project.  It will provide gas supplies during the 50-year lifetime of the pipe. From the end of this year onwards, it will give us access to supplies in the event of any interruption to the flow of our own indigenous gas.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in my introductory speech that Bord Gáis had entered into a five year security gas agreement with National Power in the UK.  It has not yet negotiated a long term gas purchase contract for the interconnector. However, BGÉ is now back in the market for gas as is the ESB.  It is not possible to say what the cost of imported gas will be for BGÉ or the ESB, but it will be related to the market price in the UK which is, of course, higher than the price of Kinsale Head gas now.</P>
    <P>Senators should note that price is but one element albeit an important one in a gas supply contract.  I should explain that it is not the cost of gas alone which dictates the retail price of gas.  It is sold by utilities everywhere on the basis that it must compete with oil, i.e., with heavy fuel oil or with gas oil as the case may be.  BGÉ operates on the same principle, and sells its gas in competition with oil products.  The profits arising from its operations are subject to the right of the Minister for Transport, Energy and communications, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to take a dividend for the State.  This dividend, which has amounted to over £300 million to date, partly reflects the relatively low input price of Kinsale gas in comparison with international gas prices.</P>
    <P>In addition, BGÉ has been required to operate its business and to make its investment as if it paid import prices.  It has striven, with the encouragement of successive Ministers for Energy, to operate so as to ensure a viable gas industry will survive in the market place beyond Kinsale, based on import costs and on the same retail pricing principles, i.e., competition with oil products.  I assure <Col N="1274" /> this House that that principle will continue to serve as the basis of gas pricing and that domestic consumers will not face price hikes because gas is being imported via the interconnector pipeline.</P>
    <P>It will mean, however, that certain bulk users may face some increase.  Bord Gáis Éireann will still have to remain competitive with other energy sources. This will mean a tightening of the board's margins, improved efficiency and a big reduction in the amount of profit to be transferred to the Exchequer by way of dividend.</P>
    <P>As indigenous supplies run out we will no longer be able to count on the Kinsale dividend from Bord Gáis Éireann.  It would be unfair to blame the interconnector for this.  BGÉ's flow must inevitably reflect the expense of building this pipeline.  If future profits allow the extraction of dividends, that will remain an option.</P>
    <P>I assure Senators gas will remain an abundant source of fuel for generations to come.  I want to emphasise once again that Norway has over 60 years of reserves at current levels of production and Russia has 40 per cent of the world's known gas reserves, most of which is untapped. Some Senators rightly pointed out that there is a global trend to link networks and it is not impossible that before long we could be buying gas from as far afield as Siberia.  Gas will be available through the interconnector at open market prices.</P>
    <P>As regards private sector investment in the project, we would welcome an equity partner for Bord Gáis Éireann.  I recognise, however, this is a long term infrastructural project which, while it is strategically important to us, may not give the kind of short term payback which would make it attractive to many private sector investors.</P>
    <P>The pipeline will probably be operated by a stand alone subsidiary of Bord Gáis. It is intended that this will operate to provide a transparent and fair service for customers wishing to ship gas through the line.  Large users, such as the ESB, will be able to negotiate access to the pipeline to transport gas which they have purchased themselves.  Producers of gas will <Col N="1275" /> likewise be able to gain access for sales to large users or for exports.  This represents a significant incentive for gas exploration, offshore of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that the project could be postponed until about the year 2010 and that substantial savings in interest payments could be effected if BGÉ stopped supplying gas to the ESB and NET.  This is not a practical proposition under any circumstances.  Bord Gáis Éireann is contractually bound to take or pay for certain quantities of gas each year.  Even if it leaves the gas in the ground, it still must pay for it.  That is how gasfields are developed everywhere. Almost 70 per cent of all gas sold by BGÉ goes to the ESB and NET.  Quite simply, it would not make economic sense for BGÉ to keep in the ground 70 per cent of the gas for which it has to pay the producer every year.  The revenue shortfall would have to be made up by borrowings. Senators can imagine what the finances of the company would look like in a few years, if this were allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that every gas field has an optimal production profile which enables the producer to maximise the amount of gas which can be recovered. Leaving gas in the ground may mean that a proportion of it would be lost.  We also have to bear the operating costs of the field in its later years, which might well be higher than the revenue. Maintenance costs would also be very high on the platforms at that time.  In addition, a reduction in the potential market for gas here would be likely to have seriously detrimental effect on prospects for exploration in our offshore.</P>
    <P>Finally on this point, Bord Gáis Éireann has contracts with both the ESB and NET to supply them with gas.  Both companies rely on the gas supplied by BGÉ.  If Bord Gáis Éireann were to be ordered to renege on those contracts it would call into question the credibility of any contract entered into by the State or by State companies.</P>
    <P>As regards the price paid for gas by the two companies in question, the ESB has <Col N="1276" /> not been sheltered; it pays a market price for its gas which it puts to very good use. Irish Fertilizer Industries pay an energy related price for the gas it uses in fertiliser manufacture.  It buys that gas from NET. NET itself is, of course, an entirely different matter for consideration in the context of the Culliton report.</P>
    <P>I assume there may be some opposition to the increased use of gas but I would like to hear what are the realistic alternatives. We do not espouse the nuclear option in this country for good reasons. There are limits to the use of what are called black fossil fuels when we are concerned about both carbon-dioxide and global warming and sulphur dioxide pollution. We will, of course, continue to explore possibilities for renewable energy, but in the meantime we must cater for our immediate energy needs.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that gas is not suitable fuel for electricity generation.</P>
    <P>The modern combined cycle plant is highly efficient, combustion efficiencies of around 55 per cent are possible.  Gas is now recognised throughout the Community as the fuel of the future for power generation so much so that recently the EC Council saw fit to revoke an earlier directive restricting its use for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I want to reassure Senator Burke and Senator Howard that the ESB pays a market related price for its gas.  There is no subsidy, implicit or otherwise, in the use of supply of gas to the ESB.  The ESB pays about the same as other electricity utilities pay for gas elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The increased use of natural gas in the domestic sector is an important element in the improvement of air quality in our major urban areas.  Bord Gáis Éireann is currently engaged in a five year project, to offer a gas supply to customers in non-gas estates, both local authority and private, where this is commercially viable.</P>
    <P>In the gas supply area, natural gas is already the dominant fuel for industry and is the preferred fuel for most new housing estates.  The major future growth opportunities in gas sales, will be in the commercial sectors and in existing housing <Col N="1277" /> and these are now being targeted. Domestic prices are competitive with alternative fuels.</P>
    <P>On the question of global warming, Senators will be aware that the EC is committed to keeping CO² emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.  However, as a peripheral nation Ireland has to ensure that its economic growth is not hindered. Gas is the most benign of the fossil fuels with lower CO² emissions than any other such fuel.  It, therefore, figures prominently in our national strategy for CO² abatement to meet our EC commitment, while at the same time allowing our industrial growth to continue.  Gas is also important in helping us to meet our commitments in regard to reduction of CO² emissions.</P>
    <P>BGÉ is very conscious of its obligations in protecting the environment in north County Dublin and the archaeological heritage in the area.  In the past where sensitive sites were uncovered, BGÉ has funded archaeological studies.</P>
    <P>BGÉ will ensure that there is the very minimum possible disruption to local amenities during the construction of the landfall and onshore pipe.  A full reinstatement will be carried out and the shore station will be screened and landscaped to the greatest extent possible.  I can assure Senators in particular Senator McGennis that the boulder clay cliffs will be put back, as far as is technically possible, in their original configuration.  I understand there is a right of way along the clifftop and the public path there will be restored.</P>
    <P>BGÉ is taking pains to protect that land along the route of the pipeline and all topsoil, fencing, hedging, etc, will be replaced.  The level of compensation to local growers will reflect the value of any crop losses.  If landowners are not happy with what is an offer from BGÉ, they can, of course, have recourse to the arbitration process.</P>
    <P>I would like to give the strongest assurance that there is no extra risk to the people of Loughshinny, or north county Dublin generally, arising from the existence of the interconector in their midst. The pipeline has been designed and is <Col N="1278" /> being constructed to the highest international standards and cannot be operated until it has been certified in totality as being fit for operation.  When the pipeline is in operation a system of regular inspections will be put in place.  Adequate precautions are being taken to avoid the risk of accidents and a sophisticated system of isolation valves will be installed at both shore stations.</P>
    <P>We are very aware of the security issues relating to the pipeline both here and in Scotland.  There will be liaison between the Garda Síochána and the police force in the UK while the pipeline is in operation.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform Senators Cassidy and Howard that Bord Gáis Éireann has spent a lot of money removing gas pipes which were near sections of the Bray line for safety reasons at the request of CIE.  I understand that it is not good engineering practice to build gas lines near railways without special protection.</P>
    <P>The promotion of energy efficiency is a central plank in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  It is our policy to achieve a situation where we use as little energy per unit of gross domestic product as possible.  Combined heat and power is also a plank in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  We are beginning work on that aspect of the programme. Bord Gáis Éireann is actively pursuing possibilities for providing combined heat and power to large commercial users.  This offers favourable efficiencies and, therefore, a return on investment.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate Senator Quinn on his election to the House.  He raised a number of points about the project.  I know Senator Wright also has an interest in this project as it is located in his constituency.  This project is needed now because the Kinsale Head gas field will run out around the year 2000.  Perhaps it will last for some time beyond that but only until 2003 at the latest.  Demand for gas is growing.  The domestic market for gas is growing rapidly and thus cannot continue to depend on only one reserve and one line.</P>
    <P>Any failure or interruption would take <Col N="1279" /> six to eight weeks to fix.  This would be very costly and extremely dangerous.  We must have security of supply.  The pipeline is the cheapest form of security, regardless of the EC grant.  The alternative is to build a liquified natural gas storage facility at a cost of about £60 million.  That would only give 14 days supply and would not be value for money. Since we cannot depend on finding more gas offshore, the decision to build this pipeline now minimises our losses as we would have to build it sooner or later.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn mentioned state guarantees, borrowings, etc.  I was surprised that a man with his financial expertise and management ability appeared to be saying that there should be no guarantee of any kind.  I do not believe that would be prudent because no matter what one does, there is an element of risk.  If the Government sets up a semi-State company and does not show solidarity, support and confidence in it, then, when that company goes to the marketplace to borrow money for any project there will not be confidence in it as a company.</P>
    <P>What the Government is doing is very specific, namely, increasing the borrowing capacity of Bord Gáis Éireann to take account of its operations to date and of its major investment in this project, to a maximum of £350 million.  In this legislation the Government is asking Oireachtas Éireann to give that right to this successful, young semi-State company. However, despite allowing the board to operate with a maximum limit of £350 million on commercial criteria, the Government is restricting the State guarantee liability on this borrowing to £190 million.  This means that the State will only be exposed to a maximum of £190 million.  Therefore, it will not be exposed at any one time to the total borrowing capacity of the company which amounts to £350 million.  This means the difference between the State guarantee and the borrowing capacity ensures that the company must operate on the basis of commercial criteria.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1280" /> Once the State guarantee is there, the money is available from the European Investment Bank and from other major institutions, particularly the AIB, at a favourable rate.  If the State guarantee was not there, the company would have to borrow money in the marketplace where it would be exposed to the volatility of interest rates at any particular time.  This would increase the risks for the company and would make the cost of this project much greater.  This guarantee gives the company a competitive edge, it ensures that the project is viable and cost effective and it provides a major opportunity for this country to open another energy supply line to the international world.  We are opening a supply pipeline to the UK which will, in turn, be connected to the European grid.  Therefore, in the future we will be able to avail of gas supplies from Siberia and other places which we could not do if we did not have this project.</P>
    <P>This project also creates an incentive for exploration offshore.  We could invest in exploration and if we are fortunate enough to discover more gas &mdash; we hope we will because of the economic opportunities it would create for this country &mdash; the interconnector pipeline could be used to export surplus gas supplies to the United Kingdom and elsewhere.  There is a dual option here.  It is a major investment which creates many opportunities for our country.  It means we are not totally dependent on a limited energy supply.</P>
    <P>As far as we are concerned this is one of the most significant and important projects ever brought before the Oireachtas and I hope we will have unanimous support for it.  We should acknowledge the great work being done by Bord Gáis Éireann and the fact that it has been done according to strict commercial criteria with minimum State involvement.</P>
    <P>This is an engineering project by a commercial semi-State body and it is not usually a subject for legislation.  For example, Aer Lingus buys planes and the ESB builds power stations, but they do not need to tell the Government they are doing these things.  They make their own <Col N="1281" /> decisions.  Bord Gáis Éireann is asking for the legislative power to make this decision and the Government is asking for an endorsement of this legislation so that the company can proceed with the major new extension of its business.  Bord Gáis Éireann is building a supply link to the United Kingdom.  It is, as I have said already, providing access to an alternative supply of energy.  The only reasons for this legislation are to ensure that Bord Gáis Éireann has power to build and that the company can raise its borrowing powers to a maximum of £350 million.</P>
    <P>I hope this explains the situation in detail.  I look forward to the Committee Stage debate when I will be delighted to answer any further questions.</P>
    <P>I would like to restate the importance of this legislation and to acknowledge the valuable input in this debate by all Senators.  This helps to ensure that the legislation we pass is comprehensive and fulfils all legal and commercial criteria. We will then be in a position to make a contribution to the development of our country so that it can continue to compete and provide economic opportunities for the people.  We must ensure that any impediments or restrictions are eliminated or reduced so that economic and employment opportunities can be created which will allow our country to play a key role as a modern economic nation.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a <Col N="1282" /> point in relation to section 3.  I recall former Senator Murphy complaining that the explanatory memorandum often had the effect of confusing him as to what was in a Bill.  I will read the explanatory memorandum in regard to section 3.</P>
      <P>Section 3 amends section 8 (8) of the Gas Act, 1976 so that in addition to the conditions which the Minister could previously attach to his consent for a pipeline, he can now impose a condition in regard to transfer of an interest in a pipeline by Bord Gáis to another party and to any subsequent transfers.</P>
      <P>The explanation stops at that point. The greater part of this Bill deals with section 3 which ensures the protection of the people in relation to this pipeline. However, these assurances given are revoked in section 3 (8H) (c) which reads:</P>
      <P>Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection shall not apply where the contravention or failure to comply in question occurs outside the State or a designated area (within the meaning of the Continental Shelf Act, 1968) unless the person responsible for the contravention or failure to comply is an Irish citizen or a body established in the State by or under any enactment.</P>
      <P>It is important that security is built into this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An earlier part of section 3 refers to the construction of the pipeline as an area where consent would apply.  Once the construction is completed there is no great need for conditions because the construction is either satisfactory or unsatisfactory at that stage.  The presumption is that it is satisfactory once it is in operation.  Does the second point refer to the operation of the pipeline?  I do not think the third point which relates to the maintenance of the pipeline is all that important, but I accept it is desirable to include it.  However, I can visualise a situation in the years ahead where the ownership of the interconnector and pipeline between this island and the UK may be transferred to a person or body outside the State.  According to section <Col N="1283" /> 3 (8H)(c), we are powerless.  Will the Minister confirm if my interpretation of the situation is correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications: (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what Senator Howard means.  The purpose of this section is to ensure that the Government can impose penalties if somebody tampers with the pipeline.  Our laws can take effect only in our territory and we can impose conditions or penalties only on an Irish national who breaches the law in our territory or on a person or company who breaches the law in that territory. We cannot impose them elsewhere.  We have an agreement with the UK authorities that similar laws will operate in their territory.  They can impose their laws on anybody tampering with the pipeline or breaking the laws in relation to the conditions laid down in regard to the pipeline.  On the other hand, under the European Enforcement of Judgments Act, a decision taken in one member state would be binding in another member state.  We have a specific agreement with the UK authorities which covers the points the Senator has been making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response although he confined it to people who might interfere with the operation of the pipeline.  The penalty prescribed in section 3 relates to people who are in control of the pipeline.  It is the operators of the pipeline I am concerned about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to the three aspects in the section.  I am not too concerned about the construction of the pipeline and I consider the maintenance of the pipeline to be the lesser of the two problems. However, I am concerned about the actual operation of the pipeline.  If a series of transfers of ownership takes place it may well transfer the pipeline into the ownership of some person or company outside the jurisdiction of the State.  It is the responsibility of the Minister to ensure that the pipeline is operated <Col N="1284" /> in a satisfactory manner.  Should it not be operated in a satisfactory manner I think, from my reading of the legislation, that the Minister would not be in a position to impose sanctions on those who fail to operate the pipeline in a satisfactory manner.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to develop the point he was making that there is complementary legislation being provided in the UK.  Will he confirm that the European Convention in relation to the enactment of legislation in member states will have full application in the circumstances to which I refer?  Furthermore, will the Minister of State indicate whether the corresponding legislation is in place in the UK and, if not, when will it be in place?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be necessary to have corresponding legislation in the UK.  This section is a dual section.  It gives the right to the Minister or the Government to apply the laws of the country on all of our territory and on any citizen or any Irish company operating in that territory, who might break the law in any regard, no matter what aspect of the law we are talking about.  It also gives the same powers to impose the same sanctions and penalties on any Irish citizen or any Irish company or semi-State organisation no matter where they are operating in any part of the world.  We have control over them.</P>
      <P>The legislation we are putting through is for specific purposes, but the agreement we have reached with the United Kingdom deals with co-operation on the management of the scheme and the legal system under which it will operate.  We have reached agreement that the United Kingdom will be in a position to implement its own laws and have its own sanctions and penalties against anybody interfering with this international pipeline on their territory.  We are covered on both sides.  The normal laws of the State in this country apply as well as this specific legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is enabling legislation to give certain facilities and rights to Bord Gáis Éireann.  The normal laws of the United <Col N="1285" /> Kingdom are enforceable for anybody interfering with the facility which has been agreed between two sovereign Governments and which is being provided by an Irish semi-State organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The precise legal status is that an agreement has been reached between two sovereign Governments and between two semi-State companies in the territory of those sovereign Governments. This agreement gives the right to a semi-State company in Ireland &mdash; Bord Gáis Éireann &mdash; to construct an international pipeline interconnector between the territories of the two sovereign Governments.  In the United Kingdom a company called National Power is to supply gas through the interconnector pipeline to another sovereign government &mdash; Ireland &mdash; and which will be taken by Bord Gáis Éireann.  All the legalities of company law and criminal law, in fact all types of laws enacted by both States, are effective in both territories. Once the agreement is signed and agreed it is binding because it is an agreement between two sovereign Governments and two companies in the territories of the two Governments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the borrowing powers, I would like to ask the Minister of State if he is satisfied that he has sufficient funds under the £350 million to extend the gas pipeline to the western seaboard which includes a number of major cities and large county towns?  If the Minister of State does not have sufficient funds, would he consider including this in the Structural Funds for 1993 to 1997?  We are receiving £3 million <Col N="1286" /> a day and that money would be well spent in bringing the most disadvantaged area in the European Community into the 21st century with a natural gas pipeline.</P>
      <P>One of the major industries in the west of Ireland is a good tourist industry.  That industry will be disadvantaged and will not be on a an equal footing with the tourist industries in southern and eastern regions since we will not have a natural gas supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Burke has raised an interesting point.  My understanding from the Minister of State is that the increase in the borrowing capacity of Bord Gáis Éireann is to provide for the construction costs of the pipeline.  While the Minister of State told us that the construction costs are on target and within budget, the content of Senator Burke's query is that should there be further development and extension of the gas pipeline around the country will Bord Gáis have sufficient capacity in its new borrowing limits to facilitate that?  That matter would be of interest to Senator Cassidy as he expressed a strong interest in seeing the gas pipeline extended to certain towns in the midlands.  Senator Burke wants the pipeline to go further into the west.  It is a reasonable query. Will there be adequate financial capacity to undertake expansion once the pipeline is constructed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann is anxious to identify areas where it can supply gas to domestic consumers on a commercial basis.  It needs no encouragement from me in that regard. However, I must point out that it has a statutory duty to do this on a strictly commercial basis.  That means it can service only those areas where a reasonable return can be earned on the costly infrastructure that must be installed.  That usually means identifying sufficient customers who are suitably located so as to minimise the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The converse is that if they were to bring gas into a certain area with a small number of consumers, the cost per connection, the cost per house and the levy <Col N="1287" /> on them would be extremely high and it would not be viable from the point of view of the company or the consumer. Bord Gáis Éireann targeted many estates not using gas and will continue to do so. Where practical and feasible they will bring gas to those estates.</P>
    <P>With regard to the borrowing situation, I am satisfied from all available information and from studies carried out by the Department that the borrowing requirement being sanctioned for the company which will be permanent once this legislation is passed, should be pitched at £350 million.  That is a big increase for the company and it will take into account the cost of this job which is about £290 million.  It will also take into account the availability of a European grant and the fact that any delay in the drawing down of the grant would oblige the company to borrow beyond its normal requirement bringing borrowing to a figure in excess of £300 million.  In the light of the existing project and Bord Gáis Éireann's commitments, I am satisfied that once the job is complete and the European grant has been drawn down BGÉ will be in a position to avail of practical and viable opportunities to extend the gas supply to provincial towns and other areas of consumer demand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I quibble a little with the Minister in that natural gas belongs to the people of Ireland and I include the western sea board in the national territory. People are entitled to share the benefits of the gas.  The strict financial criteria outlined for Bord Gáis Éireann are not the same as those outlined for Aer Lingus.  For instance, the Shannon stop-over was designed as a regional facility.  However, if a Government decides to take action on a regional basis then perhaps the region should bear the costs.  CIE is another example in that some of its consumer services especially road transport are not economically viable but are socially desirable.  In the long term, it may be considered socially desirable and profitable to extend natural <Col N="1288" /> gas to parts of the country that would benefit from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with the social philosophy espoused today by Senator Magner, that does not necessarily mean I always agree with the social philosophy he espouses.  I agree that the deprived and disadvantaged people in the west should benefit from a natural asset and resource.  Taking into account the topography and demographics of the area and the fact that natural gas could be winding its way southwards along the western seaboard, I hope it may be available at a lower cost than if it were brought across from the capital city.  It might happen someday but we must not forget we have another indigenous resource peat.</P>
      <P>The Government is putting much emphasis on combined heat and power. I hope that research and analysis will enable the use of peat in a new form, a new option could be provided in a new service, particularly for the midlands and the western areas where there are vast amounts of peat.  I would see this in totality and the Department will take a broad look at the option.  Bord Gáis Éireann has strict commercial criteria and BGÉ has already contributed £300 million by way of direct payments to the Exchequer. Their discovery and utilisation of natural gas has saved the State £2 billion in fuel imports.  On this basis there is hope and if the options are maximised the west will benefit from the most feasible and practical option that becomes available over the next ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a simple query <Col N="1289" /> about the State guarantee.  Prior to this legislation, Bord Gáis Éireann's borrowing limit was £170 million, £90 million of which was guaranteed by the State. The new borrowing limit will be £350 million of which £190 million will be guaranteed by the State.  The difference between the borrowing limit and the State guarantee is a total of £160 million. I am sure Bord Gáis Éireann is satisfied that the guarantee is adequate but will the Minister explain why it is confident of its ability to borrow a total of £160 million which is not secured by the State guarantee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann is a commercial semi-State organisation operating under commercial criteria.  The modern demands of the State and the necessity to operate semi-State companies as commercial entities must be examined.  The State cannot always prop up semi-State companies when they are in serious difficulties and plough millions of taxpayers' money into bailing them out.  Bord Gáis Éireann's track record to date illustrates its commercial ability.  It has the use of a fine, popular energy resource and based on its commercial record it would seem prudent to ensure that while it operates with commercial criteria, its interests are protected and it achieves the status enjoyed by other semi-State companies.  If Bord Gáis Éireann achieves this status, rather than borrowing money domestically and raising the price of credit it will be in a position to seek international finance where resources are available and borrow with a State guarantee.  These borrowings can be utilised for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Ireland and Bord Gáis Éireann can still operate on commercial criteria.  We are satisfied looking at Bord Gáis Éireann's track record and the demarcation between the commercial borrowing requirement facility of £350 million and the State guarantee of £190 million that it is able to carry it and will prosper in the future.</P>

      <P>Cost benefit studies are not normally made available publicly. Such studies only become available through public inquiries and other matters. This cost benefit study was carried out by a commercial company who employed professional people to conduct the study and make the findings available to them.  The study was then sent to the European Commission who employed international consultants to appraise the study.  The consultants were of the unanimous view that this was a commercially viable project which would confer vast benefits on the people of the European Community, and more particularly on one member state.  In light of the study's findings the EC was prepared to give grant aid to the tune of £90 million for the project.  The confidentiality of the report must be respected but we also have to ensure that our Department is satisfied that it is a positive and practical report. It is financially attainable and suitable and has been endorsed by the European Commission and their consultants.  This endorsement is evidenced not just by the written document given but also by the financial commitment they have made. The fact that the project appraised by the report has received financial support proves that the report, is a solid and sound one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann, recognising that the fabric of primary education is an essential part of the national social infrastructure, and further recognising that intervention at primary level is essential to any successful strategy aimed at compensating for socio-economic underprivilege, declares that the Government should take all the necessary steps to ensure that European funding is made available to support and supplement the Government's <Col N="1292" /> commitments to primary education in the programme for Government and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>I am appalled that the Government has introduced an amendment to this motion. I went to a lot of trouble to formulate a motion that would meet the needs of all participants in the education system, that was uncontroversial and that would support the Minister's case at Cabinet for the funding of primary education.</P>
    <P>Every Member of the Oireachtas is lobbied daily about the problem of funding primary education.  A lack of remedial teachers, problems with school buildings and overcrowded classrooms are some of the issues raised.  Parents demanding the introduction of European languages and people criticise the use or neglect of Irish in primary education. Ours is the only European country which does not have an educational television service for primary education.</P>
    <P>I have examined those problems.  I have spent between two and five years calling for an amendment to the Treaty of Rome to include an education policy. The Maastricht Treaty, which amends the Treaty of Rome, includes an education policy for the first time.  It clearly provides for the discretionary power of national Governments to make decisions and Europe is required to &ldquo;support and supplement&rdquo; the programmes and policies of the national member states.</P>
    <P>To ensure that there was no difficulty with this motion I consulted the Programme for a Partnership Government and the Government's commitments under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  I did not put a critical word in the motion &mdash; indeed it supports the Governments programme &mdash; and I am outraged that the Minister should amend it.  It seems there is a lack of political commitment.  I did not seek structural funding but European funding. Having discussed this issue with a European Commissioner, with the head of the European Committee on Human Resources and with other people in Europe who are competent in this area, <Col N="1293" /> it was indicated to me that this was the correct strategy.  This is the first time that a European treaty refers to education but it has had no impact on education policy in Dublin or Brussels.  That is an appalling situation.</P>
    <P>I have submitted seven proposals to the Minister which could be supported by European funding.  I hear the Government's argument that there is no money in the kitty.  However, I cannot accept it that, when I suggest an alternative source of funding which I understand the Minister would support, she considers it unacceptable. Over the years the proposals I have put forward have been implemented in other countries with European funding. The Portuguese Government built hundreds of classrooms with money from the Structural Fund.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has received different reports on that in Brussels.  I have discussed it with two former European Commissioners and there is no doubt that money was used in Portugal for a schools building programme.  The funds were used &mdash; not training or anything else &mdash; at a time when we were told it could not be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister's budget to build primary schools is down to about £18 million this year.  In 1987 it was about £30 million and in the intervening years it was between £13 and £16 million.  The Minister's budget is reduced by £70 million and she is still expected to do the job.  It cannot be done.  She is not in a position to deal with substandard primary school accommodation on her budget and she has admitted that on several occasions.</P>
    <P>The infrastructure of this country is not just roads and telephones.  The latest ESRI publication, which discusses the European situation and is published this week, makes that precise point.  European funding is about unemployment. I would like the Minister to answer a question.  What chance has the child who leaves primary school without basic education &mdash; reading, writing and arithmetic skills &mdash; either to gain or create employment? I seriously considered just repeating that question over and over again for 20 minutes to impress on the collective <Col N="1294" /> psyche of Government that no strategy on unemployment will work until we have the flexibility of an educated work-force. If it is true that the child who drops out after primary school can neither gain nor create employment, it must be possible to invest in that area as the operation of European funding is, in part, to create a better social infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The question of literacy is critical to the success of programmes for cohesion, job creation, wealth creation or economic development.  It is an objective of the Programme for a Partnership Government to create employment and it is planned to have 500 extra remedial teachers at primary level between now and 1996.  I have discussed that with the Department and it is one of the policies that could benefit from European funding.</P>
    <P>Recently I met a chief education officer in one of the vocational education committees who previously spent some time establishing education on television for primary schools in an under-developed African country.  He came back to Ireland to take up a position in one of the northern counties and found that we still do not have such a service.  There has been an abrogation of responsibility in that area.  I do not care whether it is the fault of the Department of Education, or RTE or any other organisation.  As far as I am concerned, there can be a plague on all their houses.  Our children deserve the best and if it means providing European educational television by satellite, I want it.</P>
    <P>Article 126 of the Maastricht Treaty clearly states that we should develop systems to exchange information and experience. I want an information technology system which will link the schools across Europe.  The European Community commitment is contained in Article 126:</P>
    <P>The Community shall contribute to the development of quality education by encouraging co-operation between member states.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the following and if necessary by supporting and supplementing their action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> We have signed this Treaty, it has been accepted in a referendum and it is the policy of the Government.  All I am saying is this should be implemented.  We are entitled to look for European funding to implement what is in the Treaty.  For some reason this creates a political conflict for the Government.</P>
    <P>I am looking forward to an explanation for that.  I think somebody has been misled or there is a lack of political will on this issue.  I have asked for nothing more than what is either Government policy, what the Government has put its name to or what the people have asked for by referendum.  We have demanded this time and time again.  I have not gone outside Government policy, I have not gone beyond what the Minister sought.</P>
    <P>The report of the Committee on Culture, Youth and Education covers the area of education being dealt with in the European Parliament on 22 and 23 April 1993, and says what I am saying.  It states that we will not fulfil our commitments in the European Treaty simply by concentrating on the higher levels of education. This is in the report to the European Parliament which will be supported by every Irish MEP next month. This is what I asked of the Minister tonight but instead the Government put down an amendment.  I do not understand this.  I have tried to be supportive and I am outraged that, once again, primary education has been neglected.</P>
    <P>Low levels of education lead to students dropping out of the education system early, less participation and fewer and lower educational qualifications.  I want to again put before the House what has almost become a mantra for me: every study conducted in the area of education and unemployment comes up with the simple formula that education leads to qualification, qualification leads to employment and the more qualified the person is, the more likely they are to gain employment.  Education is the first step on that road.  Education begins at primary level and any strategy to deal with unemployment must begin with investment at primary level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1296" /> I am trying to do this in a way which does not cost the Government anything. It is a long time since a Private Members' motion was put forward in this House which neither criticised the Government nor sought extra money; I looked at several motions and I could not find one.  All it requires is a spark of political courage and will to do something for the half million pupils in Irish primary schools and for the 3,500 boards of education which are dealing with problems daily and feel abandoned and deserted on this issue.</P>
    <P>I want the record to be clear.  I want a Minister who is supportive of the best deal for primary education in a public, clear and committed way which gives us in the primary education sector a sense of hope, support and partnership, that we are trying to achieve the same thing. I appeal to the Minister to deal with this motion without a vote.  I ask her to speak to the motion, not to move the amendment and to let the motion stand.  That would mean we could approach the debate on European funding in a clear and open manner.</P>
    <P>In discussions on education in Brussels we have come up against a problem time after time: for 40 years we have interpreted vocational training in the widest way and tried to integrate it into the educational area.  There is great competence in Brussels in second and third level education but there is no expertise, competence or experience in primary education.  That greatly concerns me because I do not believe that people in Brussels are interested in primary education.</P>
    <P>There is a cultural problem of attitude towards education funding from Brussels: there is a belief in Dublin and in Brussels that things should be left as they are.  Later I will be replying to the points made in this debate.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister why we cannot approach this issue as partners.  I am trying to achieve the implementation of the Programme for a Partnership Government, I am trying to implement the part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which contains a <Col N="1297" /> commitment from Government to either replace or replenish sub-standard school buildings by 1997.  This is an issue we should tackle together.</P>

There is money available, which is desperately needed in this country and it astonishes me that we should not attempt to attract this money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a neutralising amendment. Does this mean that the Government does not intend to aggressively pursue the issue of European funding?  If so, I think it is lamentable.  There are a number of areas where such money is very badly needed, for example, the literacy programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is the kind of country which it is envisaged should benefit from European Structural Funds.  Community action through the Structural Funds, the European Investment Bank and other existing financial instruments are supposed to support the achievement of the general objectives set out in Articles 130a and 130c of the Treaty by contributing to a number of priority objectives which includes promoting the development and structural adjustments of the regions whose development is lagging behind. Development in this area in Ireland is <Col N="1298" /> lagging behind and I hope to demonstrate that effectively.  The whole country of Ireland has been designated such a region.  Article 130a of the Maastricht Treaty states:</P>
    <P>In order to promote its overall harmonious development the Community shall develop and pursue its actions leading to the strengthening of its economic and social cohesion.  In particular the Community shall aim at reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions including rural areas.</P>
    <P>Article 130b states:</P>
    <P>The Community shall support the achievement of these objectives by the action it takes through the Structural Funds &mdash; the EAGGF, ESF and European Regional Development Fund &mdash; the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments.</P>
    <P>Why do we hesitate before invoking this Article?  The European Parliament has a long tradition of urging the member states to take this kind of appropriate action.  In 1982, the Parliament adopted a resolution on measures to combat illiteracy; in 1989, the Parliament adopted a resolution in illiteracy and adequate education for children whose parents have no fixed abode; in June 1984, the Council devoted part of its discussions to the problem of illiteracy in member states and adopted conclusions concerning both the measures to be taken by the member states in the context of their own education systems and the complementary measures to be taken by the European Commission to support the efforts of the member states.</P>
    <P>In addition, a network of pilot projects was launched in September 1988 to combat illiteracy.  Belgium, Spain, France, Greece and Portugal each development two projects; Ireland did not participate.  Yet we have a problem of illiteracy in our schools which is not being satisfactory addressed because of the lack of remedial teachers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" /> If we are seriously interested in the welfare of our children, we should recognise the fact that there is no point, having pious aspirations about third level education if children are not given the basic building bricks at primary level to enable them to participate in further education. I want to make it clear that I am not arguing against funding for third level education.  I am not cutting off my nose to spite my face.</P>
    <P>Successful literacy programmes, such as the New Zealand project where they intervene at four, five and six years of age, demonstrate that it is cheaper and more efficient to intervene at that age rather than at nine to 12 years of age, when it would cost four to five times as much.  There is a good reason for this kind of intervention.  I spoke with a former student of mine who is now a distinguished practitioner in the educational field and who told me that there are five schools in Ballymun and Glasnevin and none has a remedial teacher.  It is probably much worse in the rest of the country; one could go for a day's march without finding a school with a remedial teacher.  I know this concern is close to the Minister's heart and I would like her to know, despite the repetitiveness and vehemence of my utterance that I am not targeting my remarks directly at her; I recognise she is trying to settle into her job.  I am trying to structure an effective argument to demonstrate that the necessary money is here, the EC has urged us to take it up and there are practical reasons for doing so economically, culturally, and educationally.</P>
    <P>There are funds available which could be attracted for the building of schools. Often there is a crying need for education, but buildings are unsatisfactory or non-existent.  I saw in the paper recently a sad picture of some pupils in what was once St. Mary's Church of Ireland School in Crumlin, which has become host to a multi-denominational school project. They were standing beside their school, a ruined shell of a building and there is apparently no money to provide a school&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps I am raising a hare, but in these situations, EC Structural Funding would be useful.  I know of a school with 278 pupils which has no sports facilities except for a public playing field across a dual carriageway.  Nowadays, we place higher value on physical education and sport than heretofore and there is a good case to be made for attracting EC Structural Funds to develop these facilities.</P>
      <P>The physical condition of many school buildings is also a problem.  I know this is not the Minister's fault; it has been so for successive Ministers for Education for a long time.  I have heard the Minister say that proportionately more money will be made available to disadvantaged areas.  This is a good thing, but it is only a drop in the ocean, compared to the kind of money that could be attracted under the European funding system.</P>
      <P>When I tried to get European Structural Funding for other projects I was faced with the question of quota and non quota allocations on one hand and on the other, a requirement for matching funding.  I hope, in a kind of false economy, we do not think we cannot afford to match this funding.  Apart from anything else this money will break down into the economy.  It is not satisfactory in 1993, to have children in school buildings without proper sanitation and which breach building safety and hygiene regulations. The Minister could do something about this.  We could also get European money for teaching foreign languages at primary level.  If we are going to be good Europeans, why not start early and acclimatise people to a foreign language? I draw the Minister's attention to the motion tabled in the European Parliament in 1992 on the subject of illiteracy. I am sure the Minister has access to it, so I will not attempt to speed read it as I have compassion for those compiling the official record.  The report states for example:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Parliament respects <Col N="1301" /> the responsibility of the Member States for the content of teaching and the organisation of education systems, and accepts that the Treaty on European Union stipulates that the Community shall contribute to the development of quality education.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;welcomes the commitment to education in the Programme for a Partnership Government and notes the substantial steps already taken in the 1993 budget with particular reference to assisting the disadvantaged. Seanad Éireann particularly welcomes the policy of the Minister and Government to continue their support for education using all possible means.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
      <P>I do not see how anybody could have difficulty supporting these sentiments. Because of the limited time available I propose to confine myself to primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of welcoming the Minister's and the Government's continued support for primary education, the amendment proposes and I quote: &ldquo;using all possible means&rdquo;.  I hope the &ldquo;possible means&rdquo; include taking the steps necessary to ensure that European funding will be secured to provide essential additional resources for primary education.  I fully <Col N="1302" /> agree with Senator O'Toole about the importance of intervention at primary level.  I welcome the progress that has been made in recent years in dealing with schools in disadvantaged areas.  I support the budget allocation for this but more money is needed.  Primary education is seriously underfunded, and substantial allocations are urgently required over the next few years.  I recognise that it is unlikely that resources of this order will be available from the Exchequer in the immediate future.  Every possible effort should be made to secure European funding, so that the maximum impact could be made on a number of key priority areas of primary education.</P>
    <P>It is not difficult to identify the main areas for which additional resources are urgently required.  The special provision for schools in disadvantaged areas falls short of what is required to level the playing pitch for the socio-econmically deprived.  Remedial education also needs a major infusion of resources.  At present, there are approximately 950 remedial teachers serving approximately 1,400 schools.  This means that approximately 2,000 primary schools have no remedial service.  We must do everything possible to hasten the day when every child with a learning difficulty will have access to a remedial teacher.  Any progress made towards that is welcome but needs to be speeded up.</P>
    <P>The policy of integrating children with special needs or disabilities into ordinary national schools needs to be supported by adequate resources.  All over the country children with disabilities are enrolled in national schools in which teachers have little or no back-up in the area of speech therapy, psychological and psychiatric services.  If this policy of integration is to succeed, it cannot be allowed to continue on a haphazard basis.  Each child's individual needs should be examined prior to enrolment and provision made to meet them.  Provision might involve modifications to the school buildings, the appointment of ancillary staff, or arranging back-up support from professionals such as psychologists or speech therapists. The progress of children with <Col N="1303" /> special needs should be monitored and reviewed on a regular basis.  This regular monitoring is necessary to ensure that the school continues to be the most suitable place to cater for the child's needs.</P>
    <P>There is also a pressing need at primary level for a comprehensive programme of in-service education.  This has major resource implications but European Community funding should be available for it.  Teachers, like all other professionals, need to update their skills on a regular basis and those teachers who wish to undergo in-service training should be facilitated and encouraged.  If a proper programme of in-service education is to be put in place, it is essential that full substitute cover by trained personnel be provided for teachers on courses.  Travelling expenses and course and examination fees should also be recoupable to participants.  Irish teachers are the only group of the 3.8 million teachers in the European Community who have to pay for their ongoing training and professional development.  There is also a great need to provide appropriate courses to enable teachers to acquire qualifications in specialist areas, such as remedial teaching or special education. Allowance should be paid to teachers in respect of additional qualifications secured through such courses.</P>
    <P>The level of capitation grants paid to boards of management of primary schools is another area of substantial under-funding.  At present the annual capitation grant is £28 per pupil.  I welcome the Minister's recent announcement that she proposes to increase this figure to £33 per pupil.  However, this falls far short of the £80 per pupil which is recommended in the respect of the Primary Education Review Body; it is only approximately one-quarter of the capitation grant paid in respect of secondary school pupils.  Even at the level of £33 per pupil the majority of boards of management will not be able to meet the ever increasing costs of heating, lighting, cleaning, maintenance and insurance.</P>
    <P>Only boards in areas where continuous <Col N="1304" /> fund raising can be undertaken will be able to meet these costs.  It is only such schools which will also be able to meet their equipment needs and acquire such essential items as computers, audiovisual aids and remedial teaching equipment.</P>
    <P>I could go on to other matters, such as the sub-standard conditions of many primary school buildings, the provision for the education of travellers and the home-school liaison scheme, but time does not permit.  Before concluding, however, I would like to refer to the commitment in relation to the pupil-teacher ratio contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government. The commitment to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level to 22:1 by September 1996 will be widely and warmly welcomed.  I welcome it.  I also want to make it clear that I am satisfied that the Minister will spare no effort in securing the maximum funding for the other areas to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other Senators in welcoming the Minister to the House.  This is the first occasion I have had an opportunity to listen to her in this House and I hope it will be a rewarding experience for all of us.  The Minister has a very difficult task and needs support from everyone to achieve the targets she has set herself.</P>
      <P>I share Senator O'Toole's frustration with the poor quality of infrastructure in primary education and the poor service generally.  The standards we have achieved are extremely low.  I am sure every Member of this House can drive to schools in their constituencies which were built in the last century, have prefabricated classrooms in the school yard, no space for pupils to play and no playing pitches.  Such schools are more in keeping with the last century but are very much a reality in Ireland today.  However, a very high level of resources is required to deal with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government contains aspirations to deal <Col N="1305" /> with some of these problems.  However, because of the way the Government is functioning and the lack of confidence in the economy, they will remain aspirations.</P>
    <P>This motion is timely and deserves our support.  I congratulate Senator O'Toole and the other Senators for putting down this motion and giving us an opportunity to speak on it.  Statistics would lead one to believe that the Irish education system is excellent, that we are achieving high standards and that we compare favourably with more developed OECD countries.  However, these statistics do not reflect the poor standards of which we cannot be proud.  For example, many of our classrooms are overcrowded, no matter what we say about the pupil-teacher ratio.  Every day there are 38 students in many of our classrooms. Students have to spend a day in classrooms that are too small, the schools have no playgrounds, and their educational experience is poor.</P>
    <P>What is more worrying is that in every group of 38 students, four or five on average have learning difficulties.  Statistics show that about 10 per cent of students have learning difficulties.  Some may have difficulty with reading and writing, others may not be able to relate to numerical work and others would have difficulties with both disciplines.</P>
    <P>We can imagine the difficulties the students face when there is no special assistance available to them.  They go to school every morning and they are facing a miserable day.  If they are in large classes, teachers do not have time to give them the assistance they need.  There is no remedial service for thousands of these students.  Later in life they end up in a kind of twilight zone.  They cannot find employment; with the present high number of people unemployed they are the last to get work.  These people live very dissatisfied lives.</P>
    <P>Their educational experience could be described as a &ldquo;murder machine&rdquo;, because of their disability and the lack of attention they get, they are unable to enjoy education.  What should be a happy and carefree experience in childhood <Col N="1306" /> becomes a horrible and miserable existence for them.  Many of us whose background is in education know that this is the case.  We cannot be proud of what is happening and it must be remedied.</P>
    <P>There are possibilities that we may be able to attack this problem soon.  The Government should admit that we do not have the resources necessary to resolve these problems immediately.  We should take heart from the fact that European Union will soon be a reality.  The Articles in the Maastricht Treaty to which Senator O'Toole referred are clear and specific; the Union is committed to deepening the solidarity between peoples in Europe, it is committed to promoting economic and social progress and it is specifically stated in Article 3 that it is committed to making a contribution to education and training. This is detailed in Articles 126 and 127. There are loopholes to be exploited.  The Minister should accept the situation as it is on the ground and the Government should make a wholehearted effort to fully exploit the loopholes in those Articles.</P>
    <P>The Government should not try to hide the face that while some of our economic indicators are good, our rate of inflation is quite low and our Exchequer Borrowing Requirement is in harmony with the Union parameters, 25 per cent of our people are unable to find work.  That is a damning statistic.  The difficulty is that disadvantaged people find themselves in that group and are unable to cope or compete.  They are always on the edge of society.  They are in a kind of twilight zone.  The Government must recognise that in the short term it cannot deal with this problem.  It needs outside intervention and assistance and this must be explained to our European partners.  The Government has a huge problem on its hands and it needs assistance.  I am sure if the Government negotiate very actively that kind of assistance will become available.</P>
    <P>We must resolve to change some of the ground rules under which we work. Perhaps we have to redefine the meaning of work as we understand it and perhaps we have to see those who are unemployed <Col N="1307" /> as a massive resource that could be used if the ground rules were changed.  Senator O'Toole might not be too anxious to listen to what I am saying and might not be too happy with it.  There are many people on the live register today who are drawing the dole and who are highly qualified, with the leaving certificate or third level education.  If the ground rules were changed those people could be integrated into the education system and then could use their skills to assist teachers in large classes and to make the education system more relevant.  Taking this option would entail some generosity from trade unions and would take some courage by Government to achieve but in the times in which we live we should be examining such suggestions.</P>
    <P>The tyranny which takes place in the school yard is of concern to many people these days.  I suggest to the Minister that the school bus is a spawning ground for bullies.  Up to 90 students are pushed onto a bus each morning without adult supervision and when they arrive in school they are not the same people who left their houses that morning.  Peer group pressure and the fact that there is a huge number herded onto one bus means that the pupils are much more unruly and more difficult to handle in the classroom than they would be if there was adult supervision in the bus.  I suggest to the Minister that she should make it a prioriy to take a couple of thousand people off the dole and have adult supervision on those buses.  It would improve the eduction system and make life easier for teachers.  It would be very valuable and I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government, and in particular the Labour Party, is committed to the view that education is the key to future prosperity and to equal opportunities for all <Col N="1308" /> our citizens.  On this basis I second the amendment.</P>
    <P>This drive towards equality is reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government which, I remind Senators, is a vast improvement on the promises made in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  First, there is an overall budget increase from £16.5 million in 1992 to £19.5 million in 1993.  The pupil-teacher ratio is moving towards 22:1 and 80 extra remedial teachers and 25 extra school-home liaison officers have been sanctioned.  The focus will be on disadvantaged areas and towards disadvantaged children in schools.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that the earlier problems are tackled the better. More and more teachers have to cope in the classroom with the result of social and economic deprivation.  It can often be frustrating for teachers to see a happy four year turn over the years into a sullen, resentful 14-year old.  These problems can be best solved not by blanket measures but by tackling individual pupils problems in individual schools.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to solving these problems by directing financial assistance towards the areas where it is most needed.  There is a recognition that groups such as travellers have special requirements and that school-home liaision officers are best utilised to bridge that gap between school and home.  I have no doubt the Minister will use every opportunity to seek funds from every possible source to use in solving these problems.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole's motion confines funding to European sources but there are other funds that can also be sought and used for education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <P>I will when I have finished my speech.

If we raise the general standard of living we start to tackle some <Col N="1309" /> of the problems inherent in our society that make for inequality.  The two cannot be separated.  All things are interconnected and by using funds from one area to increase living standards the funding available for education, will automatically be increased.</P>
      <P>I am surprised all of the speakers so far have defined education in such narrow terms.  Senator O'Toole spoke about education strictly in terms of schooling.  I remind him that education is not confined to schools and that, according to the Constitution, parents are the natural educators of their children.  We must not talk about education in a &ldquo;nine to three&rdquo; context and we must realise that every waking moment of a child's life holds a potential for education.</P>

      <P>The motion is about education and funding for education, if education is defined in its broadest terms it is bringing out everybody's full potential. One is not confining oneself to the &ldquo;nine to five&rdquo; role of schooling.  Education does not start at primary school or at four years of age; it starts from the moment a child is born.  The role of parents in education is vastly underrated; we should examined their role.  Anything we can do to improve the level of education of parents and the interest of parents in their children's education will lead to better educated children.  At the moment money is available from EC sources for training programmes for adults particularly second chance education for mothers.  If you educate the mother you go along way towards educating the children, and EC programmes, such as NOW, which assist women's groups go a long way towards helping children.  Funding is also available for creches and play-groups in disadvantaged areas to ensure that some children will start with some of <Col N="1310" /> the necessary tools for advancing their formal education.</P>
      <P>Many teachers &mdash; and I am sure Senator O'Toole is as aware of this as I am &mdash; complain that children come into school at four or five years of age unable to hold a pencil or open a book, hardly able to tie their laces or button their coats.  Believe it or not, it is as important to a child's development to know these things before they go to school as to know their ABC or be able to count.</P>

      <P>If we take education in its broadest terms we should be looking at all aspects of education, and if that means pre-school education, then so be it.  While we recognise that formal schooling does attempt to compensate for socio-economic underprivilige it cannot be seen as the only method of doing so.  The burden of ensuring that change takes place in our society should not rest solely on the shoulders of teachers and educators.  It is a burden that must be shared by all. Therefore, every opportunity and every source of funding, whether it is from the EC, the national lottery or the International Fund for Ireland should be used to tackle the problems of education in its broadest definition.</P>

If current conditions prevail in national schools, many students will not have happy memories of those years.  Regrettably, there are many problems for the 500,000 students in our national schools as well as for the 3,500 boards of management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am speaking here as a teacher and parent rather than a Senator.  I strongly endorse this motion because it is obvious that we do not have sufficient resources <Col N="1311" /> for our national schools, and we need this money.  It is a misnomer to say that we have a free education system because every day students need money for this and that.  I fear that if the Green Paper on education becomes a White Paper on education and becomes law, school boards of management will become fund raising agencies.  It would be sad if these boards had to knock on doors to get funds to bolster the primary sector.</P>
    <P>The present pupil-teacher ratio is unacceptably high, and despite ongoing discussions, very few improvements are being implemented.  Accordingly this is making work harder for teachers, particularly in city schools, and this is leading to many sick days, with teachers looking for early retirement and the burned out syndrome becoming the norm.  In this area funding is a vital necessity.  Funding is vital to provide remedial teachers; 2,000 national schools do not have remedial teachers.  This is totally unacceptable in 1993.  Finance and funding are also very important if we are to provide psychological services.  This must be updated because the health board are doing a lot of the work of the Department of Education.  We have clincial psychologists, not educational psychologist who are badly needed in many schools.</P>
    <P>When it comes to in-service training teachers are given a day off now and then but to provide proper in-service training they should be given leave of absence for a month, or even a year, and money should be made available to pay substitute teachers.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to elaborate on the conditions of some of our national schools except to say it is sad that many children attend schools which are not adequately equipped.  A school in County Galway &mdash; Kinvara national school &mdash; hit the headlines for the wrong reasons, as one of the worst buildings in the national school system.</P>
    <P>Finance must be available to provide a proper school transport service.  Many people living in the country with a house <Col N="1312" /> on a half acre site, have lost their jobs. This is becoming the norm in County Galway with the closure of factories and other businesses.  Since these people are living long distances from schools and have to pay for school transport, they will become disadvantaged and will be the new poor of the national school system. I deplore the fact that national schools are being asked to buy a television licence and I hope the Minister will rescind this order.</P>
    <P>It is important that Euro funding is provided for our secondary schools.  We have EC money for the regional technical colleges, universities, VTOS courses and apprenticeship courses which are important. A comparison can be made between roads and education.  We have money for national and secondary roads but not for county roads; national schools can be classified with county roads and they too, under-funded.</P>

      <P>The Irish Vocational Education Association's response to the Green Paper is one of the finest I have seen. Regarding the Constitution, it states on page 22:</P>
      <P>Bunreacht na hÉireann enshrines important provisions concerning the right of the child to an education and the right of the parents as a primary educator of the child, in Article 42.  It is incomprehensible that there is no legislation covering these schools or the rights of children and their parents.</P>
      <P>Obviously, something drastic must be done to the primary school system in the near future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber and I wish her every success in her new portfolio.  I have not prepared a script because I am going to speak from the heart this evening.  I am a career guidance teacher by profession so I will concentrate on the lack of psychological services or input in primary and secondary education.</P>
      <P>We are talking about education for a changing world and changes for the future.  There is huge unemployment.  I acknowledge there has been substantial increase in the 1993 budget for areas of education but money is short in the areas I know best.  I refer to students who have major discipline problems, who have no support systems, who cannot find any psychological service when things go wrong.</P>
      <P>Schools are working in isolation.  There is no support for the parents.  The school is the centre of the community and teachers are regarded as the key people when anything goes wrong in the community. We are talking about disadvantaged areas.  There is no one to help those children who cannot be contained in the primary and second level schools and there are no places for them.  The Minister should know there is no &ldquo;Slot 2&rdquo; for them.  We have not given enough thought to what should be done with this type of student.  We have to care for them.  We have introduced the home-school links and there is a back-up service for children, with the school attendance officer and the junior liaison officer.  This small support system, works quite well in some schools but in the area where I work, north of the Liffey, I have to move from one school to the other and create a link between the primary school and the second level school.  There is a huge gap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nobody to help the remedial student who moves from one area to another. When I test those young people I have no place to put them.  I cannot take them in myself if they have a reading age below seven, because I do not have an educational programme designed for them.  I look around for a place to put them and it is impossible to find a &ldquo;Slot <Col N="1314" /> 2&rdquo; for them.  It is something I would like the Minister to look at carefully if we are to treat all our children equally in education.</P>
    <P>We know education is the key to success and to the future for all young people.  We also know it is the key for those receiving &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; education so that they can help their own children in their education.  I am isolating to two points, the lack of psychological services in the primary school and second level schools, and the lack of guidance counselling in the second level schools.</P>
    <P>It is a step forward that the Minister has increased the ratio of guidance counsellors to pupils by 0.25 of a teacher &mdash; but it makes no impact in the areas of huge unemployment where there are such problems that it is impossible for one guidance counsellor to deal with over 300 students in a second level school.</P>
    <P>In a primary school, there is no service whatsoever.  When one rings the Department of Education looking for psychological back-up it is not available and by the time it comes it is often too late.  This concerns me.  I am speaking about this area because I am at present trying to find a school for a student who has a reading age below six.  The child cannot be coped with in my school and there is no other place around.  Such children cannot be contained in the primary school because of the discipline problem and the background of the case.  I know we are making strides; I am not knocking that, I am being devil's advocate here tonight.  Disadvantaged students are being deprived of the necessary psychologically services and we have to look at that problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and her officials.  I hope she has a successful period in the Department.  I know she will be a good Minister.  She would be a super Minister if she had enough money to do all the things that need to be done. It is ironic that my old adversary is on the opposite benches.  Not so long ago I was <Col N="1315" /> here defending the indefensible so I can appreciate the difficulties of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>While this is a worthwhile motion and much is being done, there is growing evidence that primary schools in the most severely deprived areas of our major cities are urgently in need of additional financial support to deal with the problems encountered by children in those schools.  Unfortunately there is a significant gap in this country between the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have nots&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A primary school child from a deprived family where unemployment is hereditary, where poverty is a way of life and the home address will prejudice any chance of finding a job, needs specialised treatment during his or her formative years in primary education.  I know from the good work I have seen in the Department that substantial efforts are made to provide such support but all the evidence points to a failure of society to provide an adequate response to the educational and economic needs in such cases.  Therefore, a significant increase is needed in the amount of money spent on our education system for the most severely deprived and disadvantaged children. Such an increase in expenditure would provide a good return on the investment for the Government and that is what is important.  Clearly, there is not enough money to be distributed.  It is a question of determining where the State can get the best return on the investment.  Preventative measures in primary education and in allied support services will not be expensive in comparison to the cost the State is now paying for the neglect of those children; the cost of crime, vandalism, drug abuse among a disaffected group of young people in our society runs into hundreds of millions of pounds.  A more enlightened approach, involving the expenditure of sufficient resources on preventive measures in primary education in areas such as the inner city, Ballymun and Neilstown, is now <Col N="1316" /> urgently required to give those children a reasonable quality of life.</P>
    <P>Having been responsible for youth affairs I believe that if you or I came from a place like Darndale, Ballymun or Neilstown and had to contend with the disadvantages those children have, we would have no chance of succeeding.  It behoves this Government to look at these problems as its first priority and give those children the reasonable chance they are not getting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. The more I listen to the Members on the Government side the more astonished I am that our motion has been amended. Speaker after speaker has talked about the disadvantaged areas and mentioned the great problems that exist.  These will be close to the Minister's heart because from her own experience in dealing with this area she appreciates the seriousness of the situation.  I thought our motion would have prompted her to write to Brussels saying that the university Senators had incited a revolt in the Seanad about pupils in disadvantaged areas and asking for money straightaway. I am astonished that this motion has been amended.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister has provided additional staffing and capitation money for cleaning and maintenance etc. in some schools in disadvantaged areas.  I gather there have also been small grants made for equipment.  I am appalled, however, that so few remedial teachers have been provided &mdash; I thought they were about to be automatically appointed to disadvantaged schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to pick up on something Senator Fahey said.  Having an address in a disadvantaged area can adversely affect a child.  When talking about disadvantaged areas I always avoid mentioning specific places because of the stigma that will thereby attach to people, especially children, from those areas.  In writing a reference for a teenager from a known disadvantaged area the main problem I have is trying to avoid using their address. It is astonishing that when one wants to help a 15 or 16 year old to get into some <Col N="1317" /> sort of employment or educational course one has to see if they have an aunt living in another area whose address will look better.  The problem is as serious as that.</P>
    <P>Senator Fahey was right when he said the gap is widening between the haves and the have nots and as Senator Kelly pointed out children are not disadvantaged simply because of the schools they attend but because society in their localities is disadvantaged as a whole. Schools cannot be told to solve all of the ills of children in disadvantaged areas; Senator Kelly is right on that point. However, the school can be the nucleus from which one can build out into the surrounding community.</P>
    <P>When we put down the motion looking for money from the Structural Funds we did not intend to denigrate the Minister or her efforts in any way.  The Government goes to Europe looking for headage payments for cattle and sheep.  It should do the same and more for children from deprived areas.  I cannot see why if there may be money available we should not try to get it.</P>
    <P>I had thought something could be done concerning school-home liaison officers. School-home liaison officers could be funded by Structural Funds because Structural Funds, as I understand them are intended to aid the integration of the person into the community.  Insufficient liaison between home and school may be a major reason for a young child's failure to integrate into the community.</P>
    <P>Parents in deprived areas often need major social support.  Could Structural Funds not be invested in social support schemes for parents?  There are adult education schemes for mothers but these can be quite difficult to get into.  The more resources we have for such schemes the better.</P>
    <P>The small number of educational psychologists employed by the Department is unbelievable.  I would have thought additional posts could be financed using Structural Funds.  The thrust of our motion is the need for broad funding for primary education in deprived areas; there are no specific demands.</P>
    <P>The empowerment of parents in their <Col N="1318" /> children's education is extremely important; the Constitution says they are the natural educators of the child.  It is easy to cultivate this involvement in middle class areas where parents have enormous influence over what happens in schools. This is not the same everywhere.  Great efforts have to be made in certain areas to encourage parental involvement in schools and more resources are needed to achieve this.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly also mentioned pre-school education; could some European moneys go towards pre-school education which requires an enormous amount of funding, very little of which is being provided by the State.  Funding is needed most in socially deprived areas where, as the Senator said some children go to school unable to tie their shoes.  The education system has to be flexible; the centre cannot impose structures but should examine what structure is best for each community.  I had hoped Structural Funds would allow us to investigate which systems people consider best for their areas because people should be asked for their input into the education system.  We should not simply impose what the Minister, I &mdash; or, indeed, Senator O'Toole &mdash; think best but try to draw suggestions from the community.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper emphasised the importance of early schooling and that was also mentioned by many Senators. Children who have not learned to read by the age of seven or eight are likely to encounter serious problems at school. Senator Norris talked about intervention in New Zealand at an early age &mdash; between four and six.  As Senator Ormonde could tell us, intervention begins much later in this country.</P>
    <P>It is very important to realise that the disadvantaged primary school child will continue to make little or no progress. They will have few educational opportunities at second level and third level education is out of the question.  That child will become an unemployed young person and, in turn, an unemployed young parent with a disadvantaged child who begins the cycle again.  This vicious circle has to be broken and I had hoped <Col N="1319" /> the Structural Funds could have helped to do this.</P>
    <P>I am sure the EC expects us to deal with school sanitation ourselves.  It is appalling that we still have schools with outdoor lavatories and even without running water.  Structural Funds could be used to build general purpose rooms which few schools have at present.  We could also improve arts and crafts facilities in the education system if money could be obtained.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that this motion is going to be amended.  I thought the Minister could use the excuse that she had a riot on her hands to request money from the EC at once.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach) Niamh Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the first words that greeted me here were &ldquo;I am appalled&rdquo;. As a new Minister for Education I need the best wishes of all Senators.  I hope at the end of my term of office after frequent visits to the Seanad that Senators will continue to have a sense of the huge task facing me and of the need for us all to row in together.</P>
      <P>On this, my first visit to the House as Minister for Education, it is reassuring, as an ex-primary school teacher, that the motion before the House concerns primary education.  It is appropriate that this is the first topic on which I address the House because primary education is the foundation on which the whole education system is built.  The best results are obtained where the environment, the teaching, care and facilities available to pupils in primary school are of the highest quality.  There is no suggestion in the amendment that primary education will be given a lower priority in educational spending, contrary to what the first speaker may have implied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of European funding will be decided in the context of the cohesion and Single European Acts.  The European Commission has now adopted the implementary regulations within the context of those two Acts and now under the Maastricht Treaty proposals which have yet to be ratified by Denmark and the <Col N="1320" /> UK.  However, that does not deter us from pursuing, with all possible vigour, the interests of education and training. When the Government decides its priority and finalises the national plan for post-1994.  Senators will see that education will not lose out within the limit of the funds available and the eligibility criteria governing the operation of the Structural Funds.  I assure Senators that I will promote the interests of the education sector, including the primary sector, at national and Community level in the course of the discussions.</P>
    <P>I want to take the opportunity to outline the Government's commitment to primary education and to detail the substantial steps already taken in 1993, with particular reference to assisting the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>I am keenly aware of the great tradition of deeply felt concern and of professional and well informed interest of Senators in educational issues.  I think this is the correct Chamber to have this debate.</P>
    <P>The Government's comprehensive proposals for reform of the education system will be set out in a White Paper, which will be published by the end of 1993, and a new education Act will be published shortly thereafter.  The main themes of reform will be more democracy, devoluton and openness, a genuine and meaningful role for partners in education, including parents and, in particular, a focussing of resources towards disadvantaged areas and groups.</P>
    <P>Our commitments to primary education are forthright and unambiguous and include a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio to 22:1 by September 1996 &mdash; begun this year; the recruitment of 500 additional remedial teachers by September 1996 &mdash; begun this year; the expansion of the psychological service to cover the whole primary sector to ensure that every child with learning or behavioural difficulties has access to help at the earliest stage; the allocation of an increased amount in each of the next five years to implement a planned programme of replacing or refurbishing sub-standard school buildings &mdash; again begun this year; a major concentration on disadvantaged <Col N="1321" /> areas through increased capitation grants, free books and the replacement of sub-standard accommodation &mdash; more than begun this year; the development of a nationwide home-school liaison service &mdash; improvements in this year; and provision of a comprehensive in-service training programme for teachers &mdash; very much on my agenda.</P>
    <P>A measure of the sincerity of our resolve to deliver on these commitments can be gauged from the progress we have made in implementing them within the first few week of this Government &mdash; within 80 days.  The improvements made, which are substantial, are all the more laudable given that they were achieved against the background of severe economic and budgetary difficulties.</P>
    <P>The extent of the Government's commitment to education is demonstrated by the fact that provision for gross spending on education has been increased by 8.7 per cent, three times the rate of inflation. The total gross provision for the four Education Votes is nearly £1,800 million, and increase of £150 million on the comparable gross outturn figure for 1992.</P>
    <P>These figures are important in setting the financial context in which reforms and the funds that they entail must be sought and won.  My main agenda in winning and obtaining funds is the targeting of disadvantaged pupils and schools.  In this context I am especially pleased at the advances that will be possible under the budget in primary education.</P>
    <P>Falling enrolments in national schools would on the basis of current staffing arrangements and the existing pupil-teacher ratio, have resulted in a reduction of 200 teaching posts in September 1993. As a first step in implementing the commitments in relation to improved staffing in primary schools, the Government has approved my proposal to retain these posts within the system.  This will have the effect of reducing the pupil-teacher ratio to 24:1 from September 1993 from the current ratio of 25:1.</P>
    <P>The 200 surplus posts will be redeployed over such areas as remedial education, <Col N="1322" /> schools in disadvantaged areas, home-school liaison projects, travellers and special education.  This will allow for a significant improvement in the number of pupils and schools provided with remedial services, particularly in rural areas.  Likewise, it will allow me to recognise additional schools as serving disadvantaged areas on the basis of criteria agreed with the partners in primary education.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the level of the capitation grant has been a cause of dissatisfaction and concern to all interests in primary education, including management, teachers and parents.  I am pleased that I was able to secure an increase of £3.4 million or 21 per cent in the overall provision for capitation grants for the current school year.  This has enabled me to increase the basic capitation grant to £33 per pupil and to initiate further measures to assist those schools which are most disadvantged.</P>
    <P>Provision for my Department's school book grant scheme for needy pupils in primary schools in both urban and rural areas is being increased by £200,000 or 14 per cent in the current school year.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to address the sentiments conveyed in the motion proposed by Senator O'Toole.  Nobody should be in any doubt about my commitment to resolving the problems facing the more disadvantaged sectors within the education sector.  In particular, I hope to minimise and remove the barriers which have prevented young people in the disadvantaged socio-economic groups from realising their full potential.</P>
    <P>I recognise that special intervention at the early stages of education makes a significant contribution to combating disadvantage and to breaking the cycle of educational deficiency.  Equally, I am aware that research shows that the efficiency of such intervention declines with the age of the pupil due to the influence exerted by other social pressures. In formulating approaches to the solution of this problem, I will be seeking to maximise all possible sources of funding at national and EC level.</P>
    <P>My approach to the finalisation of the <Col N="1323" /> education sector proposals for the next round of EC Structural Funds is conditioned by my conviction that the problems of the disadvantaged in our society must have a significant priority in the allocation of these funds.  Accordingly, I am heartened by the outcome of the discussions which I had with EC Commissioners Pádraig Flynn and Bruce Millan during my recent visit to Brussels.</P>
    <P>During those discussions, I outlined the central importance of education in promoting prosperity and equality.  I took the opportunity of emphasising the major contribution which education will make to the achievement of the underlying Community objectives of social and economic cohesion, from social exclusion to promotion of high technology innovation.</P>
    <P>In the discussions, I also sought to ensure that the Commission's overall approach in the preparation for the implementation of regulations for the European Social Fund and European Regional Development Fund would be sufficiently flexible to facilitate the partnership concept in the achievement of our national education priorities.  I was particularly impressed by the view of both Commissioners that the new regulations governing the operation of the funds would be based on the approach that the funds should become more policy driven and less an automatic translation of eligibility criteria.</P>
    <P>There was also a strong recognition of the need for flexibility in the operation of the funds, especially the European Social Fund, to enable them to address specific needs, potential and priorities in each member State.  This flexibility would, of course, accord with the principle of subsidiarity which is now a major principle of EC policy.  The House will, of course, recognise that the European Social Fund was established under Article 123 of the Treaty of Rome with the &ldquo;task of rendering the employment of workers easier and increasing their geographical and occupational mobility within the Community&rdquo;.  Accordingly, any EC flexibility in regard to early intervention <Col N="1324" /> measures to tackle disadvantage at primary level would probably have to be seen as having a direct effect on later performance in the labour market.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the Government has yet to make final decisions on its priorities for inclusion in the next Community Support Framework. It would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to deal in detail with the specific education measures which I hope to have included in the next Community Support Framework.  However, I can say that I am concerned to ensure that we shall, within the limits of the available funds, examine how best to tackle social exclusion and more particularly the needs of young people who are socially or economically disadvantaged; to facilitate the development of the teaching profession to enable them to react to the challenges inherent in the evolution of the education and training system; to meet the development needs of second level education, particularly in the context of broadening the curriculum at senior cycle; to develop post-secondary vocational education and training and in this context to develop a comprehensive national certification system as provided for in the Programme for a Partnership Government; and to support the return to education of adults, particularly those in socially and economically disadvantaged circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Senators who sought this debate have given me and the House an opportunity to acknowledge the critical importance of education and, particularly primary education, to the personal and economic development of our people. The Senators need not be apprehensive, as their motion might imply, about either our commitment to primary education and to seeking all possible sources of funding for the sector.  Neither should they believe that we have been tardy in pursuing our objectives with vigour at EC level.  The fact is that my Department is now the single largest beneficiary from ESF aid and I am satisfied that the steps taken by my officials and myself have ensured that the Commissioners and Commission officials are, and were, fully aware of our priority objectives when <Col N="1325" /> framing their new proposals for the regulations to govern the European Social and Regional Funds post-1993.</P>
    <P>I have taken note of what Senators had to say, some without scripts, some from the heart and in particular, the reference to bullying.  Comments were made about buildings, which I am told are all mine and about in-service training.  This is particularly urgent, and I say that as someone who served her time in the teaching profession, as have many Senators.  The question of the TV licence was brought to my attention and also the position of the school in Crumlin.  That school was burned down as a result of vandalism, a problem that all too often makes the news.  I met the parents last week and dealing with that school is on my agenda.  I will speak to Senator Norris about that school.</P>
    <P>The key overall objective for the next round of Structural Funds will be to seek support for activity which enhances the growth of the economy and promotes self-sustaining employment.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Education I bring to my portfolio a passion and I will be seeking to maximise the resources available nationally and at EC level to support the Government's educational priorities. There is ample evidence to demonstrate that, for young people, the best return on investment is from education rather than on emergency measures at a later stage to deal with failures in the system.</P>
    <P>Within this overall strategy a key aim of the education sector will be, consistent with the priorities in the Programme for a Partnership Government, to establish greater equity in education particularly for those who are economically or socially disadvantaged and to broaden the system to equip our young people more effectively for life, for work and for citizenship of Europe.  Senator O'Toole in proposing the motion asked for a spark of critical courage.  I can assure him that this Minister will show more than a spark.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to use the word &ldquo;passionately&rdquo; when I started my speech and the Minister has just used it. <Col N="1326" /> I welcome the Minister to the House and wish her well.</P>
      <P>Everybody who spoke on the debate tonight is passionately committed to the development of the best education system for this country, particularly at primary level, and to redressing social and economic imbalances in society.  It has been proved in a variety of reports and investigations that action at primary level can do more to redress social and economic imbalance in our society than any other action.  There have been many surveys, particularly by the Economic and Social Research Institute, by people like Tussing or David Rothman, or Patrick Clancy, on this issue.  They have all conclusively proved that if something is not done for a person by the age of 11, nothing worthwhile may be done after that age.  It is crucial to intervene at that stage.</P>
      <P>I agree that primary level, pre-school and the home to which as Senator Kelly and Senator Henry referred &mdash; are the crucial stages in the education system; I am not saying the others are not important but this level is crucial.  I have to take issue with Senator O'Toole because when proposing the motion he used the phrase, that we have &ldquo;abandoned and deserted&rdquo; children.  They were the words he used, I wrote them down at the time.  I went to school in the Irish system with many others and the definition of &ldquo;abandoned and deserted&rdquo; as I learned it in school is not represented by the action of the Minister since she came into the Department of Education, and she is less than 80 days in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to the need for an increase in the number of remedial teachers and implied that there has been no action in this area.  There is a commitment in the budget to employing 80 new remedial teachers this year, and this has been referred to by other speakers. There are other commitments, such as 25 home-school liaison officers, the improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio and the increase in the building programme, for which funding is provided. It is not fair to use terms like &ldquo;abandoned and deserted&rdquo; in that context.  There is a <Col N="1327" /> real commitment to improving the primary education system in this country in the Programme for a Partnership Government and in this year's budget, and there is a commitment to continuing that in future years.  I have to reject the language used in proposing the motion because it is not fair.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the reason there is an amendment to the motion, the Minister dealt with it in her speech.  We cannot ensure that we are going to get funding unless the structures are there. The Minister, went to Brussels and made the point that we need this funding.  She said in her speech that she&mdash;</P>
    <P>...sought to ensure that the Commission's overall approach... in implementing the regulations for the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund would be sufficiently flexible.</P>
    <P>That is all she can do at this stage.  Those regulations have yet to be put in force. In the amendment to the motion the term is &ldquo;using all possible means&rdquo;.  In my view, that covers adequately EC Funding. Every effort has been made taken at this stage to ensure that that funding is available and I am confident that funding will become available when the structures are in place.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the time and that other speakers wish to contribute.  The Government has made a beginning to improve the position of the primary education system.  It needs funding and a sizeable amount will be made available this year and in future years.  What has been done shows real commitment.  The Minister and the other members of the Government understand and are committed to the needs of primary education. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and wish her well in her Department. The Minister referred to the fact that people said they were appalled an amendment had been tabled.  I am not appalled although I was somewhat surprised the amendment had been put <Col N="1328" /> down.  I am now totally bewildered as to why it was put down because the Minister, in reply, has indicated quite clearly she is prepared to go along the route charted by Senator O'Toole and his colleagues in their motion.</P>
      <P>The Minister said Senators need not be apprehensive, as their motion might imply, about the commitments to primary education or to seeking all possible sources of funding.  She said we should not believe she or the Government had been tardy in pursuing their objectives with vigour at EC level.  This is precisely what the motion demands.  The motion does not say that the Minister should see Commissioner Flynn and the other Commissioners responsible for this area and if she does not succeed that she will be held politically accountable.  The motion seeks to ask the Government to try to seek funding.  It is a reasonable motion and I do not understand the need for the amendment.  Senator O'Toole's motion has not questioned the Government's commitment to education.</P>
      <P>Several speakers said they were not reading from scripts.  If they refer to Standing Orders or if the former Senator Murphy were here he would remind us that under Standing Orders we are not meant to read from scripts.  It is no great virtue to be able to deliver a speech in this House without reading from a script; however, that is by way of an aside.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the problem about accepting the motion.  There has been a catalogue of improvement which the Minister has enunicated to us in her reply.  I worry whether the Department of Finance is at work somewhere in this matter.  Despite talk of subsidiarity and determining things from the bottom up, when an effort is made to do this the Department of Finance intervenes for fear others may in some way get their greedy little paws on money which they feel should properly be expended by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the matter of flexibility.  I attended a conference in Galway last week and Commissioner Flynn also emphasised the word &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; as if it were somehow <Col N="1329" /> discovered since the Government came into power.  I remind the Minister that it says in a Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty which is a solemn declaration between the high contracting parties, &ldquo;Nothing the desire for greater flexibility in the arrangements for allocation from the Structural Funds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The word is used in the Treaty and, therefore, I say to the Minister that is quite appropriate to seek funding from Europe for the purposes defined in this motion.  Building proper facilities for our children is part of our infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly said that Structural and Cohesion Funds were for all people.  I agree; if they are for all our people they must be particularly for our children to ensure that their future is secure.  It is of no benefit to have a marvellous motorway from Cork to the port of Dublin so that our children may emigrate.  That is why this matter is of such paramount importance and that is why I appeal to the Government to use whatever means are at its disposal to ensure all available funds are sought for this pressing and necessary investment.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to Article 126 in the Treaty which says:</P>
    <P>The Community shall contribute to the development of quality education by encouraging co-operation between Member States and, if necessary, by supporting and supplementing their action, while fully respecting the responsibility of the Member States for the content of teaching and the organisation of education systems and their cultural and linguistic diversity.</P>
    <P>There is also an article on culture which could be used for this purpose.  I do not see a problem on seeking these funds from Europe.  It is not a question of the begging bowl attitude; it is a question of seeking out our entitlement and claiming it.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the differentiation between training and education.  They are all part of the development of the child, of the personality and development the young adult.  The cultural aspect and Irish schools could come under the aegis <Col N="1330" /> of these funds.  Several Senators have raised questions about literacy, remedial teaching and the school structures themselves that is the buildings in which children have to be taught.  There is a school close to my home and I would be ashamed to bring any Minister or child into it.  It is not good enough, in this day and age, that children have to be educated in the conditions which exist at the moment.  It is a tribute to the teachers who educate them that they can continue to do their work in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to take up the matter with Brussels because, increasingly, it appears this is where the action is and to ensure that the money required for these badly needed investments which are part of our infrastructure will be used for these purposes and we will not have empty motorways built from Dublin to Cork to carry our people out of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to tell the Minister I am more than appalled, I feel outraged and deserted.  I have rarely been as angry. People have talked about not having scripts.  I have never come into a debate so ill-prepared.  Literally, I did not put a note on paper because I could not concentrate on what I wanted to say.  To say that I feel misled and let down is putting it mildly.  There were two important words in this motion, &ldquo;European&rdquo; and &ldquo;primary&rdquo; and they are both being excised from it.  I wanted to link those two areas.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to the Minister's speech.  I do not doubt her commitment but I no longer believe she is putting proposals for specific commitments for primary education to Europe.  If the Minister was going to do that she would have told us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not interested in technicalities.  I am aware of the position in relation to the Maastricht Treaty and the need for the UK and Denmark to ratify it.  The person who briefed the Minister should consider the decision taken at the Edinburgh summit to enable the implementation of the Structural Funds on the basis of the Maastricht Treaty.  Decisions are <Col N="1331" /> being taken now for the implementation of the Structural Funds which will take place under the auspices of the new treaty.  That is a reality.  I fully recognise the unusual situation which exists.  It was for this reason that even if we were working under the previous treaty or Structural Funds I would still be able to point out to the Minister things which were done in Portugal and other places which we have failed to do.</P>
    <P>This motion is not a condemnation of the Minister's Department.  It will be a long time &mdash; and I say this to the new people on the other side of the House &mdash; before anybody will come to Private Members' Time with a motion seeking to support and supplement the action of a Minister.  If this motion is interpreted by the far side of the House as criticism, I feel I have wasted much time trying to find consensus on the motion.  People criticised my use of the word &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo;. I say to Senator O'Sullivan and Senator Kelly to take a trip around their own area and on the way from New-castlewest take the road to Dromcolliher and drive out to Tullylease and have a look at the athletics track there.  Then they should go up to the school and talk to the parents in that little village and ask them what they want.  One could go to Kilavullen the subject of the Adjournment Matter tonight &mdash; and ask those parents how they feel.  They can produce a letter from the Department of Education stating that the Minister has put aside £100,000 to build their school and another letter from the current Minister stating that the money is gone or was never there.  That is why they feel abandoned and that was the word they used yesterday outside the school gate.  This is where the commitment comes from.  If people want to know what it feels like to be abandoned they should talk to the people running the Gaelscoil in South Hill.  Here one finds a prefabricated shack which is called a school.  The parents there want money to built a proper school.</P>

      <P>I have seen no commitment to go to Brussels to put forward proposals on behalf of primary education and I seek a commitment from the Department of Finance in this matter. That is why I feel let down.  There is a problem with what the Minister said about seeking support through the Funds.  I did not mention Structural Funds; I spoke about European funding. Do I need to give a lesson on how this works?  European funding is used to fund a variety of programmes and Structural Funds are a part of that.  The commitment on Article 126, read out by a number of <Col N="1333" /> Senators during this debate, is implementable outside the provision of Structural Fund and the Social Funds.  It is part of the implementation of the Treaty and there has been no response. That is the reason for the sense of abandonment.</P>
      <P>I put forward a point of view here which I formed following earlier discussions with the Minister when I sought to create a partnership with her to support her efforts.  I find it incredible that this line was taken.  There has been a breach of logic between the moving of the amendment and points made by the Minister and by Members on the opposite side of the House.  They do not gel together.  There is a missing link which I cannot figure out yet but time will tell.  It is clear from the European perspective how this movement should take place and that is not happening here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has lost an opportunity <Col N="1334" /> to say to the partners in primary education that she will strive to obtain funding for an area of education that has been described as the most hard pressed.  If this fails at least we will have failed together and there will be a sense of community, rather than needless dissension and divided commitment.  What is the point in putting forward constructive motions if something as innocuous as this causes a problem for Government?  Where do we move from here?  It is easy to put the Minister down and to blame the Department for the problems in primary education.  I do not know the value of a constructive approach to such matters after tonight's performance.</P>
    <P>I apologise to the Minister for not welcoming her to the House at the beginning of my speech.  I am the victim of a good upbringing which I have been fighting against all my life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  I raised this matter last year when I was a Member of the Lower House.  At that time I explained that County Leitrim was in a unique position, which we would not like to boast about, of being the only county without its own headage livestock office.  At the time I asked the Minister to have the matter investigated in the hope of establishing a livestock office in Carrick-on-Shannon; the farming community of County Leitrim is entitled to that privilege and service.  The Minister said he would have the matter investigated and since than there has been a number of developments.  I do not have the results of the investigation but I hope the Minister will have some good news for me this evening about the establishment of an office.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is currently looking for areas to be brought into the extremely disadvantaged areas category.  I know all of County Leitrim should be designated as extremely disadvantaged.  This would give the farming community of the county extra headage payments and would also entail extra administrative work for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  This is another reason why an office should be established in Carrick-on-Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission had an office <Col N="1336" /> and six officials in Carrick-on-Shannon but since the commission has been disbanded, this premises is now vacant and would be an ideal location for a headage office.  The establishment of a headage office would compensate for the number of public service jobs which were lost in Leitrim when the Land Commission was disbanded.</P>
    <P>My main reason for raising this matter on the Adjournment is that I believe County Leitrim is entitled to its own administrative unit.  There have been many requests for such an office.  The officers in Sligo have carried out their work diligently but from a logistical point of view Leitrim should have its own headage office.  I request the Minister to give favourable consideration to my plea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh) Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senator Reynolds for raising this important matter.  My Department's livestock and headage premia, veterinary and farm development service schemes are operated through a network of local offices situated so as to ensure that an effective service is delivered to the farming community.  While all these schemes operate through a local office not all counties are serviced by an office located in that county.</P>
      <P>In relation to Leitrim, the Department has an office in Carrick-on-Shannon which operates the farm improvement programme, the control of farmyard pollution scheme and alternative enterprise schemes under the operational programme for rural development.</P>
      <P>The processing of livestock and headage premia applications and ERAD operations for County Leitrim are dealt with by our local office in Sligo as this makes for the most effective use of the Department's administrative resources. However, a number of our technical officers dealing with these schemes are headquartered away from the Sligo office and operate from a variety of locations including a number of locations in County Leitrim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator will be interested to know that currently two officers are headquartered <Col N="1337" /> in Manorhamilton, two in Drumkeeran, three in Mohill, two in Ballinamore, two in Dromahaire, one in Drumshanbo, one in Dowra and one in Jamestown.  This provides a network of officers throughout the county who can deal with queries on the schemes.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has over 50 administrative, professional and technical staff in the Sligo office who process all grant applications and schemes for the counties of Sligo and Leitrim.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the level of service provided by the Sligo office and the staff throughout Leitrim is satisfactory and there is no question that farmers in County Leitrim receive a lower quality of service than elsewhere.</P>

      <P>Parents of the 135 pupils at the school are furious that the Minister has backed down on the written pledge given by the previous Minister, Deputy Davern, to allocate £100,000 for the renovations.  Anger in the area is so great that parents withdrew their children from school in a one day protest yesterday <Col N="1338" /> to focus attention on conditions at the school.</P>
      <P>The five teacher school which was built in 1907 is riddled with structural problems which constitute a serious hazard for pupils and teachers.  Overcrowding is so bad that going to the blackboard or the toilet is hazardous.  Classrooms are poorly ventilated and due to the high level of condensation fungus growth is common.  There are no storage facilities in the school and no staff facilities.  Cloakroom facilities are inadequate and there are only two sinks with cold water serving the entire school.  Toilet facilities are outdoors and are effectively unusable, due to problems with the roof and defects in the drainage system.  The school is in breach of its own safety requirements and if there is an accident, there could be claims for compensation.</P>
      <P>No child should be educated and no teacher should be expected, to work under such conditions.  They are a disgrace to our society, to successive Governments and especially to the Department of Education.  These conditions may have been acceptable 50 years ago, but have no place in modern Ireland.  The parents have raised the required £15,000 local contribution towards the estimated £100,000 cost of refurbishment.  They have also provided two computers, three sets of encyclopedia, one photocopier and one keyboard from their own resources.  Is it any wonder they feel let down by the Department of Education now?</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to give permission for the school management to invite tenders for the work without any further delay.  This is the least she could do, in view of the fact that the documents were ready to go to tender in 1992, when the then Minister for Education sanctioned the funding for the construction work.  The process would take time to complete and it would be the end of the year before any work would be done.  The pupils and parents of Kilavullen have been kept waiting long enough and are entitled to fair play.  I appeal to the Minister to allow the project to go to tender.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister certainly inherited an extraordinary difficult situation in the building section.  Although I have been critical on many occasions tonight, I would like to compliment the Minister for publishing a list for the first time of the projects undertaken during this year and for giving a commitment that this would be done in future.  This opens up the system and I am grateful for that.  However, that is of no help to the people of Kilavullen.</P>
      <P>I was in Kilavullen national school and I will make a few points about the school. Yesterday morning I was dealing with aspects of the Green Paper on Education concerning the role of the principal as chief executive.  There is no space for that in Kilavullen.  I had never before seen a classroom so overcrowded.  I have seen schools that are as bad physically worse but the curriculum cannot be implemented in that school.  I am not exaggerating.  I could not walk around the classroom because I would have to cross chairs or tables to get to the door. Apart from fire regulations or anything else the idea of implementing a primary school curriculum there is out of the question.</P>
      <P>There are three sets of toilets in the school, and one set has been condemned. The roof is falling in, an there is flooding outside.  There is a prefabricated building with three toilets catering for 105-115 pupils and they are smelly, unhygienic and dirty.  In a brand new general purposes room there are three new toilets but the Department will not give the grant necessary to connect them up to the local sewerage system.  This is a total contradiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not expect the Minister to defend this situation; that would not be her style, but what can one say to these people? With the building of a new classroom, they have made a huge effort to improve the school.  When the Department would only give permission and money to build a prefabricated building last year they raised the additional money required and built a beautiful classroom.  In the middle of all the substandard accommodation there is one &ldquo;rolls royce&rdquo; classroom with <Col N="1340" /> toilets which are not connected.  Something has to be done.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will say that she got an extra £2 million from this year's budget and that is only a start.  For a system with 3,500 schools, that money would not build 40 or 50 classrooms.  It is heartbreaking for the exceptional staff of Kilavullen and I do not know how they maintain tbeir morale.  However, there is a great <i>esprit de corps</i> among parents, teachers and management and because of his co-operation pupils get the best possible deal and numbers in the school are either increasing or are stable.</P>
    <P>I freely admit that I get angry about education too often, but cases like this provoke me.  The people of Kilavullen are doing everything right.  They depend on the system and on people like me. Every time I meet them their anger is directed at me.  Yesterday, I met a group from Ballynacally national school in Ennis and I know that school is disadvantaged also.  They vented their ire at me, because I am the general secretary of the INTO.  They are totally frustrated. I sent a note this morning to my lawyers to find out whether there is a breach of contract when a Minister fails to honour a commitment.  Many will quote the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 etc. as to where the authority comes from, but there is something morally wrong when the Department of Education can give a commitment in writing, and then renege on it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give these people a break because they deserve it.  Improvements cannot be carried out with the resources available to the Minister for this year.  We have to obtain additional resources or move the thing forward.  The people of Kilavullen put more money into their new classroom than the Department. This is a first and they deserve our support.  I appeal to the Minister to respond to them.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh.  I am glad of the opportunity to tell the House the position regarding Kilavullen national school.  I met a deputation of <Col N="1341" /> parents and the excellent teachers from there and I was impressed by the united front presented by public representatives of the area.  They gave me a portfolio and photographs of the school and I am pursuing the matter as rigorously as possible. As a result of that meeting some small improvements have been made. The present accommodation at this school consists of four small classrooms and a general purposes room.  The staff comprises a principal and four assistant teachers and the current enrolment is actually 136 pupils.  On foot of the application which had been made for the provision of a permanent extension, my Department has approved a major building project involving the conversion of the existing four classrooms to two classrooms and toilets and the construction of an extension to include two standard classrooms and a staffroom. Planning of the project has reached tender document stage.</P>
      <P>Because of other demands deemed to be of higher priority which gives one an idea of the desperate state of some school buildings, other projects obtained precedence in 1993.  I acknowledge that this is a high priority project and it will be considered for inclusion in the programme as soon as possible, in light of the available resources and other commitments and priorities.  We are beginning to move forward and to be able to indicate the projects which will be undertaken each year.</P>
      <P>The Senator has referred to the threat to the health and safety of pupils and teachers arising from the present conditions. The only conditions at the school which could give immediate concern regarding health and safety, are those relating to toilet facilities.</P>
      <P>The present toilet block is not currently in use because of the possibility of flooding and the collapse of part of the roof. It was deemed necessary from a health and hygiene point of view that temporary toilets be provided.  This has been done and has been grant-aided by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to another new toilet block at the school which was <Col N="1342" /> provided in association with some accommodation provided by local initiative. Even though these alone would not suffice for the school in the longer term, necessitating toilet facilities to be provided as part of the major project now pending, the Department has made arrangements for those existing toilets to be connected to the local authority pipeline.  As soon as this is done, it will obviate the necessity for the rented temporary toilets.  An official of the Office of Public Works visited the school on Friday, 25 March to initiate the necessary arrangements.  Senator Sherlock and his visiting party can take much credit for that.  This further underlines the priority which is attached to this project in the context of the 1994 programme.  I have instructed a senior official in my Department to visit the school within the next few weeks to examine the conditions, to speak to the interested parties and to report back to me.</P>
    <P>To summarise for the Senator, remedial measures have been taken in relation to the inadequate toilet facilities. I accept these measures are not what the Senator wanted but, as a result of his deputation, we were able to move quickly.  I accept that the major programme now at tender must be regarded as of the highest priority.  I explained to the Senator's deputation &mdash; I am very careful of my words because I hope not to break any promise I give &mdash; that this project will be borne in mind when resources allow further major projects to be selected and to proceed.  This is one of the few cases where I have instructed officials to proceed into the 1994 programme.</P>
    <P>I commend the Deputies and Senators who represent the area and I commend the teachers and parents involved.  It is a wonderful community and one which I hope will not suffer much longer as a result of the parsimonious nature of some Government Departments.</P>

      <P>I have notice from <Col N="1343" /> Senator Kelly and Senator Neville that they wish to raise matters under Standing Order 29 (A).</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister for the Environment to make a speedy decision to fund what is known as the Hill group water supply in the general west Limerick area.  Group water supply schemes are two a penny and even in County Limerick we have many demands for funding for various group schemes but this one is of particular importance because of the nature of the ground water that is available to people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wells are difficult to bore in the area. When one is successful in boring a well one finds that there is a high concentration of iron pyrites in the water.  If one uses surface water, for example, by tapping streams, the water tends to be high in acidity.  The iron pyrites and the acidity content of the water that is already available make it unsuitable for use in backboilers, washing machines etc.  For that reason it is important that people in this community have a decent water supply and that is available from the town of Abbeyfeale.  All that is needed is a reservoir and pumping station to bring it up to the level of the Hill or Dromtrosna area.  If the reservoir were put in place it would also ensure that communities in other areas in west Limerick such as Tournafulla and Mountcollins would have a better water supply.  This group <Col N="1344" /> water supply scheme is for the benefit of not one, but three different communities. Speedy action is needed because of the poor quality of the ground water supply.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise with the Minister for Justice, through the Leader of the House, the recent suicide in Wheatfield Prison.  We should express our regret and send our sympathy to the family of the bereaved.  I call on the Minister and the Government to introduce suicide prevention strategies in prisons as recommended in the 1991 Report of the Advisory Committee on Prison Deaths. As a matter of urgency I believe the Government should improve psychological services for prisoners, allow the Samaritans access to prisoners, review the system of special observation lists of prisoners considered at risk of suicide and improve the assessment of prisoners when they are first committed.  People are 16 times more likely to die in prison than in the community.  Twenty people have committed suidice in Irish prisons over the past fve years.  One of the main problems which is causing great difficulties in our prisons is drug usage and related problems.  Resources should be made available to adequately deal with the health problems of drug abusers and to eliminate drugs from our prisons.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 1 April 1993.</P>
