      <P>I have notice from Senator Neville that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that the Stella Maris School in Foynes, County Limerick continues as a second level institution after 1995 in view of the withdrawal of the religous community and the decision not to accept first year students from September 1993.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Kelleher of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide a secondary school in the Glanmire/Riverstown area of Cork.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to explore the possibility of having St. Helen's House, Booterstown, preserved for the benefit of the State.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Cashin of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance <Col N="194" /> to request the British National Monuments Trust to return, as a gift to the people of Ireland, Kanturk Castle; and if the Government would then set about restoring it.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Farrelly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide £50,000 to Meath County Council for the appointment of a design consultant for the new bridge over the River Blackwater in Navan, County Meath, which will alleviate the serious traffic problem which exists.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to take steps as a matter of urgency to protect the important archaeological site at Christchurch Place, recently uncovered, which contains an impressive portion of the pre-Norman town wall and 13th century mural tower, which is threatened by commercial development and infill.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Neville, Kelleher, Cosgrave, Cashin, Farrelly and Norris as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Neville's and Senator Kelleher's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Cosgrave, Cashin, Farrelly and Norris may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House if he could make time available today or tomorrow to discuss a matter about which there is a great deal of public anger, that is the proposed new changes in telephone charges?

      <P>I wish to put on the record of the House that I have had a number of discussions during the past week with the Government Chief Whip about accommodation for the Independent Senators.  Some progressive proposals are being put to the Government side and I hope the matter will be resolved over the next couple of days.  I hope that will dispose of the matter.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader give a clear indication of the discussions that are taking place in the other House and with Government about subsidies for political parties to fight elections?  There seems to be no recognition that Independents seeking election should get any support whatsoever. If there is any attempt to disbar or not support Independents in either Dáil or Seanad elections&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are several Items on the Order Paper which are matters to be resumed.  One is statements on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. When is it intended to return to this matter?  There were a number of people who wished to speak on it before it was adjourned last week.  Senator Kennedy only had a few minutes to begin his contribution. In view of the topicality of this matter and the fact that farmers have become fillers of forms rather than producers of food, can it be resumed as soon as possible?</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Leader of the House if he could provide some time for a debate on the entertainment business and in particular the providers of entertainment.  There is major public concern regarding copyright and royalties and the ability of organisations to <Col N="196" /> act in a monopolistic and anti-competitive way.  This is a matter of public interest and this House should have a debate on it.</P>

If time is not allowed for this discussion I want to give notice that I intend under Standing Order 29 to raise this issue later today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what my colleague Senator O'Toole said about improvements in the accommodation for university Senators.  I want to put on record my strong feelings on the matter. The Cathaoirleach knows that I have put a strongly worded motion on the Order Paper.  It is not just a question of accommodation but also of secretarial services. We are being asked to make bricks without <Col N="197" /> straw.  It is a farce.  I will leave it at that as I am glad there has apparently been some progress.</P>
      <P>I welcome, a Chathaoirligh, your consent to the matter on the Adjournment about Christ Church Place &mdash; although it is not being taken today.  I intend raising this under Standing Order 29.  It is the most important discovery since Wood Quay and tomorrow it is to be backfilled and destroyed by a commercial company. It is about time we did something about this.  May I finally raise a matter that is of considerable concern to everybody&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not blaming the Cathaoirleach at all, not in the slightest. I only heard about it yesterday from the archaeologist involved.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for accepting it.  I do not wish to be critical.</P>
      <P>There is one further matter that might be of interest to the House.  We had an extremely good debate last week on the question of AIDS.  I am horrified to read in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today about a cabal within RTE.  I remember the days when RTE used to be attacked on the basis that they were a nest of Workers' Party sympathisers.  It appears to me they are far more a nest of the Knights of St. Columbanus.  The RTE Authority, or people inside it, have conspired against the Government to block an AIDS advertising campaign.  To whom are these people responsible?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader if he could make time available to discuss the problem of back moneys due to people as a result of the EC equality ruling.  An impression is being given by legal people, solicitors in particular, that they alone can claim these moneys for those who are entitled to them.  That is very sad.  May I ask the Leader if the matter can be speedily clarified?  The Minister said to me when speaking on the Social Welfare Bill that anyone who applied would get a prompt reply. However, that is not the case.  Solicitors are applying and charging 10 to 20 per cent of any moneys due.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to reconsider the decision to take the concluding stages of the Unfair Dismissals Bill today.  This is one of the first Bills we have initiated in this House.  We have to take a different view of Bills initiated in this House as against Bills passed on to us from the other House. The decision to take the Committee and remaining stages today should be reconsidered. There are 38 amendments down and it would be sinful for us to treat this Bill with such disdain that we do not deal with them all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris has undermined himself and confused me as I always thought he was the most important discovery in Ireland.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House if we could have a debate on the subject of the Structural Funding for this country.  I indicated last week that I would appreciate if some time could be afforded for such a debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by <Col N="199" /> Senator Manning and other Senators to the Leader to provide time for a debate on the increase in telephone charges.  I would also like to support the call by Senator Finneran that the House be provided with time to discuss the abuse of music users by the copyright organisations and I compliment him on the accuracy of his observation on the matter.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to provide time for a debate on the health services.  I say this with particular regard to a recent decision which, from 1 June, involves the closing of the casualty unit in the Ennis General Hospital between 1 a.m. and 8 a.m., the closure of one theatre and the closure of one ward.  These are urgent matters that we need time to discuss in advance of 1 June and, consequently, I ask the Leader to raise the matter with the Minister for Health and provide time in the House.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to inquire if a decision has been reached on the matter of Mother Teresa addressing the House in a few week's time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to request the Leader of the House to provide time within the next week to discuss the seed potato disaster in Donegal.  A sum of £2.5 million was allocated to the farmers who lost out in this disaster but now quite a number of them stand to lose out as a result of a document from the Department in relation to the regulation.  Only those farmers who have an RSI number will qualify.  Legally the RSI number&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put a question to the Leader of the House in view of a report that appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday which stated that <Col N="200" /> no money from Europe will go to the Department of Defence in the next number of years.  It also stated that a high-level committee in the Department of Defence will close down a number of barracks around the country.  It has to be said that military barracks are an integral part of the fabric of an area.  They play a major part&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if we could have time to discuss the problem of threatening letters being sent by prisoners to victims of serious crime.  These letters are, apparently, not censored.  We have previously discussed the incest case in Kilkenny; now the victims's misery is perpetuated by the receipt of letters from her attacker.  This is not an isolated case, it is a common occurrence.  As a result the victims of crime are often in a worse situation than the criminals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to prevent confusion in light of the fact that the Culliton report called for balanced telephone charges, would the Leader of the House ask the Leader of Fine Gael why they have now changed their minds in calling for the implementation of Culliton?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House confirm that Committee Stage of Item 3 will be taken today and if it is not completed, that it will be resumed?  Will there be an interval between Committee and Report Stages to allow Members to put down further amendments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two issues. The first is very important and has been mentioned by Senator Henry.  It concerns <Col N="201" /> the extraordinary revelations that prisoners can intimidate people from behind prison bars.  I hope the House will have the opportunity to discuss that and the report on the Kilkenny case at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>The second issue I wish to raise is the extraordinary treatment of this House on RTE.  Last week there were important debates on AIDS and on the Comptroller and Auditor General but there was no coverage of those debates by RTE.  That is disgraceful; RTE viewers would imagine nothing happens in this House. That is a serious distortion and is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator McGowan in asking the Leader if he could discuss the Land Registry and Ordnance Survey with the Minister for Justice. Farmers have a serious problem acquiring maps and that problem should be addressed.</P>
      <P>Does the Leader of the House intend to allocate time to discuss the sale of the Mespil flats complex and the concerns it has caused for the tenants?  Had Mr. Haughey been Taoiseach and had a member of his family been involved in the scandal, the Minister, Deputy Spring, would have been so irate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible to have a debate on the possibility of establishing a complaints authority for the written media in view of the fact that a popular RTÉ presenter and a member of the Judiciary were last week accused in newspapers of being part of a golden speculation circle?  There was also the recent controversial tape recording by a journalist.</P>

      <P>It is impossible to answer every query that has been raised.  Many of them are appropriate to the Adjournment or to Private Members' time.  I will deal with those that are relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>With regard to the concerns of Senator Quinn and other Members, there will be no guillotine on Committee Stage of the Bill.  This Bill was initiated in the Seanad and it will get the respect and time it deserves.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning and others referred to telephone charges.  Item 2 on today's Order Paper &mdash; a motion on Employment through Enterprise &mdash; will be taken tomorrow and that will be an appropriate opportunity to discuss telephone changes.</P>
      <P>I understand we can discuss Common Agricultural Policy next week and the Structural Funds, mentioned by Senator Kelleher, are on the agenda for the future.  The Whips will deal with the Land Registry issue raised by Senator McGowan and the health issue raised by Senator Howard.  Senator Finneran suggested a debate on problems in the entertainment industry.  I suspect that many people would consider this House an appropriate venue for a debate on entertainment and its problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure of the reason for the change in this section.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;trade union&rdquo; means a trade union which is the holder of a negotiation licence under Part II of the Trade Union Act, 1941;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is asking about the definition of &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; and why it is used so restrictively.  This definition is used in the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.  To maintain consistency in employment legislation, we retain the same terminology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No problems have been encountered with the definition in the 15 years since the first unfair dismissals legislation.  This change, in addition to being consistent with the 1990 Act, is considered necessary to avoid problems with the existing definition. There is no hidden agenda.  While no problems have arisen with regard to the 1977 legislation we want to retain consistency in terminology so that interested parties &mdash; employers, employees and the public &mdash; will understand the precise nature of the term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>While not disagreeing with section 2, there is one aspect which should be brought to the Minister's notice.  We know what the term &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; means and that a high percentage of employees are represented by trade unions.  However a number of employees are not.  It has come to light that many of those employees, should they bring a case <Col N="204" /> to the tribunal, do not get free legal aid and they cannot afford legal expenses. Perhaps the Minister would deal with this issue of free legal aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>First, everybody can seek redress, whether in a union or not. There is no circumscribed group of people who may or may not seek redress.  The point is to keep legalism out of the proceedings.  I accept the point made about free legal aid.  People, in unions and outside them, have told me that they do not like the increase in legalism in the Employment Appeals Tribunal because it was established to bring simplicity and clarity to the proceedings.  By introducing legalism, one negates the purpose of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I am meeting the members of the Employment Appeals Tribunal in the near future and I will discuss these matters with them.</P>
      <P>To answer the Senator's point, no one is excluded from seeking redress.  To do so would be the wrong way for anybody to attend the business.  The route of legalism is not the right route.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to hear what the Minister has said about reducing legalism in this area.  I made this point on Second Stage.  In view of what the Minister has said, I am sure she will accept some of our amendments which try to reduce legalism in industrial relations legislation.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the Minister and I agree with everything she said.  What is the difference between us? The Principal Act says that a trade union means a trade union granted a licence under the Trade Union Acts, 1941 and 1971.  As the Minister says &mdash; and she may correct me if I misquote her &mdash; this definition has worked perfectly.  Now there is an amendment to change the definition in the Trade Union Acts, 1941 and 1971 to one section of the 1941 Act. I want a reason for this.  If I am being suspicious, I apologise.  Could the Minister assuage my fears and explain to me why this change was brought into the <Col N="205" /> early legislation and why, in this Bill, we decided to change the interpretation in the Trade Union Acts, 1941 and 1971 to one part of the 1941 Act.</P>

      <P>The Senator did not hear me correctly.</P>
      <P>Although I said no difficulty had arisen, this definition is more comprehensive because it covers all the trade unions defined in industrial legislation and in industrial relations legislation.  The definition in the Principal Act may not have covered every trade union in the country, for example, English based unions, because the definition did not refer to the Trade Union Act, 1975.  This is the most correct and precise definition which can be obtained.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a point about legalism.  I confirm the thrust of what the Minister has said.  The existence of legislation facilitates employers and employees to resolve disputes without recourse to the law.  In other words, the best way to handle disputes is to prevent them and to allow people in the workplace to resolve them at that level. The existence of legislation avoids legalism.</P>
      <P>Second, this is a technical Bill and the Minister underlined this fact.  Legislation, including this Bill, should be kept as simple as possible.  In that context, there is everything to be said for a simple guide to the legislation.  We should have minimum legalism and simple legislation.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister's view that the legalisation of the Employment Appeals Tribunal should be avoided.

      <P>I am not speaking from any section of the Employment Appeals Tribunal or from any section of the industrial <Col N="206" /> relations area, but from my experience of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  It has become overly legalistic. The original intention was that an employee could take his own case, without any representation, and the Employment Appeals Tribunal would be sensitive to the position of the employee and would elicit all the facts from that person. If the tribunal could develop in that way, it would be better than the present situation where legal people debate the facts at length, while sometimes confusing the issues.  Two of the three members of the Employment Appeals Tribunal are lay people who often seek guidance from the chairperson because the tribunal has become so legalistic.  It was not meant to be that way.</P>

      <P>I raised this matter because people who have not been represented by trade unions have failed miserably in their efforts to gain redress as they did not have representation at the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  Where would they get representation?  The immediate reaction of a person who is unfairly dismissed and who is not a member of a trade union is to seek legal advice because they do not know anything about the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  If a person deems it necessary to have legal representation &mdash; and I do not want to be overly legalistic in these matters &mdash; they should be entitled to it. Sometimes an employer will be accompanied by a solicitor and barrister. In that case what chance has an employee without trade union representation?  I ask the Minister to consider this matter with a view to providing free legal aid for people in these circumstances.</P>

      <P>I know that any points Senator Sherlock raises are based on what he sees as people's rights.  However, what he is urging me to do would have a negative effect on the workings of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  The Employment Appeals Tribunal was <Col N="207" /> meant to be accessible, understandable and simple.  Legal aid is advocated for people who are unfairly dismissed and I know who is advocating it.  However, that is not Senator Sherlock's view.  If we go that route we would negative what is meant to happen in the Employment Appeals Tribunal and it would be contrary to the spirit and thrust which was inherent in the setting up of the tribunal. I am meeting the chairman and the members soon to discuss this issue.</P>
      <P>One issue which has been mentioned to me by the trade unions and other interested parties is the increasing legalism in what was meant to be a free and unfettered expression of views.  I know the stance which Senator Sherlock is taking and I assure him that the format of the Employment Appeals Tribunal was never meant to be one in which there would be increasing legal representation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) the substitution of &lsquo;nine month's&rsquo; for &lsquo;one year's&rsquo; in paragraph (a) of subsection (1).&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This legislation has worked well to protect people who might have been dismissed or sacked over a period of time. One issue which arises time and again is the one year period before people are entitled to avail of the legislation.  Prior to the Principal Act, this legislation, or amended legislation, an individual who was sacked from employment and had not been treated equitably within the boundaries of common law and natural justice would have tried to take a case under common law and under the principles of natural justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the experience of the trade union movement that this legislation has been used by a minority of unscrupulous <Col N="208" /> people who have avoided the one year term of qualification.  A person must be employed for one year before they can avail of this legislation if they are sacked. There are a number of reasons why there should be a specific period.  An individual may be appointed to a position and, despite the best methods of filtration, the most comprehensive system of interviewing and the most supportive methods of probation he may be unable to do the job.  An employer must have the right to deal with that situation.</P>
    <P>There is nothing sacrosanct about a year.  It is easy to avoid this legislation &mdash; yearly contracts are being used for this purpose.  An individual in employment for more than six months will have established himself or herself sufficiently for the employer and fellow workers to know if he or she is able to do the job.  The one year period should be reduced to nine months.  An individual in employment for nine months should have access to this legislation if dismissed and should be enabled to appeal.</P>
    <P>A person in employment for less than one year may challenge dismissal, but may not do so under the unfair dismissals legislation.  People may challenge dismissal by seeking a judicial review or legal redress under common law or the principles of natural justice.  It would be easier for everybody, including the employer and employee, if this matter could be addressed.  I would like to see the period of one year reduced to nine months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point made by Senator O'Toole and I ask him to change his amendment to reduce the time period to less than nine months.  I do not know whether this may be permitted.  In a number of jobs the probationary period is three months; in others it is 12 months. If a dismissal is wrong after 13 months it is equally wrong after three months.  I ask the Minister of State to address this issue. Three months is an adequate period of time to assess an individual's competence. I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper on unfair <Col N="209" /> dismissals highlighted interesting figures in relation to other EC countries.  For example, the time period in the UK is two years, in Denmark it is one year, in Germany and Italy it is six months and in the Netherlands it is two months. Employers argue for one or two years while trade unions argue that six months is sufficient time to assess a person's suitability. I believe that the time should be reduced from one year to nine months or six months.  Under existing legislation the time period for apprentices is six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The time period may vary depending on the occupation and skills of the people concerned. Employers, collectively, would like to see a period greater than one year.  Based on observation and experience I believe one year is reasonable.</P>
      <P>Employing people is an important decision.  Job security is important and an employer worth his salt would wish to keep somebody in employment.  There are several occupations and professions where one year is necessary to assess the suitability of the person for &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; employment.  It is a reasonable compromise, bearing in mind the demands made by employers for a period greater than one year.  In some occupations one year is necessary.</P>

      <P>I support what Senator Hillery said regarding a sensible attitude.  The Bill and many of the amendments are worthy of consideration.  However, it is easy to understand the use of the one year period, given attempts to make the legislation understandable, intelligible and sensible.  A one year time period is a fair compromise that will be accepted on all sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation relating to part-time workers was enacted about two years ago and it gave them all these rights.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Toole for moving this amendment and the Senators who have spoken on it.  I will outline the background to this section and the amendment which we are discussing.  The Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill, 1993 was introduced as a result of consultations between employers and trade unions. That is to be expected because at preparation stage one seeks to hear all the views.  The Bill was the result of a consultative process and a compromise between various points of view.</P>
      <P>Employers sought to introduce a two year period, bringing it to the UK level, while the trade unions sought to reduce it to six months.  In Denmark, a country which prides itself on its humanitarian and socially advanced legislation, the time period is one year.  Last week in Denmark I spoke informally to the Danish Minister for Labour Affairs about their legislation.  The Minister told me they have no plans to change the time period from one year.</P>
      <P>I recognise that Senator O'Toole is seeking a compromise on this issue.  Since the 1977 Act, the one year guideline has operated satisfactorily and there will be no need to come back to this House or the Dáil to change it.  I will keep a close watch on this legislation and on this provision. If in the course of my tenure of office, this issue needs to be addressed, it can be done by order of the Minister. I intend to keep a close watch on all labour legislation and to consult with the relevant bodies.  If the need arises I will attend to it but as of now, this is the best route to follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise two <Col N="211" /> further points.  I want to clarify the position regarding the employer.  I have discussed this amendment with some of them and the beauty of this legislation is that it gives a straightforward course for those who wish to challenge their dismissal. There is a similar path for employers who feel that they have acted honourably and correctly.  I have been on both sides on this matter, as chief executive of a large organisation as well as the leader of a trade union.  There is a great sense of satisfaction in knowing that one can check the stages one after the other.  The employer makes his case for dismissing the individual and it is either an acceptable position or not.  That is a help to both sides because it gives a clear position.  I do not want this to be seen solely from the worker's point of view. This is the beauty of the legislation.</P>
      <P>What about the worker who is dismissed after six months in employment? There is a view around the Chamber that, if they are less than a year in employment, they do not come under the terms of the Unfair Dismissals Act and have no recourse.  That is not the case.  Everybody has recourse to the law at any time if they feel they have been unfairly treated, discriminated against or have been the victims of some iniquitous decision.  The method of dealing with the matter is costly and cumbersome, both for the employer and the employee.  Many people who are excluded under the terms of the Act have won unfair dismissal cases, even against the State.</P>
      <P>I am trying to state the reality.  Legislation was introduced in the first place, not in response to pressure from the trade unions, but because it was a difficult area to deal with.  Those who wished to challenge a decision had to go through the cumbersome legal system.  The Minister of State talked about diminishing the level of legalism involved in such cases and I support this.  My amendment reduces that still further and is attractive to both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an opinion among many in the trade union movement that the one year system in readily understandable, but <Col N="212" /> that it is being used to exploit workers by only giving them 12-month contracts.  It does not require employers to decide if they should be retained.  There is a strong case for reducing the one year period for qualification under the Act.  Those affected can then take claims and fight against what they perceive as an unfair dismissal.  There is nothing sacrosanct about nine months either, but it is important that it be less than a year.  I would have no difficulty with 11 months.  There is a long standing Irish tradition about not using a year as a yardstick.  Those of us from rural Ireland know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Conacre agreements are never for a year.  There is precedent for using a period of less than a year for qualifying under the Act.  The 12 month provision makes it easy to retain workers on contract and instills in them a fear that they will never be made permanent.  If people dismissed after six or nine months feel that they have a grievance &mdash; they still have to prove their case &mdash; would it not be better to do it in this way rather than to have recourse to the law and clog up the courts, bringing excessive legalism into industrial relations, which does not help either side?  There is a very strong case for reducing the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me take Senator O'Toole's point concerning employees. Although there are few unscrupulous employers, reducing the qualification from nine to six months would not stop those few from reducing that by a further month and so on.  That is the way I view it.  The Senator also spoke about the employer.  I accept that he has had experience on both sides.  I can only tell the Senator what the main group representing employers told me.  They wished to make this period comparable to the UK period, which is two years.  The unions and employees wish to change it to six months.  It does not require further amendment because I intend to watch the future trend of dismissals.  I will be glad to attend to this by way of Ministerial <Col N="213" /> Order, should I see, after a close review of the Bill, there is a need to reduce it further.  For the moment, we are leaving it at 12 months.</P>

      <P>This might be already covered under the Worker Protection Act.  Many working in health boards and vocational education committees are part-time employees who are temporary and work 20 to 25 hours, or less, a week.  I know some who have worked for 15 years in health boards on this basis.  If this amendment is not covered by this Act I will press my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand why Senators Neville and Doyle put down the amendment.  It is in line with my approach on the matter and is already covered in the legislation.  The provisions of the legislation will cover temporary officers in the health boards.  Part-time temporary officers will also be covered, provided they are expected to work a minimum of eight hours per week, as set down in the worker protection Act.  The Senators' intentions are good but they have already been met.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, paragraph (b), line 33, to delete &ldquo;3&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;6&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a slightly different matter which pertains to holding someone in employment with short breaks.  I did not press the previous amendment because an employer can as easily exploit or dismiss an individual, after 11 or seven months as after 13 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to mention any specific type of employment but where a specific <Col N="214" /> skill is required for the operation of an institution, company or service it is not fair to employ workers on a one year contract.  At the end of that contract the employer may decide to let the worker go for a few months to save holiday costs, and to re-employ the worker three months later.  In a minority of cases this is done on a regular basis.  It is all too easy to exploit the contract worker.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the arguments which were made against my previous amendment there is a clear difference between six months and three months in terms of service being continued to be delivered by a company or institution; it can do without a specific skill for three months. After nine weeks an employee is recalled and a contract extended for another year. That happens.</P>
    <P>To pre-empt the Minister of State's question of the difference between three and six months, it is impossible to implement that practice on a six month basis.  If a contract worker is re-employed after three months it circumvents the Act.  The period should be reduced from six months to three months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section of the Bill is to prevent the misuse by employers of fixed term contracts. There has been some concern, as Senator O'Toole said, in recent years that fixed term contracts are being used widely by employers in an attempt to avoid liability under labour protection legislation, particularly the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  The proposal contained in this Bill will allow the relevant adjudicative authority to decide if a second or subsequent fixed term contract was justified or if it <Col N="215" /> was wholly or partly connected with the avoidance of liability under the Act.  It allows for the examination of contracts where a period of up to three months might have elapsed between the termination of the first contract and the commencement of the next.</P>
      <P>In specifying a period of three months I believe that I have been quite open to the views of the employee.  This approach is warranted because there is some evidence that fixed term contracts are being used by some employers as a device to avoid liability under the Act.  The three month period is a proper, workable length of time.  Senator O'Toole's amendment seeks to increase the period to six months, so that for the purpose of ascertaining the reasonableness of a subsequent fixed term contract, the adjudicative authority could look at two contracts between which up to six months could have elapsed.  I believe that six months is excessive and unnecessary and that three months is generally recognised as reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>While I support Senator O'Toole's amendment I have some reservations that it may be counterproductive. I agree there is exploitation with fixed term contracts at present and sections of the public service are the main culprits.  Could a situation arise now where people who have had long term employment on a monthly or three monthly contract basis have their employment terminated and not be re-employed as a way of avoiding the proposed six month stipulation?  While I fully agree with the spirit of the amendment, I wonder whether it could be counterproductive?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that if an employer intends to employ a <Col N="216" /> worker on a monthly basis, for six or 12 months or even two years as happens regularly, they may now terminate that employment after two months so as to ensure they do not come under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.

      <P>The Principal Act provides that people do not have to be contracted on a monthly basis.  Workers may be contracted to do a job which takes longer than a year but it is a fixed contract.  The time is not specified at the beginning but it is specified by the nature of the work, for example an engineer's contract to work on a bridge might last longer than a year. Section 2 (2) (b) of the Principal Act covers that issue precisely.  I want to make sure my amendment does not actually&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It has been known for health boards to employ people on short term contracts for a period of up to ten years.  The contract is renewed every month.  However, if such a body wanted to avoid its responsibility under this Act it would terminate the employment after two months and employ somebody else.  I am sounding a note of caution about counterproductivity. Employers will devise ways of avoiding their responsibility as they have done in the past.  They could do so by terminating a person's employment and employing somebody else in the same role.</P>

      <P>In the case of a person employed on a year to year basis whose contract is renewed at the end of each of two years, the employee may be let go each time and the contract not renewed for four months.  This could go on for four, five or six years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept the case the Senator is making.  The person in the sample is obviously suitable for the job, otherwise their contract would not have been renewed and yet they are let go for, say, four months in this case.  The person in question can go to either adjudicative authority, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Rights Commissioner, and ask for redress.  I hope there will be just one adjudicative authority soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that this type of amendment arises because of the trend that has developed in recent years towards contracts negotiated between employers and employees.  Am I right in saying that besides fixed term contracts? there are also fixed purpose contracts? If so, there must be reference to fixed purpose contract employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>If someone on a fixed term contract, having been &mdash; in their view &mdash; unfairly dismissed goes to the Rights Commissioner or the tribunal, can that authority decide if their contract was justified in the first instance and, if not, deal with the appeal as if there was no contract?  Is there legislation to cover that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is evidence that fixed term contracts are designed to avoid liability under the existing Act.  I am not briefed on the fixed purpose contract, but I will contact Senator Sherlock about the point he raised.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle raised the case of a person who had been on a short term contract and sought adjudication in a perceived case of unfair dismissal and asked if the authority in question would examine whether he or she should have been on a short term contract at all.  I do not think so.  A person would go to adjudication to see if they should or should not have been let go.  Whether the person should have been employed on a fixed contract basis would be the subject of another inquiry.  It may well be that the Rights Commissioner or the tribunal consider that the case deserves looking at, but the person would not have gone on that basis.  Normally, the person in question would expect adjudication on what they had put to the Rights Commissioner and not on the point raised, although I am sure it would not preclude it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not deal with my question.  If a person went to the tribunal or the Rights Commissioner, could the authority in question, having examined the case, then say a fixed term <Col N="219" /> contract had not been justified in the first place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the reason the person went to the Rights Commissioner.  A person goes to the Rights Commissioner to have a particular grievance addressed and that is adjudged.  The Senator is asking if the Rights Commissioner could then say the person should not have been on a fixed-term contract.  This would not be the correct way for the case to be dealt with. If the person wished perhaps something could be done about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two issues I wish to raise on this section and on which I intend putting down amendments on Report Stage.  However, I wish to get the Minister's view before doing that.  I am discussing section 2 of the Principal Act, In the light of experience over the past ten years, why are gardaí excluded from this Act?  There was a high profile case <Col N="221" /> where the most senior garda &mdash; and I do not want to misrepresent the situation &mdash; successfully challenged the method of his leaving office &mdash; to put it in the most polite words.  There have been a number of cases in recent years where gardaí have successfully challenged their suspension, not under the terms of the Unfair Dismissals Act but under the normal court process.  I see no reason that gardaí should not have access to this legislation.</P>
      <P>I would like to hear the Minister's views on this matter in light of the fact that, as I said earlier and will repeat <i>ad nauseam</i>, anybody can challenge their dismissal.  A person does not have to be covered by the Act to challenge the method of their dismissal in the courts, even if they are only one day in the job, have not taken up appointment, or have been there for ten years.  What interest has the State in excluding gardaí from access to appeals against unfair dismissal, and in putting them through a convoluted, cumbersome and legalistic approach to get an adjudication as to whether their dismissal was fair, unfair, legal or illegal?  How is it in the interest of the State to spend huge amounts of money on lawyers to defend its position should a garda decide to challenge his or her dismissal?  Cases of dismissal involving gardaí could be opposed &mdash; to use the Minister's words &mdash; without necessitating a huge legal team, saving money for the State and ensuring access to the law for everybody.  I am confused that the gardaí do not have access to this legislation.  There is no issue of security involved.  All that is wanted is access to the law and access to a simple system of challenge and of adjudication.  The Industrial Relations Act, 1946, excluded civil servants from a variety of labour legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are part of a new Europe and this situation does not bear close scrutiny. There is no reason a person in the Civil Service should not have this legislation. Where two people are working in the same building &mdash; one for a Member of this House and another for the Department &mdash; but both doing precisely the same job, it is unfair that one of them <Col N="222" /> has access to the Unfair Dismissals Act but the other does not.  I cannot understand this.  I did not put down an amendment at this stage because I want to hear the Minister's view.  I cannot accept that a group of workers do not have access because they are employed by the State. I discussed this with one of the employer organisations some months back and I wondered why they were not firm about this in their dealings with the State.</P>

I am referring precisely to the Principal Act which is being amended under section 3.  Section 2 (1) (e) of the Principal Act says the Act shall not apply to a member of the Garda Síochána; section 2 (2) (f) also excludes a person employed by or under the State.

      <P>The Act lays down <Col N="223" /> that the State, those employed in the Garda, the Army and the Civil Service cannot have redress under the Principal Act and the amendments to it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, neither of the Minister's arguments stand close scrutiny.  The Minister's first argument is that these people are listed in the 1946 legislation.  I do not have a copy of that legislation before me, but I am familiar with the relevant section of the 1946 Act. If the Minister looks at the list in the 1946 legislation and compares it to the list in the 1974 Discrimination Act, she will see there are differences.  For instance, teachers are included in one and not in the other.  I have an interest in that and I can assure the House what I am saying is correct.  It is not enough for the Minister to say that because a group was not included in the original legislation they should never be included.  That is a weak argument.  We are amending legislation here and that is not good enough.  Neither is it acceptable to say that these people knew their conditions of employment from the start.  That is like saying it is acceptable for people to accept discrimination because they knew they are going to be discriminated against, and they have no choice but to accept the job. I take the truth of the point the Minister <Col N="224" /> made but I do not accept it is a valid argument.</P>
      <P>It is unacceptable to offer somebody a job &mdash; as a garda, for example &mdash; and tell them they will not have access to the Unfair Dismissals Act, and then say that in taking the job, they have chosen not to be covered by the Act.  Both the Minister and I know that is not the way to do business.  It is not fair to deny civil servants or gardaí access to the law.  It does not help the operation of the Civil Service or the Garda.</P>
      <P>The Garda said last week they are being discriminated against by being denied the right to form a trade union and the right to strike.  I am not going to discuss that but I will say they should have access to the law as it applies to other workers.  The Minister has not given me a reason they should not.  Why do they not have access to the law now? Why did they not have access in 1946? Rather than tell me that the list was put together in 1946, the Minister should give me a fair response and say that we will look at it on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know the argument Senator O'Toole made is a very good one.  The practice itself is discriminatory. Where does it come from? We all know it comes from the British precedent.  They make a habit of this niggardly, miserable, wretched, parsimonious practice of excluding sections of society from the operations of civilisation.  I regret that we should follow this practice.  The Minister's first point was that these people are excluded because they come under categories excluded in the original Bill. It really is not appropriate because we are amending the legislation.  It is the kind of argument that used to infuriate me when I argued with my brother; when I won a point I would say, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; and he would say, &ldquo;That is the why&rdquo;.  The Minister has just said, &ldquo;That is the why&rdquo;, but it is not a satisfactory &ldquo;why&rdquo; as far as I am concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point made by Senator O'Toole is an extremely good one.  Why should civil servants be unfairly dismissed without recourse to exactly the same procedures that ordinary citizens have?  The point he made was unanswerable.  There may be <Col N="226" /> people working in the same office, under the same conditions, and doing the same work and yet, because one is technically employed by the Civil Service, he or she has no recourse under this legislation. There should be equality, and this is a Minister who has a finely attuned sense of the civilised requirements of equality. I am very surprised that the Garda, the Defence Forces and civil servants should be so excluded.  There is no cogent reason, in the interests of the State, that they should be discriminated against.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not labour the point but I fully support Senator O'Toole in his statement.  There is no reason civil servants should be excluded.  It is ludicrous that officers of a health board are excluded but employees of the health board are not.  The fitter or porter in a hospital is included but the nurse is not. That does not make sense.  There is a lot of tidying up to be done.  I support fully what Senator O'Toole said with regard to public servants, the Garda, Army and civil servants in general.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I did not make it clear enough that each of the three bodies to which the Senator refers <Col N="227" /> has its own internal disciplinary measures.  The Garda Síochána has recourse to these measures in times such as the Senator outlined.  The Army has recourse to Courts-martial.  They have procedures to which other groups covered by the legislation do not have recourse.</P>
      <P>Regarding civil servants, this legislation was circulated to all the unions which represent various grades in the Civil Service.  One must take representative groups as being the voice of the constituents they represent.  They did not say they wished to be covered by the terms of the Unfair Dismissals Bill.  I have first hand knowledge of this.</P>
      <P>The Garda and Army have internal measures.  Everybody has the right to go to court should they so wish.  Listening to Senator Sherlock, one would think that people in those three sectors had no rights to go to a court; that is patently not so.</P>
      <P>Senator Sherlock mentioned the role of independent chairpersons.  We are not addressing that issue at present but I would be pleased to discuss it at a later stage.  I have strong views on the issue which would not be far from the Senator's own.</P>

      <P>I would like to comment on what the Minister said.  She is miring herself in further inadequacies as she speaks.  She has certainly clarified that there is no good argument for placing civil servants, the Garda and Army in the invidious situation where they only have recourse to an internal mechanism of complaint against unfair dismissal.  This is rubbish.  Suppose my distinguished colleague, Senator Quinn, dismissed somebody from his supermarket and it was discovered to be unfair.  I very much doubt if this could ever happen because he is such a charming man, but just take it as a theoretical case.  Is the Minister saying to the House that Senator Quinn should then sit in judgment as to whether his own dismissal procedures were fair? It is a complete nonsense.  Lewis Carroll had it to a T: &ldquo;&lsquo;I will be judge, I will be <Col N="228" /> jury&rsquo;, said cunning old fury, &lsquo;I will try the whole case and condemn you to death&rsquo;&rdquo;. This is what the Minister is recommending. There must be independent complaints and unfair dismissal commissions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to address the area I raised, especially with regard to local authorities, health boards and vocational education committees. There can be two different groups of people employed by the same body, one of which has redress under the Unfair Dismissals Act because they are officers while the other has not because of being employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That point was raised by Senator O'Toole, it is not new. Senator O'Toole may not have spelt out the vocational education committees or health boards, but it is still the same point about having two people in one office where one has the right of redress under this Bill and the other has not.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris spoke about Senator Quinn sitting in judgment on the legitimacy or otherwise of dismissing his own employee.  The Garda and the Army have internal procedures to which they have redress.  In the Army there is what is called &ldquo;a right of redress&rdquo;.  Under this system an Army man makes out his case, and goes before a board where he is accompanied and represented.  I am speaking from my constituency knowledge now, not from any labour knowledge. Quite properly, the Army has its representative organisation.  Senator Hillery and Deputy Lenihan, the then Minister for Defence, worked together on bringing that system to fruition, despite a lot of opposition.  The Army has, and not by way of patronage, a decent, fair representative group to protect its interests, as well as having the right of redress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda has its internal disciplinary organisation and, judging by their conferences, <Col N="229" /> the gardaí are well able through their associations and organisations, to put forward their points, and be represented and heard in a proper fashion. I do not have anything further to add. This debate could go on forever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point which has to be addressed.  We are making fish of one and flesh of another.  Where we are working at the moment, there are people sharing an office and while they are not doing the same job they are doing similar work.  In some cases they have access to the legislation on unfair dismissals and in other cases they do not. There is something seriously wrong with that.  It is not sufficient to suggest that people have internal means of redress against dismissal.  That means they must go through these internal procedures before they have recourse to a series of laws other than the Unfair Dismissals Act.  If somebody wants to challenge a dismissal further, having gone through internal procedures, why can they not use this Act?  Why do they have to pursue avenues such as a judicial review or an appeal under the principles of natural justice or under some aspect of common law?</P>
      <P>These concerns are also applicable to the Garda.  The Minister makes one telling point in her response, namely that this is not the position of the representative groups of those workers such as the Garda.  They have not put forward any view that they want it done differently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I cannot accept this legislation as it stands.  My father was a garda. I do not accept that he should not have had access to the law if he had been unfairly dismissed.  He was not, of course, dismissed, although he was moved very suddenly from Dublin to Dingle.  I intend to talk to the representative groups of all <Col N="230" /> those workers and on Report Stage I will have a very clear view.</P>
      <P>I am opposing this section.  I did not put down an amendment in order to reserve my position until Report Stage. I want the Minister to have the opportunity of assuring this House that an amendment will be introduced on Report Stage.  It is insufficient that people should have access to an internal remedy or tribunal but that they should not have access to this law.  All workers should be treated equally under the law.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Garda, I might add that the old saying, &ldquo;Who guards the guards?&rdquo; gives a new meaning to this legislation.  The Minister should introduce measures on Report Stage to deal with this area.  A guarantee to that effect would be acceptable.  As it is, the Minister's proposal is unfair.</P>

      <P>May I make a point which I do not believe has been considered? Is the Senator aware of the only way in which a civil servant can be dismissed? The only way a civil servant can be dismissed is by the collective voice of the Cabinet.  That is the stated position. I was five years in Cabinet and in that time there were two such cases.  Details are circulated to each Government Minister with all the background and a judgment is made.  The process is embarked on reluctantly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am stating the fact. Part of my time here is spent on stating facts as they arise and that is a clear fact. There are other procedures.  We have considered internal procedures, disciplinary regulations and courts martial. These are within the context of and underpinned by laws and regulations. Senator O'Toole is aware of this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole has referred to the internal procedures. These procedures have been negotiated between the management and qualified representatives on the employee side. They are negotiated agreements underpinned <Col N="231" /> by statute and they should not be seen merely as internal procedures.  They are jointly negotiated as opposed to unilaterally imposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is beside the point. Looking at the reports of the conference last week of the Garda Representative Association there are many things which have been negotiated with which they do not agree.  Furthermore, there are many things which they want which they are not allowed by statute.</P>
      <P>The Minister advised, I understand, that people in the Defence Forces can only be dismissed by court martial and that is covered by law.  Whilst I understand the court martial position is covered by law, I certainly did not understand that people could only be dismissed by court martial.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has chosen to take me up incorrectly.  What I said was each person in the Defence Forces has access to a system called the &ldquo;Redress of Wrongs&rdquo;.  If a soldier, male or female, decides that he or she has been wrongly treated in any respect, for example if they have been sent to another barracks or have had time docked or have been otherwise punished for some deed, they have recourse to this system.  It is very detailed and precise and the soldier can be represented at deliberations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether or not there is a redress of wrongs system or other such mechanism, I have yet to hear the case as to why a soldier or garda or civil servant cannot get access to the same procedures as this legislation offers other workers.  I believe that to be completely wrong. They should have access to these procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unimpressive that the Cabinet might be drawn into the dismissal of a civil servant.  I am appalled to hear it. <Col N="232" /> It is a poor way of doing business.  All workers should have at least the choice of access to the procedures offered by this legislation.  No judge or tribunal in the land would accept the use of the law until all internal remedies have been exhausted.  If there are internal remedies they would require to be used beforehand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister as always is informative and educational and I willingly admit that I had no idea that the Cabinet has to decide on the dismissal of a civil servant.  I am horrified and appalled that this should be the case.  It is an utter waste of the Cabinet's time. Does this mean the dismissal of a postmistress requires a Cabinet decision?</P>

      <P>As always, Senator Norris is over playing the situation.  If the Senator believes that every Tuesday the Cabinet discusses civil servants he is entirely incorrect.  Such cases are extremely rare, perhaps one or two in five years.  I think since the legislation or regulation came in that one case at most was dealt with at Cabinet.  I was not there at the time.  It is farcical for the Senator to suggest that the Cabinet discusses these things every week.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 4 is a Government amendment.  Amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 4 and amendment No. 6 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 26 to 29, to delete paragraph (a) and substitute the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) the substitution in subsection (2) of the following paragraphs for paragraph (e):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(e) the race, colour or sexual orientation of the employee,</P>
      <P>(ee) the age of the employee,&rsquo;,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give the background and the context to this amendment before I deal with it.  Senator Quinn put down an amendment which reads:</P>
      <P>In page 6, paragraph (a), between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f) the age of the employee, provided the employee is less than the normal retiring age and is capable of carrying out the duties of the employment,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn's amendment forms the basis for the Government amendment which I am putting forward.  One might ask why I did not just accept Senator Quinn's amendment as it is admirable.  I wanted to accept but did not because we wanted to frame it in the correct legal terminology.  I am aware of the positive motivation behind Senator Quinn's <Col N="235" /> amendment and I fully accept the principle that gave rise to it.</P>
    <P>The wording of the Government amendment is, I am advised, in the correct format to achieve the Senator's aim. The scope of the Government amendment is, like that proposed by Senator Quinn, limited by such factors as normal retirement age and capability of the employee to perform the duties for which he or she is employed.  In other words this amendment is governed by section 2 (1) (b) of the Principal Act, which excluded from the scope of the legislation employees who have reached normal retirement age or are over the age of 66 years, and by section 6 (4) of the Principal Act which deems a dismissal not to be unfair if it results wholly or mainly from matters such as the capability, competence or qualifications of the employee for performing work of the kind for which he or she was employed.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I am pleased to put forward this amendment and to state clearly that it is influenced by the amendment which Senator Quinn put forward and to which I gave my support.  I felt strongly that there was a need for precise wording. I will deal later with amendments which Senator O'Toole has put down with regard to cultural and social background and such matters and will explain why they will be for other legislation.  I wanted to take this amendment as it is quite precise.  Age is a precise matter; a person's age is on a birth certficate and most people will tell the truth about it.  At least I find that women usually tell the truth about it.</P>
    <P>The amendment has been put in terms which, we were assured by the parliamentary draftspeople are correct.  It is Senator Quinn's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure our spouses are welcome as well.</P>
      <P>When I was in America some years ago my attention was drawn to an article which described how, in the fifties, the word &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; was understood to mean discrimination on the basis of colour only.  By the seventies, after that battle had been won, discrimination was understood to mean gender discrimination. According to that article the battle against gender discrimation has been almost won and by the late eighties it was anticipated that the battle would be against age discrimination.  In Ireland we have not recognised that this is a basis for discrimination.</P>
      <P>I proposed this amendment in view of the movement towards equality in employment as well as equality in other areas of life.  Any list of categories against which the employer cannot discriminate will nowadays include age.  Our unfair dismissals legislation should reflect that fact and I appreciate the Minister's recognition of it.  We should take the opportunity to include age when we are broadening the categories of discrimination. That issue is of serious concern to many people in their fifties.  There is a belief that people of that age have exhausted their usefulness and should be replaced by younger people.  If this happens through early retirement with the agreement of the employee, that is all right.  However, sometimes people in their fifties are laid off or made redundant against their will simply because of their age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If people can do their job properly they have the right to continue working and <Col N="237" /> my amendment sought to protect that right.  I am pleased the Minister recognised this and I am pleased with her speedy response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In the third line of the amendment, after &ldquo;colour&rdquo; to insert, &ldquo;cultural background&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the inclusion of discrimination on the grounds of race, colour and sexual orientation in this Bill.  It is landmark legislation and the Minister and the Department should be congratulated on such progress.  It is also welcome that any traces of ageism will be removed.</P>
      <P>I wish to include the traveller community, a group which suffers discrimination on a regular basis, in the Act. I have worked closely with travellers for a number of years and I recently launched a book, <i>Do You Know Us at All</i>, about the culture of travellers.  The title of the book is a quotation from a well known Irish traveller who, having discussed travellers with various people in the community, said &ldquo;sure they do not know us at all&rdquo;.  A friend of mine &mdash; a traveller woman &mdash; was in tears one night because she could not get a hotel booking for her daughter's wedding reception.  There are numerous tales of travellers not being served in public houses and not having access to various services.  Such incidents undermine Ireland's attempts at pluralism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is almost 100 per cent unemployment in the traveller community. There are no opportunities for employment and the community feels excluded. I want travellers to be included and this amendment attempts to do that.  It is <Col N="238" /> equally unacceptable that a person who may be barred from a premises because he or she is a traveller may also be dismissed or not offered employment for that reason.  Having heard the Minister's views I know she would also consider it unacceptable.</P>
    <P>As we have a Minister for Equality it is important that we include equality measures in legislation to ensure that it complies with the objectives of Government. No reasonable person could object to this amendment.  It does not create difficulty for anybody in management or in the workforce, and it is a gesture which affords recognition to the travelling community. As a group they are trying to address their problems, to explain themselves to the public and they want to be an integral part of Irish society.  It is important that legislation should include them.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I understood that the traveller community was included in the legislation.  It was not, regrettably.  I ask that this amendment be accepted as there is no cost implication and it affects a group that is discriminated against in employment.</P>

Senator Doyle is correct.  I apologise to him and I withdraw my remark.</P>
      <P>I congratulate my colleague Senator Quinn.  It is a remarkable achievement, so early in his term as a Senator, to have a substantial and important amendment so graciously accepted by a Minister.  Discrimination on the basis of age is disgraceful.</P>

      <P>I am sure I have many failings, a Chathaoirligh which you have unremittingly brought to my attention in the most Christian way.</P>
      <P>Discrimination on the basis of age is an important matter.  However, I have a different view of the situation.  I have been teaching in Trinity for 26 years, since I was about 22.  I would approve of &mdash; and perhaps the Government would consider it &mdash; releasing people from work after 30 years.  I am expected to teach for a total of 45 years and I have the same pension rights as somebody who has taught for only 30 years.  That is abominable. However, it is my little gripe.</P>
      <P>With regard to the section, I am proud that this Government has been far sighted enough to include discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  I pioneered the argument in this area and it relates directly to what Senator O'Toole said about discrimination against members of the travelling community. My amendments to the video Bill and the incitement to hatred Bill introduced the idea of paired series of groups liable to discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator O'Toole's amendment. I am not quite sure why the amendment is so broad; &ldquo;cultural background&rdquo; could mean a person from Foxrock or from Ballybough.  I would like the people from Ballybough, Sean MacDermott Street and Dublin 1, where I live, to be protected.  There is real discrimination on the basis of address which was clearly indicated, to my amusement, when middle class apartments were built in the north inner city, on &ldquo;handbag corner&rdquo; in Sean MacDermott Street.  The contractors were careful to rename Sean MacDermott Street and it has now become Upper Cathal Brugha Street.  I strongly support the motivations behind this amendment.  In the original amendments which I moved and which were ultimately successful, I specified discrimination based on sexual orientation and/or membership of the travelling community. <Col N="240" /> I wonder if Senator O'Toole has cogent reasons for altering the wording.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have cogent reasons.  There are other minorities in the country and there is an incipient racism in Irish society which worries members of Government.  I was trying to include other sections of society, as well as the travelling community.</P>

      <P>Cork people in Dublin are not discriminated against.</P>
      <P>Ireland is becoming more pluralist, as people from other nations with different cultural backgrounds settle here.  Therefore, I should also deal with those.  My amendment mainly relates to members of the travelling community.  I would be happy to withdraw it if it would be dealt with on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>This issue does not impinge on the Principal Act or create a difficulty for either side of the House.  Therefore, I ask the Minister of State to consider addressing this point, perhaps following consultation with the Department of Equality and Law Reform, with a view to introducing changes on Report Stage. I do not believe that this issue can be dealt with by the Department of Equality and Law Reform except in a general consolidated Bill which would make reference to all other Bills and make the issue more complicated.  This is the place to deal with it and it is clear from the explanatory memorandum of the Bill what we are trying to address.</P>
      <P>I would be happy to discuss membership of the travelling community if that is more acceptable to the Minister of State.  I broadened it out because I was looking ahead.  In Ireland now there are different cultures reflecting different backgrounds and communities.  I am worried in case racism develops; I was trying to deal with that.  Perhaps I was trying to do too much.  I am happy to deal with membership of the travelling community only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy for us not to discriminate on the basis of race or colour as we do not have race or colour problems. However, we have a problem with discrimination against travelling people. Whatever the words are or need to be, I am sure the Minister of State will give proper consideration to them.  I am sure the support of the House will be available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the sentiments expressed by Senator O'Toole.  The Government appointed a Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, and he is currently preparing equal status legislation and employment equality legislation.  My Department has had meetings with the Department of Equality and Law Reform, both at ministerial and official levels.  The matter has been well discussed.  We have been told that the Minister will embrace these issues in employment equality legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept what Senator O'Toole and the other Senators have said on this issue. Senator Norris and Senator O'Toole want to know what wording will be used. Will it be &ldquo;cultural origin&rdquo;, &ldquo;cultural background&rdquo;, &ldquo;ethnic origin&rdquo;, &ldquo;social origin&rdquo; or &ldquo;travelling community&rdquo;? These terms have been considered. During my meeting with Deputy Taylor, we discussed suitable terminology.  We wanted to find the terminology which would best encapsulate the views we all share in relation to this matter.  The Minister, his officials and his advisers are currently examining other legislation so as to find the best terminology which would <Col N="242" /> not be ambivalent and which would be understood by employers, employees and the adjudicative authorities.  I am aware of these developments because I had a meeting with Deputy Taylor when we talked extensively about this matter.</P>
    <P>Senators may say I accepted the amendment related to &ldquo;the age of the employee&rdquo;.  However, age is precise and retirement age is clearly indicated. Therefore, the amendment could not be open to other interpretations.  We want to get the best interpretation of this wording so that it will embrace all of our concerns.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform Deputy Taylor has the necessary expertise available to him and is pursuing that path.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that Senators cannot discuss this matter on Report Stage; I am saying that the Minister has already considered this matter.  Equal status legislation and employment equality legislation are being prepared and Deputy Taylor wishes to use the correct terminology in employment equality legislation.  We do not want to settle for a wording, whether &ldquo;cultural origin&rdquo;, &ldquo;travelling community&rdquo; or &ldquo;social background&rdquo;, which might not be the right one.  It is for the Senators to decide which way they wish to pursue this issue; we are all <i>ad idem</i> upon it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the careful response of the Minister of State on this issue and I would like to make one point. It is important that these phrases are automatically included in future legislation. The terminology &ldquo;sexual orientation and/or membership of the travelling community&rdquo; was satisfactory in previous legislation.  Once it becomes uncoupled, the travelling community could be dropped as an automatic component. I hope these phrases will be automatically included in future legislation, including, I hope, an anti-discrimination Bill.  I am concerned that sexual orientation and/or the travelling community, which are related, should remain coupled in case those drafting future Bills follow the example of this Bill because it is the latest one, and accept the wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> Senator O'Toole and Senator Quinn made some important points.  We do not have coloured minorities but we do have cultural minorities.  Perhaps it would be better to include membership of the travelling community and cultural background as they are distinct categories.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot articulate to the Minister the views of the travelling community. They will not understand this decision.  It is difficult to explain to a traveller the views of a hotel manager, who returned a deposit when she discovered the individual is a member of the travelling community.  It is difficult to explain to a mother that her child can only go to the local disco when she receives a pass from the local gardaí.  This is Irish society today.</P>
      <P>This is an opportunity for the Minister of State to display a caring approach. Although I know the Minister of State's views on this matter, travellers do not. What has caused these people to feel different from everyone else?</P>
      <P>This legislation does not accommodate difference.  It reinforces exclusion and facilitates discrimination.  The Minister does not want to do this; I know her views on this issue.  Travellers are not recognisable by the colour of their hair or by particular mannerisms.  Many travellers are organised and they may have undistinguishable accents.  Often the background of a traveller in employment may remain undiscovered. However, they do experience a sense of insecurity.  Do people realise the lengths to which travellers go in order to be dealt with like ordinary people?  I know of two travellers who have glasses with plain lenses.  They may get casual work and go to pubs because nobody believes travellers wear glasses.  That is why this legislation is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A traveller who breaks down barriers, including educational barriers and finds employment fears dismissal if her or his background is discovered.  They cannot celebrate their cultural background. They cannot tell people they made it <Col N="244" /> because their background is always a dark secret.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to address this situation and to say why this amendment cannot be accepted.  I am prepared to speak with the people in the Department of Equality and Law Reform if the Minister of State agrees to deal with this issue, in consultation with them, on Report Stage.  It would be an important gesture which would make a difference to those working with the travelling community and would enable leaders of the travelling community to say to their people that there are people in authority who care.  It would give these people the ability and incentive to seek sustainable employment.</P>

      <P>The words you used were &ldquo;facilitates discrimination&rdquo;.  In the couching of this Bill &mdash; and it has been duly noted and regarded by all &mdash; we deliberately removed any discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  When the history of the Houses is written I hope there will be a piece which will say: &ldquo;Yes, she was the person who broke through <Col N="245" /> the door on that particular matter.&rdquo;  I refute what the Senator said in relation to discrimination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>The Senator said this Bill facilitates discrimination.  It does not facilitate discrimination.  It removes an important item of discrimination.  That is the point.  The Senator may not realise this.  The Bill abolishes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  That is not a facilitation of discrimination; it is a clearance of discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Senator agrees with me.  Secondly, on the question of age, I was pleased to accept this amendment.  It was a clear case of discrimination and Senator Quinn's amendment was appropriate.  Age is a precise measurement, which nobody can dispute. We all support attempts to remove discrimination on the basis of social, ethnic or cultural background.  However, we were unable to reach agreement on a precise wording which was acceptable to all.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole is not the only one who is familiar with the travelling community. We all meet members of the travelling community during the course of our constituency work.  We are aware of the measures that have to be taken by the Government in relation to housing, educational and social welfare matters. The travelling community wish to be treated like everyone else.  They want nothing more or nothing less.  Surely that is their right under our Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the Government appointed Deputy Taylor to review discrimination against women, the disabled and the travelling community and to make provision for equality in employment. I hope this task will be carried out <Col N="246" /> correctly.  Deputy Taylor will incorporate any changes that are required in his legislation. The Government does not seek to facilitate discrimination, it seeks to remove it.  Deputy Taylor's legislation will be absolute and accurate in its attempts to eliminate discrimination.  He has the expertise, the research and the necessary qualified people to enable this to be done.</P>
    <P>Nobody has a province on concern for minorities.  Given the nature of this House and the background of its Members, I would be surprised if there was one Member who did not feel as strongly about this matter as those who have spoken.  One does not need a special axe to grind; we all feel the same about the matter.</P>
    <P>As a legislator, I do not want to insert a wording which can be so interpreted as to discriminate against a group not included by the wording.  If one legislates solely for the travelling community, then what about ethnic minorities and others of different social origins?</P>
    <P>Those living in affluent areas may discriminate against travellers and others simply because of their address.  I know of many in my town who cannot find a job because they live in a particular area and would put a relative's address on an application form to improve their chances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the greatest form of discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  That should not be allowed.  Why insert a narrower definition when the broader one embraces all groupings?  I do not want to facilitate discrimination, but to tear it away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid a slight touch of sharpness has entered an otherwise very good humoured and informative debate.  The Minister of State in the beginning may have slightly misheard or misinterpreted what Senator O'Toole said because he did not say that the Minister either facilitated or intended to facilitate discrimination.  He did say that <Col N="247" /> the Bill facilitated discrimination.  He did not say that it sought or intended to facilitate this.  He probably meant that, because of the incidental exclusion of a phrase, which had become almost routine because of the foresight of Government &mdash; of which the Minister of State is a member &mdash; it might appear to the travelling community that this legislation constituted some kind of discrimination. In a sense, the perception of discrimination is real to the person who believes himself to be discriminated against, despite the Minister of State's complete disavowal of an intention to discriminate.  No Member of this House would imagine for one moment that the Minister of State would wish to facilitate discrimination of any kind.  That has not been my experience nor Senator O'Toole's experience and it would be nonsensical to say so.  I went out of my way to state my appreciation, as a member of the gay community, of the courageous and forward looking inclusion of the sexual orientation clauses by Government, without amendment by me.  That is a remarkable, historic and brave action for Government.  The Minister of State, however, has not answered the point I made, which is a neutral one about uncoupling an existing formula of words.  In the light of that point, the Minister of State might be prepared to accept a variation of Senator O'Toole's amendment &mdash; my original wording in the previous legislation &mdash; which was sexual orientation and/or membership of the travelling community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>But where does that leave discrimination on the basis of address?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister of State and it was I who raised that issue in my earlier contribution when I spoke about Dublin 1, where I live.  I was delighted with her vigour and firmness in taking that up.  The Minister of State is clearly concerned about this area and is leaving that margin of appreciation so <Col N="248" /> that it can be properly opened up in discussions between herself and the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  However, that is not sufficient reason for removing a previously accepted formula of words &mdash; sexual orientation and/or the travelling community &mdash; but I completely accept the Minister of State's bona fides in wishing to further expand on this matter and honour her sensitivity.  There is no reason to retract the scope of previous clauses in legislation merely because the Minister of State proposes to expand it subsequently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not withdraw my words any more but will repeat them so that the Minister of State can interpret them and I ask her to listen carefully.  I did not say that this Bill seeks to facilitate; those are the words of the Minister of State and the record will show that. What I did say is that the Bill &mdash; I will repeat it &mdash; facilitates discrimination.  The word &ldquo;facilitates&rdquo; is not an active word, but a passive one.  It means to make facile or easy; in this case, the process of discrimination. I said that, after having earlier said that this Bill removed discrimination in many other places.  I would like the Minister of State to consider <Col N="249" /> the example I gave whereby, if someone has found employment and is then dismissed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation facilitates the dismissal of an individual solely on the grounds of being a traveller.  It allows discrimination to take place not actively, but passively.  The word is clear and I use it in the correct context.  I wrote three words down before I stood up to speak and that was one of them.  Neither the Minister of State nor the Bill seek to discriminate.  This means that travellers cannot, after having found employment, talk about their background &mdash; it has to remain a dark secret.  There is a clear difference and if the Minister of State refuses to see the difference, there is nothing I can do.  I stand over my words. I did not say that the absence of these words is intended to be used in that way, but their absence makes discrimination possible.</P>
      <P>I cannot deal with the other areas of discrimination that the Minister of State referred to and do not seek to do that.  I seek to cover the travelling community only.  My arguments on the matter stand up and I admit I have an axe to grind on this issue.  Therefore, I am somewhat subjective in my approach.  All I ask of the Minister of State is that she consider the points I have made and address them on Report Stage, following consultation with the Department of Equality and Law Reform to ensure there is no conflict. It is a reasonable request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As a legislator, I want to make as few mistakes as possible.  My fear would be that this narrower legislation we all approve of would exclude others discriminated against, on the basis of social or cultural background.  By coupling the travelling community and sexual orientation together as another form of discrimination would, to use the Senator's own words, facilitate other forms of discrimination.  The Senator says this Bill would facilitate discrimination <Col N="250" /> against travellers because it does not mention them and I do not want to preside over a Bill which has that effect.</P>

      <P>Everybody agrees that discrimination should be eliminated in all areas and I welcome the sections in the Bill which do this.  I agree with Senator O'Toole but I want to make the point that under current legislation the tribunal would find the dismissal unfair if somebody was dismissed on the grounds of sexual orientation, colour, creed or membership of the travelling community.  It is important to have that enshrined in legislation but the current practice is that they would be found to have been unfairly dismissed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

She has said she does not want to preside over any Bill which is imperfect.  The Minister said she does not want to discriminate against any group by including them.

It would be a pity if we tried to score points on this because I know the Minister is a person of genuine goodwill on this issue.  However, I find the logic of what she said specious; I do not understand the argument fully.  Senator Honan made a very good point that the Minister said she does not want to discriminate against any group by including a group. Including a group does not discriminate against any group but reduces the bulk level of discrimination.  If one was to accept the Minister's argument it would operate directly against the entire section.  In other words, we must specify minutely every potential, hypothetical, marginalised group in society&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I support what Senator Norris said.  The Minister is noted for her good temper and sweet nature, like myself, and I appeal to her to recognise the value of including every possible group.  She stated, correctly, that no one has a corner on compassion for the travelling community.</P>
      <P>We all deal with travellers and do our best for them.  Again I plead my inexperience in the House but would it be possible for the Minister after consideration, to introduce an amendment to this effect on Report Stage?  If so, no answer need be given today.</P>

      <P>I wish to reply to the Minister.  I used the phrase &ldquo;cultural background&rdquo; to cover all the areas she dealt with.  I appreciate that it may be too vague but my prime consideration was the travelling community.  I will withdraw this amendment.  I am not asking for a commitment at this stage but if the Minister is prepared to consider the inclusion of the travelling community on Report Stage, we could make progress.</P>

      <P>We all went off at different tangents and ended up talking about the travelling community.  The phrase in the amendment &ldquo;cultural background&rdquo; is, in my view, imprecise.  How does one define &ldquo;cultural background&rdquo;? We all have a cultural background.  If the intention is to include the travelling community, that is a separate matter at which we would be prepared to look on Report Stage, but I do not want vague wording.</P>

      <P>Perhaps we can deal with this on Report Stage when I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Taylor, and the officials, it would be a good idea for Senator O'Toole also to speak to them if he wishes.  &ldquo;Social background&rdquo; is more precise than &ldquo;cultural background&rdquo;. &ldquo;Cultural background&rdquo; is a very vague term under which all sorts of claims could be involved.  The Government will look at the matter but the wording must be precise.</P>

      <P>We are discussing an amendment to Government amendment No. 4.  Is the amendment to the amendment being pressed?</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 4, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) the deletion of all words from and including &lsquo;unless&mdash;&rsquo; down to and including &lsquo;notwithstanding pregnancy.&rsquo; in paragraph (f) of subsection (2).&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a matter of critical importance which reflects a flaw in the legislation.  I am attempting in this amendment to cover dismissals relating to pregnancy. Under the original legislation the pregnancy of an employee cannot be used as a reason for dismissal, unless the employee is unable, by reason of the pregnancy, to do the work for which she was employed.  That affects nurses or others who do physical work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is in breach of European law. <Col N="255" /> I have a copy of a European Council Directive of 19 October 1992 which states:</P>
    <P>Member states shall take the necessary measures to prohibit the dismissal of workers within the meaning of Article 2 during the period from the beginning of their pregnancy to the end of their maternity leave.</P>
    <P>That is specific and there is no room for manoeuvre.  If this amendment is not accepted the legislation will ignore the EC Directive.</P>
    <P>Even if there was no such directive, I would still take the view that the dismissal of a worker because she could not do the work for which she was employed during pregnancy is unacceptable.  There are other solutions, for example, a woman could, perhaps, take leave without pay, but dismissal because one is pregnant can never be acceptable.</P>
    <P>It is also discriminatory because it can apply only to women.  The courts have taken the view that because it does not discriminate against all women, just pregnant women, it may not be discriminatory. I am taking a case at the moment in another area to disprove that. Because pregnancy only affects women, discriminating against somebody who is pregnant is, in effect, discrimination on the grounds of sex.</P>
    <P>That is a peripheral argument; the central argument is that it is wrong &mdash; and must be seen to be wrong &mdash; that a woman can lose her job because of her pregnancy. The supporting argument is that there is a European Directive on which the State is required to act.  It specifically says what the State is required to do and the Minister of State is the competent authority to ensure the directive is put in place.  Clearly, this Bill, the Principal Act and the EC Directive are concerned with dismissal.  The State is required to accede to that directive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>When I got responsibility for labour affairs I also sought the responsibility to translate that directive into legislation, which must be done <Col N="256" /> before October 1994.  However, the Government in its wisdom decided it was in the remit of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor.  I sought responsibility for the directive for the reasons Senator O'Toole gave.  As a woman I believed I believed I was in a better position to handle it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>To be frank, I wanted responsibility for that and for the directive dealing with adoptive leave.

      <P>I welcome the Minister's remarks.  She has once again indicated her goodwill and accepted the cogency of Senator O'Toole's arguments.  He referred to section 6 of the 1977 Act.  It seems to me that non-acceptance of the amendment would negate the thrust towards paid maternity leave, because the only reason for dismissing somebody on the basis that their pregnancy interfered with their physical capacity to do their work would be during the period of the pregnancy.</P>
      <P>I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights for six years, and I know that the thrust of the movement for women's equality is that people should be entitled to paid maternity leave.  If this amendment is not accepted to update the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, it will go completely against the notion of paid maternity leave.  I was glad to hear what the Minister of State said, it encourages me to believe she will consider positively the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am very concerned about this.  This has been what the Americans call a learning experience for me today. I learned about microphones, I learned about Cabinet decisions about postmistresses and now that the Minister of State is not able to do perfectly logical things because they are the responsibility of another Minister.  It seems absolutely daft.  Why can we not amend the Bill?  To approach it another way, why can the Minister of State not tell the Minister for Equality and Law Reform that the intelligent people in Seanad Éireann anticipated his goodwill and ask him if he is trying to block progress?  I am sure there is no friction between him and such a sweet-tempered Minister.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about this unnecessary grid lock in legislation. Regardless of the government's decision, there is nothing illegal, unconstitutional &mdash; or improper in a Parliamentary sense &mdash; or irregular in terms of draftmanship, in accepting Senator O'Toole's amendment. I doubt if the Minister for Equality and Law Reform would cavil at its acceptance.</P>

The Minister and I were in Dublin Castle some months ago for the announcement of the Report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, and on Report Stage I will read the section from that report dealing with this area.  I regret that I did not make reference to it in my initial presentation.  The Government is committed to acting on this report and this legislation does not reflect that commitment. That is a passive position.  This legislation does not implement the EC directive governing this area.  This brings the whole legislative process into disrepute. That is unacceptable.

The wording the Minister uses may be different; I have no difficulty with that.

It would reflect badly on the legislative process were we not to amend the legislation, unless there was some compelling reason this should not <Col N="260" /> happen.  There is no compelling reason at this time.  We need to look at those two issues.  I believe the Minister agrees with me.  We need to establish how this issue should be addressed and that the Minister intends to bring in an amendment on Report Stage.

      <P>My intentions are good, but it may not be possible to realise them.  I have made that very clear in the House.  The final implementation date is October 1994, although one should not be always dragged screaming to the altar. The legislation would not be illegal or against the thrust of the Directive in that respect.  Notwithstanding that I saw it clearly as a labour need and as a matter to be dealt with under employment legislation. Others thought otherwise.  I freely admit that.  To enable us to have proper consultation and, hopefully, to make this change, we will discuss the matter again on Report Stage.  Thank you, Senator, for withdrawing your amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made the point that report of the Commission on the Status of Women need not have been accepted by the Government.  There was no point accepting it if none of the recommendations is to be considered.  This is important because not only is dismissal from a job at issue here, but the career structure of a woman in employment could be destroyed by her dismissal from a job because of pregnancy.  How do we know that people in various branches of <Col N="261" /> the health services, who already complain about the amount of time people take on maternity leave will not decide that the woman involved is not suitable for the job because she is pregnant?  I urge the Minister to go back to the Government and say she had a great deal of trouble with this section.</P>

      <P>In page 6, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) the insertion of the following paragraph in subsection (2):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(g) the conduct of the employee's private life in matters which do not impinge on the employee's capacity to discharge all duties required in the employment.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Senator Sherlock referred to a case in Wexford some years ago in which I was involved.  There is a thin line, which I recognise and try to deal with in this amendment, between where a person's private life might impinge on his or her professional work.  I have tried to introduce a clear understanding that the conduct of an employee's private life in matters which do not impinge on the employee's capacity to discharge all duties in regard to employment, etc., should be part of the Bill.</P>
      <P>A person's private life is remote from the world of work.  I have, however, included in amendment No. 7 the words &ldquo;in matters which do not impinge on the employee's capacity to discharge all duties&rdquo; because I recognise that there may well be situations in which something in a person's private life may be utterly incompatible with a person's working life.  As a general principle a person's private life should not impinge on work.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 has the same intent in saying that &ldquo;the conduct of the employee at the place of or in the course of employment&rdquo; would be the only issue which would lead to dismissal.  Other matters should not be considered for the purposes of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 6 (4) (b) of the Principal Act provides that dismissal because of &ldquo;the conduct of the employee&rdquo; can be fair, and section 6 (6) provides that dismissal can be fair for some other substantial reason.  It is a matter for the judgment of the adjudicating body concerned, the rights commissioner, Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Circuit Court, to determine whether a particular dismissal is fair having regard to all the circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>I know that Senator O'Toole's amendment is couched in general terms but teachers are usually vividly aware of the background to a particular case.  The purpose of this amendment is to confirm that a person's behaviour in private life may not be used as grounds for dismissal. There was a widely publicised case some years ago, the dismissal of Miss Eileen Flynn, where the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the Circuit Court and the High Court held that the employee's conduct outside her employment justified her dismissal. She pursued all the avenues of redress to which she had access.  In the High Court the presiding judge held that an employee's conduct outside the place of employment justified dismissal as the employer was entitled to believe that the conduct in question was capable of damaging the employer's business.  In the case to which I referred, it would have involved the enrolment of pupils and the conduct of classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue was examined in the general review in preparation for this Act.  There are difficulties, there is no doubt about that and Senator O'Toole recognises them.  It is a debatable point, and I would be interested to hear other Senators' views.  Is it preferable to leave the consideration of these issues in the capable hands of the appropriate adjudication <Col N="264" /> bodies?  Is it proper and right to let such bodies decide the fairness of individual dismissals without being unduly constrained by the legislation?  There are a few of us who believe that any and all actions by an employee outside the workplace should be disregarded for the purpose of dismissal unless &mdash; and Senator O'Toole recognised that &mdash; they impinged on the employment in which that person was engaged.  Accordingly, certain behaviour by an employee outside the workplace could be regarded as constituting grounds for dismissal, and Senators have clearly recognised that. There is also general agreement that the actions which could give reasonable grounds for dismissal in one case may not be accepted as a basis for dismissal in another case, even within the same type of employment.  Indeed, dismissals based on an employee's conduct outside work relate to a wide range of actions which may amount to a conflict of interest with the person's duty to the employer under the contract of employment, or raise doubts as to the person's continuing suitability for that kind of employment.  That was implicit in Senator O'Toole's remarks.</P>
    <P>The very complexity of this amendment requires a case by case examination if justice is to be done to the employer and the employee.  I would not like to tie the Employment Appeals Tribunal's hands in considering, for instance, the fairness of dismissal of an employee because he or she carried on a business in off-duty hours which was in direct competition with that of the main employer. That is just one example.  I am not making a judgment, I merely mention it to illustrate the possible consequences of accepting this amendment and to illustrate that such issues should be considered by the adjudicative bodies under the Act, in the light of the circumstances in each case.  I would welcome further points of view on this as the issue is an important one of principle.</P>

      <P>I do not want to tie up all the discussion.  It is very hard to give examples of where a person's private life might impinge on that person's work life. However, we can take an example which might be appropriate to Members.  If an employee of a political party, working in the head office of that party, turned out to be politically active in a different party I am sure Senators on all sides of the House would accept there would be a clash between that person's private activities and his or her work.  If a person was selling furniture, and one of the employees decided to set up a cut-price furniture business across the road, a resultant dismissal would not be unfair. Those are the clear examples and it is important to cover them.</P>
      <P>I am really trying to deal with the moral question which normally arises when somebody does not like the relationship an employee has with somebody else, because the marriage arrangements or sexual orientation do not conform to the employer's views.  I am particularly clear about this question in the area of teaching, and the Minister of State also referred to it.  If teachers are in unusual arrangements they feel vulnerable.  If it was dealt with in the Bill it would solve the problem.  I recognise it is a difficult one to address and creates difficulties.  I have tried to find a balance here between saying on the one hand that there are situations in which it would be fair for an employer to terminate someone's employment, and, on the other saying, it would be unfair for employers to sack someone because of matters which did not impinge on the person's work.</P>
      <P>Whatever about a person's relationships outside work, if that person comes to work in the morning and does the work adequately, competently, and to the satisfaction of his or her supervisors, then there is no conflict.  If the person's work, operations, or private life outside the work area are directly in conflict with, subvert, or in some way pervert, change, or make less efficient, or less effective the work of the person in their employment, then that is a different matter.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann endorses the policy measures of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in support of rural development.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am delighted that the Minister, Deputy Hyland, is here to debate this important issue of rural development.  We are fortunate in having the services of two very experienced Ministers, Deputy Walsh and Deputy Hyland, who have shown their dedication to rural development over the last few years.</P>
      <P>Agriculture, despite Common Agricultural Policy reforms, continues to be the mainstay of rural development and affects the rest of the economy.  There is no substitute for the conventional beef and dairy industries.  We should have developed a market for our high quality beef, instead we took the short-cut and dumped the finest quality beef into intervention, which means that now we do not have proper markets.  I hope we will try to redress that situation; EC regulations encouraged that type of dumping as there was a greater financial reward for the meat industry.  However, it was very short-sighted, as in the long term it was bad for the farmer and the meat industry not to try to develop a broader market for our high quality beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must address a situation in which <Col N="267" /> agriculture is no longer sufficient to secure rural development and to maintain a strong and viable rural community. A healthy, thriving rural community augurs well for a happy people.  De Valera's vision that people in rural Ireland would have a happy healthy outlook and would trade jobs to stay on the land and be educated is still relevant and a challenge to these changing times.  The idea of small being beautiful is more attractive as the days of the big multinational industries creating jobs recede.</P>
    <P>We must develop jobs and opportunities on and off the farm to supplement the income of people on holdings, big or small.  Regardless of the size of farm, there are many problems in regard to quotas and so on.  Many forms have been filled in the last few weeks and I hope all farmers will remember to submit them by Saturday, 15 May 1993, at the latest.  I thank the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, the officers in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry at county level and Teagasc for their advice and help over the last couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>The operational programme for rural development provides a framework of aid for farmers and farm diversification, for example, relief services and forestry. There were developments in forestry in recent times to create jobs.  Great progress was made over the last number of years in increasing the acreage of land under afforestation, which contributes a major part in the development of our tourism industry, for example in the construction of forest walks and so on.</P>
    <P>Every county has its fair share of beautiful areas which we should try to preserve.  There are small community enterprises in these areas such as fisheries, harbours and research and development in marketing.</P>
    <P>Considering our fish stocks over the last 60 years or more, it is amazing that we have not made more progress in the development of our fishing industry, particularly in the area of job creation.</P>
    <P>There has been a good response to the measures, especially those in relation to <Col N="268" /> diversification such as agri-tourism.  We must not depend on the government for help, we must help one another to help the community in general.</P>
    <P>Reforms have introduced an integrated approach to tackling our economic and social problems in a more effective and coherent manner.  I thank both Ministers and their officials for the manner in which they established the Leader programme and others.  The EC concern for rural areas is illustrated by the vast amounts of money earmarked for them.</P>
    <P>The Leader programme is an exciting new Community measure which provides support for local development and effort. It allows people to help themselves, it has taken off and is making great progress.  I wish it well.  Every assistance has been given by the Department to help people get their projects moving.  Considerable funding has been allocated to the 16 selected Irish groups to enable them to pursue business plans which they have drawn up to meet needs in their own communities and areas.  That is what it is all about.  There is much satisfaction when a development is carried out by a group of neighbours.</P>
    <P>The recent establishment by the Government of the County Enterprise Partnership Boards complements the Leader programme.  It provides an opportunity for people to get together on a county level with the County Development Officer, the County Manager and various representatives from business, trade unions and farming, etc., to pool ideas and money, with the help from various Departments, in order to do something for their county.  There is very little red tape involved which we hope will result in speedy action.  There are job opportunities in every county.  The response to Leader has been tremendous and it is my experience that people are only too eager to contribute to the development of their own county and the creation of jobs for young people.  Future rural development policies require an integrated approach that encourages rural communities to harness all the resources available.  I am sure in 12 months time that much will have been <Col N="269" /> achieved between the Leader programme and the County Enterprise Partnership Boards.  Together something can be done to move away from dependency on Government and the EC.  Creating jobs ourselves will also reduce our dependency on foreign multinationals although most of those are responsible and have contributed much to Ireland.  The employment scene is changing to smaller units and smaller projects based on tourism and agriculture.  In the period 1991-93 over £100 million of public funding, £60 million of which came from the EC, was allocated, an indication of the confidence of Government and EC in the development of the Leader and other programmes.  The ball is at our feet.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling the Edinburgh summit that took place just before the last general election.  There, it was said that the Taoiseach was talking nonsense and would not get the money he expected.  It silenced many critics when he clinched the deal on behalf of the Irish people.  We should be grateful to the Taoiseach and his Government for achieving a deal worth worth 85 billion ECUs.  That is a vast amount of money for Ireland in both Structural and Cohesion Funds over the next six years which I am sure will be spent sensibly. With the current level of financial commitment and improving economic indicators, such as low inflation and falling interest rates there is a good reason for optimism about the future of rural Ireland.  I have every confidence that the Minister and his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, will do everything possible to create jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. This is a subject that could be discussed at length.  It is a situation that will cause many problems.  The kernel of the problem is that we live in a capitalist society. In such a society the only place projects will be located is where there are people because that is where profits are to be made and as the rural population dwindles there is less incentive for people to invest there.  This is why people are leaving in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> Structural funding has been mentioned and this is our last hope of stopping the mass migration of young people especially to urban areas.  I am not naively suggesting that they are leaving only because there is nothing for them; they see on television and read in newspapers about a more exciting life far beyond their immediate rural habitat. They experience a life that is exciting and fast moving when they move to urban areas for second level or university education. Many people wish to return to their homes but they get involved in the urban way of life, get a job if they are lucky enough and settle down.  This is what happens; people wish to return but cannot.</P>
    <P>A massive amount of money in Structural Funds will be injected into this country over the next couple of years. Structural funding mainly goes to urban areas to alleviate the problem caused by the depopulation of rural areas.  One of the reasons for this is that roads in urban areas are overcrowded by people travelling to cities for work and enjoyment. I suggest that if roads were upgraded, people could travel quickly to cities either for work or social activities and they would be more inclined to live further from large urban areas.  This is a realistic suggestion because travel here is too slow.  People living in a rural area feel they are missing out on what is happening in the urban area.</P>
    <P>The problem that has arisen with planning regulations needs to be seriously questioned.  For example, Cork County Council's new directive says it will only grant planning permission to areas where there is already a high density of housing. The reason given is to meet criteria laid down by the EC with regard to funding for sewage treatment plants.  Towns with a population of over 5,000 will be granted money for sewerage treatment.  What it is trying to do is to take people out of remote rural areas and into towns to increase the population there to qualify in the long term for EC funding.  This has to be seriously questioned because if people are moved from a rural area investment will cease.  People are the <Col N="271" /> essence of investment because they generate profit.</P>
    <P>There is a furore at the moment regarding the pricing of telephone calls.  All calls in Ireland should be equal in charge. This is a very important issue.  Since the increase is to be phased in this issue must be addressed as soon as possible.  This is important if we want to keep people in rural areas.  I see no reason a person in Ballydehob should not have the same right as a person in Dublin to ring his neighbour.  We are all living in the same country.  People leave rural areas because it is better to live in a city area where more services are provided.  We have made great strides in addressing this situation. I welcome the commitments of the Minister of State and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, in this respect.  Traditional farming has suffered due to over-production and we must encourage our farmers to move into agri-tourism and other means of subsidising their present income.</P>
    <P>Their income has to be supplemented in a profit making sense.  It must be generated from people rather than from the coffers of the EC or the State.  Unfortunately, farming being a traditional occupation, the people involved are also traditional by instinct.  It takes a lot of time and encouragement to get them to develop other activities apart from traditional farming activities of beef, milk and cereal production.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, while it is still profitable to farm, the smaller farmer is being squeezed out since the standard of living of a small farmer is not comparable to that of a person living in an urban area.  I do not want to suggest there is a rural-urban divide.  I represent 60,000 people living in a high population density, urban area and 20,000 people, mainly from a farming background, in a low population density area.  From my experience I have noticed that people in the city feel under pressure when their rural counterparts move to the city.  People from urban areas may feel under threat because they consider people in the rural areas have more money and a better standard of living. <Col N="272" /> Yet people in the rural areas see the issue differently.</P>
    <P>One may ask what is a good standard of living?  A good standard of living means having a reasonable social life, a reasonable amount of money, being able to educate one's children, living a happy life and owning a home eventually.  That is what most people wish for and it is a fair ambition.</P>
    <P>We must decentralise, not from a national level but within regional levels. There is no point decentralising from Dublin to Cork because the same problems will be created.  The same problems exist in Cork and Limerick as in Dublin. Rural areas are being rapidly depopulated. I know from my involvement with Macra na Feirme and youth groups that this issue is always discussed. Addressing these problems will require a massive injection of funding in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem is that people like to move to the city for a couple of years. However we must encourage them to bring the skills and education they have acquired back to their own areas.  I have a couple of proposals that might be helpful in future years.  Grants will have to be made available but not to farmers or to any one group in particular.  The IDA, the Leader programme and other groups should be brought together.  To avoid duplication there should be one body, to co-ordinate the local groups, organisations and programmes and tackle the immediate problems.  We must develop this mentality of helping ourselves.  With so many bodies involved there is a complete breakdown in communications between the IDA and other organisations. What we need is an overall group in small regions.</P>
    <P>In discussions on the Roads Bill it has been mentioned that bad roads are a problem and I agree with that.  However, a person once suggested to me and I suppose it defeats the thrust of my argument, that if the roads are bad people are not inclined to move out on them in the first place.  I think that when the roads are good people are inclined to travel more while living in their native area.  It is a <Col N="273" /> four hour car journey from Cork to Dublin yet it takes nearly a hour to travel perhaps 50 miles from parts of rural Cork into the city centre.  This will have to be addressed immediately if we are to keep people from moving to urban areas.</P>
    <P>I recognise the commitment of this Government and I hope that the Structural Funds, which are the kernel of this issue and our last chance for a solution, should be diverted to the areas which people are leaving rapidly since this has already created problems in urban areas. I wish the Minister of State and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry the best in their endeavours as I know they have done their utmost to address the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;calls on the Government to outline the EC policy measures in relation to rural development; and to clarify the Government's commitment to these policies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The four main issues as far as rural development is concerned are an acceptable early farm retirement scheme, sound investment in rural development as far as agri-tourism is concerned, the development of land suitable for afforestation and, something that is absolutely essential, access to what we describe as reasonable interest rates.  We have seen, particularly over the past six months, great variation in interest rates ranging from 14 per cent to 22 or 24 per cent in some cases.  This is unacceptable and there can be little development, rural or otherwise, with these fluctuations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is now a large number of organisations representing rural development. We have the Leader programme with 16 companies across the country, Bord Fáilte operating through the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in the case of agri-tourism and in the proposed new county enterprise partnership boards.  I agree with Senator <Col N="274" /> Kelleher that these different organisations should be brought together under one umbrella organisation to avoid duplication on the one hand and ensure co-operation and consistency in the areas of development on the other.  Teagase is also involved in all these schemes.  We must look at the issues regarding disadvantaged areas, reclassification and the various headage payments.  It is vital that a thorough examination be made of the operation of these schemes in the different Departments.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is still the cornerstone of the rural economy of this country and will be for some time to come.  I have always argued that when import substitution is taken into consideration agriculture accounts for between 35 and 40 per cent of the total economy.  Therefore, in rural areas it is not just the farmers but the villages and rural towns, shops and other small business within these areas who are sustained by agriculture.  We should not forget that when agriculture is having a difficult time, so are these dependent businesses.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of talk about creating jobs in the servicing area.  Agriculture is one of the biggest consumers of services in the country.  There is a huge number of people employed directly and indirectly in the agri-business. When we consider agri-tourism we must not forget that there are limits which must be taken into account because if there is over-capacity and heavy expenditure without proper planning, even bigger problems will be created than those that already exist.</P>
    <P>We must have planning with market strategy.  The industry is competitive not alone on the home front but also abroad. Package holidays &mdash; bringing people from one area to another be it to a heritage park, hill climbing, pony trekking or any other tourist attraction &mdash; are important to rural areas because people will holiday in an area provided they get good value.  The day is gone when we can &ldquo;ripoff&rdquo; the unfortunate tourist.  It must be remembered that the customer is the boss in any tourist activity and we have keen competitors for the European tourists. <Col N="275" /> Our biggest rivals are Scotland and Norway.</P>
    <P>I would criticise the tourist board for not adequately promoting our tourist industry.  There should be more emphasis on the European market rather than on the American market.  American tourists are very welcome but we are closer to the European market and, as fares at present are favourably competitive, there should be an Irish tourist office in every major city in Europe.  Expenditure on such offices would be justified and I would encourage that development.</P>
    <P>The EC early retirement scheme is fundamental to the development and sustenance of people in rural areas.  It provides older people with a reasonable income while keeping the young people on the farms, and farming is a young man's job.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry indicated that the early retirement scheme would be formally sent to Brussels in March.  Has the submission been sent to Brussels?  If not, it should be sent immediately.  The Minister should tell the House what approach he will take in respect of this early retirement scheme.  He should remember that the last two attempts to introduce such a scheme failed miserably.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the retirement scheme includes transfer of the farm from father to son as this was the reason it previously failed.  I would like the Minister to explain certain provisions in the scheme.  One is the requirement on those who benefit from the scheme and who succeed to their fathers' farms, to acquire 10 per cent more land over the succeeding two years.  This is a peculiar decision as in a certain number of cases it will not be possible to comply.  The question of leasing land should be examined in respect of that provision.</P>
    <P>What is the proposed starting date for this scheme?  No dates have been mentioned aside from speculative ones in the newspapers.  The starting date should be from January 1992 to allow people who have signed over farms during that period to benefit.  Many issues must be resolved. It would be fatal to introduce a scheme <Col N="276" /> and discover in two on three years that it has not succeeded because then, nobody can benefit.  I urge the Minister to have discussions with the farming organisations and all the interested parties about this early retirement scheme.  It is fundamental to the farming industry and the Minister must ensure that it succeeds this time.</P>
    <P>One other area with which I would like to deal is forestry policy.  Our primary objectives are to increase the acreages under forestry, to increase employment in forestry related enterprises and to improve the recreational and scenic value of the countryside.  These objectives are often inter-related and complementary provided their multiple objectives can be recognised and properly integrated at the planning and development stages.  A threefold increase in the area under forestry is both feasible and desirable.  The increase can be achieved by increasing the acreage in both the private and State sectors.  We should encourage increased private planting by improved premiums of up to £240 per hectare, improve grants, remove any distinction between farmers and non-farmers, promote partnership and leasing arrangements and, above all, retain the tax incentive.  Only land which is suitable for forestry should qualify for improved grants and premium payments.</P>
    <P>We should encourage the present policy of planting 12,000 hectares of State owned land annually, provided it can be financed from internal resources.  The semi-State body, Coillte Teoranta, is ideally placed to promote partnership and leasing arrangements.  We should also plant a minimum of 10 per cent broad leaf hardwoods, encourage community and urban planting of broadleaf trees and plant broadleaf hardwood trees in tree derelict regions.</P>
    <P>As 1,000 new jobs can be created for every 10,000 hectares planted, long term employment opportunities will be created, especially in rural areas. Increased planting and forest maintenance, development of timber export markets, establishment of board manufacturing mills, feasibility studies on the establishment of pulp mills and paper <Col N="277" /> mills, the development of the wood processing and timber manufacturing industries as well as the centralised marketing of Irish timber products should be pursued with vigour.  The complementary role of commercial woodlands in the improvement of the scenic value of the countryside can be achieved by increasing broadleaf planting by 10 per cent, species diversification and urban broadleaf tree renewal programmes.  Wexford County Council has set a target of planting one million trees in a ten year period. Last year approximately 94,000 trees were planted.</P>
    <P>Since many matters have not been clarified, particularly the farmer retirement scheme, I will not support the motion. The Minister, in his speech to this House on the Common Agricultural Policy on 6 May 1993, made a very evasive statement. The early retirement scheme should be clarified before it is sent to Brussels and not when it is returned. With regard to the forestry industry, there are approximately two million unused acres of land in this country.  We have made progress in that industry during the last couple of years but, if we make changes permitted by the EC, we can introduce a comprehensive semi-State and private programme.  I appeal for those two important issues to be clarified before this motion is agreed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to second the amendment.  It is an unexpected honour for me as I became a Member of the House in order to listen and learn, but that is a fairly specialised activity.  It is a sensible amendment that seeks information about the Government's plans for rural development, and particularly its co-ordinated plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with interest to the contributions made and there is nothing with which I would wish to disagree in terms of content.  However, I have a few questions. There is much discussion of integrated programmes.  What is the alternative in principle or practice to integrated programmes?  Logically it should be disintegrated programmes but I do not think anybody ever consciously <Col N="278" /> proposes a disintegrated programme.  I understand it to mean sectoral programmes; programmes which reflect the sectoral interest of individual Departments of State or individual agencies without reference to the interests of other Departments or agencies and which are, in a sense, producer or bureaucracy driven rather than consumer orientated.</P>
    <P>I am a strong believer in integrated programmes which aim to improve the standard of living for people in particular places.  None of us lives in a sector; we live in places and it is the collective impact on those places of various programmes that constitutes the final consequences of policy.  Rural and urban areas have a great deal in common although, of course, some aspects of their lives are different.</P>
    <P>I share Senator D'Arcy's view that agriculture remains, despite its declining share of GNP, a sector of fundamental importance.  It is also clear, however, that life in rural areas is changing and will continue to change very rapidly.  Many of the problems and challenges which will arise in our society have been anticipated in other societies and I wonder if we have learned anything from the difficulties and opportunities that have arisen elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It would be a pity if we resigned ourselves to the inevitability of the decline of rural Ireland without trying to take pre-emptive steps to not only arrest that decline or postpone its inevitability for another generation but to see if one can transform rural Ireland in a positive economically effective way.  Nobody will remain in rural Ireland &mdash; nor can they be expected to remain &mdash; unless they can enjoy a satisfactory economic existence.</P>
    <P>There are values, in addition to the economic ones, which rural Ireland embodies and which could be fostered. Since becoming a politician, I am conscious of the fact that academics who call for long term thinking are able to do so with conviction because they have life tenure and do not have to face elections, unlike those who have to listen to their arguments.  Therefore, I am sympathetic to their problems.</P>
    <P>We have a collection of ideas and <Col N="279" /> experiences from which we should be able to draw when planning for the implications of inevitable change.  This change must be embraced and, if not welcomed, at least acknowledged so that we can anticipate its consequences and build on the change, rather than battle valiantly, but unavailingly, against inevitable defeat.</P>
    <P>Integrated programmes should be seen to be effective.  We cannot return to what has been unsuccessful in previous programmes. It is important that we do not use the rhetoric of integration but try to ensure effective integration.</P>
    <P>I suspect there is a learning process for those involved.  One should not expect instant results but should realise that the process is part of an activity of local democracy which is good in itself, and which is being fostered.  I will not avail of the opportunity to speak on local democracy, although I have strong feelings on the subject.  It is important that integrated programmes are given time to be successful and that they become an integral part of what developing an effective civic spirit ought to be about.</P>
    <P>As an educationalist I wonder if the education system and in particular, higher education is making any contribution to the quality of our thinking about integrated programmes.  It strikes me that almost all the people in universities are specialists.  We specialise in subjects and we develop tunnel thinking. We may be good at our subject but we develop a fairly narrow perspective. Integrated planning is meant to transcend that narrowness of perspective or that degree of specialisation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps higher education could think ahead and try to produce graduates with a training which would make them more integrationist in their thinking, rather than bringing people together with specialisations who do not know what integrated thinking is about.  We could do more in universities and in education in general to develop thinking along those lines.</P>
    <P>I would like to see closer liaison between policy makers and the education <Col N="280" /> institutions, particularly the agriculture faculties.  This matter transcends the departmental distinctions one finds at third level institutions where integrated planning is a concept which has yet to gain ground in certain areas.  Some form of discussion should take place between those who must face the problem of policy making and those who ought to be training and educating graduates as effectively as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, to the House.  I know he is aware of the need for rural development because of his background.</P>
      <P>The issue of rural development is of great importance because this is still a rural nation and agriculture is our biggest single industry.  Therefore, we have a vested interest in sustaining the economic and social fabric of rural areas.  The need for increasing emphasis on wider rural development in Europe can be appreciated when one considers the current trend in our rural areas, namely, the continued decline in the importance of agriculture in the rural economy and in the numbers employed in farming.</P>
      <P>The introduction of set aside means that employment on the farm will decrease to such an extent that the rural farm worker and the rural area associated with the farming community will become extinct.  If we could improve labour intensive agriculture it would help to increase employment.  This is how local farmers and their employees increased rural development in the past.</P>
      <P>Many rural areas have become depopulated. To counteract this, I ask the Minister to try to increase the value of agri-tourism to the farmer.  I would also like housing to be part of the rural and urban structures, as it is at present.  All county councils have a plan to encourage the person living in rural areas to be a part of the urban initiative.  As a result, people are becoming town oriented to the detriment of the rural community.</P>

    <P>Many rural groups may become involved in the Leader programmes.  The rural economy has become fragmented. Towns and townlands are divided by bypasses <Col N="281" /> and there does not seem to be any regard for the rural economy or rural life. Infrastructural development must continue, while rural development and the rural economy are of secondary importance. The environment is also threatened by the change to intensive farming.</P>
    <P>In EC terms, the current debate on rural development began in 1988 with the EC Commission's paper on the future of rural Ireland.  That paper analysed current developments and trends in rural areas and identified standard problems in the launch of development initiatives.  It listed potential areas for worthwhile initiatives, and, most importantly, it recognised that rural development must be integrated.  We must continue that policy and ensure that we do not become town oriented.  The time has come for people in authority to encourage those who love country life to enjoy it, rather than telling them that they must be part of the town development as far as housing is concerned.</P>
    <P>With generous EC assistance, we operated a pilot integrated rural development programme in 12 selected areas from 1988 to 1990.  Under this programme efficient rural development coordinators worked with local groups of committed individuals to decide priorities for their areas.  The value of this type of pilot scheme has been highlighted.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the results of these pilot schemes are highlighted in all areas, not just in areas where they have been successful.  Perhaps the result of such pilot schemes could be published in booklet form so that they would be available to associations and groups throughout the country.  This would show people that successful pilot schemes can be developed and would prevent the decline of rural areas.</P>
    <P>Co-ordinators identify sources of official funds for projects which are considered suitable by local core groups.  An evaluation of this pilot programme concluded that the model of development from the bottom up had something useful to offer and could play an important role in harnessing local initiative.  Local groups, from different parishes, could <Col N="282" /> come together to show what is on offer in their area in relation to tourism and other aspects of life.  This would reduce unemployment and highlight areas which could be improved.</P>
    <P>The operational programme for rural development provides the framework of aid for farm diversification, rural service, forestry, small and community enterprises, rural roads, harbours, research and development, marketing the food industry and training.  Senator Byrne and others mentioned research and development in the fishing industry, to which we do not have a co-ordinated approach. Fishing harbours, regardless of size, receive the same entitlements in terms of funding.</P>
    <P>The Leader programme is an exciting new community measure which provides support for local development initiated from the bottom up.  County councils and associations must be made aware of these schemes and their potential for development. They must ensure that their area is high on the priority list of the Department from which they seek assistance.</P>
    <P>Future rural development depends on an integrated approach which encourages rural communities to harness all available resources and ensure their continuation as viable entities.  This requires a co-ordinated policy and a response at national and EC level.  We have begun to discuss these issues with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh and his Department.  The Minister must ensure that rural Ireland remains an important part of our culture. Employment, tourism and other rural activities must be high on the Government's priority list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I made my point and I hope it will be taken up.  I am a friend and admirer of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh and the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland. However, I cannot support this motion.  As regards the achievements of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry &mdash; or previous Ministers &mdash; in relation to rural development over the past five or six years, I condemn them.  The Minister is doing a wonderful job in some areas but rural development is not one of them.  We will continue to fail in this area because we have accepted an EC regime which is not suited to Ireland.  This regime has been accepted and there is no way out.</P>
      <P>We are moving into an era of decline in terms of rural population, job and wealth creation and the Government realises this.  It has developed miserable alternative enterprise programmes and has tried to make them respectable but it knows that they cannot produce the kind of wealth or number of jobs as traditional farm enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us living in inland counties know that agri-tourism and rural tourism, which have been discussed in both Houses, are not having the desired impact.  In my county, which is near the east coast, the impact of tourism is almost nil, it is the same today as it was ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  It is a minor element in the local economy of Counties Monaghan and Cavan, although there are many rural and agri-tourism programmes in place.  People are not becoming involved in rural and agri-tourism and those who do make pennies rather than pounds. Those who say that rural and agri-tourism will have a major impact are wrong.  Even <Col N="284" /> if it is managed and developed properly it will not have a major input.</P>
    <P>People at county council and other levels, spend an inordinate amount of time talking about tourism.  It is essential that we develop and market our tourist industry to the best of our ability. However, we must be conscious of the limited potential for tourism in inland counties.  Tourism has made an impact in coastal areas and in others which have been developed for this purpose.  I am sceptical of the emphasis we place on tourism in inland counties.  That also applies to alternative enterprises which are not making the desired impact.</P>
    <P>Those involved in alternative enterprises, such as deer farming, usually have a lot of money and are not too concerned if they lose it.  People interested in becoming involved in alternative enterprises are not doing so because they are afraid they will lose their money.  Alternative enterprises do not generate much wealth.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State visited County Monaghan and is aware of developments there.  The mushroom, poultry and egg industries have developed to a very high level over the last ten or 15 years. We have been successful at making money from them and I hope we continue to do so.  The market will probably not allow that kind of development to take place in other counties; it may have reached saturation point.</P>
    <P>The big difficulty has been our total capitulation to the EC.  Our reliance on agriculture, in comparison with the developed EC countries is shocking; 15 per cent of our population are still working in this industry, while the average figure for the developed EC countries is about four per cent.  The GDP input from agriculture in Ireland is around 10 or 11 per cent, much smaller than in the developed countries, but we are obliged to accept the same conditions.  It does not matter to Germany and other EC countries what quotas and restrictions are brought in, but it is of huge consequence to us.  Farmers must fill in forms and are becoming increasingly frustrated and <Col N="285" /> annoyed because the scheme has been rushed.  Some of the Senators who talked about trying to get maps should go to the Land Registry office and spend a day working there instead of complaining about the difficulties.</P>
    <P>Farmers are filling out these forms to ensure their cheque will arrive two or three times a year; they are being paid not to produce.  Over time the value of these cheques, and of agricultural output, will decrease.  The contribution from agriculture will probably remain relatively high because of these cheques, but there is no future in that.  Our reliance on agriculture should have been recognised &mdash; our total agricultural production is minor in the EC &mdash; and there should not be as many restrictions.  As a member of the EC, we have to accept some restrictions, but we should not be forced to accept the kind which developed countries can bear without grant loss.</P>
    <P>We are in this position because we capitulated, and it is now proposed to congratulate the Ministers responsible.  It is an absurd motion and should never have been tabled.  The Senators who did so must now be embarrassed.  I will ask my party to vote against this motion tonight.  The Minister and the Minister of State should tell their Senators not to embarrass them like this in future.</P>

We are glad he is in charge of this matter because he, more than anyone, is aware of the opportunities in rural development which must be exploited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never seen, and I have been a public representative for almost 20 years, more enthusiasm in rural communities.  I was in Carrigaholt last night at the launching <Col N="286" /> of a Leader programme where, for the first time in over 100 years, oyster cultivation has recommenced in Carrigaholt Bay, with the guidance of Seán Keating, the chairman of the local Leader committee, in co-operation with the local community.  There are 14 local people involved in an effort to create employment in the Shannon estuary, which would involve long term permanent jobs in one of the most remote areas of the EC. There are shortcomings in rural communities which need to be addressed by the Minister.  Although there is enthusiasm and energy, they are hampered by the lack of important services.  There is urgent necessity for road investment in rural areas.  I appeal to the Minister for the Environment to work with the Minister of State with special responsibility for Rural Development to avail of Community funding for the development of the county road network, which will enable small projects to prosper.</P>
    <P>There is an opportunity in the integration of these schemes to develop villages in rural communities.  Many of them in west Clare do not have a basic sewage system or leisure and recreation community schemes.  Such facilities would make it attractive, especially for young people, to live and work there.  I must take issue with Senator Cotter, there is a great vibrance in local communities. They are energetic, active and are keen to make progress in development.  Cavan and Monaghan are examples of the success of small community enterprises.  The work done by the Leader programme could create long term permanent jobs in many attractive areas, especially in isolated rural communities, such as Carrigaholt. The lack of infrastructural investment to help these developments needs to be dealt with.  For example, I have sought investment for Carrigaholt pier for nearly five years.  The Minister must try to co-ordinate the activities between the Department of the Environment and others.  Many departments and State agencies have responsibilities in these areas.  Indeed I am confused by all the agencies involved, the Leader programme, SFADCo&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;IDA Ireland, Forbairt, Departments involved in schemes and State agencies like FÁS, Eolas, etc.  The Minister would be the best person to co-ordinate these activities so that various Departments and agencies can pool their resources in dealing with their problems.</P>
      <P>I must avail of this opportunity to pay tribute to the Leader programme in County Clare and to Fr. Harry Bohan who is well known to almost every Member of this House.  He has given a major boost to rural development in County Clare.  The documented success of numerous projects is ample evidence that where there is a will there is way. When financial and technical support are given to small schemes and projects, jobs can and will be provided.  If anyone wants to see a successful development in action they should talk to Fr. Harry Bohan and look at the schemes which have already been established through the Leader programme in County Clare.</P>
      <P>I advise the Minister of State not to be deflected from the Leader programme by the failure of some projects.  It would be a pity if, because of a few mistakes, the whole programme was abandoned.  The programme should be consolidated and put on a permanent basis.  Under the Leader programme I have worked on many projects in County Clare to help break down the barriers of bureaucracy and planning difficulties.  A special effort must be made to integrate and co-ordinate Departments, State agencies and local authorities so that we can break down the barriers of bureaucracy and cut the red tape which prevent many small projects from progressing.</P>
      <P>As will be seen from the successful projects under the Leader programme in County Clare, long term, permanent, sustainable jobs can be provided.  I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to Fr. Bohan for his work with the local community.  He could not have been so successful without the co-operation of the local people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact of headage grants has led <Col N="288" /> to a major transformation of rural areas. In almost every area where headage grants and farmers' assistance have been paid, it has been reinvested to develop these areas.  Research carried out by the Department of Social Welfare in the areas in County Clare where farmers' dole was paid directly to farmers shows this money was invested to increase productivity and create more opportunities for the people in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a point made by Senator Lee.  I am sorry he is not here to further develop the points he was making about the involvement of research institutions, such as the universities, in helping to establish projects in rural areas.  I wish to refer to the University of Limerick and the development of technology connected with fish farming.  Since the development of fish farming we have mainly relied on imported technology from Norway, Sweden and Japan.  It is time that we put in place an Irish technology to suit Irish tidal and water conditions.</P>
    <P>The University of Limerick has responsibility to the local communities. It should have a research station on the Shannon to undertake research into the natural resources of the Shannon, especially in the area of engineering technology because it has on tap the necessary qualifications in that area.  Nevertheless, it would seem that some people in the University of Limerick are more interested in what is happening in Taiwan and Hong Kong.  I would like to direct their attention to west Clare and the Shannon Estuary and ask them to work with the local communities to develop the type of technology which will provide permanent employment and create opportunities for employment for young people interested in technology.  This is a subject worth debating and I am sorry such a negative approach has been adopted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State here this evening to discuss this important matter.  I agree with some of the criticisms of successive Governments and of the EC in respect of their commitment to rural development, but I do not share the criticism of the Minister of State's commitment to this area.  He has invested a lot in it and has worked very hard.  I want to stress that any criticisms I make are not directed at the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>It is unquestionable that rural development is an area of tremendous potential. We must accept the facts whether we like them or not.  The European Community is moving from a system of price support to a system of income support which has implications for the entire rural community, particularly in this country as we depend so heavily on agriculture.  That is why rural development initiatives are so important.  It would be unrealistic to expect that rural development could replace production agriculture which must remain the dominant activity.  That is what drives our meat processing plants, our milk production plants, our markets and our economy and it will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>However, rural development has an important part to play in the overall picture. The central criticism of rural development is that it has not been adequately funded by the European Community.  That is why it is so important when the Minister for Finance goes to Brussels that he ensures, as a priority, that the rural communities are potected within the framework of the Structural Funds and that adequate funding is provided for the rural infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with some of the remarks made about rural roads.  It is not sensible to have a super highway from Dublin port to the area very near the Minister of State's home so that he would have to drive only a short distance on potholed roads from his home to the highway.  The condition of the roads is having a negative effect on the agricultural economy in terms of hauliers and farmers bringing <Col N="290" /> goods to market and it is something which needs to be addressed.  When the Ministers go to Brussels they should remind their European colleagues that under the Article of the Treaty on Economic and Social Cohesion &ldquo;The Community shall aim at reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions, including rural areas&rdquo;. The European Community needs to be reminded of its responsibilities in this area.  I also support the claims made by the farming organisations that 18 per cent of the funds should be devoted to agriculture.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties I have with rural development is that it is developing into a conference circuit.  One can go to rural development conferences from the beginning to the end of the year and see the same faces and hear the same sense, or otherwise, depending on your point of view.  It is becoming a nice, cosy, academic circle.  Senator Lee and his friends might find attending these conferences very agreeable but I do not think it is the way forward.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Leader programme which I regard as very successful.  I agree with Senator Daly that we should not take the unfortunate experience in Tipperary as a reason for not continuing the Leader programme. When is it proposed the new programme will replace the existing programme?  Can we expect that it will be greatly expanded, as it should be?  Can we expect funding to be made available for that expanded programme?  How many departmental officials are available to administer the Leader programme?  I understand the excellent officials who look after this scheme are badly stretched; there is a very small unit in the Department to look after a programme which I hope will be expanded.</P>
    <P>My other questions relate to the operational programme for rural development. I do not agree with some of the comments made about rural tourism.  I accept that it is a minor part of rural development but I also know that the demand for funding under the rural tourism <Col N="291" /> programme was greatly in excess of the funds available.  Is the European Community going to make adequate funding available, when the new programmes come onstream, to ensure the developments we need to foster?</P>
    <P>Reference was made to alternative enterprise.  With regard to these I return to the point I made about production agriculture.  Meat, milk, sheep and cereal production will remain the basis of Irish agriculture, but that is not to say that alternative enterprises do not have a role to play in helping some people remain in the rural community who otherwise would have to leave.</P>
    <P>Greyhound training is an area with potential that has been financially assisted.  We have a good record in Kildare and throughout the country for breeding greyhounds and selling them abroad.  Another area of potential growth is non-thoroughbred horses.  There are opportunities which should be examined closely and exploited.</P>
    <P>The central problem for alternative enterprises is a bureaucracy which prevents them from flourishing and not only by inadequate funding.  It is nonsense for somebody in a small rural community who decides to produce free range eggs to be suddenly told, having taken their eggs to the local supermarket for six or seven weeks, that they now need a packing licence.  Health regulations must be enforced to prevent salmonella, but there is an inconsistency between the rhetoric about developing rural society and the restrictions imposed. There is considerable energy to be tapped within local communities.  Ideas are flowing as the Leader Programme showed. People get discouraged by the impenetrable layer of bureaucray.  It is the responsibility of the Minister of State and his Department to ensure that bureaucracy is not increased.</P>
    <P>Sea trout have disappeared from the west of Ireland.  Fishing is an essential part of rural tourism; it is a traditional tourist activity which has generated millions of pounds.  Now, overnight, the <Col N="292" /> sea trout has disappeared and nobody seems to care.</P>
    <P>Regarding bureaucracy it is the responsibility of the Department to enter into partnership with the local community as is mentioned at all conferences on rural development.  The partnerships should involve State agencies and voluntary bodies so that all may work together for the good of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>We must accept that there has been a decline in farming, but that should not entail a decline in rural life.  Although we have reports of large numbers of farmers leaving the land and forecasts that farmers will continue to leave we should not allow rural areas to be depleted of their people.  Common Agricultural Policy intervention is being reduced, but the rural development side should increase, so that people who wish to may continue to live in rural areas.</P>
    <P>A bottom up approach can work, but it must not be stifled by bureaucracy. People must be made to feel involved in the rural community and in the planning process.  The rhetoric about the need to have people living in rural areas does not fit with planning decisions which prevent them from doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and echo the sentiments that have been expressed most eloquently by Senator Dardis.  The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is the right man in the right place at the right time. Nobody questions his commitment on the mighty task he has undertaken.  Rural development has only been recognised as an entity in its own right in recent years. I come from a rural area and I hope rural development will grow to become a full Ministry and that, perhaps, the present Minister of State will get that job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The age profile in rural Ireland is a serious cause for concern and in that context, I welcome the recent initiative on early retirement.  This is the third time such an initiative has been introduced; perhaps, Europe and Ireland will get it right at last.  Certainly the immediate response in my home community suggests <Col N="293" /> there will be a much greater take up on this proposal than on others in the past.  I hope it will be implemented quickly.</P>
    <P>Many Senators referred to the Leader programme.  My home area is one of the pilot areas for Leader and the Minister recently graced us with his presence when the Leader programme there launched its proposals.  Experience of the Leader programme has varied among the 12 designated areas.  In some areas it has been good, in some bad and in others mixed.</P>
    <P>Based on my own experience of the Leader programme, I believe the composition of the boards should be more broadly based.  The Minister of State is anxious that this be so and I know that in other parts of the country boards are broadly based.  However, of 12 members on the board in my area seven are teachers.  The seven were nominated through various Community organisations but a majority of teachers leads to a deficit of other skills and experience on the board.  Where are the people with an entrepreneurial background, who are used to handling money, who deal with employees and have already created viable jobs?</P>
    <P>I believe the composition of the board in my area may hinder the Leader programme from acting as a conduit for the enterprise and initiative, which as Senator Dardis said is evident in all rural communities.  The boards should be more varied in their composition.</P>
    <P>On every occasion the Leader programme is discussed, reference is made to local authorities.  As a recently elected member of Leitrim County Council I have noticed that while the Leader programme and the council may operate in parallel they do not work together.  The Leader programme goes one way and Leitrim County Council goes another. When the Leader programme started up resentful comments were made by public representatives about its future direction and operation.  I am glad to say that these initial difficulties have been sorted out; a meeting of the manager with the full council has smoothed feathers and clarified <Col N="294" /> many of the difficulties and negative perceptions that had arisen.</P>
    <P>This does not detract, however, from the essential point to be answered; what role can local representatives play in rural development?  It seems that this &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo; concept is being expanded as more initiatives are implemented by the Irish Government.  This is being done to the exclusion in many cases of the contribution of elected public representatives in choosing the direction the development of communities, particularly rural communities will take.  This lack of public accountability in the implementation of the £2.4 million, in my case, is anti-democratic, and can lead to a Tipperary-type situation.  I will use this opportunity to yet again voice my concern at this situation and I do so as an elected public representative without in any way diminishing the role of the Leader programme or of the Minister and his Department's commitment to the concept.</P>
    <P>When the next operational programme begins and the Leader programme is, hopefully, continued into phase II and expanded, the Minister might consider changing the composition of the Leader boards to allow for a greater degree of flexibility without taking from the initial criterion, which is that it should be part of and grow out of the community.  As public representatives, we are part of the community.  We have been elected by the people.  Therefore, why should we be excluded to this extent?  It is not enough to say that the chairperson of the local authority should be included on a Leader board, or that there should be some involvement by the executive of a local authority in a discussion or in negotiations.</P>
    <P>My experience in this area &mdash; the Minister of course can correct me because he is dealing with it on a day-to-day basis and my facts may not be exactly correct &mdash; is that there should be a greater role for local authorities.  However, that is not in any way to underestimate the impact that the Leader programme has made in my area.  The board should be allowed to offer grant aid in excess of 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> The problem facing people in rural communities is a lack of money.  The ideas are fermenting all the time, but when it comes to implementing them, money seems to be the problem.  It is interesting that under the Structural Funds the Government can get grant aid of between 75 per cent and 80 per cent for certain schemes but under the Leader programme a grant of only 50 per cent is paid.  This figure should be increased to 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>INTERREG has proven to be a boon in Border areas but due to its small funding base it has whetted the appetite rather than provided a satisfactory meal.  I hope INTERREG will be expanded, particularly in the Border counties because the biggest problem there is access.  Why can some of the money not be spent on county roads?  This seems to happen only in Border roads.  There is a suspicion that successive Governments have used INTERREG as a substitute rather than an addition to the Structural Funds which, in the absence of INTERREG would be provided in the Border regions. There is a feeling that while money is being provided in this region through INTERREG, Structural Funds do not have to be given to that area.</P>
    <P>I make no apologies for singling out the Border counties for special treatment because we are a peripheral area with problems which are unique in Ireland and in Europe.  In the context of rural development and the Minister's activity in that area the Border region is a special case.  There are rumours that the INTERREG concept will be expanded to other parts of Ireland.  For example, there is some talk of an inter-regional grouping between Wicklow and Wales. Will this mean a dilution of funding under that heading?</P>
    <P>I agree with everything that was been said about the co-ordination of agencies. In Leitrim alone grants are available from the following bodies: the International Fund for Ireland, which provides money to carry out feasibility studies; the Leitrim enterprise fund, which is set up under IFI and gives soft grant aid; <Col N="296" /> EOLAS, which gives research and development grant aid; the IDA, which gives capital grant aid; the Leader programme which gives grant aid; the Arigna Task Force which gives grant aid; the INTERREG Fund which gives grant aid, and now we will have the county enterprise boards.  Why should business people have to spend their time chasing grant aid through several State agencies when they should be getting on with their businesses?  I wish the Minister well in his endeavours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, I thank you for allowing me time.  This is a very important motion.  First, the decline of rural areas is so rapid that one wonders how the Mansholt plan could have been implemented by stealth as it has been in this country.  The speed of rural decline was slowed down by the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy but the nature of this policy was such that it inevitably generated food surpluses. The present proposals to modify production in order to eliminate surpluses will inevitably speed up the decline of rural areas unless offsetting compensation is paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central European market will further sharpen the push towards urban concentration and rural decline.  When all the programmes are in place regional authorities will have a key role to play in research and planning development based on regional strengths and co-ordinating the implementation of national and EC policy.  Ireland lacks the political maturity to put such regional structures in place.  Politicians have been dissuaded in their attempts to put these structures in place by civil servants because they do not believe lesser mortals can achieve success where they themselves have failed.  The claim that as a single region we stand to gain more from the EC has never been seriously questioned.  I base my case on the fact that there must be <Col N="297" /> a development of regional authority to bring all the agencies together to implement European funding to best effect.</P>
    <P>The recent replacement of labour with capital intensive machinery in Irish farming is a cause for concern.  I worked as a labourer on the land and saw that development taking place.  As people became richer they made a capital investment. The replacement of labour by machinery on Irish farms in recent decades is a result of economic and monetary policies that included massive State borrowing and export subsidies.  The labourer is replaced by borrowed capital and this has put the State and the farmers heavily in debt.</P>
    <P>We are not fully exploiting the potential of our food industry.  In Mallow a factory which formerly provided jobs and contributed to the economy has been closed.  We are not making the best use of our timber resources which could significantly benefit the State and rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I thank and congratulate Senators on their objective contributions.  I listened attentively to what they had to say and benefited from the wide ranging views expressed.</P>
      <P>Senators are aware that rural development policy is now a matter of truly international debate and not just within the European Community.  This debate is born out of a recognition of changing circumstances, both within the European Community as a result of Common Agricultural Policy reform and outside it, as a result of likely changes in GATT.  There is now widespread acceptance that as we approach the end of this century the future security of rural areas lies in local economically viable enterprises that supplement farming which itself will become more dependent on the marketplace.  I fully agree with the views expressed by Senator Dardis that the core agricultural industry will still be crucial to the economic development of our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years the European Community <Col N="298" /> has made significant progress in developing an effective rural development policy which will have a major influence on the future direction of rural communities.  The publication by the EC of the discussion document &ldquo;The Future of Rural Society&rdquo; in 1988 also marked a watershed in current thinking.  The document contained an analysis of current developments and trends in rural areas of the community.  It identified standard problems facing the community in launching development initiatives and it listed as well, broad areas in which the Commission saw potential for worth-while initiatives.</P>
    <P>One of the most important elements in &ldquo;The Future of Rural Society&rdquo; was the recognition that a fundamental requirement for rural development is to ensure that all action is fully integrated, and that development strategies must be dovetailed into a coherent overall policy.  The point was made in the debate by most Senators.  Indeed, the crucial role of the farm family is given recognition in our Constitution which says that the State shall direct its policy towards securing, <i>inter alia</i>, &ldquo;that there may be established on the land in economic security as many families as in the circumstances shall be practicable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Agriculture and the food industry are vital elements not only in our rural economy but in the wider national economy. Agriculture and food account for close to 10 per cent of the gross domestic product in Ireland and for some 17 per cent of our overall employment.  The low import content of agri-food exports means that as much as 37 per cent of our net export earnings come from the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>In common with trends elsewhere in the European Community and in the developed world generally, our farming population continues to decline and to age.  Our most recent agricultural census in 1991 shows the total number of farms in the country at 170,500, down from 228,000 in 1975.  Only 15 per cent of Irish farmers are under 35 years of age with almost 45 per cent over the age of 55.</P>
    <P>Under-employment is a major feature <Col N="299" /> of Irish agriculture.  There is also a growing number of farmers with a gainful activity other than farming and this development must be seen as one of the most important structural changes which has occurred within Irish farming over the past two decades.  The net effect of the increase in part-time farming has been that the proportion of farm household income derived from farming is now less than 50 per cent.  The changing proportion of non-farm income in farm households illustrates the importance of rural development measures which increase the income and employment opportunities in rural areas.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, agricultural development and rural development are not synonymous.  Agriculture alone will not sustain the economies of many of our rural regions but neither will those economies be sustained without a viable agriculture.  Agriculture is, and will remain at least in the medium term, central to rural development in virtually all rural economies.  However, our rural societies are changing and our farmers and agricultural sector as a whole are trying to come to terms with the most radical changes in agriculture support arrangements since we joined the European Community.  As a result, the full exploitation of rural potential will be dependent on the degree to which we succeed in integrating agriculture into a wider rural development framework. This involves the creation of greater opportunities for on-farm, non-agricultural activities and more off-farm economic activity in rural areas.  It requires a broad approach solidly based on local as against external enterprise.  It requires a suitable blend of policies and measures both centrally operated and the &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; type fully attuned to a wide variety of rural needs.  It requires partnership between the various interests from central level through regional and on to local community levels.</P>
    <P>Put very briefly, the aim of rural development policy in Ireland is to preserve and strengthen the rural community, to improve the quality of life and <Col N="300" /> to cultivate a sense of identity among the rural population.  What we are endeavouring to do is to treat rural development in an integrated and coherent manner. Currently there are two important programmes directly supporting our rural development policy; the Operational Programme for Rural Development and also the Leader programme to which a number of Senators already referred.</P>
    <P>The programme for rural development involves a broad range of measures aimed at stimulating rural development and is designed to complement the other major operational programmes such as tourism, industry, and control of farmyard pollution, as well as the various measures financed from the EC's Structural Funds. Total public expenditure under the programme is about £123 million with the EC contributing some £72 million.  The EC funding is spread across the three Structural Funds.  The programme was never seen as the only tool for addressing the many and varied demands of the rural communities.  Rather was it seen as a measure to plug, as it were, any gaps left by the other operational programmes in order to assist certain activities and enterprises which could not be funded from other sources.  The programme is essentially in two parts comprising first, a series of conventional &ldquo;top-down&rdquo; grant aid schemes operated centrally by Government departments and State agencies and secondly, a special fund to assist &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; initiatives by local communities.</P>
    <P>The measures covered involve farm diversification, agri-tourism and forestry, rural infrastructure, small and community enterprises, research, development and marketing in the food industry, training and education, and promotional schemes.  Grant rates of up to 50 per cent in disadvantaged areas, and 40 per cent elsewhere, are available for eligible projects. The rate and speed of take-up under the various measures have been very encouraging.  Demand for the various diversification measures, particularly those promoting the production of sport horses and deer, agri-tourism and horticulture, quickly surpassed the initial <Col N="301" /> allocation and more funding has had to be diverted to these activities.</P>
    <P>The small and community enterprise measure which is designed to be responsive to local needs and to provide a safetynet for worth-while ideas by supporting projects for which aid is not otherwise available, is now operating very successfully after a delayed start.  The scheme only got going in June 1992 as a result of steps taken by me, and considerable progress has been achieved in a short time by the county development teams and SFADCo, who are operating the scheme on behalf of central Government.</P>
    <P>Leader is a pilot measure introduced by the European Community to aid rural development.  Its objective is to find innovative solutions which will serve as a model for the development of all rural areas and which will ensure maximum integration between sectoral measures. The approach is to establish a network of local groups, each enjoying a substantial degree of flexibility and autonomy in the implementation of local development plans, and each funded through global grants, financed jointly by the European Community and the State.  Some 16 groups were approved for Leader funding in Ireland, 213 for the Community as a whole, and the area of operation of the selected groups covers roughly 50 per cent of our rural areas.  The groups involve various combinations of activities including community, business, co-operative movement, local authority and State agency interests.</P>
    <P>The total funding approved for the Irish groups is £35 million, made up of £21 million in European Community funds and £14 million from the State. Individual allocations, on average just over £2 million, range from £600,000 to £2.9 million.  As the groups are required to ensure that matching funding is available, total investment under the Leader programme will be in the order of £70 million.</P>
    <P>Many items were raised in the debate to which I would like to be in a position to respond individually but, unfortunately, time constraints on this debate will not <Col N="302" /> enable me to do so.  I would, however, like to assure Senators that, in relation to a continuation of our rural development programme, I and my senior colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, and the other Minister of State at the Department, Deputy O'Shea, will be endeavouring to ensure the availability of the maximum amount of funds for future rural development programmes.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senators who made the point that the Leader programme has been successful despite some shortcomings. At this stage I believe we can clearly demonstrate that the national programme is a success, that jobs are being created and that worth-while rural development projects are being put in place.</P>
    <P>Rural development is about people, it is about the quality of their lives, their opportunity to work and the environment in which they live.  The depopulation of rural Ireland and the increasing pressures on inadequate urban infrastructures, which were referred to in this House earlier, arise from the inability of past policies to ensure a reasonable balance between rural and urban areas.  This problem is, of course, not peculiar to Ireland.  Indeed, in many ways we have been more successful than some of our European neighbours.</P>
    <P>We must, however, now act as a matter of urgency to correct this decline and through good and careful planning take effective measures to restore a reasonable balance between rural and urban areas.  This plan must be more than just aspirational.  It must be implemented through a programme for the economic development of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The economic return on investment in rural areas is not always easily established or identified with specific jobs and is therefore difficult to fully quantify.  It has, however, been clearly established that investment in rural development has and will continue to generate a significant number of new jobs.  It is also important to remember that the preservation of existing jobs is as important as new job <Col N="303" /> creation and very often more cost effective.</P>
    <P>Those who cast doubts or raise questions about the importance and value of rural investment very often do not understand the complexities of the rural economy or its relevance to the broader national economy.  In my view we have reached the crossroads.  Decisions which we make now in the context of European Community funding will decide the entire future of our rural areas.  The level of funding available to the peripheral areas of the Community such as Ireland will not continue indefinitely.  It therefore behoves all of us to take positive steps to ensure that we get maximum value in terms of jobs and development from every pound that is now available.  I have the utmost confidence in the Taoiseach and this Government that rural Ireland will get its fair share of European funding.</P>
    <P>My personal commitment to this objective is and will be unrelenting.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Byrne for sharing his time with me.</P>
      <P>Like other Senators I welcome the Minister, Deputy Hyland, to the House. There could not be a more suitable man for this job.  His contribution to rural development going back over a quarter of a century is well known and recorded. The number of people from all constituencies who attended his quarter of a century function was an indication of the esteem in which he is held by those who know him and by those involved in rural development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rural development has taken place already through our membership of the EC.  I do not have to explain to the House the importance of the FEOGA grants for the supply of water to Irish villages and byways.  In the 1970s a public rural water supply was not available in practically any part of my county.  Today less than <Col N="304" /> 100 households are without water.  That is an important development.</P>
    <P>In order to continue rural development we need funding.  I fully support the proposal that 18 per cent of the new Structural and Cohesion Funds be made available to agricultural and rural development.  Without that percentage the programmes that are necessary to maintain and invigorate rural Ireland cannot be implemented.</P>
    <P>The concept of rural development is broad and varied.  It includes tourism, organic production of food and vegetables, forestry and the development of forestry, peat and various programmes such as the Leader programme and the Operational Programme for Rural Development.  There are three areas in particular, forestry, peat production and tourism, where rural development can invigorate rural communities.</P>
    <P>Regarding forestry, a further development of timber processing presents a great opportunity for rural Ireland if managed correctly.  I know the Minister has an interest in this.  Further research and outside investment is required in the form of joint ventures and programmes.</P>
    <P>Our peat industry has fallen by the wayside in recent times and decisions made to rationalise the industry have been counter productive.  They have been anti-community and have contributed to the decline of the industry.  A new approach is necessary and the Government must address the question of peat production, harvesting and processing. Otherwise we will have a slimmed down, ineffective industry with no ability to provide jobs or future opportunities for rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Some people concentrate too much on tourism to the neglect of other programmes. However, tourism can play a major role and that role can be expanded under the Operational Programme for Rural Development under the Leader programme.  Recently the Minister attended our Leader programme in Arigna and I was pleased to be involved in the development of the programme as a member of the consultative council of the European Commission.  I have great <Col N="305" /> belief in the usefulness of the programme and I worked closely with Mr. Ray MacSharry and with the county managers of Roscommon, Leitrim and Sligo to have it established.</P>
    <P>I wish to advise the Minister that there are 17 Leader programmes in this country. Europe will decide in future what funds should go into those programmes on the basis of how well the present programmes do.</P>
    <P>The former EC Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry, said at one meeting I attended that the possibility of obtaining three or four times the funding on the next occasion will not arise unless this tier of Leader programme proves successful. It is therefore very important that the Minister maintains an active role in this area which I know he is doing.  I have no doubt that we can get over the little hiccup in Tipperary and get on with the business.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock mentioned that the Mansholt plan or forecast has now been implemented.  I doubt that.  I believe that the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is a definite attempt to reverse the full effect of the Mansholt plan.  Indeed that matter was to the fore in the discussions of the consultative council of the European Commission for the period 1989-91.  The philosophy behind the Mansholt plan was damaging for Ireland and for Europe.  As the Minister has said, there is worldwide rural development <Col N="306" /> and, hopefully, we will have a further opportunity to discuss it.  It is a very broad subject that impinges on practically every man, woman and child in rural Ireland. The representatives of rural areas must ensure that over the next seven years structures are established that will maintain rural Ireland and enable people there to make a living.  I do not believe that funds will be available after the year 2000 for that purpose.  Over the next seven years we must use EC funds wisely and if we do so some useful structures and opportunities for rural Ireland will have been set down.</P>

      <P>It gives me pleasure to thank the Minister for his honest and open address on this motion.  I wish him well in his task in the years ahead and his experience in Macra na Feirme, Muintir na Tíre, and on a county council will help him.  The first time I met Deputy Hyland was through a group water scheme in 1968.  That was rural development at the time.  He is a worthy representative of rural people at a very critical time.</P>
      <P>I hope peace can be achieved in the North of Ireland with benefits for Irish tourism and industry.  I hope also that public liability claims will ease and that claimants will realise that they are putting a handbrake on progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to take this motion which is important to us in Limerick West.  It concerns one of the key education establishments at Mount Trenchard in Foynes.  It is important for the future of second level education in the Foynes, Glin, Shanagolden, Kilcolman area.  I call on the Minister and on the Government to secure the future of this school as the excellent establishment it has been since 1958.  It has contributed enormously to education in the area and now the school is under threat.</P>
      <P>The school has been run by the Sisters of Mercy and in January 1991 the sisters indicated to the parents that they were obliged to re-examine their position and withdraw from teaching at the school. They gave as their reasons the shortage of religious personnel to man the school, the financial drain on the order and the inadequate grants from the Department.</P>
      <P>This school was established in 1958 as a boarding school and subsequently became both a boarding and a day school. Mount Trenchard, adjacent to Foynes, is an ideal location for an education establishment. It is a rural area and is not affected by traffic or urbanisation.  It is also an area of development.  There are 300 people working in Foynes.  Some weeks ago we discussed a £20 million development programme for the area which will increase employment by another 400.  Therefore it is important that adequate educational facilities are maintained.</P>
      <P>About 230 pupils attend the school at present.  The Department is anxious to rationalise schools in the area and to achieve that, the parents have proposed amalgamation with the Shanagolden vocational school.  The local vocational education committee has welcomed this and is prepared to establish a community college in Mount Trenchard, Foynes. The problems of rationalisation have been solved by the parents' decision.  The vocational education committee has agreed and intends to develop the school as an adult education facility during the school holidays as it is ideal for that purpose.</P>
      <P>The Sisters of Mercy are prepared to sell the property for £500,000.  The architect engaged by the action committee considers this good value as the school is in good condition.  I understand that this was discussed with the Department and it was agreed that the local architect would meet the Department of Education's architect to examine the situation.  Perhaps the Minister would report on the outcome of that meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last March the Sisters of Mercy announced that the school would not accept first year students from September. That is the death knell of the school.  People have lost confidence in its <Col N="309" /> future.  It should be re-established as a matter of urgency to allow the school to continue its excellent work.  Parents, children and teachers are uncertain about the future and that uncertainty should be resolved.  When a school is in difficulties and the number of pupils decreases, confidence in the school is lost.  Because the school gradually deteriorates, the Department is not obliged to close it.  In this case the Sisters of Mercy have forced the issue and the Department is obliged to inform us of its decision.  I urge the Minister to ensure that the decision is positive.</P>
    <P>I compliment the local committee who has done excellent work in lobbying the Department and local representatives who are fully appraised of the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  He will be aware that the Mercy Order in the diocese of Limerick announced, in 1991, its intention of withdrawing from the management of its post-primary school at Mount Trenchard, Foynes, in 1995.  As the Stella Maris school is a voluntary secondary school, this decision was a matter solely for the Mercy Order.</P>
      <P>The Stella Maris school at Mount Trenchard, Foynes, is located in the west Limerick catchment area which is unique in that it has four post-primary schools located in four different centres.  The three other schools are: Scoil Mhuire secondary school, Askeaton; the Salesian college, Pallaskenry and the vocational school, Shanagolden.  For many years the Department of Education has considered that some measure of rationalisation at post-primary level should be implemented in this catchment area. Since the late 1960s the matter has been discussed periodically with the four managements involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator will be aware that a school action committee was formed in Foynes with the aim of keeping the Stella Maris school in operation after June 1995 under a new management, the County Limerick vocational education committee.  The <Col N="310" /> Department carefully considered a submission made by the action committee and the question of the school continuing in operation beyond 1995 has been under consideration.  One option, that of leasing the school property from the Mercy Order, has been explored but found to be unacceptable to the Sisters.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and departmental officials met a deputation representing the action committee, on 1 April last.  The Minister listened carefully to the points put forward by the deputation in support of their case.  However, she informed the deputation that the technical advice available to her suggested that the development costs in question were likely to entail a large financial liability which would be difficult to justify.  As the deputation disputed the scale and scope of the development costs involved, it was agreed that a meeting would be held between the Department's professional staff and the architect advising the action committee.  At this meeting, which took place on 20 April, there was an exchange of information on likely development costs, with the Department's professional staff providing details of how its costings had been arrived at.</P>
    <P>The meeting concluded on the basis that the architect advising the action committee would report back to the committee and would contact the Department again when more details in relation to mechancial and electrical costs, structural requirements and dry rot possibilities had been clarified.  This response is awaited.</P>

      <P>Parents who are at present deciding what school their children will attend next September will be influenced by this issue.  Even if it was decided to keep the school open, this year's first year students would be in difficulties.  It is urgent that a decision be made immediately before people commit themselves to other schools.  Would the Minister not agree that the delay in making the decision spells the death knell for this school?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking time to hear my views on secondary school funding for Glanmire.</P>
      <P>This situation affected me and currently affects 400 pupils in the Glanmire area.  Every day 400 pupils travel by bus from the Glanmire/Riverstown area to secondary schools located almost 20 miles away.  I understand the Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach, has met several deputations to discuss this issue.</P>
      <P>The problem, I believe, is that the Department, when compiling its statistical analysis, includes Glanmire in the city area.  As the student population in Cork city is declining it concludes that there is no need for a secondary school in Glanmire.  However, Glanmire has been classified as a satellite town in the new county development plan and that suggests that Glanmire should not be included in the city area.</P>
      <P>Other satellite towns around Cork, such as Ballincollig and Carrigaline, have adequate secondary school facilities.  This situation has continued for too long. Property was bought by the vocational education committee in 1981 to build a secondary school.  However, because of local opposition it was decided to move the school to Ballincollig.  The Government said it would wait until people decided what type of school they wanted in Glanmire.  Unfortunately, before they had decided the Government withdrew funding.</P>

    <P>I attended a national school in this area, but I had to attend boarding school miles away because there was no public transport to these schools.  This problem is affecting 14,000 people.  The population is rising and Glanmire has been <Col N="312" /> designated a satellite town.  It has development potential, and a secondary school is required.  This has serious implications for the community.  A satellite town must have a closely-knit community if it is to be successful.  There are five national schools in the immediate vicinity. Young people grow up together and become involved in various activities. However, at the age of 12 and 13 friends are torn apart because they must go to boarding school or travel 20 miles a day to secondary school.  They see each other only at social functions.  This is the sad reality.  This situation is having an adverse effect on the closely-knit community. They are proud to live in a rural area and although there is a large population, they do not see themselves as an urban community.  I am not saying they have difficulties relating to city people, but they want to remain in the area where they were brought up.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to make funding available.  I have made my case and I hope the result will be a positive outcome. I understand funding from the Department of Education is scarce but this case must be given consideration because 400 pupils are bussed every day to seven or eight secondary schools.  I ask the Minister to make funding available.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Kelleher for raising this matter.  It gives me an opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, to outline the position in this area.</P>
      <P>The Riverstown-Glanmire area is approximately six miles from Cork city and for accommodation and transport purposes it is considered part of the Cork city catchment area.  There is an all-Irish post-primary school in Glanmire.  Apart from this school, the vast majority of primary school leavers from the area attend schools in Cork city, Carrigtohill, Carrignavar and Midleton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 1991 departmental sanction was given to County Cork Vocational Education Committee to purchase a site for a new second level school in Riverstown <Col N="313" /> in view of the then anticipated population growth in the area.  The timing and size of the school was to be decided at a later stage.  The vocational education committee has purchased a site for the school and has been pressing the Department to allow building of the school to proceed.</P>
    <P>The planning section of the Department of Education regularly reviews the second level facilities in Cork city and environs based on the most up to date primary and post-primary enrolments. During the course of the most recent review carried out, the information presented by the Riverstown&mdash;Glanmire Second Level School Committee in a submission made to the Minister for Education at a meeting in Cork last February was also taken into account.  The conclusion reached however, was that the establishment of a new second level school in Riverstown-Glanmire is not warranted at present.</P>
    <P>The following points are relevant in this context.  First, in the past five years the total number of primary pupils in County Cork and environs has fallen by 3,534 &mdash; 14 per cent &mdash; and the trend is continuing.  Second, the level of spare capacity in second level schools in Cork city is increasing.  Third, Cork city has had one of the largest falls in birth statistics in recent years.  In 1980, 2,653 were recorded and in 1991 the figure was 1,522, a decrease of 43 per cent over the 11 years.</P>
    <P>Fourth, in March 1988 an interdepartmental committee concluded a &ldquo;Review of Policy for the Provision of New and Replacement Accommodation for Primary and Second Level Schools&rdquo;. One of its recommendations was that, in major urban areas, consideration of an application from any school or area for new accommodation must have regard to the accommodation situation, actual and projected, within reasonable access of the school or area.  This recommendation has relevance for the Riverstown-Glanmire area.</P>
    <P>Fifth, it is expected that pupils from the Riverstown-Glanmire area may experience inconvenience in attending <Col N="314" /> the second level schools of their choice. However, this situation is not unique to the Riverstown-Glanmire area and, in itself, is an insufficient reason for providing a new post-primary school. Revised arrangements were put in place in January 1991 to include the second-level schools in Midleton as designated schools for transport purposes for the Riverstown-Glanmire pupils.  Reaction to date from parents and schools has been favourable.</P>
    <P>Sixth, given the limited financial resources available to the Department of Education, priority must be given to those building projects which will cater for the areas with the greatest need. Given the stability in numbers at primary level, Riverstown and Glanmire cannot be considered as priority areas in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education will continue to monitor closely the situation in Riverstown-Glanmire in the light of the most up to date statistics available for the area on demographic trends, housing developments and primary school enrolments.</P>

      <P>This reply concentrates on the schools situation in Cork city.  I agree that Glanmire is a satellite town, six miles from Cork city but the figures suggest that there is no need for a secondary school in Glanmire.</P>
      <P>The existence of an all-Irish school in Glanmire does not change the fact that another secondary school is needed. People from the Gaelscoileanna in Cork city attend this all Irish secondary school. There are few local people in Coláiste an Phiarsaigh.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the parents and school authorities are happy about the transport arrangements to the designated schools in Midleton.  Of course the schools authorities are happy because they will receive the pupils but unfortunately, the school which is most needed has not yet been built.  I would appreciate it if the Minister, Deputy Hyland would convey this fact to the Minister for Education.</P>
