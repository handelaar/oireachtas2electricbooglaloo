      <P>I have notice from Senator Michael O'Kennedy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to request Bord Telecom to carry out a social impact study of the effect of its re-balancing programme on handicapped, disabled and immobile people with a view to limiting the hardship of the new scheme of charges on such citizens.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Item 1, all Stages of the Interpretation (Amendment) Bill, 1993 and Item 2, Second Stage of the National Monuments (Amendments) Bill, 1993, until 1 o'clock.  There will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. followed by Item 3, statements on the farm retirement scheme between <Col N="1282" /> 2 p.m. and 4 p.m.  On Item 3, I suggest a limit of ten minutes per person.</P>

      <P>I suggest the Whips organise the length of individual contributions in accordance with the number of speakers offering.  We are coming to the end of this session and I am informed that there is a full programme of work next week with a large number of Bills. At the beginning of this session we said, as we say every year, that we do not want a situation where Bills are being rushed through all stages in one day.  That is what is being proposed for next week. With an item such as the Interpretation (Amendment) Bill, 1993, there is no difficulty in taking all Stages.  However, I want to say now that we will not agree to all stages of Bills being taken in one day next week, unless it is a matter of extreme urgency or the Bill is uncomplicated.  I am saying this in advance of the Whips' meeting today.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to those involved in last night's dramatic air-sea rescue operation off the west coast.  The bravery of those involved is something we should all appreciate as a community.</P>

      <P>I would like to join Senator Manning in congratulating those involved in the rescue, particularly the pilot of the helicopter which was flown to Galway.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Interpretation (Amendment) Bill, 1993, has eventually reached the floor of this House.  I remind the House that this was originally a Bill I put forward four years ago and I have been urging that it should be taken.</P>

      <P>The point I am making is a point of principle, unaffected by the interruptions from my own side, which is that it is ironic that this should happen the week after we had a contribution from the Government side saying it would be a good thing if they accepted legislation from sources other than the Government alone.  Here we have the Government once again poaching a piece of legislation.</P>

      <P>It is rather interesting.  I would also like to ask if the Leader will provide time for a discussion on the tourism industry.  I realise that time is short before Christmas but perhaps it could be arranged for early in the New Year.  I am sure the Leader knows about the significant intervention of the Minister for Tourism and Trade in supplementing, if I can use a non-controversial phrase, the work of Bord Fáilte in North America.</P>

      <P>I would like to put on the record my congratulations to the pilot and his team involved in the rescue operation off the west coast.  All the emergency services, including the ESB, must be warmly congratulated on their work during last night's storms.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to facilitate the drafting of legislation and <Col N="1284" /> statutory instruments in the feminine gender.</P>
      <P>Senators will be aware that the Interpretation Act, 1937, defines the meaning and construction of words and expressions used in legislation.  Section 11 (b) of that Act provides that, in the interpretation of legislation generally, every word importing the masculine gender shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as if it imported also the feminine gender.  The converse of this rule, however, does not apply.</P>
      <P>The practice has therefore been that legislation is drafted in the masculine gender, unless it relates exclusively to women, as is the case with the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981. However, legislation which affects both women and men is drafted in the masculine gender even if it primarily relates to women, as is the case with the Employment Equality Act, 1977.</P>
      <P>There have been many calls for an amendment to the 1937 Act.  The Act has been criticised by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights and has been the subject of Private Members' Bills in the past.  The Second Commission on the Status of Women criticised the present position as sexist and one that could &ldquo;contribute to stereotyped and limiting images of the respective roles of women and men&rdquo;.  The Commission recommended that the Interpretation Act be amended to enable the adoption of the feminine gender in legislative measures clearly and primarily addressed to women.</P>
      <P>I believe these criticisms are well-founded. There is general awareness nowadays of the importance of terminology in shaping perceptions of particular groups.  It is no longer acceptable to use language which is sexist or which reinforces sexual stereotypes.  I believe the State should give a lead in addressing this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stress I am bringing forward this legislation not for ideological reasons but for sound practical ones.  This is not a matter of being &ldquo;politically correct&rdquo;.  The predominance of the masculine gender in <Col N="1285" /> legislation can, as the Commission on the Status of Women pointed out, contribute to stereotyped and limiting images of the respective roles of women and men.  It is sexist and demeaning that legislation which will primarily, but not exclusively, affect women cannot be couched in the feminine gender.  There is a clear imbalance in the present position and the Bill is designed to redress this imbalance.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill provides that, in the interpretation of legislation generally, every word importing the feminine gender shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as if it also imported the masculine gender.  This is, of course, the converse of the existing provision in section 11 (b) of the 1937 Act.  It will mean that use of the feminine gender in Bills and statutory instruments will no longer be confined to measures directed exclusively to women.  This provision will apply to Acts passed on or after the date of enactment of the present Bill and to statutory instruments made under such Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill is a standard technical provision which provides for short title, construction and collective citation.</P>
    <P>To complement the provisions of the Bill, the Government has decided that, in general, Bills and statutory instruments should be drafted in gender-neutral language as far as possible.  In other words, legislation will be framed as far as is possible in terms which can apply to either gender rather than in terms which are specifically masculine or feminine.</P>
    <P>This is a short Bill but it represents a fundamental change to the Interpretation Act.  Its importance should not be underestimated. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a simple but important proposal.  It updates, after 57 years, the Interpretation Act by giving the interpretation of legislation in the female gender the same status as the interpretation of legislation in the masculine gender.  Section 11 (b) of the Interpretation Act provides that every word importing the masculine gender shall, unless the contrary intention <Col N="1286" /> appears, be construed as if it imported the feminine gender.  This Bill gives the feminine gender the same status as the male one.  Heretofore, legislation expressed society's view in general that males had a higher recognition and status.</P>
      <P>This Bill is symbolic of a growing change in attitude to women in general and is welcome.  Much has been spoken and written about women's rights and equality of the sexes over the past two or three decades.  A great deal has been achieved but too many areas remain to be dealt with.  Equality between the sexes in many areas is more apparent than real. I wish to mention a few of them and invite the Minister to comment on them.</P>
      <P>The lack of support for child care facilities seriously limits women's potential to play an equal part with men in society. There can be no equality of opportunity in the workplace without a supportive system of child care.  The key indication of the Government's commitment to this area is the amount of money it provides for greater and more accessible child care facilities.  The report of the Commission on the Status of Women identifies, as a first priority in this area, the establishment of an annual child care budget to invest in the development of child care facilities.  The commission has suggested a budget of £20 million and special tax allowances for investment in child care and that the Government should make a case for EU Structural Funds for child care facilities.  I ask the Minister to comment on the Government's approach to this and to say if there are plans to provide moneys for the establishment of such facilities.</P>
      <P>If the Government is serious about women's rights, it should extend equality legislation to the Defence Forces.  There is no valid reason for excluding the Defence Forces from such legislation. The Minister can implement this extension by the making of an order.  This would indicate the Government's real commitment to equality in a key area under its control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am highlighting these two areas as an example of where the Government has <Col N="1287" /> an opportunity to show real commitment to equality of the sexes.  I also ask the Minister to indicate when the Equal Status Bill, as recommended by the Second Commission on the Status of Women, will be published.  What plans has the Government to establish an independent equality commission on a semi-State basis?</P>
    <P>In discussing equality, we must recognise and give due status to work done by women in the home.  Despite the vital role they play in society, they have never been given the recognition they deserve. What plans, if any, has the Government to direct social welfare payments and allowances for dependent children to spouses in the home?  This would give some recognition to such women.  The Minister might also give us information on the Government's view on the reform of the PRSI system to allow women in the home optical, dental and other such benefits.  Tackling these issues would be much more tangible to the lives of women than this Bill, worthy though it is.</P>
    <P>Education has a vital role to play in the attitude of future generations to equality and women.  It is important girls have the same access to subject choices as boys. There has been discrimination in this area in the past.  There have been some improvements but many remain to be introduced or accepted by schools and colleges.  Until we have equality of educational choices, we cannot say women have full access to careers previously dominated by males.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to raise an area which is of direct relevance to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The ushers in the Oireachtas are exclusively male.  I congratulate them on the excellent job they do.  They are our public relations officers in that they meet the public when they arrive at the Houses of the Oireachtas.  They do a first class job and one cannot commend them highly enough.  Surely the ushers, who are the window of the Oireachtas, should not be exclusively of one sex?  I am surprised that there are no women ushers in the Oireachtas.  Perhaps the Minister will <Col N="1288" /> give his views on this and address it in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me enormous pleasure to welcome this short Bill to this House because of its significance.  As the youngest elected Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas I am, therefore, the youngest woman in either House.  It shows the changes and inroads which women have made in politics.  I am optimistic for the future when I see myself in my first year aiding the passing of this legislation, which I welcome.  Countess Markievicz was elected as the first Minister for Labour 75 years ago.  This has too often been underestimated and written out of the history books.  Next Tuesday a portrait of Countess Markievicz is to be unveiled in Leinster House.</P>
      <P>We are making strides in the fight for equality but it is a fight.  As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, I am aware of the measures which are necessary to deal with even the most basic and fundamental recommendations in the report of the Commission on the Status of Women.  Countless reforms are necessary. Many of these involve high costs but many do not cost anything but simply require policy changes.  Why do we have housing estates with steps to pathways which are inaccessible to women with prams and shopping bags?  We should be looking to simple policy matters where the Government should not miss an opportunity to rectify matters.</P>
      <P>The language in our legislation has been sexist.  Apart from that, language generally tends to be sexist.  When reference is made in newspapers and on television and radio to people in the home the word &ldquo;she&rdquo; is automatically used.  When reference is made to business, law and high finance the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; is generally used because it is a male dominated society in that sense.  Those attitudes are ingrained in people.  Even women take those attitudes to heart because we hear this language so often and have grown up listening to it.  It is time to get rid of at least the overt and open discrimination in language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> The damage is often unknown but it is invidious.  It ingrains attitudes in society where it is assumed that judges and bank managers are men.  Why should this be assumed?  Perhaps we are talking about history here.  Perhaps we are not open to the fact that there are women in those positions nowadays.  There are not enough of them but we are getting there. We must change the attitudes which result in these assumptions.</P>
    <P>This legislation goes some way towards tackling that.  However, it is still a man's world.  We do not have separate social welfare payments for women dependants. Married women on the dole, of which there are many, are described as dependants.  Their husbands receive the payment and they get nothing into their hands.  That is a disgrace.  In most cases the woman looks after the children but she is not recognised as an individual under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>We have umpteen areas in which legislation is urgently needed.  When I came to this House I was aghast that I could not find the ladies' facilities.  They are hidden and were obviously not planned for in the beginning.  We still do not have a crèche in Leinster House.  We have an enormous distance to go but at least this legislation gets rid of what I call the blatant and obvious discrimination.  Women in politics need certain supports such as positive discrimination in certain ways, a political system which encourages women and financial support.  However, I firmly believe that it is only when women are elected to these Houses that the necessary changes will happen.</P>
    <P>This legislation deals with open discrimination. Women have come so far nowadays that one cannot always say &ldquo;he&rdquo; in legislation.  At last, this has been taken on board and provision has been made to gender proof our legislation. We will no longer have to read &ldquo;he&rdquo; in reference to important people, it will now read &ldquo;he or she&rdquo;.  It is a help but it is not enough.</P>
    <P>It gets rid of the open and obvious discrimination, but the real problem is in the mind, and is more difficult to eradicate. I am talking about the ingrained <Col N="1290" /> attitudes of many people.  I wonder if we have really changed anything.  Men are more careful now about not being seen to discriminate but attitudes need a general shake up.  We are now left with the hidden, carefully disguised discrimination which still exists in my profession, in politics and every other area of life.</P>
    <P>That is much more difficult to tackle but I have faith in the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, whom I know personally and who is totally dedicated to this.  The creation of that Department was a major step on the road towards equality because at last we are not just talking to a blank wall, we have a Minister to approach on such issues.  The legislation introduced so far goes a long way.  One can now tick off many of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women. We have made inroads but it is most important that we tackle attitudes.  That is the most difficult task but we will keep at it.  I welcome this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This important legislation is welcome.  It is, in a way, a slight piece of legislation in that it is quite a short, clear Bill.  It has a number of significances. The first I wish to draw to the attention of the House is the fact that it represents a clear signal from the Government on two levels.  On one level the Government is obviously committed to equality and I would like to pay tribute to the splendid work of this Minister. However, the Government has also used it to indicate that it will not accept cooperative government, including contributions from the Independent benches.</P>
      <P>I make again, with the Minister present, the point which I made on the Order of Business that this is a Bill which has been on the Order Paper or available for quite some time.  It originated before I was elected to this House as a result of the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  There was some discussion with Nuala Fennell who, I think, had intended proposing precisely such legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1291" /> When I was elected to the House I was made a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  This was one of the areas which we looked at and it did, in fact, cause a certain amount of trouble.  It is ludicrous to envisage situations where employment equality legislation has to be drafted in grammatical terms which completely eradicate the visible presence of half the human race because of their gender.  It is completely absurd.</P>
    <P>I had discussions with Nuala Fennell who by that stage was no longer a Member of the House.  I took over sections of her Bill and we changed it slightly.  It was printed and put on the Order Paper.  For four years I asked various Governments to use this simple, uncontroversial legislation to give a signal that it was prepared to accept proposals for legislation from benches other than those of the Government.  It is important that signal should be given at some stage.  I remind the House that it is now 40 years since any legislation, even of a non-controversial nature, emerged from the Independent benches.  The Minister is shaking his head but my information is that the last Bill to emerge from the Independent benches in the Seanad&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;was the late Professor B.W. Stanford's Bill on humane treatment of animals in abattoirs.  I acknowledge that the Government has accepted and sent to Committee Bills from, for example, Deputy Shatter and that is most welcome.  It is a pity, however, that it could not be done in the Seanad because we are a debating Chamber, a revising Chamber and a Chamber where social improvements can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been noticeable in the past session that not only have Bills not been introduced here but legislation which has been proposed in this House and put on the Order Paper has been snatched from us and taken to the Lower House. <Col N="1292" /> Senator Neville is in an excellent position to speak about this.  I am making a strong plea to the Government to find some opportunity to signal that the intellectual energy of this House can be appreciated, harnessed and channelled so non-controversial items can be put on the Order Paper to allow us on this side of the House, whether we see ourselves as Opposition or merely Independents, to contribute to debate.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome and I accept what Senator Neville and my other colleagues have said about the wider aspects, particularly the question of including the Defence Forces in equality legislation.  I am sure the Minister will examine this issue particularly since the Government was so successful in a difficult and sensitive area, the decriminalisation of homosexual behaviour which was extended to the armed forces in a manner which President Clinton found quite impossible.  There should not be too much difficulty with the inclusion of the Defence Forces in all equality legislation.</P>
    <P>The idea that the male includes the female must be one of the most insulting, patronising and demeaning notions even if it is only at the level of grammatical construction.  It gives a clear indication of the position of women who were traditionally regarded as inferior and less important.  Generally speaking it was much better if they were invisible or in the kitchen which is more or less the same thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have to mention the same old phrase we all know from textbooks, &ldquo;Tá Daidí ag obair agus tá Mamaí sa chistin&rdquo;.  I do not know what she was doing in the kitchen if she was not ag obair.  When the Government gets around to giving wages for housework, not just to ensure equality but in full recognition of the dignity of each individual, as a house person who does all my own housework, I will certainly be claiming some supplementary income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grammatical form in which legislation previously had to be framed indicates <Col N="1293" /> that women were regarded as an emasculated form of the male which was not fully complete but rather an imperfect version of humanity which was seen as secondary.  I have to say the Church has a large measure of responsibility in this.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville is looking for female ushers and I will not make a cheap crack and use the word &ldquo;usherettes&rdquo; because that would be clearly sexist language.  If we are going to have ushers who are women and who would do an excellent job, why can we not have equal employment in the Church?  We could have women priests or a woman pope which would be a huge advance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may not have control over that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Some day he might &mdash; one never knows.  These matters which appear to be simple grammatical effects actually reflect deep seated prejudices in our society.  It is a good day's work to eradicate this and is long overdue.</P>
      <P>Although I welcome the Bill I regret that it was not possible for the Government to be generous on this occasion. As the Minister indicated by his body language, the Government took legislation from the Opposition in the Dáil.  I hope the Minister will carry the message back to Government as there will be other Bills which will have all party support. Perhaps we could get away from the dog in the manger attitude which prevents legislation emerging from this side of the House.  The point is not quite as important as the removal of sexism but it would be a healthy development in our political life.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber and I am delighted that he has introduced this legislation.  I know the Minister well and have worked with him at county council level.  I am not surprised that he is so up front because any time I had dealings with him he treated me as a person, not as a woman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is overdue and I am delighted to see it being introduced when <Col N="1294" /> I am trying to make strides as a person in politics.  I do not speak as a woman in politics and neither should people speak as men in politics.  We should speak as educated people doing a job.</P>
    <P>It is all about attitudes and while I welcome this legislation there are some hidden agendas which stem from our education system and from parents who still believe in maintaining the traditional concepts of men, boys and girls.  There is nothing wrong with that but we tend to rear children with separate agendas for boys and girls when it comes to the workforce.</P>
    <P>Every year I interview students of 18 years of age for post leaving certificate courses.  I ask the young ladies to tell me something about their background, what they would like to do in life, how they would see themselves in the future and whether or not their mothers are working. Immediately they reply that she is not and when I ask what it is she does they say that she is at home.  This is a good example of how people think.  If a woman is not doing something outside the home, she is merely a housewife.</P>
    <P>This is a sad reflection on our education system and we must start confronting this problem.  As an educator I try to introduce it in social and personal programmes by urging students to think of themselves as people, recognise their own strengths as a person and yet delight in being a boy or a girl.  This legislation is important but could remain in the background. If I was not here today I might not know about the introduction of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to be able to return to my school and tell the staff that legislation has come on stream which deals with equality of opportunity and equal chance for all young people whether they are male or female.  I dread the use of the two words, male and female.  They are necessary and it is nice to be a woman or a man but we should live our lives as people.  I broke through in a Seanad campaign which was very male oriented. There were 14 men on the panel on which I sought election and to be elected against those odds was a clear indication of a <Col N="1295" /> change in politics.  We have seen it here in that female Senators have been prominent in discussing these issues.</P>
    <P>We can discuss equality in the context of our education system and the number of teachers and school principals.  I do not know why we do not have more lady principals.  Maybe it is an example of discrimination.  One term I cannot stand is &ldquo;ban gharda&rdquo;.  Do we use the term &ldquo;fear garda&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>It has been abolished and it was well overdue.  However, it was in existence for so long that people still use it.  I was talking to a person yesterday who used it.  It is still necessary to change attitudes.  Ideas have not filtered through society.  Any legislation which is enacted must be communicated to the public and our attitudes in implementing it must change.  It must filter through all walks of life, otherwise, the legislation will exist but we will not know anything about how it works in society.  It is nice to see this welcome legislation coming on stream.  It tells us that we are now a nation which respects equality of opportunity in theory.  We must start with theory.  I hope there will be more such legislation in the future.</P>
      <P>The key provision in this Bill is that legislation from now on is to be drafted in gender neutral language.  We will get away from the concepts of male and female and legislation will reflect people as they are.  Whatever walk of life we are in, we are there as people and that is the way it should be.</P>

      <P>I, too, congratulate the Minister and welcome this legislation.  As other Senators have said, there are still many issues outstanding, but we must give him credit where credit is due.  This section in the 1937 Act was criticised by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights.  Senator Norris, who referred to that point, brought Private Member's Bills into this House dealing with this issue.  The Second Commission <Col N="1296" /> on the Status of Women, of which I was a member, made a strong recommendation in this regard when it asked that the Interpretation Act be redrafted to enable the adoption of the feminine gender in legislation clearly and primarily addressed to women.</P>
      <P>I welcome the statement in the Minister's speech to the effect that he is ending discriminatory and unnecessary gender specific language in Bills, Acts and Instruments of the Oireachtas.  The Commission on the Status of Women recommended that &ldquo;she/he&rdquo; and &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; should be used in all Bills, Acts and Instruments.  I would like to see that happening. Language is very important and has a huge influence on our experience of life.  Children can be very conditioned by the language they habitually hear.  We take it for granted that great strides are being made but Countess Markievicz was a Minister long ago and it took until 1993 to break the one woman barrier in Cabinet.  It shows how slow progress has been.  Many of the requests or recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women are still outstanding and still perceived by women to be very important.</P>
      <P>It is because there are so few women in positions of power, both in the Oireachtas and outside, that things change at such a slow pace.  The aggressive and demanding voices in this country, those which are listened to, are the voices of men.  Senator Neville has said that childcare is the single most important issue that prevents women from taking their full place in Irish life.  This very important issue must be addressed by the Minister.  I know tackling this issue has a cost, as does the issue of carers.  In 1990 some 66,000 people were cared for in their own homes and over 80 per cent of the carers were women.  Women are not selfish or demanding of things for themselves. When decisions about these issues are being made, whether in the Oireachtas or outside in the world of business, people always ask where the money will come from, but we can find money for other things.  We must reassess our values and decide what is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> Much of the contribution of women over the years has been very important and has gone unrewarded because women are not demanding.  They are not selfish enough and do not demand things for themselves.  It is up to us here to realise this and demand for women the things they want.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of Women recommended an Equal Status Act, to which Senator Neville referred. We are waiting for that.  It also recommended the setting up of an equality commission which would incorporate the Employment Equality Agency, but the Minister should note that the level of staffing and funding to the Employment Equality Agency is very low.  There is much to be done in this area.  Those who have the money or power are not aware that there is such an agenda to be fulfilled. They do not realise the enormous amount of work to be done.  I ask the Minister to increase staffing levels and funding for the Employment Equality Agency and to talk to us about his views on the equality commission.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, who in setting up of the county enterprise boards asked them to strive to achieve 40 per cent representation by women.  They were not too earnest in their striving because most of the boards sent back lists of names without a women among them. It is absolutely disgraceful.  In fairness to the Minister &mdash; and I compliment him on this &mdash; he added two women to each of the county enterprise boards throughout the country.  If I were Minister I would have sent back the list and told them that I was sorry, but since representation of women was not at 40 per cent, they would have to strive again.  It is not acceptable in 1993 that they presume since they always got away with this they will get away with it this time.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the county enterprise board in Laois.  When we were discussing the position of chief executive, they all talked about &ldquo;him&rdquo;.  It was automatically assumed that the chief executives of the county enterprise boards would be men. If you interrupt people and say &ldquo;she&rdquo; or <Col N="1298" />&ldquo;a woman&rdquo; they turn around and look at you as if you are making a statement.  We are making a statement.  People continuously say &ldquo;he&rdquo; and nobody considers it to be important.  That is the way it has always been and it will continue unless we are vigilant and constantly demand our rights in this respect.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that we should not have men.  We need a balance right through society, particularly where the decisions made will affect people's lives.  That is why in dealing with the county enterprise boards, the Government should encourage women to get involved in enterprise and to use their talents and resources there.  By talking about men, about &ldquo;he&rdquo; and by not having equal representation for women on these bodies, certain statements and perceptions are sent out to women.  Women are being told that they have their place but that it is not at the centre of activity.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise one other issue.  We have an office in this country, the Ombudsman, which was established in the recent past.  The word &ldquo;ombudsman&rdquo; came from Norway.  My difficulty is that by 1990 the normal term for the ombudsman in Norway was &ldquo;ombud&rdquo;.  We could do something about this here.  The office of the Ombudsman was set up by the Government.  By the very term &ldquo;man&rdquo; the message is automatically given that there is a presumption that the holder of that office is a man and must be a man.  I ask the Minister if he would take appropriate action to change the name of the Ombudsman to &ldquo;Ombud&rdquo;.  He would be giving a signal out that the holder of the office can be man or woman.  These things are important, and not for the sake of being politically correct.  It must be done to condition people to the idea that both men and women can participate equally in all aspects of life.  We who are seen to be in positions of power must recognise this.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and wish him well.  He has a lot to do.  He has already brought the Matrimonial Home Bill to us which we welcome.  I urge him to continue in this work and to look at <Col N="1299" /> the issue of community of property which he said should now be aimed at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Senators for their constructive contributions on the Bill.  The question of whether legislation is drafted in the feminine or masculine gender may appear trivial to some.  I am convinced however that the present dominance of the masculine gender in our legislation is distorted and offensive to women.  It is sexist and reinforces stereotype views of roles of women.  It is simply not acceptable that legislation primarily directed at women should be framed in the masculine gender.  Criticisms of the present position have come not only from the Second Commission on the Status of Women, but from many other quarters also.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, made strong comments on this topic in this House last May and many Deputies in the other House have also raised it.  There were strong comments made on this topic by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, in this House last May and many Deputies in the other House have also raised it.</P>
      <P>The approval with which the measure is being greeted is welcome and is evidenced by the fact that Senators have commented on other substantive equality issues, not all of them in my area of responsibility.  I agree with Senator Neville's remarks about child care, and he can take it that this is a matter which is receiving my active attention at present. Appropriate proposals for funding child care will be put forward for assistance from the Structural Funds.  The equal status legislation to which Senator Neville also referred is being advanced as speedily as possible and I hope it will come before the Oireachtas early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator Norris's point, I cannot take responsibility for what a Government may or may not have done four years ago but I would have no problem in looking at any Private Members' Bill which originated in the Seanad in my <Col N="1300" /> area of responsibility and I am sure that other members of the Government would feel likewise.  The Government has shown that it is prepared to be open minded by accepting the landlord and tenant Bill proposed by Deputy Shatter in the Dáil.  I know of no reason that there would be any inequality in that regard in the Government's view regarding acceptance of Private Members' Bills on non-controversial or appropriate matters as between the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan referred to the question of the &ldquo;ombud&rdquo; which had not occurred to me and I thank her for bringing it to my attention.  I will refer it to the appropriate Minister who has charge of that office.  It is a matter which should be dealt with at some stage.  I thank all Senators who contributed for their constructive comments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on his initiative at this early stage in his Ministry in getting down to regularising the legislation in this complex area.  He indicated he is considering a number of other measures which are also overdue.  I welcome the initiative he is taking in, for instance, putting autonomous boards in place for the National Museum and the National Library.  This will be a worthwhile and progressive development which is necessary in view of the added responsibility the National Museum will have in the implementation of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am less sure about the Minister's plans for the putting in place of a statutory <Col N="1301" /> heritage council.  There would need to be some examination of the structure of departmental responsibility in this regard before the Minister would go ahead with legislation.  For instance, how would a statutory heritage council work with the Commissioners of Public Works?  There would need to be an examination of the whole subject at the political and the administrative levels to see how best a framework could be put in place which would do what we would all like to see done.  To a large degree, heritage was left in a poor state over the years.  Other priorities took precedence and other areas of national endeavour sought funding which, to a large extent, deprived heritage of the funding which was so necessary to deal with its problems.</P>
    <P>There were a few developments in the 1980s and the early 1990s.  I would mention the contribution of the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, in this area.  When he discovered that some of our national buildings, even in this city, were in a derelict and run-down state he provided urgent funding.  This enabled reconstruction and remedial works to be undertaken on this building, the National Gallery, the National Museum and other buildings.  When I had responsibility for the Office of Public Works in the 1989-90 period the rain was running down the inside of the walls in some of our most important national buildings in this city due to lack of investment.</P>
    <P>The second important element was the provision of funding through the National Lottery.  This has been worthwhile and I would like to record our appreciation of the former Taoiseach's involvement in the various areas and the funding provided through the National Lottery which has, to a large extent, remedied deficiencies in the buildings housing the National Gallery and the National Museum, and has allowed some magnificent work to be done such as the development of the Royal Hospital Kilmainham and the gallery there.  To a large extent, we are making up now for the lack of action over many years and for the state of neglect of many of our national <Col N="1302" /> monuments and buildings.  It is important that adequate funding be provided to enable the work which needs to be done to be carried through.</P>
    <P>This legislation clearly makes provision to sort out what has been a subject of litigation and controversy, the question of the legality of ownership of national treasures and national archaeological objects.  The legislation puts a grave responsibility on the Director of the National Museum.  I would like to pay tribute to the present director, Dr. Pat Wallace.  He has made a magnificent contribution to the development of the National Museum and I am aware of his extraordinary energy and ability.  I have no doubt he will have the competence and professionalism to deal with the responsibilities being put on his shoulders in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that he plans to have a new autonomous board for the National Museum and I do not see where the board is brought into the legislation. Perhaps the Minister might look at this. It is a complex area which has been the subject of various court proceedings and litigation and, in an effort to find a way in which we can minimise litigation, I would suggest that in the legislation the Minister is putting before us he might give some consideration to putting in place an appeal mechanism either to the board of the museum or to the Minister. While I have great confidence in the competence and professionalism of the director of the National Museum, to avoid complication in this area it would be desirable that an appeals mechanism be put in place.  Thus if there is a dispute, for example, between the director and a person who has a special find, there would be a means of resolving it to avoid, as far as possible, recourse to the courts and litigation which could bring the legislation into question again.</P>
    <P>The director requires adequate funding to enable him to carry out his duties and to employ, as is indicated in the legislation, qualified and competent people to assist him in his work.  If it is necessary to secure safe places for the storage and maintenance of important <Col N="1303" /> items that may be found, the director should have the necessary financial resources to do so.  Perhaps provision, if it is not already in the legislation, could be made for a fund which the director could use.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the importance of regionalisation in deciding locations for the storage and display of important items.  While we value and would wish to see the National Museum in a dominant position in this area, it is important that the regions be given attention.  Magnificent work has been done on the Hunt Museum and the Hunt Collection in Limerick which is very encouraging and should be supported.  I would like to see that work extended to other regions.</P>
    <P>The work that has already been done in the conservation area is a credit to the Office of Public Works.  Long before the State was founded the commissioners took steps to ensure that important items of our heritage were protected and preserved. No doubt they, too, were deprived of financial resources for much of their work.  I again emphasise the necessity to provide the necessary resources to enable conservation and management work to be undertaken. There are huge demands in the conservation area which will require substantial investment.  Conservation is a costly exercise.  Look at this Chamber and the magnificent work carried out on it by the Office of Public Works. However, it is very expensive work.  If we want to do these things we must pay for them.  Funding is vitally important to ensure that important sites in Ireland are protected and conserved.</P>
    <P>It is wise that the Minister, through the Office of Public Works, is establishing a record of national monuments.  Perhaps he would outline the present situation in relation to the records of sites that was compiled by the Office of Public Works for many counties; I am not sure if that work was completed.  It was started by An Foras Forbartha and continued by the Office of Public Works.  I launched the records of one or two counties and they contained detailed documentation, <Col N="1304" /> including maps, plans and sketches, which were available to planning authorities and archaeological societies. People who were interested in conserving and developing those areas had first hand information from these records.  The record for Kerry was well documented and aerial photography identified about 1,000 sites which had previously been unidentified.  I am not certain if that record will be affected by the new record the Minister proposes under this legislation or whether he is giving legislative effect to that record in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I support the comments of other Senators on theft of important stone carvings and other items from our important sites.  It is both a tragedy and a scandal that an individual can go into a site like the Friary in Ennis and, with an electric saw, remove some of the most important stone carvings in that national monument. How that can be done without coming to somebody's attention is beyond me.  The fines in this area are totally inadequate.  In addition, how this highly professional and well organised campaign can be tackled baffles me.  The Minister should bring it to the attention of the Garda authorities and others.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in one location a child was lowered through iron bars which had been installed to protect important stones.  Ropes were put around the stones and, over a period of time, they were removed.  This type of blackguardism must stop.  The resources of the Minister, the Garda Síochána and the Office of Public Works must be utilised.  We must also seek the support of local organisations, such as archaeological societies, in an effort to stamp out this wanton vandalism which is creating havoc in some of our important sites.  There was another serious incident in Liscannor a few weeks ago.</P>
    <P>We also know that attempts were made to smuggle items out of the country in cars travelling through ferry ports. Recently the competence of the customs officers prevented some very valuable items from Clonmacnoise being brought to Germany.  Very heavy penalties must be imposed for such crimes and I am not <Col N="1305" /> sure the penalties in the legislation will be adequate.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk recently about amnesties to enable us to recover finances that have been invested abroad. Perhaps an amnesty might be considered in regard to this problem.  Very valuable items which, in many cases, are of no use to the individuals who have them might be turned over to the State if there was an amnesty provision over a period was introduced.  We need strong legislation to deal with people who take valuable historical items out of the country but we need an incentive to get some items back. In the UK in particular there are many items of historical and archaeological significance which would be returned if there was an incentive to do so.</P>
    <P>In section 10 there is a provision to pay rewards or inducements to people who hand over historical items.  It may be possible to extend that by offering inducements to people overseas who have important items, some of which were taken from the country before the foundation of the State.  Some of the most important historical items from Scattery Island &mdash; which was a monastic settlement in the Shannon estuary &mdash; are in the British Museum.  I realise there is co-operation between that museum and the National Museum and I would like that co-operation to be encouraged and developed.  Perhaps the Minister might bear that co-operation between the professionals in the British Museum and ours in mind and, when he is considering the establishment of a new board for the museum, this co-operation might be extended in the European context.  Perhaps it is already possible to do this under section 10.  It would be desirable if some inducement was provided to encourage people outside this jurisdiction to return important items in their possession.</P>
    <P>The preservation and development of historical sites is important.  One of the challenges the Minister will face is how, on the one hand, we can preserve and maintain important sites and monuments and, on the other develop them.  This has been done in the buildings next door and in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham where <Col N="1306" /> there is a modern museum in a historical and architecturally important building.</P>
    <P>The challenge which faces the developers and the Minister, in particular, is to blend the modern with the old.  One can see the hand of the architectural professionals from the Office of Public Works in the work done in the Custom House, Leinster House and other buildings in this city, where the new has been successfully blended with the old.  In particular, I want to mention the refurbishment of Dublin Castle and the modern facilities which have been put into a historical building.  This is an indication of the success of the architectural professionals in the Department.  The same is true of the Custom House and the National Gallery which was officially opened a few years ago.</P>
    <P>In relation to national monuments and to Scattery Island, I mentioned the necessity for change in some of the old legislation which inhibits what can be done on many important sites.  For instance, under the Church Act, 1869, the Commissioners of Public Works are prohibited from financing projects where services are held in certain buildings.  The restoration of St. Mary's Cathedral in Limerick was an important job undertaken by the Bishop of Limerick and the community.  Excellent preservation work has been undertaken on one of the most historic buildings in Ireland.  However, the Commissioners of Public Works were prohibited from financing that project because services were taking place in St. Mary's Cathedral.  I urge the Minister to use this legislation to repeal the Church Act, 1869 because the Commissioners are prohibited from becoming involved in the restoration of buildings where religious services are held.  Religious services on these important sites should be encouraged. People involved in this area would welcome a decision by the Minister to repeal the entire legislation or to make some provision for a licensing arrangement.</P>
    <P>I compliment the great voluntary effort being made at present.  I want to mention the work being done by Kilrush community development in relation to the <Col N="1307" /> acquisition of Scattery Island.  This island was established as a historical monument before the formation of this Government. I urge the Minister to support the development work being planned for Scattery Island by providing Structural Funds to ensure that the pier development, which is essential for the overall development of the island, is undertaken.</P>
    <P>Areas such as Kilfenora have a long record of involvement at community level and with State agencies in the preservation of some of the most important sites in Ireland, including the controversial Burren area.  Significant work has been done by the Burren Community Council and by the comhar cumann which operates the Burren Kilfenora centre.  I urge the Minister to support the work they are doing by grant aiding the committee so that they can update their premises and undertake the work which needs to be done.  Grant aid could be given by the Heritage Council which has done magnificent work.  This funding would allow important work to be done at Kilfenora to ensure that the project, which has been there for many years, will survive and develop in the future.</P>
    <P>I want to mention the Discovery Programme reports and the work carried out by Professor George Eogan and a team in the unique development started by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, and supported by the present Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds.  The first report was issued recently by Professor George Eogan, chairman of the Discovery Programme panel.  Professor Eogan said about the project:</P>
    <P>This venture is without parallel in European archaeology: the editor of one international archaeological periodical has recently described it as a visionary and remarkable initiative coming at a time when integrated research is wasting away elsewhere in Europe.  It is also a significant affirmation of the importance we attach to our heritage, for without the research to explain how this legacy was formed, our museums and heritage centres <Col N="1308" /> would be little more than superficial displays of relics of times gone by.</P>
    <P>These sentences sum up what needs to be done in this area.  The Minister faces an exciting challenge and many professionals are working with him.  Professor George Eogan and others in the Discovery Programme worked in a place which is dear to the Minister's heart, Mooghaun Fort.  His brother, John, is involved in the local Clare archaeological society.  The Discovery Programme reports indicate the work already done in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister must get the necessary backing from these Houses to undertake future work.  This is an exciting time and the Minister will have a difficult job to strike a balance between the preservation of our heritage and its future development. People must be able to say in 50 years' time that a contribution was made to conservation and development in the 1980s and 1990s, that the situation was not all negative.  We had negative action in Mullaghmore and we should not allow anything similar to happen again.  The Minister has a big challenge facing him and he needs our support.  I assure him of my support and I compliment him on the effort he has made because it augurs well for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy M. Higgins, to the House and I also welcome the Bill.  I was delighted when the Minister was appointed to his position because he is the right person in the right job, at the right time.  Our attitude towards our past has changed for the better in the last few decades.  I hope the Minister will take positive action, not only with this Bill, but with many more aspects of our past and culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not fight the battle of the interpretative centres again, but I am concerned about the size of the centres we are building.  A few months ago I was in Filatosa in Corsica, the major megalithic site there and its interpretative centre, which is a distance from the main site, is approximately the size of the shop <Col N="1309" /> we are constructing at the gates of Leinster House.  Literature was used to give information about this site.  Any commercial cafés, shops with souvenirs and so on connected with the megalithic tombs were some distance away in a small village.</P>
    <P>As I was leaving the megalithic tombs, I gave a lift to French students and told them I was from Ireland.  I was struck forcibly by the fact that they considered Ireland had the best megalithic tombs in Europe.  They had not been to Ireland, yet they knew all about Newgrange and our country.  They were so well informed, knew what we had to offer and were hoping to visit.  I hoped that when they did visit they would not consider that we were developing some of the sites into something like a theme park.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to appear too critical, I believe this would be a terrible mistake, because I have also been to other sites where I have seen this happen. I especially remember visiting Pammoucle, one of the most exciting places of natural history I have seen in my life, and the place was being destroyed as I was there.  Pammoucle is not a very exotic place to get to.  If anyone goes on a package holiday to Kusadasi in Turkey it is not far away and it is a most exciting place to visit.  Their idea of an interpretative centre, with hotels and so on, has been built in the centre of this most precious piece of their environment.  I am glad I visited Pammoucle, because I do not know how much of it will remain in ten years' time.</P>
    <P>We need to be careful about the scale of our constructions.  I have no intention of telling anyone where the little 1,000 year old bridge on the way into Dingle is located, and I hope that Senator Fitzgerald will not tell anyone either.  At present one can see this completely unspoilt little bridge, in existence for 1,000 years, the ruts of carts which went over it and the parapets where people had to walk beside it.</P>
    <P>We must be very careful about precious bits of our environment which can be rapidly bulldozed over by vast numbers of tourists.  For example, I am not <Col N="1310" /> enthusiastic at the prospect of roads being extended on Slea Head to bring people down to Dunquin.  A very large number of people got down to Dunquin, often on buses which managed to get around the terrible corners, before such work on the roads was considered and I do not recall any appalling accidents there.</P>
    <P>The Government must take positive action on protection.  It must be positive about everything that is to be done on this issue.  Recognising that the sites exist will not be enough.  They have to be protected and it is the Government's duty to do this.</P>
    <P>The National Heritage Council was established in 1988 and to my knowledge has not received any statutory recognition to date.  I understand that talks are ongoing in the Department about this, but I wish to recognise the great amount of work that 14 volunteers have undertaken over the last seven or eight years. This has been achieved with a decrease in money.  When it was established, the National Heritage Council received approximately £1 million pounds per year.  However, the latest sum the council received was £330,000, because, I gather, if money is given for restorations, this is taken from the money allocated to the council.  This is not a good idea.  It does not allow the council to commence other projects.  In view of this, I await the Minister's plans for the National Heritage Council.</P>
    <P>Many Members have mentioned finance, which is important.  I was interested in the amount of money promised in the Structural Funds for the establishment of golf courses.  I am anxious about the attitude towards tourism.  Is it not essential that the golf courses which are set up should be established and profitable, so that those who are involved in them know that they are going to have some sort of income?  Every golfer in the world cannot be expected to land at Rosslare and play all the way around the country.  Could not some of the money allocated to golf courses be spent on the restoration and preservation of buildings and historic sites?  It seems an extraordinary amount <Col N="1311" /> of money to go into new projects which, I believe, have to be brought on stream carefully so that they become viable before others are started up.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Department of Finance is always short of money.  Any money which the Minister can obtain, from any source, for the National Heritage Council would be important.  I hope also that the Office of Public Works will co-operate with the National Heritage Council.  Sometimes I get the impression that the bodies appear to be working in conflict with each other.  I would like to believe that an <i>entente cordiale</i> would be struck between them.  I hope the Minister receives credit for the efforts he has made to help the National Heritage Council and the handing over of Castletown House and surrounding lands, which I understand is to take place shortly, together with the loan of the important contents of the Castletown House itself.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, but we must go a great deal further in introducing legislation to protect our heritage.  There is no effective legislation to prevent people from filling crates and exporting a considerable amount of artef acts.  This is what happened to the sculpture from Russborough House.  Urgent legislation is required on this matter.  I am aware that the legislation under consideration in the House today will help, but there is a need to protect contemporary work also.</P>
    <P>The case of the sculpture at Russborough House is famous, but there have been other such cases.  Books are especially vulnerable.  This is a serious matter because a large number of our best collections of books are in private hands.  The library of the Earl of Grannard was sold, I believe within the last two months, in London.  Did Dr. Donlon from the National Library have an opportunity to examine the collection to ascertain if there were any works of importance for this country that we should retain?  I recall the Kings Inns benchers sold books some years ago, apparently to build a canteen, which I hope was not the case, and there was <Col N="1312" /> great drama on that issue.  Some of the books were eventually bought back.  The Worth Library is under the control of the Eastern Health Board.  I do not suggest that if the health services got into difficulties, part of the Worth Library would be sold, but is there any legislation to prevent this from happening?  I do not believe so.  I urge the Minister to go forward with the work he is doing as I believe that it is very important.</P>
    <P>The report of the committee concerned with the outflow of works of art was published in 1985.  I do not believe much has happened on this matter.  Works of art can be exported in crates very easily and many of them are from private collections. What efforts have we made on the issue of taking works of art in lieu of taxes as other countries do?  This could be of importance.  Worse still, if works of art are exported and subsequently returned the problem regarding VAT payments on valuable pieces, such as furniture and paintings, being brought back into the country arises.  All of these matters are important and I hope that the Minister will apply his mind further to protecting our heritage.</P>
    <P>The centenary celebrations of the independence of this State will take place in 25 years' time.  There are pieces of sculpture from our recent colonial past, some of which were blown up.  Approximately a year ago a woman asked me why we had no equestrian statues in this city.  I recollected that there was General Gough in Phoenix Park.  Whatever about General Gough, the horse was Irish.  I do know how badly the statue was damaged. If the Office of Public Works is in charge of these works, is there any possibility of repairing them and has this been considered? These were important pieces of our past.  Did Ireland ever get a statute of Queen Victoria?  I understood that a statue was sent out to everyone when she was 50 years on the throne.  I do want to suggest that these will be tourist attractions because I do not wish to sound as if I am denigrating Queen Victoria, which I am not.  However, these were parts of our past which might be important when <Col N="1313" /> we celebrate the centenary of our independence in 25 years' time.  One is no longer supposed to say whether one was on the winning or the losing side but they are part of our past and matters came to a successful conclusion as far as we are concerned.  I hope care is being given to areas which are not now considered important but may play an important role in the future.</P>
    <P>There is no suggestion that we take down the wonderful paintings in Kilmainham of the various lord lieutenants and of King Charles.  I was in Dublin Castle last night and one could not but be incredibly proud of it and the way it has been restored.  Marvellous efforts have been made in recent years to restore important parts of our past and our improved attitude to them is to be commended.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill is but a start.  I trust the Minister will continue his efforts because he is in an important position at an important time.  I warmly welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCashin" hpid="Mr. Cashin Mr. Cashin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cashin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and I support this Bill.  I am glad of the opportunity to speak about this important legislation.  The Bill will go a long way towards protecting this country's unique national heritage, ensuring the people of Ireland have the right to own their heritage; and preventing pirates and mercenaries from stealing and profiteering from our national treasures and works of art which, by definition, belong to everyone.</P>
      <P>This Bill stresses that all archaeological finds with no known owner found after the enactment of this Bill will be retained by the State.  When the Bill becomes law we hope we will never again see court cases concerning the ownership of national treasures.  We remember the case contesting the ownership of the Derrynaflan chalice.  The Bill should prevent the recurrence of such an incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Individuals who find such items will be subject to the full rigours of the law.  The legislation also covers individuals who possess, sell or acquire unreported archaeological objects found since 1930. <Col N="1314" /> Our heritage is vitally important.  Our museums and galleries are the rightful home of national treasures.  Mercenary auction houses measure heritage in monetary rather than cultural terms.</P>
    <P>My home town has on display a full set of cooper's tools which belonged to my grandfather.  They are a source of considerable interest as there is no brewery in the vicinity.  I am pleased my family donated the tools.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 4 (6) creating the offences of withholding information, failure to give names and addresses to a garda on request and obstruction of official inquiries.  On some building sites, particularly those in cities, artefacts have been found.  Because the contractors did not want to cause delay these finds were never reported and were covered over. One individual retrieved well preserved spear heads from a site.  I suggest to the Minister that an official from Office of Public Works could visit unrecorded sites at excavation times.  Perhaps compensation could be given to contractors who suffer delays when a site is unearthed.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the seizure and forfeiture of unauthorised detection devices and diving equipment found on national monument sites.  Such monuments and the heritage therein are sacred and deserve full protection from people who are no better than predators.  This element of the legislation will protect national monuments on land and sea and a garda may, without a warrant, seize a detection device from the site or diving equipment if he or she believes it may have been or is about to be used underwater. This Bill will send the correct signal to individuals who think they have the right to use detection devices to ferret around national monument sites, causing untold destruction.  As a country which prides itself on its history, culture and heritage, we must match that pride with protection.</P>
    <P>In the Duhallow area of County Cork, there are many stone alignments, ring forts and castles.  In my town, Kanturk, we have Kanturk Castle, known as &ldquo;The Old Court&rdquo;.  It is 400 years old and one of the finest examples of a castle built by <Col N="1315" /> an Irish chieftain.  We in Kanturk hope to develop the castle and display it to the nation and the world to show how our ancestors lived 400 years ago.  In the nearby village of Tullylease there is a monastic settlement dating back to 600 A.D.  This is dedicated to St. Brechert and the site also yielded some pre-Christian gravestones, one of which is on display in the National Museum.</P>
    <P>I would welcome new legislation on occupier's liability so farmers would be no longer liable when people go through their land to visit national monuments. This would open land for walks, fishing, shooting, etc. and would be of great benefit to the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>I do not support the destruction of ring forts by young farmers.  Given the introduction of the set aside scheme this should no longer be the practise.  Penalties should apply to such behaviour.  In olden days ring forts were sacred and the fathers and grandfathers of these farmers would not touch them.  It was said many forts were used as burial places for unbaptised children.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's work to recover the Spanish Armada ships around our coastline and his seeking financial aid from Brussels to do so.  He is including the Spanish and Greeks in this effort and he hopes to recover and display any Viking boats located.  He will take solace from the recovery and display of the <i>Mary Rose</i> in Southampton.  That has raised considerable interest.  Some 10 to 12 years ago in the Moville-Corduff area of north Donegal, the Derry sub-aqua club accidentally discovered an Armada ship.  Two of the artefacts brought up from that vessel were bronze cannons, weighing approximately 2.5 tonnes.  At that time, there was no national body interested in assisting these people in the recovery of artefacts.  I congratulate and applaud the Minister for having the imagination and initiative to do so.  I wish him well and support him fully on this matter.</P>

      <P>Our country can make enormous strides in the development of <Col N="1316" /> our culture and archaeology.  There is a huge awareness across Europe of our common background and the Celtic factor is now of major interest.  Last year, I visited Switzerland and a museum in Neuchatel where there had been a celtic settlement.  We saw some of the artefacts of the settlement recovered from the lake, including what seemed to me to be a hurley.  I asked the guide what it was and he told me that he thought it was used for stirring food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>They know as much about hurling there as they do in Longford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a hurley, which is evidence of the spread of Celtic culture across Europe.  Scotland also has a variation of hurling called shinty.  That evening, we met the professor at the museum.  Fortunately, we had a book showing places and scenes in Ireland. There was a photograph of a juvenile hurling team in the book and we were able to show him what a hurley looked like.  He was overjoyed when he discovered its usage.</P>
      <P>I give that as an example to show the huge connection we have with Europe.  I am sure the Minister knows of the interest that Celtic studies and influences have generated in Europe in latter years and we are part of that.  Any areas relating to that era should be preserved and protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preservation works at old cemeteries have increased in recent years.  Local authorities have responsibility for the upkeep of cemeteries but they do not have the funding to keep it going.  In many parishes and communities, people set up a committee to organise FÁS scheme and great work has been done. There are ruins of churches located in many of those cemeteries.  Sometimes there is a clash between the Office of Public Works and the local committee because they have to get a certificate from the Office of Public Works to carry out the schemes and this can cost in some instances, a few hundred pounds.  I see the Leas-Chathaoirleach nodding his <Col N="1317" /> head in agreement with this statement.  I have no doubt he has experienced this himself.  Local communities are organising schemes to clean up local cemeteries and keep them in good condition and are suddenly faced with this obstacle from another State body.  If the Office of Public Works is serious about preserving our past, they should not interfere with these committees.  Although they have the right to do that, there should be more co-operation, effort, understanding and more encouragement given to those local committees, who are doing excellent work in maintaining these cemeteries.</P>
    <P>This area has vast tourism potential. Tourists come here from all parts of the world trying to trace their ancestors, sometimes back to three or four generations. If they can go to a local cemetery which has been well kept, cleaned up and presentable, they may be lucky enough to find a headstone with their ancestors name on it.  This area probably does not make the headlines as far as tourism is concerned, but it is still important.  Both the local people and the State Departments are coming together to offer tourists and those interested in their ancestry the opportunity to trace them.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise how important it is for the Office of Public Works to encourage those local committees.  The Office of Public Works also has a role to play because we are all aware of certain objects being stolen from churches and old buildings across the country.  This, of course, is discouraging.  This Bill is making an effort to bring about an awareness of the State's interest in this area.  I wish the Minister well in his work.  There is a large area to be covered and brought up to date and the Minister deserves every encouragement and support in his efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time when people are crying out for jobs and industrial development, this Bill will not be easy to sell to the general public.  Nevertheless, the preservation of our heritage is important.  Coming from a county that has benefited from schemes such as the <Col N="1318" /> development of Glenveagh National Park, I can say how important it is to preserve our heritage.</P>
      <P>We can do without fanatics in the effort to preserve our heritage.  Perhaps some people would criticise me for saying it but fanatics have made it more difficult to develop the Irish language.  I have noticed this at céilí dances where hardline &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; people have said that something cannot be played because it would encourage others.  The attitude of fanatics is one of the most difficult areas that has to be overcome.  Diplomacy and encouragement are required rather than defying the general public.  Whether one is in planning, development or retaining some of our national treasures, it is important to bring the people with you. That might not be easy in some cases but the advantage of retaining and developing our heritage has to be pointed out.</P>
      <P>I was fortunate to visit Brittany and if anyone in Ireland wanted to see the commercial value of retaining and developing our heritage, they should go to the walled city there.  It was flattened during the war and rebuilt by the French. It is one of the most important and valuable sites in Europe and there is a huge number of people visiting it, even during the off season.</P>
      <P>In County Donegal, the development of the national park at Glenveagh has been an outstanding success, far beyond the wildest dreams of those who undertook that major project in a remote rural part of the county.  It is fantastic.  When people are invited to the county we automatically focus their attention on the importance of Glenveagh.  They leave with delight having seen the value of that development.  It is now a hub of the county and it illustrates the value of developing our heritage to those who would not be over enthusiastic about such work.  It has coloured the thinking of many people who would have said there is no point in heritage preservation in a town if half of it is derelict, although that is a hard argument to dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Daly, when he was Minister for Defence, made an offer to jointly develop and manage another <Col N="1319" /> important heritage site at Fort Dun Ree in County Donegal.  Perhaps through a shortage of funds, my council did not respond quickly enough to the offer, and that was a mistake.  However, I am pleased that McCarther's of Buncrana have purchased the Dun Ree fort and made sure that its preservation in the future will not be prevented.  I compliment them.  I hope the Minister will focus the necessary attention on the development of Fort Dun Ree.  It is fantastic but we have not yet realised the potential for increased tourism in County Donegal through its development.  I record my appreciation to the former Minister of Defence, Senator Daly.</P>
    <P>I encourage the kid glove approach to the development of our heritage.  The biggest difficulty we face is if we do not bring the people with us.  That would be a major mistake because there will be hostility towards these developments.  As I said I visited the walled city in Brittany. Its commercial value has to be seen to be understood.  In my evaluation of heritage, that was an education and I was able to reassess the potential of developing our heritage.  Many people will tell the Minister that his first responsibility is to provide funding for job creation. There are many demands on financial resources and the Minister and the Minister of State will face plenty of opposition when they propose spending money in this area.  However, the Minister should use diplomacy rather than confrontation.</P>
    <P>I have seen the approach of fanatics in the past and it does not work.  I hope the Minister will focus attention on the potential of the development of Fort Dun Ree in County Donegal and that he will continue his efforts.  He is a valuable Minister and he has the support of the vast majority of people.  I hope he will continue this commendable work.  He is putting down an investment for future generations and most people understand the value of what is being done.  We have not yet discovered the full potential of preserving our heritage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with the positive aspects of the Bill, I am always a little wary of Bills which suggest that there are no financial or staffing implications for a Department.  I do not like Bills which have an explanatory memorandum which states this as a positive aspect.  If we are to be positive in this area we must spend money and use staff. I hope the Minister will take into account Senators' comments that there is a huge benefit to the State if we implement the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, 1993, to its maximum.  When it is stated that there are no cost implications to the Exchequer, I hope somebody will look at how this Bill can be implemented without such implications.  Whoever wrote the explanatory and financial memorandum should not insert such positive statements. Perhaps they are implying that we will do nothing because we do not have the staff or the money to spend.  I hope the Minister will look again at producing Bills which state that there are no cost implications.  No Bill does not have such implications.  The Minister should consider this when drafting further Bills.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for bringing forward this Bill which is of great importance. In Ireland we have a range not alone of Celtic history but an amalgam of all the people who have raped, raided and lived on this island over many centuries. Senator McGowan mentioned Glenveagh National Park, one of Ireland's jewel in the crown.</P>
      <P>I visited Glenveagh many times and the surrounding areas, including Glendowan and Church Hill are important.  An American's generosity has allowed Glenveagh Castle to be returned to the State and an artist's generosity has given us a wonderful library and museum in Church Hill.  There is a need for investment given the fact that it took an American to return Glenveagh Castle to the State and an artist from Cornwall to give us a library and museum in Church Hill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must care for our treasures because they are being stolen and taken abroad. Many of artefacts in graveyards and churches are being stolen and they are lost to the State.  Stolen artefacts only benefit <Col N="1321" /> those who take them abroad and keep them in vaults so they can be passed from one generation to the next.  Such artefacts are of no benefit to anyone, except those who steal them.</P>
    <P>We have seen how the rape of a country's artefacts has been detrimental to its tourism potential.  I refer to the rape of Egypt by British and French archaeologists in the 19th century.  They robbed Egypt of its treasures, including Cleopatra's Needle.  When we visit museums in Britain and France, we find artefacts from Tutankhamun's Tomb, the Valley of the Kings or the Valley of the Queens. We must ensure the Long Man from Kilfane in County Kilkenny or artefacts from any other archaeological site are seen in their natural environment.</P>
    <P>In the past number of years, the Office of Public Works has done a lot of preservation work.  People often say the Office of Public Works takes a long time to do any job but the importance of this work is emphasised by the number of special tours organised to bring foreign tourists to visit the country.  These people do not come to Ireland for the sun or the sea, they come to see our historical and archaeological heritage.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan referred to people who went overboard about the Irish language and he spoke about people jigging at the cross-roads.  The Senator must have heard Mr. John Taylor yesterday when said that was part of our heritage, not his.  Jigging at the cross roads is a thing of the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Office of Public Works on the mapping job which has been started.  These aerial maps have shown a number of important mottes and moats around the country.  A number of years ago a motte in County Kilkenny was under threat.  The landowner said it was only an old hill beside the river and that a number of years ago when the river was drained, this lump of mud was thrown up.  The court case went <Col N="1322" /> on for some time.  Such mottes are important.</P>
      <P>We are fortunate to have bogs.  Bogs provide excellent conditions for preservation and many artefacts have been preserved in our bogs for thousands of years.  Such artefacts would have been lost had they been located elsewhere. Bogs should be preserved.  A heat mapping system should be used to discover artefacts.  A French company takes aerial photographs in an attempt to identify objects a number of feet under the ground by the heat they emit.</P>
      <P>Local communities must care for things in their area.  In addition to our Celtic heritage, we must look after look after our Norman heritage.  We, in County Kilkenny, take pride in our AngloNorman heritage as well as our Celtic heritage.  A recent find in south Kilkenny, near Hugginstown, suggests this will be as important a site as those discovered in the midlands and in County Meath.</P>
      <P>Artefacts are often found by chance. Although there is a ban on the use of metal detectors, some adjustment should be made to the law in this regard.  People should be able to get licenses to use metal detectors and if there is a find, it should be assessed before digging takes place. Were it not for Mr. Michael Webb, we would not have the magnificent gold chalice which he found with a metal detector.</P>
      <P>If my house was built today, the builder would use a digger.  However, when my house was built, the builder used hand tools to dig the surrounds and in doing so, he found a holy water font, an altar stone and a dedication stone dating from 1780.  I know 1780 is not very long ago, but these items would not have been found if hand tools had not been used. The forgotten ruins of an old church were discovered in my parish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had to argue with the Minister for Finance to get sufficient money to do the job which this important Bill attempts to do.  Somebody raised a question about the Church Act, 1869, which states that if a religious ceremony takes place on a religious site the Office of Public Works cannot spent money on it.  I mention that because it may have implications for a <Col N="1323" /> former Member of this House, now a Member of the other House, whose marriage took place on one of these sites. Does that mean no money can be spent on the Rock of Cashel?  A marriage took place recently in Kells Priory, County Kilkenny.  I hope that Act can be changed to ensure that, if a marriage takes place on such a site, the Office of Public Works can continue to spend money on it.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on this Bill. Treasure trove is a concept, rather than anything else.  Some people believe a ploughshare made in 1900 is of equal value to one made in 1800.  Unfortunately, agricultural implements used up to the 1940s and 1950s are being lost. They are exported without any licence. They are being used in agricultural museums abroad and while it is wonderful to see a 1890 Pierce plough in a Belgian museum it should be in an Irish farm museum.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a major piece of legislation for the future.  I ask the Minister to use all his powers to get local communities involved in mapping or recording things which may be of importance in the future. A tower house in Kilkenny is as important as the monuments at Knowth or Tara. The preservation of a mid-16th century merchant's house is just as important as the preservation of natural artef acts.  I compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill.</P>

      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí go léir a labhair sa díospóireacht as ucht an sprid iontach a léirigh siad agus an fháilte lách a chuireadar roimh an mBille.  I am most grateful for the very supportive comments made by all Senators who contributed on the Bill.  I find it most encouraging that there is not only a consensus but an enthusiasm for the kind of measures which are necessary to secure and develop our heritage.  I particularly welcome Senator Enright's 100 per cent support for the principle of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1324" /> I also wish to be associated with Senator Enright's praise, and that of a number of other Senators, for the work being done quietly throughout the country on the preservation of our national monuments by Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí, the Office of Public Works.  I should also refer to the work being done by the director and staff of the National Museum of Ireland, for which Senator Daly was fulsome in his praise, as were others with whom I entirely agree.  I accept the contention of Senators Norris, Honan and others that the museum has been grossly under resourced on the financial and staffing fronts for far too long. As the first Minister with the broadest remit in arts, culture and the Gaeltacht, and with responsibility for heritage, broadcasting, waterways and such matters, I appreciate the House is strongly in agreement that not only the agencies but the Department should be adequately staffed to enable us to operate expeditiously and efficiently.  I appreciate Senators' support in that regard and hope to address the particular issues in the National Museum before too long.  I hope also that we will be able to strengthen the resources of the National Museum so that the institution will be able to continue its vital work of collecting and conserving artefacts that come within the scope of National Monuments legislation and to display for the enjoyment of all the people of Ireland, and those who visit our shores, far more than is possible at present.  My approach towards the museum will be to try to make it institutionally relevant to the end of this century and the beginning of the new one. In other words, the structures that were there in one century are not the ones that we need now, as we have an increased awareness and consciousness of the importance of what we are doing.  We must look at the questions of location and staffing to do the job properly.</P>
    <P>I note the many issues raised by Senator Ormonde on the detail of the Bill and I look forward to discussing these on Committee Stage.  Senator Ormonde is correct in her assumption that there was a conscious decision to limit the <Col N="1325" /> scope of the Bill before the House mainly to secure the State's right of ownership of archaeological objects found in the State with no known owner, to enable the early investigation by the proper authorities of the physical context in which such objects are found and to make some improvements in the legislation in regard to monuments.  This was basic and had to be done in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde was disappointed to find nothing in the Bill relating to a planning authority's role in the preservation of amenities, and made some suggestions for co-ordination and co-operation between the Commissioners of Public Works and the planning authorities.  I have to say that legislation relating to the role of planning authorities is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, and it would be inappropriate to make such provisions in this Bill.  However, I do not want to leave it at that.  I take her point, and that of other Senators, that there is a need to look at the two codes of legislation &mdash; the National Monuments Acts on the one hand and the planning Acts on the other &mdash; to see if possible areas of conflict or ambiguity between them can be eliminated. It is my intention to examine this matter.</P>
    <P>I have been asked many times about the Heritage Council.  I have proposals before the Government in relation to putting the Heritage Council on a statutory basis, at which point it will be able to valuably address the question of this intersection between the two codes of law.  These issues, however, require detailed investigation and discussion and I will come back to them in further legislation during the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>I note the comments of Senators Enright, Ormonde and Norris on Wood Quay and the state of our Georgian and other architectural heritage but these issues are obviously outside the scope of the present Bill.  I will, however, address the Senators' concerns in my forthcoming legislation on the Heritage Council, the formulation of which, as I have said, is quite advanced, and in the other proposed <Col N="1326" /> legislation to which I have already referred.  I must stress to the House that the present Bill is really only concerned with two matters: one, to give a statutory basis to the State's claim to ownership of objects of archaeological interest of national importance which are discovered with no known owner, as suggested to the Oireachtas in the Supreme Court judgment in the Derrynaflan hoard case; and two, to amend certain provisions of the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1987, by extending the protection given to monuments and historic sites under these Acts.  This basic framework is required to start with and more legislation can be added later.</P>
    <P>With reference to the definition of &ldquo;treasure trove&rdquo;, which Senator Ormonde and others commented on, I agree that this is a very difficult issue. However, as a result of the Supreme Court decision in the Webb <i>v</i>.  Ireland case there is no need for a separate definition of the term.  Any object coming within the new definition of &ldquo;archaeological object&rdquo;&mdash; whether it constitutes treasure trove or not &mdash; will be protected by the provisions of the Bill before the House.  Senator Ormonde also referred to the question of rewards for the finders of archaeological objects.  I must say that I do not see the question of reward as being based on the possible value of the item found because that would impute an amorality to the finder.  Often, the information regarding the find will be as valuable or more valuable than the object itself.  I should stress that the Bill does not envisage a situation where a reward would be negotiated with the finder with a view to enticing her or him to surrender the object in question.  This would be tantamount to paying a ransom for objects of our own heritage.  Such objects are the property of the people of the State &mdash; no more, no less &mdash; and in my view rewards should be related to responsible citizenship rather than the possible commercial value of the find.  My approach to rewards is to recognise and pay for responsibility rather than talking about the commercial value of something that is the property of us all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1327" /> Senator Ormonde referred to the concept of a fallow area.  This expression comes from the judgment in the Carrowmore, County Sligo, case where the court found that the legislation protects not only a national monument itself but also some lands around it.  The concept has been in legislation since the enactment of the National Monuments Act, 1930 which defined a national monument as:</P>
    <P>including, in addition to the monument itself, the site of the monument and the means of access thereto and also such portion of land adjoining such site as may be required to fence, cover in, or otherwise preserve the amenities thereof.</P>
    <P>With reference to Senator Norris's concerns regarding the recording of monuments and sites where it is believed such monuments are located as provided for under section 12 of the Bill, over the past two decades funding has been provided for an exhaustive national record detailing places where monuments are, or are believed to be, located. Senator Daly, in a thoughtful and most constructive speech, made reference to this very point.  This record has been compiled on survey maps by the Office of Public Works.  The maps are structured on a county by county basis.  The nationwide survey was completed in 1992 and the detailed maps have been distributed to all local planning authorities and are already open for inspection by those wishing to know where monuments are or might be located.  These maps are known as sites and monuments records or SMRs to those who use them.  They are a most important educational resource and will encourage people to become knowledgeable about monuments. There are about 150,000 monuments already recorded.  Accordingly, the basic work in compiling the list of monuments, etc. under section 12 is already completed and the section gives a statutory backing to these records.  The lists and maps will be widely available for inspection in each county in places such <Col N="1328" /> as Garda stations and local authority buildings so that it will be a relatively simple matter for any conscientious person to discover whether there are any such sites on her or his property.  I encourage Senators to bring this to the attention of the public and those who may benefit from such knowledge.  Section 12 will, therefore, be a useful first line of defence against the destruction of important sites, which can occur innocently through simple ignorance or, unfortunately, deliberately on some occasions where people have a concept of time and personal benefit which casts all considerations of heritage and public responsibility aside.</P>
    <P>The vast number of monuments already recorded brings me to another of Senator Norris's points regarding the physical difficulty of protecting these treasures. I agree with the concept of a heritage neighbourhood watch type approach.  The idea expressed by Senators Norris and Kelly of children in local schools carrying out a regular audit of such places is an entrancing concept and I will certainly think further about this matter and speak to my colleague, the Minister for Education.  I know some teachers already have initiated such projects in their own area but there may be room for a more structured approach. This would be a pleasant and good way of handing on knowledge of heritage to the next generation.  This reflects points made by other Senators about the definition of cultural tourism.  The dignified relationship which I hope will prevail in future between the visited and the visitor is enhanced if those who are visited are in possession of the story of their own heritage and can speak with confidence, concern and love about their own people and place.</P>
    <P>There may also be ways of harnessing the energy of the many local historical societies in this area beyond the formal educational setting.  Local authorities have a large role to play here.  In addition, it is the policy of the Office of Public Works, where a monument is on private property, to come to an amicable agreement with the landowner over the maintenance <Col N="1329" /> of the site.  Senator McGowan asked me to use as much diplomacy as possible.  This personal involvement has paid rich dividends in the past and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>This is relevant also in relation to the question of compulsory purchase, which is addressed in section 11 of the Bill. Section 11 merely updates provisions under existing national monuments legislation. Such powers are used only as a last resort.  They are important to have but are not used arbitrarily and this policy will continue.  However, I am sure Senators will agree that a compulsory purchase order is absolutely essential even if it is rarely used.</P>
    <P>I share the sadness expressed by Senator Farrell and others at the lack of appreciation of monuments and buildings by some people but I think such people are declining in number.  However, this has been a fact of life throughout history. It is not a relatively new development nor is it confined to Ireland.  Unfortunately, so long as there are people in the world whose personal enjoyment is derived solely from the private possession of archaeological objects, there will be those who are prepared to satisfy this demand illegally.  I listened with great care and sympathy to what Senator Lanigan said in this regard.  The idea that one's relationship with something which is the story of many people should be looked at in a vault or in private circumstances is offensive.  I am confident the Bill will strengthen our hand in this area and that, by the penalty provisions which are proposed, illegal activities will be curtailed.  With regard to the removal of objects from particular sites, while there is no reason for complacency, I am informed that the scale of this problem has been reduced in recent years due mainly to the wonderful work of the staff of the National Museum and the activities of the Garda Síochána.  The provisions of the Bill will make life that much more difficult for those who seek to steal our national heritage.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I see one of my principal roles in formulating legislation in this area as raising the consciousness <Col N="1330" /> of everyone of the beauty of our national heritage and the awareness of everybody of their responsibility to protect it for present and future generations.  We inherit it and hand it on.  All Senators who spoke stressed the value of our heritage to the economy, particularly its potential to attract tourists.  I know they are also personally interested in our heritage and I have spoken about this already.  While the job creating potential is of course vital, we must get to a stage where the physical expressions of our heritage and culture are regarded at local, regional and national level as being of prime importance in their own right, not merely to be preserved for purely commercial reasons or to take a lower place in our list of national priorities to be dealt with after all the potholes are filled.  It is only then we will be able to say that we are beginning to recognise their true value.  I regard it as one of my key responsibilities as Minister for the Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and of my new Department to ensure that for the future the language surrounding our heritage and culture is fully understood and accepted and takes its rightful place in all our debates relating to economic activities.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for our heritage will not be undertaken only after other considerations have been fulfilled.  It will be a central concern to be satisfied like any other concern in relation to changes we are making to something that is not ours. Between now and Committee Stage I will look at some of the detailed points which have been made.  Senator Daly spoke about the balance between the roles of the Office of Public Works and a Heritage Council with increased powers.  It is necessary to put the Heritage Council on a statutory basis and give it an effective remit.  I will deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission has reported on the issues of ownership and owners' rights.  I think this report was due on 3 or 4 December and is probably now available.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, and I have discussed these issues because they are very important and must be balanced.  In <Col N="1331" /> relation to the National Museum's policy and strategy, I accept what has been said about regionalisation.  We must have a balanced and practical approach.  We want to ensure standards of excellence centrally and avoid excessive centralisation but we cannot send valuable objects to places where they cannot be conserved or made safe.  There are all sorts of strategies available for regionalisation and I will certainly look at them.</P>
    <P>I like to share with the House the information I have in relation to this ongoing debate because the more people who are involved the better.  In Belfast last week I met the minister with responsibility for the arts in Northern Ireland, Michael Ancram, MP.  We discussed conservation and recognised it as a problem affecting all of Ireland.  We agreed it would be wasteful of resources for each museum on this island to attempt to provide comprehensive facilities and that there could be merit in major conservation activities being concentrated in a few locations which could service the needs of all the cultural institutions on this island.  We agreed that a directors forum, comprising the directors of cultural institutions, North and South, would be established to study the conservation needs of the whole island and submit proposals to us for consideration.  We also agreed such a forum would facilitate even greater co-operation between the cultural institutions, North and South, than exists at present.  We look forward to strengthening co-operation, which is exemplary.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the Discovery programme.  When I launched the programme's reports the other evening, I referred to one of my predecessors with responsibility for the arts, the former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles J. Haughey.  It was an inspiration by him to establish this programme.  My immediate predecessor with responsibility for the arts, the present Taoiseach, continued the programme. This programme is one of the issues on which I have been asked to make representations to Ministers for culture in Europe to get them to establish <Col N="1332" /> a similar type of programme.  It is a fine example of integrated research interfacing with the public.</P>
    <P>I also thank Senator Henry and I note her point about the balance which is necessary between visitors to and the scale of interpretative centres.  I share her concern.  It is important that we satisfy the needs of those who have a right to know but, at the same time, respect the shape and context in which that knowledge is delivered.  The Senator is right about Castletown.  I have taken a personal interest in this and I hope to be able to bring matters to fruition quickly. I also note her point about books and the movement of objects.  I see this as a question of balancing private property rights and public ownership in terms of our Constitution.  This is a European problem and there are movements between countries in Europe.  I will examine the national legal requirements but it is also important that we address it at a European level.</P>
    <P>I agree with the point made by Senator Cashin.  When we talk about heritage symbols which dominated often come to mind.  The tools of people who worked with their hands, such as coopers, are an important part of our story.  This is the neglected story and I support what he is doing.  All I have done so far in relation to underwater archaeology is to take some initial proposals for co-operation between Greece, Spain and Ireland in developing skills which will enable us to do survey work and good mapping in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Belton spoke about the Celtic movements in Europe.  He spoke of the importance of there being a good relationship between the Office of Public Works and local communities, which I support.  Senator McGowan spoke of the desirability of keeping negotiations as far as possible on a voluntary basis; gentle relationships are needed.  I hope, when staffing allows, to implement his point about having people look at undeveloped resources in the heritage area in counties such as Donegal in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan suggested that this Bill must have staffing and cost implications. <Col N="1333" /> He will know that in the rhetoric which surrounds the delivery of such Bills and in their gestation period, not to speak of their delivery from Cabinet, one has to look at the resources one has.  I am satisfied that the measures being taken in this legislation will enable the existing staff to do their job more efficiently and effectively.  The explanatory memorandum makes this point clear, but may I assure the House that should I find that I cannot operate the Bill in the spirit in which it is drafted, I will have no hesitation in approaching my colleague, the Minister for Finance, for the necessary resources to implement the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan's point about Egypt is close to my heart.  The same is true of what happened in Central and Latin America at the time of the relationship with Spain.  It is a delicate business.  Colonial and imperialist movements have not only visited contemporary consequences on those who have been colonised or dominated, but have also stolen the story of these peoples and brought it back to the metropolitan centre.</P>
    <P>Because we are creatures of the present, informed by the past but looking towards the future, it is a matter for new thinking as we now learn that we must negotiate the sensitivities which are involved.  For example, we have excellent co-operation with the British Museum and the Ulster Museum and are frequently indebted to them.  These are matters for the future when we decide on the best location of an object in terms of those who want to have its story.</P>
    <P>A specific point was made in relation to weddings which took place in places which require a licence from the Office of Public Works in addition to the usual papers.  The Office of Public Works can give licences for ceremonies to take place in places where they would propose to continue working.  However, it is an interesting point because it is affected not only by the legislation of the 1860s referred to, but also by a complicated, complex agreement between the Church and State at the time.  I intend between now and Committee Stage to have another look at this and I will probably indicate <Col N="1334" /> if changes are appropriate at that time.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan made reference to elements of our folk heritage which have been lost.  I would like to place on record the magnificence of the folk life collection in the National Museum.  As part of my development of a comprehensive museums policy, I will address the question of finding a suitable location to display this aspect of our heritage as a matter of urgency.  I am grateful to the Senators who spoke, not only for what they said but for the spirit in which they said it.  I look forward to co-operating with them in making the necessary changes in the years to come.</P>

    <Title>Farm Retirement Scheme: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity of addressing the Seanad on the farm retirement scheme.  As Senators probably know, the proposals in this scheme have been approved by the EU Committee for Structural and Rural Development.  However, before it can be operated the EU Commission must give its formal approval.  I expect this will be forthcoming shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme involves the following: pension payments of up to close on £9,000 per year at current rates for a farm of 24 hectares or more for a maximum of ten years but not beyond the retired farmer's 70th birthday; payment of a pension to farmers between 55 and 66 years <Col N="1335" /> who have practised farming as a main occupation for the preceding ten years, who retire from farming for good and transfer their farms by gift, lease or sale to farmers who expand their holdings. Farmers who retired from farming on or after 30 July 1992 and who met the qualifying age limits will be eligible for the scheme; a minimum size of holding of five hectares, which is 12.35 acres, must be transferred to a transferee who must enlarge his or her holding by at least five hectares or 10 per cent of the transferor's holding, whichever is the greater; an upper age limit of 50 years for a farming transferee who should have an agricultural qualification or be otherwise suitably qualified.  In certain circumstances transfer of land can also be to non-farmers or the transferor can reassign the land for non-agricultural uses, for example, forestry; payment of the pension where a farm being released has been managed jointly and where a member of the partnership meeting the age or other criteria is not the owner; payment of the pension to the spouse and/or dependants on the death of the pensioner, subject to certain income limits; and there is also a pension scheme for workers &mdash; or family helpers &mdash; between 55 and 65 years, under certain conditions, who lose their employment as a result of the farmer's early retirement. The rate of pension is £2,196 per year up to 65 years of age subject to a maximum of two workers per holding.</P>
    <P>There are some aspects of the scheme which I wish to address further.  It is a voluntary scheme which no one is being forced to take up.  Each applicant as a transferor will have to ensure that he can comply with the conditions of the scheme.  My Department will help by providing information and guidelines on how to complete the application.  Applicants will also be free to consult other agencies such as Teagasc, solicitors and accountants; the choice is theirs.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the enlargement provision and perhaps I should elaborate on this because it is one of the main objectives of the scheme.  The <Col N="1336" /> priority is to have land transferred to younger farmers to increase their viability.  Where a person succeeds the transferor as head of the holding and has no land in his or her own right either owned or leased at the time of the transfer then he or she must expand the transferor's holding by five hectares or 10 per cent, whichever is the greater.  It is important to remember that this expansion must be in terms of the utilisable agricultural area of the holding.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, a transferee has a minimum of five hectares of land in his own right which was not transferred to him after 30 July 1992 &mdash; the date on which the regulation came into force &mdash; he can take over all the released land or five hectares or 10 per cent of the utilisable agricultural area of the released land, whichever is the greater.  Splitting of farms after 30 July 1992 to provide land for the proposed transferees to overcome this enlargement provision will not be allowed.  In other words, a father could not now give a son five hectares and then transfer the balance of the farm to qualify for a pension because no overall expansion would have taken place.</P>
    <P>Where the proposed transferee has no land to start with he may have a problem obtaining land to meet the enlargement requirement; however, since the leasing of land is allowed this, I hope, will help overcome that problem.  The scheme offers an attractive pension and not all applicants will have transferees in place so the land released in this way should be generally available to those aspiring transferees who are seeking land to expand.  The enlargement provisions apply to farming transferees.  However, if such cannot be found, the transferor has the option of transferring to a non-farming transferee who will use the land for non-farming purposes.  A further option is to retain the land, again for non-farming purposes.</P>
    <P>Another point which should be emphasised is that farmers who are between 55 and 66 years and who cease farming after 30 July 1992 can still avail of the scheme provided they have stopped farming and transferred their land before they reach <Col N="1337" /> 66.  In the case of farmers who are over this age, if they have a spouse or someone else who is involved in the joint management of the holding, that person can qualify for the pension provided they meet the conditions of the scheme as outlined earlier.</P>
    <P>I hope that the scheme will be formally approved by the EU Commission before Christmas.  This would enable it to become operational in the New Year. There are still some matters to be clarified in relation to the interpretation of the conditions of the scheme but this should not unduly delay implementation. This scheme, in my view, offers a good incentive to older farmers to pass on land to a younger generation of farmers and will help redress the main structural problems in farming in Ireland, namely, farm size and the age profile of farmers.  I believe it will prove of considerable help in improving farming structures and helping younger progressive farmers to expand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very disappointed with the statements being made today. We hoped we would at least have had agreement from Brussels and a detailed analysis of the scheme.  It is blatantly obvious that, in the absence of this approval and the details, the statements will be very restricted.  Unfortunately, this is clear from the Minister's statement. I do not blame the Minister of State for that because I am aware that this is being handled by the Minister, Deputy Walsh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The announcement of the farm retirement scheme has been promised on many occasions but it is still being delayed.  The Minister of State said today he hopes to have it in place before Christmas.  I came into this House last February and at that time the Minister said in the Dáil it would be in place by early summer, then we were told it would be made in the late summer.  In September it was said that the announcement would be made in the late autumn.  Today we hear that it will be made before Christmas.  The Minister has played the same trick again.  He has announced the scheme every couple of <Col N="1338" /> months.  He says the scheme will come, when and where it will operate and then says he has second thoughts about it and outlines what he expects will be in the scheme.  How long will this go on?  As far as I can see, it will be well into next year before a real announcement is made.  No announcement can be made until there is agreement with the EU and a detailed scheme is presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There are 27,000 people who are eligible for this scheme and they have been waiting patiently for a very long time.</P>
    <P>The proposed scheme, once implemented, will have a positive impact in the restructuring of Irish agriculture. The age profile of Irish farmers must change if a viable agricultural industry is to survive into the next century.  At present over 40 per cent of farmers are over 55 years of age and only 15 per cent of farmers working the land are under 35 years of age.  Those are the figures supplied by the Minister's office.</P>
    <P>The retirement scheme will allow this age structure to change through incentives for older farmers to hand over their lands to their sons or daughters or other relatives.  The previous attempt at a farm retirement scheme was not successful as the incentives were not attractive enough.  The proposed scheme will offer a maximum pension of £9,000 per annum to farmers who retire between the ages of 55 and 66 years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Department of Agriculture's proposal to include the younger spouse as an eligible applicant in cases where the older farmer is over 66 years of age.  There is an enormous level of interest in the scheme.  The administrative procedures in Ireland must be put in place so that when the scheme is formally ratified in Brussels farmers can make immediate applications.  The only available guide to the scheme is the three page document from the Minister's office.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister state in his speech that there was much talk about the scheme's expansion requirements, but he did not explain why this should be so.  Neither of the previous <Col N="1339" /> schemes was successful because there were too many obstacles in the way.  The expansion requirement is another obstacle.  A farmer with 80 or 90 acres of land whose holding is barely viable will need to purchase a minimum of 10 per cent of the area of his land or 5 hectares, that is, 12.5 acres.  In most areas the purchase price of 12.5 acres is in the region of £20,000 or £25,000.  That money will not be easy to acquire.  He may go to a financial institution and show his accounts.  His accounts will clearly state his position and, depending on his milk quota and his level of borrowings, the viability question will immediately come up.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated in a document sent from his Department that the pension will only be paid from the date all the conditions of the scheme for transferor and transferee are met.  This expansion requirement is an enormous obstacle to thousands of farmers who would participate in that scheme and who need it very badly in view of the circumstances prevailing.</P>
    <P>I was tempted to talk about GATT but I will not do so.  I will just say that the present proposals will put thousands of farmers out of business.  The effect will not be seen in the first or second year, but in the third year of the scheme thousands of farmers will be in trouble.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is a farmer who has a reasonably clear understanding of the way things stand and he knows the number of farmers who would wish to participate in that scheme.  The condition whereby the farm must be expanded by 10 per cent will be a very serious obstacle to thousands of farmers, requiring expenditure of, perhaps, £20,000 to £25,000.</P>
    <P>From a reading of the Minister's document of October 1993 is clear that the pension will not be payable until this condition is met.  This is very serious.  I argued in Brussels and in the other House about the obstacles to the previous schemes because I could see clearly that people could not participate.  Because of these obstacles, the schemes failed miserably.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1340" /> The Minister of State said in his speech that the schemes offer an attractive pension. He said that not all applicants will have transferees to place on the land released under the scheme, and that this land should be generally available to aspiring transferees who are seeking land to expand.  It is one thing to say that in a speech, but another to try to put it into practice in thousands of parishes.  Land will not be available for people to purchase in order to qualify for the scheme. I ask that this condition be withdrawn from the pension scheme to allow the maximum number of people to qualify.  I have given the reasons.</P>
    <P>Only 9,000 of our 150,000 farmers own more than 140 acres.  The aim of the scheme should be to maximise the number of people who will qualify under the scheme.  I see the expansion requirement as an obstacle that will without doubt eliminate thousands of farmers from this scheme, which seems otherwise good, although we have not seen the finer details.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a second point which the Minister of State also mentioned in his statement.  The pension will only be paid from the date on which all the conditions of the scheme for transferors and transferees are met.  There is an additional qualification for the scheme. A farmer must have obtained the &ldquo;green certificate&rdquo; or completed at least one year in agricultural college.  I accept that, but if the scheme is to be successful, in many cases the farmer concerned will have to bring his son home, maybe from a job in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It takes two years for a young farmer to qualify on the educational side and he may have to wait, to purchase the additional land required.  This means thousands of farmers will be unable to take advantage of the scheme.  If these two conditions prevail, thousands of farmers will be debarred from the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to reconsider, because the European Union is not in touch with many of these issues.  Those in Brussels do not seem to understand the structure of our farms here.  The figures <Col N="1341" /> are clear.  There are many older farmers now farming the land and many young farmers who want to farm it, but they cannot afford to invest money or to borrow.  I am making it quite plain that those two conditions are very restrictive and damaging and will have a terrible effect on this scheme.  I have no doubt about it.</P>
    <P>A system exists in the Department of Social Welfare whereby once the farmer goes to a solicitor and signs over the farm to his son he is automatically eligible for a contributory old age pension if he has paid PRSI for ten years.  I cannot see this new scheme working unless similar conditions apply.</P>
    <P>If the stipulations I mentioned are left in the scheme, I estimate that 50 per cent of potentially eligible people will be eliminated.  One might ask how I arrived at that figure.  I asked the local branch of the IFA to give me a rough idea of the eligible people in three or four local parishes. I was brought in to speak to them and when I told them about those conditions everybody immediately saw the problems attached to the scheme.</P>
    <P>The first is that the pension will not be payable until all conditions are met and that could take two or three years.  What happens to the unfortunate farmer and his wife who are under 65 years and are not eligible for the non-contributory old age pension?  The farmer's son may have to return from Cork city, Wexford town or Enniscorthy to take over the farm. One family will have no income until these conditions are all met.  It is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>The second problem is this expansion by 12.5 acres.  I have not the slightest doubt that even in the Minister's own county land costs £2,000 per acre and we are, therefore, talking in terms of £25,000.  One would not buy land, unless it is poor quality, for under £2,000 per acre.  The way the financial institutions work is that one's accounts must fit their computer model to prove that the farm is viable and making a good profit so that they can get their full interest &mdash; adding 1.5 or 2 per cent of what they call a cushion to make sure that they get the <Col N="1342" /> payments.  They are the criteria which will be used by every financial institution, including the Agricultural Credit Corporation. If one does not fit those criteria the loan will not be given.  These two restrictions will inhibit qualification.  I estimate that 50 per cent of farmers will not qualify if these two conditions are left in.</P>
    <P>I welcome the scheme.  I believe that giving ageing farmers a reasonable pension between the ages of 55 and 65 is the only way of encouraging them to transfer the land to their sons.  I hope the points I have made will be taken into consideration when the final details are drawn up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the scheme, as should all farmers.  It will encourage farmers of my age and the Minister's age to transfer their farms to their sons.  I understand this scheme was part of CAP reform.  I listened to Senator D'Arcy, whose approach to this scheme seemed negative.  He was also negative on GATT and on CAP.  I see no ill effects in this country from the CAP reform, rather the agricultural community has gained. Although it may be political point scoring, we can always find loopholes in any scheme and it is important that they would be highlighted, especially in regard to this scheme.</P>
      <P>The 12.5 acres being talked about is a small amount.  One must have a farm of a good size to ensure that the person retiring would qualify for the scheme. When it was suggested that we join the EEC many people were sceptical about what would happen rural Ireland.  It was obvious that we would have to adapt to European conditions and we must be realistic about doing so.  The reality is that if we had not joined we would be a lot worse off today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme is part of the CAP reform and under EU regulations we may institute a community aid scheme for early retirement for farmers partly financed by the EU.  I am glad to see that workers are included in this scheme because some workers might find themselves out of a job before they reach <Col N="1343" /> pension age and would have to go on the dole or get some other benefit.  I would also like to acknowledge the practicability of young farmers taking over land at an earlier age.  It is important that farmers do an agricultural course and qualify for the &ldquo;green certificate&rdquo; as it is called.  They deserve to implement whatever they have learned as early as possible. This is a scheme that will help them to get into business and own farms, and it will give them the responsibility for which they are educated.  Agriculture is one of our main industries and it will remain so despite the efforts to industrialise.</P>
    <P>I am glad it is an essential qualification for people to do a course before they can take over the farm and allow those retiring to qualify for a pension.  Heretofore, before a farmer could transfer his holding he had to wait until he was 66 years old to qualify for a pension.  Otherwise he would be putting a burden on his son to support him and his wife until they reached pension age.  That pension was not half as good as that he will get through this farm retirement scheme.  A pension of £9,000 is a lot of money for any man retiring.  I am sure that it will be index linked over time and it will be welcomed by farmers, especially where there is a good relationship between father and son.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that in certain circumstances transfer of land can also be to non-farmers or the transferor can reassign the land for non-agricultural uses, for example forestry.  This puzzles me slightly.  I would not like to see speculators qualify in this regard.  I would like the Minister to indicate who the &ldquo;non-farmers&rdquo; might be so that if a transfer of land took place it would not be for speculative purposes.</P>
    <P>The farm must be expanded by five hectares or 10 per cent, whichever is the greater.  That puzzles me.  It was referred to as 12.5 acres.  I am not a mathematician; I am more used to acres.  I still live in Ireland, not in Europe.  Perhaps the Minister would explain that.</P>
    <P>Senator D'Arcy also said that the scheme offers an attractive pension and, <Col N="1344" /> as not all applicants will have transferees in place, the land released in this way should be made available to those transferees who are seeking land to expand. He mentioned that there were 27,000 people who would qualify for this.  I believe, although I am open to correction, that the Senator is exaggerating when he uses that figure.  It would not be realistic.  He may be quoting figures from the IFA.  The IFA held a meeting in Buswell's Hotel last Sunday night which, I heard, was like a mini Fine Gael Árd Fheis.  There were standing ovations for former Ministers, so I would not take any notice of what the IFA&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is a great scheme which will encourage older farmers to retire earlier and younger farmers to take a greater interest.  It is very important, now that we are members of the EU, to have a scheme to encourage young farmers to become more responsible for agriculture, our main industry.  I wish the Minister luck with the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate. I raised this matter in the House three weeks ago and the Minister for Agriculture responded on that occasion.</P>
      <P>The points raised by Senator D'Arcy are valid.  Many farmers, because of one regulation or another, will be prevented from participating in the scheme.  I welcome the principle of the scheme which is excellent.  However, as I said three weeks ago, there are certain logjams in the scheme which must be cleared before it is approved by the Commission.  I understood the scheme would be cleared by now because the Minister's press release of late October indicated that it would be approved within the following four weeks.  Four weeks have passed and it has not been passed by the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1345" /> I raised the anomalies in the scheme because it would be a tragedy if it fell into the same trap as the 1973 retirement scheme which did not succeed.  A number of other schemes &mdash; for example, the calf to beef scheme &mdash; introduced from Brussels did not work either because the guidelines did not suit Irish farming.</P>
    <P>One of the major difficulties with this scheme is the requirement for additional land.  There is a practice in this country of land being let on the 11-month system. The principle of land leasing has not been accepted and that is a stumbling block for the scheme.  Unless the Government and the Commission do something to encourage leasing rather than letting, the scheme will fail.  Many young farmers will not be able to get the additional land required under the conditions of the scheme.  The requirement is a minimum of 5 hectares or 10 per cent of the holding, whichever is greater.  In many cases people would be unable to buy or lease the additional land, particularly young farmers taking over a viable holding. There is a contradiction in that a young farmer can take over a viable holding but will have to get additional land before his parents can qualify for the scheme.  That roadblock should be removed.  If a holding is viable there should be no need for additional land.  I believe many farmers will be prevented from participating in the scheme because of that requirement.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty is the requirement that farming be the farmer's main occupation for the preceding ten years.  In many parts of this country we have part time farmers.  If this scheme is to be meaningful we should encourage such farmers to hand land over to the younger generation.  All of those who are involved in part-time farming, whether they work with Bord na Móna &mdash; as is the case in the Minister's area and in mine &mdash; the county council, CIE or other bodies, are prevented from participating in this scheme because of the requirement that they be practising farming as a main occupation for the preceding ten years.  That difficulty, like the additionality requirement, must be removed if the scheme is to be of benefit to rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1346" /> The scheme has much merit provided these difficulties are removed.  Now, before it is approved by the Commission, is the time to remove them.  Once the scheme is approved it will be very difficult to change it.  There is no point in finding out that the scheme is unworkable when it is put into operation.</P>
    <P>There is another major difficulty with the scheme, which was referred to by the Minister, Deputy Walsh.  The difficulty is the question of social welfare.  There is a major conflict involved.  I have discussed this with the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Agriculture and neither Department seems to be able to resolve the conflict that will develop in this scheme.  The Minister told the Seanad he was having discussions on the matter with the Minister for Social Welfare and that it was his aim that any farmer who participated in the retirement scheme would automatically on finishing the scheme become eligible for a contributory pension.  Many people have paid a contribution under the PRSI scheme for perhaps five years.  If they participate in the retirement scheme as it stands now they will lose their eligibility for a contributory pension.  It is vital that this difficulty is quickly resolved.</P>
    <P>I also anticipate a problem with the requirement that the person to whom the land is transferred have an agricultural qualification.  On the one hand, a farmer who takes over land with the intention of farming it must have a qualification in agriculture.  On the other hand, if a businessman buys the land for the purpose of planting it there is no requirement for that qualification.  That is a contradiction.</P>
    <P>That leads us to the question of land policy.  We have stumbled along for the last ten to 15 years without a clear land policy.  It is of vital importance that there are guidelines to identify clearly what land should be planted for forestry and what land should be retained in agriculture. It is criminal that some of the best agricultural land is being planted simply because when it is put up for sale it is bought by those who get big grants from the EU for the purpose of planting. Land, which is not viable for agricultural <Col N="1347" /> production, should have been planted 30, 40 or 50 years ago rather than now.  It is criminal to take good land out of agricultural production and put into forestry because once that happens it is no longer used for agricultural production.</P>
    <P>We are going through a difficult time with 300,000 people unemployed.  If one looks carefully at this scheme, one will see that while the principle should be to get land transferred from the older to the younger generation, instead it is getting people off the land.  This is returning to the Mansholt plan of 15 years ago.  Where will these people go because there are no jobs for them in industry?  People who leave farming must go on the dole.</P>
    <P>I come from a county which, according to the last census, lost 5 per cent of its population, the heaviest loss in any county with the exception of County Leitrim. Each day townlands are stripped of their population; the older generation are dying and there is no one taking over the land; people who should be working the land are emigrating to London, Birmingham, Coventry, New York, etc. They are not working in County Roscommon where one would hope to see them.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the major difficulties with the scheme.  If these restrictions are not removed before the scheme is implemented, it will not have the impact it should have on rural Ireland.  If the difficulties highlighted by Senator D'Arcy and myself on this and previous occasions are removed, it will transform rural Ireland.  For the first time, there would be an opportunity for younger people to get a sizeable amount of land while, at the same time, their parents or the older generation would be financially protected.  The principle of the scheme is a good one if the problems I mentioned are removed.  There is an obligation on the Minister and his officials to ensure that those conditions are changed before this scheme is approved by the EU because this is too great an opportunity to miss.</P>
    <P>When speaking about this scheme one cannot but refer to the other major problems <Col N="1348" /> affecting Irish agriculture, the GATT negotiations.  I am concerned at the stand taken by the Government with regard to these negotiations.  If the GATT agreement is implemented, as the newspapers and the Commission seem to suggest, it would have a devastating effect on Irish agriculture because it would wipe out 50 per cent of the farming community.</P>

      <P>I could not conclude without referring to the major difficulties facing the farming community under GATT.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, and the Minister, Deputy Walsh, if need be, to apply the veto with regard to the negotiations. You, Sir, I am sure, would not like to see a reduction in the number of dry stock or sheep farmers throughout the country, although those in the dairy industry would probably survive.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the restrictions relating to additional land, part-time farmers, qualifications and social welfare <Col N="1349" /> are sorted out before the farm retirement scheme is approved by the EU.  I hope this scheme will help to contribute to the transfer of substantial areas of land to young farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing this scheme at the wrong time.  We should have discussed it a couple of months ago or we should wait until the application forms are issued and the Department has produced a comprehensive booklet on the scheme.  While the Department has been unable to produce a booklet about the scheme because it does not know the full details, the IFA has made one available and is claiming credit for organising the scheme.  It claims the scheme is the end result of months of negotiations between the IFA, the Department and the European Commission.  It is difficult to understand why farmers in County Wexford have not heard about this because the IFA is claiming responsibility for the scheme.  It also claims the scheme will be attractive to many farmers between the ages of 55 and 65.</P>
      <P>We must remember that the EC Farm Retirement Scheme is an accompanying measure under CAP reform which is governed by EC regulation 2079/92.  It has three main objectives.  The first is to encourage older farmers to leave farming by providing them with a pension.  This is a useful measure.  Serious restrictions have been placed in the way of small farmers.  If a small farmer wants to transfer his holding to a son or daughter, he must acquire 12.35 acres from outside the holding being transferred through purchase, lease or gift.  This is impossible for many small farmers who might avail of the scheme.  On the other hand, it will not be a major problem for larger farmers as they will be able to organise themselves efficiently.</P>
      <P>The second main objective of the scheme is to replace retiring farmers with younger farmers on large holdings which have better prospects for economic viability.  However, this could be a dangerous development because large farmers could buy out the small farmers around them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> The third and main provision of the scheme is that if younger farmers are not available it will be possible to redirect agricultural land for non-agricultural use, such as forestry, agri-tourism and, perhaps, set aside, although this has not yet been decided.  It will be possible for the larger farmer to buy out any number of small farmers who want to avail of the scheme and this could be dangerous.</P>
    <P>The scheme should be the accompanying measure of the agreed 1992 CAP because it was an example of a missed opportunity for Irish farmers and it may not arise again.  We must remember that Mr. MacSharry, the EC Commissioner for Agriculture, was in a unique position to influence the outcome in favour of small farmers in this country, who are in the majority.  However, because of unrelenting and consistent pressure from large farmers and vested interests, Mr. MacSharry had to abandon his plan for reform which would help the needy.  His every attempt was thwarted.  I believe that because of a series of unforeseen circumstances in 1993, such as devaluation, the weather and animal diseases in Europe, the full effects of the reformed CAP are not yet felt and the worst has yet to come.</P>
    <P>A large number of small farmers are giving up milk and sheep production to cash in on their quotas and I am advised that at least 40,000 smaller farmers, especially in Leinster, who traditionally buy calves and sell them as stores, and more who buy the stores and fatten them, will be in serious trouble under the revised CAP.  The penny has dropped, and in a big way, with the farming organisations. Some of them may now be sorry they were so opposed to Mr. MacSharry's proposals, and they have resorted to blaming the GATT for what is almost certainly the reformed CAP.</P>
    <P>We often heard of the man who went to confession and told the priest that he stole a rope.  However, he forgot to tell the priest that there was a pig at the end of it.  I believe that when the IFA, especially, and others sold the reformed CAP, they forgot to tell the farmers that one of the accompanying measures was <Col N="1351" /> the early retirement scheme for farmers. Some of the provisions of the scheme are generous but taken in tandem with the 1992 revision of the CAP, I believe it will lead to large scale rural depopulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Rarely has such a good opportunity been presented to any Government as the early retirement scheme for farmers.  It is an opportunity to benefit the people living in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>Given the level of depopulation taking place across the provinces, it is vital that such an important scheme should be fully utilised.  However, regrettably, it creates some problems, especially with regard to the enlargement of holdings, because to qualify a person must already have land in his own name.</P>
      <P>The IFA published a document entitled &ldquo;The IFA Guide to the EC Farm Retirement Scheme&rdquo; which clearly sets out the amount of land a transferee must have before enlarging.  The minimum amount is 10 per cent, or five hectares of the overall holding to be transferred.  The problem with this is that many of the transferees may not have any land in their own name.  At present it is difficult for farmers to obtain land on a lease and in this instance a lease for a minimum period of five years is required.  In view of this, many farmers who own land will be reluctant to lease land to facilitate leasees.</P>
      <P>Many farmers of 55 or 60 years of age, who are anxious to transfer their holdings to their son or daughter will find that, because of the regulation requiring the transferee to have a minimum 10 per cent or five hectares in his name, they will not be eligible unless they can obtain land by lease or by purchase.  This raises a difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this early retirement scheme it is intended that there will be an enlargement of holdings.  This will make farmers more viable.  However, to illustrate the seriousness of the position in rural Ireland, I quote the following figures: in the constituency of Laois-Offaly, represented by the Minister, there is a <Col N="1352" /> decline of 1.8 per cent in the population of County Laois, or 959 people; in County Longford, the Taoiseach's constituency, the decline is 3.8 per cent, or 1,203 people; in County Louth it is 1.2 per cent and in County Offaly it is 2.3 per cent or 1,387 people.  There is a similar decline in County Westmeath.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>With the exception of approximately three areas, every townland in County Offaly has had a decline in population.  They are not all farmers, but the vast majority of people living in these areas are involved in agriculture and the spin off from agriculture.  Farming provides the money which keeps people in these areas.</P>
      <P>The population decline in Connaught is alarming.  In County Sligo there is a decline of 2.3 per cent, or 1,300 people, in County Roscommon there is a decline of 2,716 and in County Mayo the figure is 4,488, or 3.9 per cent.  It is not necessary to give further examples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme is well advanced, but even at this late stage I believe that if the present position continues where a farmer who owns a farm wishes to transfer it to his son or daughter who has been working with him, and has obtained their Green Certificates and undertaken their minimum of 150 hours with the Teagasc courses, the farmer will then qualify for a non-contributory old age pension.  I hope this scheme continues as before. Perhaps the Minister would say if this is <Col N="1353" /> within his power and if it is possible to have it amended in this way.</P>
    <P>If many farmers in their late fifties or sixties who are anxious to transfer their holdings, could obtain a capital sum, a monthly pension and be able to stay on the family holding, the farm could be worked by their sons or daughters and the haemorrhage of population from rural Ireland would stop.  This is a golden opportunity which if taken can reverse this trend.</P>
    <P>The scheme as it stands raises a number of questions.  The transferee apparently has to practise farming full time.  Will someone drawing the small farmers' dole qualify?  Will a farmer who up to now has leased land qualify for the retirement scheme?  Will a widow who has recently inherited a farm qualify, although she may have only been involved in the home previously?  There is currently a five year requirement.  Must the transferee's undertaking to practise farming as a main occupation be included as a covenant in the deed of transfer?</P>
    <P>There will be means testing for the scheme.  How does that affect surviving spouses?  How far does the means testing extend?  Will it be applied on the death of the transferor?  It is important to clarify the position for widows in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister says a farmer cannot transfer part of his holding to qualify for part of the 10 per cent; farmers will not be allowed to transfer one portion now and the rest a few years later.  That is another factor which will prevent people qualifying for the scheme.  Across Ireland there are 25,000 to 30,000 farmers who should qualify for this scheme.  However, as drawn up it may exclude many who should be eligible.</P>
    <P>A great deal of work has gone into the scheme.  The IFA has put considerable effort into it; an IFA representative in my constituency, Mr. Ivan Sheppard, has been very involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Minister and his Department have also put much work into it but unfortunately there have been many delays and the earliest date for its introduction is the beginning of next year.  This should be dealt with as a matter of priority.  Efforts should be made to remove the minimum requirement because it will exclude many people.  That is not desirable.  The scheme should encompass as many as possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a practising politician. Many farmers in his constituency have transferred their farms to sons or daughters. This means the parents living on the farm and those younger people often become progressive farmers.  This scheme should be geared towards ensuring that farmers who would normally transfer their farms qualify.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme all regulations have to completed, registered and approved by the Department.  At present if a farmer transfers his farm and the deed of transfer is signed and lodged in the adjudication office, he qualifies for an old age pension from the date of lodgment. It is important that this continues to be the case.  The scheme is excellent but has a major flaw.  If that regulation was removed it could stop the haemorrhage from rural Ireland and enable more people to remain on the land.  It would then be a magnificent scheme which would give hope and we would be proud to be associated with it in years to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this scheme. The Minister announced it on several occasions but something which is good is worth announcing often lest we forget about it.  Since this scheme is part of the CAP programme, those who should take credit for it are the officials in the Department and the EU Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea behind the scheme is excellent because for too long the age profile in farming has not helped us make the agricultural industry more efficient.  The enlargement issue may have to be examined but the concept is good because there is no point keeping the size of agricultural holdings the same.  We must be realistic.  We are engaged in GATT negotiations <Col N="1355" /> which will produce a final outcome in the near future.  We must realise small farms are inefficient.  If we want to stop what Senator Enright called the haemorrhage from rural Ireland, the size of farm holdings must be increased to make it more viable for families to carry on full time farming.  That is an important issue and the thrust of the scheme is to enlarge the holdings for this purpose.</P>
    <P>In the last number of years many people have left rural Ireland but not because agriculture is not prospering. Young people want to leave rural Ireland to see other parts of the country and of the world.  As a young person I know many young people who ultimately have left farms to go to England or America for a number of years.  People can produce whatever statistics they like, but that fact must be recognised.</P>
    <P>We must await the final outcome and details of the scheme.  I am looking forward to it.  There is an upbeat mood in the farming community about this scheme and there is a lot of interest in it, which was evident to me from several meetings throughout my constituency.  I hope the Minister will advertise it well. One of the main reasons he announced it so often may be that the farmers who qualify for the scheme can take it up in large numbers when it finally comes about.</P>
    <P>There is no point in asking the Minister about the intricate details of the scheme. He has already outlined it in his speech and it is there for all of us to see.  I suggest he should remove any underlying obstacles that might be attached to it. Other schemes have failed throughout the years because farmers were afraid to transfer and were worried about their future situation.</P>
    <P>I have little more to say on the matter, other than to suggest that the scheme should be speedily implemented.  It would be a nice present for the early new year.  I hope Teagasc and the other bodies involved will have the facilities and the backup to ensure the scheme is fully taken up and that every individual who can qualify for it will avail of it.  I welcome <Col N="1356" /> the thrust of the Bill and look forward to its implementation.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. I am sure the reservations stated are sincerely held by those who expressed them.  We would all prefer a situation where we could devise a scheme without any limitations or restrictions. However, we live in the real world and the early farm retirement scheme is, as the Senators acknowledged, part of the CAP reform.  It is one of its accompanying measures and 75 per cent of it is being paid for by the EU.  Therefore, it is inevitable that there would be restrictive requirements as far as the Union is concerned. In an ideal world, we would all prefer not to have a CAP or a GATT, but we are members of the enlarged European Union and we have to play our part, bearing in mind that we are considerable net beneficiaries from the Union.</P>
      <P>There would be no future for our agriculture or our farmers outside the CAP framework.  Our commitment in Government is to secure under the GATT as best we can the benefits we negotiated under the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  I will not try to analyse these benefits either one way or the other, except that it is important to know what exactly we are talking about in the context of this debate.</P>
      <P>If we are to develop the maximum benefits of CAP reform for our country, our agricultural industry and our many farming families, we must also ensure we develop, to the greatest possible extent, all of the accompanying measures, such as the new agri-environmental scheme, which will be announced shortly, the new operational programme for forestry and the early farm retirement scheme. Members have identified, as they perceived it, certain limitations in relation to eligibility.  The Government also identified some of these limitations and difficulties in relation to qualification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of extensification was the <Col N="1357" /> item most frequently referred to in this House, where farmers have to increase by 10 per cent the size of the holding taken over.  I acknowledge that that can be difficult for some farmers.  We expressly went to Brussels to negotiate with Commissioner Steichen on this issue.  The original requirement was 20 per cent and we succeeded in negotiating it down to 10 per cent.  There is no way he would entertain our request for a total elimination of that requirement.  I want the House to understand that we tried hard on this matter because it will present a problem to some farmers.  There has to be an element of restructuring.  There is no point in asking us to eliminate it.  In this debate we were criticised for the delay in bringing the pension scheme to fruition.  If there is any reason for a delay &mdash; I do not accept there are any avoidable delays &mdash; it is because we are endeavouring to get for our farmers, our agricultural industry and the country the best deal under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Many Senators raised the question of eligibility for the scheme and of farmers who may have been getting more than 50 per cent of their income outside farming. I understand that argument because many farmers are getting more than 50 per cent of their income in this manner. You come from a part of the country, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, where that would be very much the case.  We did succeed in getting what I consider to be a major concession from the Commission in that area.  If the farmer did not qualify on the basis of his off-farm income, his wife would be regarded as an eligible applicant if she was living and working on the farm full-time and would qualify under the scheme.  That concession is a worthwhile one.</P>
    <P>The early farm retirement scheme is one of the best schemes introduced in this country in terms of bringing about a degree of land mobility.  We expect approval before the end of the year. Aging farmers who, up to now, did not have the financial security to enable them <Col N="1358" /> to retire from farming, can now do so with a degree of financial security and hand over their land to young and energetic farmers, who will be capable of facing up to the challenges of CAP reform and the GATT.</P>
    <P>The way forward for Irish agriculture is to adjust to the challenges which we now face.  The only way we can do that is to ensure those who are operating and managing our land have the vitality and the education to increase the profitability of each farm holding and thereby maximise this potential for the nation.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend the early farm retirement scheme to the House.  I acknowledge, as Senators have, that there are difficulties but tell me of any scheme that was introduced which did not have some limitation or restrictions. As far as we are concerned we have endeavoured to minimise these to the lowest extent and I anticipate that it will be a very successful scheme.</P>

      <P>Regarding a farmer who is leasing 10 per cent of his farm, will this affect the lessor's eligibility to obtain grants, subsidies or retirement pensions in the future?  This point concerns me. Will it affect the lessor's rights to grants or subsidies if he later wants to avail of the scheme and transfers the farm to his son, even though he leased a portion of it earlier?</P>

      <P>We are talking about a retirement scheme.  The farmer who is retiring has to transfer his entire holding, with a small retention provision, to a qualified person.  In that case, I am sure the Senator will appreciate, that the question of qualification for grants relating to agriculture does not arise.  The position is that the young farmer coming into the <Col N="1359" /> scheme, the transferee, will be eligible for all of the grant aid that is available under the CAP reform.</P>
