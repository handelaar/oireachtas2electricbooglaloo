      <P>I have notice from Senator R. Kiely that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to instruct or advise county councils when and where major roadworks are under construction that they be organised so as to cause least inconvenience to road users.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to outline his plans for improvements in the dental services in County Clare and if he will provide staff and finance to deal with the current crisis in the service in County Clare.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Dick Roche of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to outline the application of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts to wine licence sales from certain small retail outlets in Bray and Greystones, County Wicklow and the threat posed to the outlets in question by the application of the law in a <Col N="342" /> manner which is not general throughout the county.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Kiely, Daly and Roche as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Kiely's and Daly's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Roche may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business as outlined by the Leader of the House is agreed.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House if he has any information on the Opsahl report?  May I suggest that the three Members of this House who are also Members of the British-Irish inter-parliamentary body, which is meeting in Cork today and yesterday, be given an opportunity to report to the House on the deliberations of that body?  While I believe all Senators approve of the principle of co-operation between the two Parliaments, this co-operation is not sufficient if it is confined to a small number of Members.  It would, therefore be worthwhile if the House could hear some details of the activities of this body over these two days from those Members attending it on our behalf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently requested the Leader of the House for an outline of the <Col N="343" /> outstanding legislation for the reminder of this session, and I see it is substantial. In this context there is a bad image being presented to the public by Members of the Oireachtas in the rush to close this session.  I believe it is in the interests of all Senators to indicate to the Government Chief Whip that this House is prepared to sit for as long as necessary to deal adequately with the legislation.</P>
      <P>To date, this House has not had recourse to the guillotine this session. I believe there is enough time to deal adequately with legislation over the coming weeks.  Any intention to rush through legislation before the end of this session will reinforce cynicism about political representatives and will reinforce the negative public image of the operations of the Houses of the Oireachtas. This would not be the interests of Members from either side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding a matter raised several times over the last number of weeks, namely, the delay in the publication of proceedings of the House, I want to make clear that I attach no blame to the reporting staff or the staff in the Editor's Office &mdash; this may not have been made clear previously &mdash; because they can only work with the resources at their disposal.</P>
      <P>The extra demands of the developing committee system are putting this staff under strain.  I believe it is wrong that this House should be given a lower priority than committees.  The Government Chief Whip gave assurances to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that the status of this House would not be altered following the establishment of the committees.  In stressing this I believe Senators should emphasise their own rights on this issue.  I ask the Leader of the House to endeavour to resolve the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Leader to provide time for a debate on school transport. It is some time since the provision of school transport was introduced.  Many problems have arisen and the services has <Col N="344" /> been established long enough to warrant an examination of its effectiveness.  This could be undertaken very profitably in this House, and I ask the Leader if it will be possible to arrange an appropriate debate before the close of the present session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House if it would be possible for the Minister for Social Welfare to address us on the ongoing problem of equality, where some people are receiving much more money than others and representations are being made by the legal profession?  The situation is now serious, particularly in my own area.  Other Senators are aware that no recognition has been given to representations made by Members of the Oireachtas, whereas if one sends letters through a legal representative they are acknowledged and receive a speedy response.  Would it be possible for the Minister or a Minister of State to attend the House and inform us of the up to date situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what my colleague Senator O'Toole has said about the Order of Business in this House, and the unseemly rush which we get every year at this time with Bills being rushed through the House.  This is particularly so in relation to the Animal Remedies Bill, 1993 for which we did not even receive an explanatory memorandum, so it is difficult to know how we are supposed to deal with it.</P>
      <P>May I also support Senator Dardis in his comment about the publication of the proceedings of this House.  I have raised this matter repeatedly over a number of weeks, and would point out that today we received the Official Report of Seanad Éireann for 19 May, and this is 30 June. That is simply not acceptable.  The report of sub-committees of the Dáil are produced within a matter of one week, and I really think it is intolerable.  I hope that you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh will pass on to the appropriate authorities this strong feeling of the House on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Manning for raising the matter of the Opsahl report.  My reaction is a mixture of thanks and some embarrassment because I was the one who said it should be debated here.  I know the Leader has done his best because, though the House is busy, the report is to be debated next week or the week after.  Unfortunately, six months ago I arranged to be away for three weeks as and from the day after tomorrow and I feel not a little embarrassed. I would be happy if the debate was postponed until the autumn, but that is a matter for the House.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Leader if he is in a position to say when the tax amnesty Bill will be with the Dáil, when it will come before the Seanad and how much time will be allotted for discussion on it.  As regards disadvantaged areas, I see the Minister of State is in the House and perhaps the Leader could find out from him the present position in relation to appeals and the extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senators Dardis and Norris in regard to the late publication of the Official Report.  I do not know whether it is a matter for this House or not, but I am also concerned by the scant coverage of the proceedings of this House in <i>Oireachtas Report.</i>  I was travelling last Sunday evening and listening to <i>This Week in the Oireachtas</i> on the radio, which lasts for 20 or 25 minutes, and during that time not one item from the Seanad was reported.  It finished up by saying that the Dáil and Seanad would meet again this week.  I think the scant coverage of this House is disgraceful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McGowan has raised the issue of school transport several times and I support his call for a debate on this issue.  There is evidence that there is a move to privatise school <Col N="346" /> transport; there is an investigation and, seemingly, a report.  In view of the experience one has at local level on many issues arising from the anomalies in the school transport system, I support the case being made by Senator McGowan for a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards Senator Manning's views of the British-Irish parliamentary group, I am sure we will consider some way of providing some report to Members.  On the Opsahl report, I find myself with a difficulty now having listened to Senator Wilson because the last phone call the Whip made before coming to the House was to the Tánaiste.  We will have to speak to the Whips and leaders of the groups after the meeting today.</P>
      <P>I am surprised at Senator Norris, because I dealt at length yesterday with the legislative programme for the coming weeks and thought there was general agreement that we were endeavouring to ensure there would be no guillotine in this House.  There has never been any suggestion of a close-off date in this House.  It was made clear yesterday that most of the legislative programme is going into Committee in the Dáil, and the only two pieces of legislation Senators will have to deal with between now and the summer recess are the tax amnesty Bill on Thursday, 8 July 1993, and the European Communities Bill.  The reason the tax amnesty Bill is being taken in the Seanad on 8 July, and not the 13 July, is that the Dáil session ends on 9 July and if there are amendments by this House it means the Minister can go back to the Dáil with them.</P>
      <P>With regard to the explanatory memorandum on the Animal Remedies Bill, 1993, obviously something has gone wrong with it along the way because I have a copy and I am sure other Members have as well.  Senators McGowan and Sherlock mentioned school transport.  It may well be that we will get an opportunity to discuss it before the summer recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the query raised by Senator Norris, the explanatory memorandum was circulated and I am sure all Senators received it and have studied it in detail.</P>
      <P>Perhaps, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, you would allow me to extend my personal good wishes to the Cathaorileach for a speedy recovery to health.  I know this House has extended its collective good wishes to Senator Fallon and I would like to be associated with that.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide a single comprehensive basis for regulating the availability and use of animal remedies. The availability and use of animal remedies has consequences for the producer, the consumer and for the pharmaceutical industry.  The relationship between animal health and successful livestock production is well recognised and apparent.  In recent years the public health aspects of the safety of residues of animal remedies has come strongly into focus, and much research and analysis has been carried out into the safety of residues.  Coupled with this awareness is the need to use animal remedies responsibly and carefully and to observe proper withdrawal periods.  A no less important aspect, which may not be obvious to the casual observer, is the pharmaceutical industry which develops, manufactures and distributes the animal remedies and is a significnat investor and employer in the Irish economy.  This is something which should not be overlooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks at the broad range of activities which are influenced and affected by legislation relating to animal remedies, it is not surprising that the area is regulated by a variety of different instruments.  At the present time the availability and use of animal remedies is regulated under four principal Acts: the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932; the <Col N="348" /> Animal Remedies Act, 1956; the Poisons Act, 1961 and the European Communities Act, 1972.  The Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, also applies to animal remedies with narcotic properties.  In addition, the question of residues of animal remedies in food for human consumption is addressed under enactments such as the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Acts, 1930 to 1978; the Pigs and Bacon Acts, 1935 to 1978; the Milk and Dairies Acts 1935 to 1956; and the Abattoirs Act, 1988.  This scattering of legislative controls does not facilitate equal and effective enforcement.  Neither does it assist the law-abiding producer or consumer who wishes to understand more clearly what controls must be complied with.  The greatest concern for enforcement authorities arises from the fear that loopholes may arise which enable the intended controls to be evaded.  Therefore, this legislation is timely and necessary.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of this Bill that animal remedies will be subject to a uniform set of controls from the point of manufacture to the sale for human consumption of food derived from treated animals.  This is a vast area, as I have already mentioned, and the legitimate interests of a variety of different groups have to be appreciated and respected.  I recognise that there are different interests and that the aspirations of each must be balanced to ensure that the wishes of any one interest group does not dominate to the detriment of any other party.  I do not suggest, however, that there is any fundamental incompatibility between these parties.  In fact, I would go further and say that their interests are interdependent and complementary.  It is our function and duty as legislators to ensure that we create a legislative climate where all needs are addressed.</P>
    <P>I do not consider this is an unrealistic aspiration.  We are all consumers and have a mutual interest in ensuring that the food we consume is wholesome and is not contaminated by potentially detrimental substances.  Additionally, we are anxious to be satisfied that our food is derived from healthy animals.  Consumers <Col N="349" /> are now very well informed regarding farming practices, in particular those relating to livestock production. They are rightly demanding assurances that any animal remedies administered to food-producing animals have been administered correctly, that proper withdrawal periods have been observed and that the substance used was authorised and is safe for use in food-producing animals.</P>
    <P>Mechanisms are in place to ensure that these concerns are met.  All animal remedies have to pass a vigorous evaluation before being placed on the market.  Very stringent criteria of safety, quality and efficacy are applied to products before they receive a marketing authorisation. Particular attention is paid to the safety of residues and a great deal of work is underway at EC and other international organisation level to assess the safety of residues and to agree international standards.</P>
    <P>In recent times it is regrettable that abuses of animal remedies have received so much attention.  It has to conceded that it has, and does, happen and I will return to this point later.  Apart from the public health concerns, which are well recognised, an equally serious outcome is that it has tarnished the reputation and image of the farming community.  I must put on record that those who traffic in and use illegal substances are not representative of the rank-and-file genuine farmers.  Clearly they are not friends of the consumer, neither are they friends of the farming community.  Farmers and their families are also consumers and are just as concerned as the rest of the community about the quality of the food they produce and consume.  Naturally, because their livelihood depends on it, they are anxious to ensure the health and welfare of their stock.  Healthy stock are needed to produce quality food, to give a good product to the consumer and to give the producer a decent return for their investment and labour.</P>
    <P>Farmers also recognise the reality of the market place and acknowledge that there is little point producing any commodity if there is no confidence and, <Col N="350" /> consequently, no consumer demand for it.  Farmers, therefore, depend on consumers for their livelihood and have to appreciate that their wishes must be respected and served if their custom is to be retained.</P>
    <P>Of course, the consumer is not left entirely dependent on the goodwill of the producer.  There are extensive official checks carried out on live animals, on farms and on carcases at slaughtering facilities and on milk at dairies and creameries to ensure that only authorised animal remedies are used, and are used correctly.  These checks are carried out on a random basis and also on suspicion and are supplemented by regular checks on the distribution chain to ensure that only authorised products are put into circulation.</P>
    <P>Moving back a stage from the farmer and animal owner who uses the animal remedy, we reach the pharmaceutical industry.  I use this term generally to encompass the manufacturing and distribution activities.  The pharmaceutical industry has come in for a share of criticism. People are very quick to condemn the industry for developing products which have come to be abused.  However, we are quick to overlook the fact that most of these products were developed originally for bona fide purposes to treat clinical illness.  We in Ireland enjoy an animal health status that is the envy of many of our trading competitors.  We are all conscious of this health status and go to great lengths to protect it.</P>
    <P>At a general level there has been dramatic improvement in animal health in recent years and many minor &mdash; in the sense that they are not exotic to this country &mdash; illnesses and diseases can be successfully prevented or treated by the judicious use of animal remedies.  Many of these essential products are the result of many years of research and substantial investment by the pharmaceutical industry. The legitimate pharmaceutical industry in Ireland is making a substantial contribution to the improvement in animal husbandry.</P>
    <P>The industry is not simply concerned with selling the solution to the various <Col N="351" /> animal health problems which are encountered on a daily basis.  Many firms are active through the promotion and sponsorship of educational and awareness schemes directed towards the farming community and the veterinary profession.  The costs of developing new products are very high and after the development of the product, significant sums must be invested in carrying out the necessary studies to prove that the product meets the stringent standards of safety, quality and efficacy prescribed. If the industry is continue to invest in research and development of new, better and safer products they also must be protected against unscrupulous dealers in substandard, unauthorised and in some cases dangerous products.  I repeat, there should be no conflict between the consumer, the producer and the pharmaceutical industry on this very important issue.</P>
    <P>So far I have concentrated on the groups whose interests must be protected by the Bill we are considering.  I will now turn to those against whom we all need protection, it is clear from the earlier proceedings in Dáil Éireann that I do not need to acquaint this House of the problem which exists in Europe in relation to the use of illegal substances for growth promotion purposes.  We in Ireland, I regret to have to admit, have our share of this problem.  Recent reports in the national and international media have not done anything to enhance the image of Ireland as a producer of quality, wholesome, natural food.  This image has been the cornerstone of our marketing strategy and while good reputations are hard to earn they are even harder to re-establish.</P>
    <P>Our live animal and meat exports are worth in the region of £1 billion annually. This sum is of immense significance to the economy as a whole but it is the life blood of the farming community.  As I have already stated those who use these substances are unrepresentative and unscrupulous.  They threaten the fundamental viability of our livestock and meat industry.  Persons who supply or use these <Col N="352" /> substances have been roundly condemned, and quite rightly so.  The Members of Dáil Éireann have sent a loud and clear message that such actions will not be tolerated by the legislature and the magnitude of the permissible fines reflects that attitude.  I assure this House that no effort will be spared to identify all involved in this activity and to bring them to justice.</P>
    <P>Senators may be aware of the recent communication from the EC Commissioner for Agriculture, Rene Stecichen, who is reviewing the situation in the Community with a view to having more stringent and effective enforcement of the prohibition on the use of illegal substances.  The general thrust of the Commissioner's view is supported and the recognition of a need for a well directed vigorous attack is to be greatly welcomed.  Many of the measures being proposed are based on some of the controls already applied in Ireland.  The passage of this Bill coincides with the renewed attention to this matter in the Community and will send a clear signal to our colleagues of our determination to put an end to this behaviour.</P>
    <P>The use of growth promoters, whether legal or illegal, is a very short-sighted view of a means of ensuring farmers' prosperity.  Consumers throughout the Community have, through the democratic process, indicated clearly that they do not wish to purchase or consume meat produced using any of these substances. The use of illegal substances has hardened consumer resistance to meat and meat products.  This resistance needs to be overcome if the disturbing downward trend in meat consumption throughout the Community is to be reversed.  Future prosperity for meat producers can only be assured by increasing the demand and the market for their produce.  There are some commentators who suggest that the natural hormones should be legalised and this will prevent the abuse.  This is erroneous thinking, however meritorious certain scientific arguments may be.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the detailed provisions of the Bill I would like to draw <Col N="353" /> special attention to one aspect.  This is the fact that this Bill which we are considering provides for the transposition of future EC legislation dealing with any aspect of animal remedies into national law by means of regulations under this Bill.  This will ensure a total consistency in the application of national and EC measures and will bring a greater coherence and flexibility to the law in this area.  In view of the recent High Court judgment relating to the use of the European Communities Act for the purposes of implementing legislation, which is under appeal to the Supreme Court, it is appropriate that all our legislation should be based on a common denominator which enables conflict of laws to be readily resolved.</P>
    <P>I will now preceed to outline the main provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 1 defines various terms and concepts for the purpose of the Bill. Many of the definitions employed are reenactments of the provisions of the 1956 Act.  The only significant change is in the definition of an animal remedy which is revised to take account of Community law in this area and to keep abreast of technological developments.</P>
    <P>Section 2 sets out the animals to which the Act will apply.  The definition is greatly extended from the 1956 Act and includes all mammals, birds, fish, molluscs and bees and any other animal kept, or whose produce is intended, for human consumption.  This is necessary to take account of species not covered by the 1956 Act which are now being farmed or reared for human consumption, for example deer and fish.  It is also desirable to provide that all remedies intended for any animal are covered as, otherwise, unacceptable products could be marketed for species outside the scope of the Act and diverted to animals intended for human consumption.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the enlargement of the Animal Remedies Consultative Committee which, under the 1956 Act, advised and assisted the Minister in the making of regulations under the Act. That committee had five members; it is proposed that the new committee will <Col N="354" /> have nine members.  The structure and appointment of the Committee was the subject of lengthy consideration by the Dáil and this section has been redrafted to reflect the views expressed in the Dáil. In proposing to extend the size of the committee I was mindful of the diverse interests materially affected by legislation relating to animal remedies.  I was, therefore, most anxious to ensure that all interests likely to be affected by regulations made under the Act would be adequately represented.  The section now provides for a Committee of nine persons of whom six will be appointed from nominees of groups such a veterinary surgeons, pharmacists, farmers, consumers, manufacturers and distributors of animal remedies and the food industry.  I appreciate the interest shown by the Deputies on this matter and feel we now have a structure which will ensure transparency and confidence in the legislative process.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the labelling of animal remedies.  The purpose of this section is to ensure that adequate information is conveyed on the container or outer wrapper of every animal remedy in order to ensure safe and proper usage of the animal remedy.  The same particulars must be stated on any advertisement for an animal remedy.  The particulars required may be varied by regulation in appropriate circumstances.  It was pointed out during the Dáil debate that the indentification of bulk animal remedies was inadequately dealt with.  I was happy to make an appropriate amendment to cover this aspect and I feel this issue is now comprehensively covered. Section 5 complements section 4 by prohibiting the publication of false or misleading particulars in relations to an animal remedy.</P>
    <P>Section 6 addresses a number of issues arising out of possession of an animal remedy.  The posession or control of an animal remedy in contravention of the provisions of the Bill or of regulations to be made thereunder, or of an animal or carcase or animal produce knowing it to have been illegally treated is prohibited under this section.  Provision is also made <Col N="355" /> to enable certain presumptions to be drawn from the possession of an animal or an animal remedy which will facilitate the enforcement of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 7 inserts an implied condition in any contract of sale that the animal or, in the case of a carcase or any animal product, the animal from which it was derived had not been illegally treated. This type of implied condition of sale is similar to the implied provisions of fitness of goods for the purpose for which they are intended which applies under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980.</P>
    <P>Section 8 empowers the Minister, following consultation with the Animal Remedies Consultative Committee, to make regulations relating to animal remedies.  Arising out of the comprehensive nature of the Bill the regulation-making power covers an extensive area of application.  Regulations made under this section may provide to control the manufacture, importation, distribution, sale, advertising, possession and use of animal remedies.  Powers to prescribe maximun residue limits for animal remedies in foods of animal origin and for the control of animals to which animal remedies are administered are available under this section.  The controls provided for include powers for marking, detaining or restricting the sale, slaughter or movement of animals which are believed to have been treated with animal remedies.  Provision is made for the disposal or destruction of illegally treated animals.  Regulations may also be made to deal with the inspection and testing of substances, animals and food of animal origin and for the charging of fees in respect of these activities.</P>
    <P>In addition to the aforementioned matters which arise directly from this Bill this section enables regulations to be made giving effect to Acts of the European Communities and validates regulations relating to animal remedies already made under the European Communities Act, 1972.  This is a very important aspect in two respects.  First, when a new Bill is <Col N="356" /> introduced there is always speculation about the type of regulation which will be made thereunder.  In the case of this Bill, the question is largely answered as the provisions relating to the continuation in force of existing regulations will ensure a smooth transition in that the Bill once passed will be immediately operational Secondly, it means that future EC directives in this area will be implemented and enforced as an integral part of our national law on the subject rather than being imposed as a series of independent measures.</P>
    <P>Section 9 allows for the Minister to prescribe approved methods of analysis for the determination of the composition of animal remedies or for the presence of residues in animal produce.  The authorisation of the persons and bodies to carry out such analysis and for the admission of documents stating the results of such analysis as evidence in legal proceedings is also addressed under this section.  This section was subject to some technical amendment to clarify certain evidential matters during Dáil proceedings. The purpose and effect remain unchanged.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the authorisation of officers for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 11 confers extensive powers on authorised officers, officers of Customs and Excise and members of the Garda Síochána.  These include, <i>inter alia</i>, powers to stop vehicles and enter any land or premises where there are reasonable grounds to believe that they are used in connection with activities regulated by this Act or where an offence under this Act has been, or is being, committed.</P>
    <P>Following entry, officers have extensive powers to search, examine, inspect, test or take samples and to seize and detain suspicious items which may be found thereon.  Persons connected with the specified activities are required to produce relevant documents or other items including animals and to give such information or assistance as may be requested by the officer or member concerned. This power is exercisable in respect of a dwelling only where there is <Col N="357" /> reason to believe that relevant material would be destroyed before a search warrant could be obtained.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that a judge of the District Court may issue search warrants to an authorised officer, officer of Customs and Excise or member of the Garda Síochána to enter and search a dwelling house where there are reasonable grounds to suspect evidence of an offence is to be found therein.  Members of the Garda Síochána and officers of Customs and Excise are empowered to search a suspect person under section 13 and section 14 empowers members of the Garda Síochána to arrest without warrant persons suspected of having committed an offence.  Section 15 provides that nothing in the Bill shall curtail or prejudice other provisions of existing legislation in relation to powers to search, seize or detain property which may be exercised by members of the Garda Síochána or officers of Customs and Excise.</P>
    <P>While the powers available under section 11 to 15 are very extensive, I would like to assure this House that the most severe aspects would only be employed in cases of suspected serious infringements.  These provisions are based on the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, and are very similar to the powers of enforcement as already applied under the regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972, I should mention that there is already good co-operation between the different enforcement agencies in this area and all the officers concerned deserve to be complimented on their efforts and success to date.  Those going about their normal legitimate business need have no fear about these provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides that any person who obstructs or impedes an authorised officer, officer of Customs and Excise or member of the Garda Síochána in the enforcement of any of the provisions provided for by or under this Bill shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that the Minister may issue composite identity cards to his officers in lieu of the separate warrants <Col N="358" /> of authorisation prescribed by the various statutes in respect of which the officers are authorised.  This provision is inserted because many officers are engaged in a wide range of duties and as a result are obliged to carry a large number of separate warrants.</P>
    <P>Many officers are simultaneously authorised to enforce the provisions of a multiplicity of Acts, for example, the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, the Animal Remedies Act, 1956, the Pigs and Bacon Acts, 1935 to 1978, the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Acts, 1930 to 1978, the Abbatoirs Act, 1988, etc. This provision will enable a single composite identity document to be issued to such officers.  To take account of the legitimate concerns, expressed in the Dáil, that officers seeking access to premises should be properly indentified, I have amended this section to provide for all composite cards to carry photograph of the bearer.</P>
    <P>Section 18 deems the impersonation of an authorised officer to be an offence. Section 19 provides that where it is not possible to prove the specific identity of an animal remedy in relation to which a contravention took place, it will be sufficient to prove that contravention took place in relation to a particular class of animal remedy.</P>
    <P>Section 20 prescribes matters which constitute offences.  Contraventions whether by act or ommission of any provision of the Bill, or regulations made or continued in force thereunder, or of a term or condition of any licence or authorisation given or granted under the Bill are deemed to be offences.</P>
    <P>Section 21 relates to offences by bodies corporate.  The purpose of this section is to prevent offenders evading personal responsibility for their actions by hiding behind a corporate veil.  Where an offence is committed with the consent or connivance of any person who is a director, manager, secretary or other officer of the body corporate that person shall, in addition to the body corporate, be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished as if guilty of the offences.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> Section 22 empowers the Minister to prosecute summary offences and provides that summary proceedings may be instituted within two years of the date of the offence.  This provision is considered necessary because the investigation of offences relating to animal remedies can at times be lengthy if all parties to the offence are to be identified and proceeded against.  Aside from obligations under EC law, it is essential if problems are to be tackled effectively that breaches of the legislation are traced back to the source of the illegal substance and that all parties involved are identified and dealt with.  However, this comprehensive approach would be meaningless if we were to find that the institution of proceedings was statute barred on completion of the investigation.</P>
    <P>Section 23 addresses the issue of penalties and offers a range of options appropriate to the offence involved so that, hopefully, the punishment shall match the crime.  It is absolutely necessary that the penalites available must be sufficiently severe to act as a deterrent. My views on this matter were shared by many Deputies in the Dáil.  It was their considered judgment that in the case of more serious offences, even more stringent penalties were called for because of the damage which could result from these activities.  I was happy to defer to their views on this matter and the maximum penalties for the most serious categories of indictable offences have been substantially increased.</P>
    <P>It is provided that maximum penalty on summary conviction shall be a fine of £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment.  For conviction on indictment, a maximum fine of £100,000, rising to £250,000 on second or subsequent offence, and ten years imprisonment or both is provided. It is additionally provided in section 24 that on conviction on indictment, a person may, in addition to the penalty imposed be disqualified from keeping, dealing in or having control of any animal or class of animal or any animal remedy, or be disqualified from working or participating in the food trade for such <Col N="360" /> period, including the life of the person, as the court thinks fit.  This is a very daunting prospect, but also a fitting one. Persons who behave with callous disregard for the health of innocent and trusting consumers cannot be allowed access to, and control of, products which will eventually end up in the food chain. Our food industry and the welfare of our consumers customers and farmers, at home and abroad, cannot be jeopardised and held to ransom by unscrupulous profiteers.</P>
    <P>Section 25 enpowers a court at its discretion to order the forfeiture of an animal, an animal remedy or other thing in relation to which an offence has been committed.</P>
    <P>Section 26 deals with the manner in which items seized by authorised officers, members of the Garda Síochána, or officers of Customs and Excise will be disposed of.</P>
    <P>Section 27 enables the Minister to recover the cost of disposal of items seized or forfeited as a contract debt.</P>
    <P>Section 28 to 31 deal with standard procedural matters such as the laying of orders and regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas, the fixing and charging of variable fees and levies for different classes of licences and authorisations and the payment of expenses incurred by the Minister out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 31 will continue in force all instruments, documents and authorisations issued under the Animal Remedies Act, 1956, which were in force immediately before the Act is repealed. The purpose of this section is to ensure uninterrupted application of controls.</P>
    <P>Section 32 repeals the Animal Remedies Act, 1956, section 21 of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966 and provides for the repeal of the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932, by order of the Minister for Health following consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  These provisions arise because the subject matter of these Acts have been superseded by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>These are the salient features of the <Col N="361" /> Bill which I commend to the House, and in so doing would like to thank all the bodies who have contributed to its preparation. I think there is a broad consensus on what we are trying to achieve and I hope it will have the full support of this House.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to acknowledge the commitment demonstrated by the Department of Agriculture officials in their work on the preparation of this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to this House.  I have read the Bill but I consider the Minister's comments more important because they detail the intentions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this legislation.  The importance of the beef industry to this country can never be overstated.  There have been many statements during the past ten years about the use of implants which have led to misunderstandings on the part of ordinary consumers.  Consumers in Europe have clearly stated that they are not prepared to consume meat that is contaminated with chemicals.  For that reason it is essential to ensure that the farmers of this country and Europe are not allowed to make their own rules for beef production.  It is important that Ireland retains its clean and green image.</P>
      <P>We already have much legislation on this issue and some of it appears to be inadequate.  In 1991 the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy O'Kennedy, introduced regulations to control certain sales and during the debate on them in the Dáil &mdash; in which I participated &mdash; Deputy O'Kennedy put great emphasis on pursuing and bringing to justice those people who were illegally using growth promoters. Unfortunately, there appears to have been little progress in identifying those people.  How many were brought to court?  Fine Gael had a deep interest in this problem.  Members of the party told the Minister that many people were illegally using implants and that it was, unfortunately, hard to convince them of the dangers to the beef industry of doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="362" /> I want to avoid creating scares among consumers in the course of this debate. There were many scares following statements about the usage of these chemicals, even from the Department, during the last debate on this issue.  Between 1 and 1.5 per cent of farmers are prepared to abuse the present system.  The percentage of affected cattle may be different. I arrived at those percentages after checking the number of farmers getting high tests as far as U grades are concerned. The Department also has those figures.  Some of the beef producers who use growth promoters have large herds of cattle; therefore the percentage of cattle being given growth promoters would be somewhat higher.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unfair to suggest that officials of the Department created any scare in relation to the use of chemicals.  That would not be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the last debate when there were serious scares following statements made during the debate.  The Minister and his Department is aware of that.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested many times that the material known as clenbuterol is being supplied by the Provisional IRA. That illegal organisation consists of evil people who are ruthless in the use of this material on animals as a means of financial support for their evil acts in this country.  I cannot understand how the Provisional IRA can import the large quantities of the material necessary for successful distribution.  It would be imported in half tonne or tonne lots which would be a bulky cargo and it should be easily identified if it is imported by plane or boat.  I do not wish to suggest that the Garda Síochána are not doing their duty.  Indeed I congratulate them on their work in this area and on their ability to identify where the material is stored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also suggestion that the substance comes from South America &mdash; from the so-called drug barons &mdash; via Spain and eastern Europe.  We should call on the international police force to <Col N="363" /> try and stop this trade.  We must have the co-operation of other European countries and America to ensure that this material does not reach our shores.  We must preserve our valuable beef export trade.</P>
    <P>Clenbuterol is a lethal substance and the effects on consumers of meat containing residue of the product can be serious, particularly on people with cardiac problems.  The effects can be immediate on people who are applying the substance either to meal or to cattle feeding troughs.  Clenbuterol can have a long term effect and can cause death in some cases.  We cannot measure or know the full effect of its use over a long period of time.  We have heard stories of people who have died instantly after handling this substance without protective gloves or masks.  In one case a man using the substance was unable to get from the feeding sheds to his door, a distance of 20 yards; he died on the way.  That is a measure of the danger of clenbuterol. About six to eight years ago it was widely used in Spain and Holland and, according to an article I read, hospitals were full with patients suffering from cardiac and lung problems.</P>
    <P>Clenbuterol, or angel dust as it is commonly known, reduces the amount of fat in cattle thereby improving their grade which should be a clear indicator of its use to the Department of Agriculture inspectors.  Almost 95 per cent of herds reach a U grade of between 5 and 10 per cent; approximately 2 per cent reach the U grades of 35 and 40 per cent.  Some of these cattle are not Belgian Blues or Charolais; they are Friesian cattle and everybody knows it is physically impossible to get Freisian cattle to Grade U when they are sent to the factory for slaughter.  This should be a clear signal to Department inspectors who should then be able to identify the people using the substance.  It is not beyond the Department's ability, once they have secured the farmers' names, to have a thorough search carried out on the farms and the cattle sent to the factories should be tested to see if any residue remains. <Col N="364" /> These people are cunning and clever and as there is a withdrawal period of about five to six weeks it may be difficult to prove that the material was used.  Having got the name of those involved, surely it is not beyond the ability of the Department to track them down quickly because the use of this substance in beef production must be eliminated.  I welcome the substantial powers made available in this Bill; they are well justified.</P>
    <P>I would like to bring to the Minister's attention the misuse of certain material in feed in order to improve cattle gradings, that is, turkey feed.  I am sure the Department has information on this.  The cost of this feed, which contains approximately 30 per cent protein, is about £400 per tonne, but it contains a certain amount of growth promoters and in some cases, it is being mixed with animal feed. Such a practice should be brought to the notice of the relevant authorities and I am doing so in this House today.  I cannot produce evidence to support this claim but I have been told that turkey feed is being used in rations for fattening cattle on a limited scale.  This practice should be stopped before it gets acceptance from our farmers.</P>
    <P>We need to pay close attention to all source and distribution outlets for these substances.  There are a large number of wholesalers and retailers, including pharmacists, dealing with veterinary medicines who supply farmers.  There is a body of opinion calling for a licensing system. However, as a farmer I cannot agree with this.  One can have all the legislation one likes, but those using these substances need to be caught.  In my speech, I mentioned ways of identifying these substances and it should not be too difficult to trace them back to their source.  When caught, they should be brought to justice and no mercy shown to them because the beef industry is so important that we cannot allow 1 to 1.5 per cent of our farmers to destroy our European trade. It is becoming more important to satisfy the consumer, especially when these substances are allowed to be used by beef producers in America.</P>
    <P>I understand that some of the provisions <Col N="365" /> in the current Bill arise from the recent High Court decision on the validity of the regulations passed and based on the provisions of the European Communities Act, 1972.  I know the matter is under appeal to the Supreme Court and that it cannot be completely teased out now.</P>
    <P>I fully support the measures in this Bill but there are still a number of questions to be answered.  I would be especially interested to hear the Minister's answer to the questions on the 2 per cent of farmers whose cattle are getting U grades of between 30-40 per cent.  I have checked with three factories and they tell me that only 2 per cent of all farmers are using this substance, but how do they manage to get this percentage level?  The best the majority of farmers can obtain is between 8-10 per cent.  I call on the Minister of State to urgently investigate this area.  I only referred to these points because there is little chemical abuse other than in that area and I hope the Minister of State will appreciate this.</P>
    <P>I will not be putting down amendments because this Bill should be implemented as quickly as possible and the people involved in this practice should be brought to justice.  There were many good points raised in the Dáil debate on this issue and I have no doubt there will be many more raised in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and appreciate the opportunity to express our abhorrence at the misuse of animal remedies &mdash; primarily clenbuterol, or angel dust as it is known &mdash; by some farmers for short term financial gain.  This is detrimental to the long term development potential for agriculture both here and abroad.  In view of the importance of the agriculture to our economy and the Common Agricultural Policy reforms currently being implemented, every effort must be made to promote Irish agricultural produce as the highest quality not only in Europe but in the world, and the highest standards of excellence through the production chain must be demanded so that quality is achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Divergence from high standards at any <Col N="366" /> level can undo the good work of others in the food production chain who work diligently to comply with all the legal requirements to ensure the safety and welfare of the animal, the handler, the environment and most importantly, the consumer of animal products.  Livestock based production is our primary industry and we should set world trends in standards of excellence that would make our food products the most highly demanded in world markets.  We are proud of our image of green fields, fresh air, clean lakes and streams and we have used it to promote Irish produce as being of a high quality, wholesome and naturally produced. Why spoil this image?</P>
    <P>This Bill aims to put an end to use of clenbuterol and other so called cocktails, which are very efficient in some cases in converting the muscle formation in some animals while quickly aiding the removal of excess fat in others in a brief period. Artificial growth hormones first became available here in the mid-1970s, when we began to copy our European compatriots who were using them long before we entered the EC.  At that stage, we saw the unscrupulous side of that industry. Some people did not observe the regulations concerning synthetic hormones and did not allow for the 60 day period between implantation and slaughter.  In some cases midway through the term, people decided to double the dose.  This practice was commonly accepted.  The net result was that people lost all sense of responsibility.  Those involved in the use of this substance felt they were justified in using it and all that mattered was the end product.  They forgot that this product was to be sold to the consumer who could be affected by the consequences of their actions.</P>
    <P>The decision to ban both natural and synthetic hormones was taken at EC level in the mid-1980s because of increasing consumer queries and a series of abuses in a number of member states.  At the same time, other drugs, including clenbuterol, were introduced and they are the most lethal substances that can be administered by a farmer to his livestock. Not only are they dangerous to the health <Col N="367" /> of consumers in the long term but they are also an immediate danger to those who administer them.  Clenbuterol is a lethal substance and we are aware of some of the effects it can have on the consumers of meat in which it has been injected.  It can adversely affect those with cardiac and lung problems.  These are the immediate effects but we do not know the possible effects of repeated ingestion of small quantities of the residue over an extended period which would result from clenbuterol treated meat sold in an area over a specific period.</P>
    <P>Clenbuterol in powdered form can be lethal to an ignorant user.  Senator D'Arcy referred to a person who inhaled it and died before he reached his home. There are documented cases of ignorant users mixing this powder feed without using protective gloves or masks and who have died from massive heart attacks soon after that.  The main physiological effect of this substance is an increase in the heart rate.  Someone using this substance in powdered form is liable to inhale it and to suffer the same effects as animals treated with it.  Ingestion in that manner is usually at a higher level than that which an animal would get in its feed.</P>
    <P>The use of this product produces short term gains for the unscrupulous user.  The Minister in his speech said that &ldquo;those who traffic in and use illegal substances are not representative of the rank-and-file genuine farmer.&rdquo;  I agree with that statement.  Treated animals appear to have better conformation and, therefore, command higher prices, given the system we use for pricing beef animals in our factories, a subject we could debate for several days.  The meat of those animals following treatment is much tougher and less palatable than untreated meat.  Apart from the malignant effect on consumers' health, there is also a substantial effect on the palatability of the product.  Continued and widespread use of clenbuterol would inevitably degrade the quality and damage the image of Irish beef.  Therefore, this Bill must pass quickly through the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> I refer to an article in <i>Cork Examiner</i> of 2 March 1993, about the involvement of illegal organisations in the trafficking of such substances.  It is bad to see our meat industry being jeopardised by the actions of these people.  Profits are used for purposes which Members would condemn. I was surprised to hear Senator D'Arcy blame farmers with Friesian cattle for the use of this substance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator must defend them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the use of this substance in Friesian cattle, I did not refer to farmers with Friesian cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>It might have been Friesian cattle that passed from farmers to other cattlemen.  Some Friesian cattle grade well in factories, although they may not reach the grade mentioned by Senator D'Arcy.</P>
      <P>Section 3 provides for the appointment by the Minister of an Animal Remedies Consultative Committee to advise and assist the Minister in the making of regulations. I am glad the Minister is increasing the number of representatives on this committee.  It will include representatives from farming and consumer groups.  We must project an image as a quality beef-producing country.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increase in fines.  This Bill provides that a maximum penalty on summary conviction shall be a fine of £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment.  For conviction on indictment, a maximum fine of £100,000 rising to £250,000 on second or subsequent offence and ten years imprisonment or both is provided. These fines and terms of imprisonment are necessary to ensure that use of this illegal substance is discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the farming organisations. A report in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of 3 March 1993 stated that Ireland had an untarnished meat industry.  It said &ldquo;CBF chief executive Mr. Paddy Moore has expressed full confidence in the Government's commitment to stamp out angel dust abuse in Ireland.&rdquo;  The chief executive of the CBF is conscious of the <Col N="369" /> Government's efforts in this regard.  Furthermore, the General Secretary of the ICMSA, Mr. Donal Murphy, has urged the Government to adopt several initiatives. However, I have yet to read a statement from the IFA seeking the banning of angel dust.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that this lethal substance is banned.  Unscrupulous and greedy farmers who use this substance for short term gain are damaging our meat industry.  It is important that producers &mdash; and I am one &mdash; rely on some animal remedies to ensure the health of stock so as to derive optimum return for investment and labour.  There are occasions when cattle become ill and the veterinary surgeon is called and has to administer drugs or some substance to cure the animal.</P>
    <P>I am delighted this Bill provides a regulatory framework to ensure the safe administration of drugs to animals and that quality products are used responsibly and correctly where necessary.  I welcome the Bill and I hope it will have the desired effect on the beef industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome to the House the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Hyland.  This is one of the most important Bills relating to the food industry to come before the House.  The beef industry is vital for us and this comprehensive and detailed Bill is an acknowledgement of that fact.</P>
      <P>In recent years there has been a disturbing increase in the use of illegal and dangerous substances for the purpose of promoting growth in livestock.  It is unfortunate that it is profitable to use these substances.  The manner in which cattle were graded for intervention encouraged the use of hormones and until the system is changed a small minority will contrive to use these substances. It is difficult to get cattle to the required grade unless one use some form of substance and this is a matter the EC must consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish agriculture trades on its reputation as a producer of quality produce. Therefore, it is unacceptable that a small group of unscrupulous people should <Col N="370" /> jeopardise the economy, as was pointed out by other speakers.  We are looked upon as a clean and natural beef-producing country.  The aim of this Bill is to give confidence to everyone involved that we now have the legislative power to curb the use of these illegal substances.</P>
    <P>The media and the trade speculated that the use of these substances was rife. I come from a farming background, and I want to put it on the record that the genuine farmer was not involved in the use of these substances.  In the past, we used natural recurring hormones.  In recent years the image of the beef industry was tarnished because people had the perception that every farmer was using these hormones even after they were banned.  It has been suggested that paramilitaries are involved in the distribution and importation of these illegal substances.  This perception is detrimental to the industry.  If a whole industry is perceived as being involved in illegal activities, it does not augur well for its image abroad.</P>
    <P>The industry depends on the trust and goodwill of the consumer.  It is important that we alleviate the fears of the consumer and this Bill will do this because of the stringent laws and guidelines it lays down and the heavy fines it imposes.  The trust of the consumer must be restored. The fact that beef consumption throughout the EC is falling is an indication that people are not eating beef because of possible health implications.  This issue must be brought to the fore and dicussed openly.  The public must be assured that we have dealt successfully with this problem. As was pointed out, a small minority of people in the trade using such substances have tarnished the whole trade.</P>
    <P>The livestock trade is very important but while we have a system where cattle are graded for intervention purposes we will have to look for other ways of grading cattle because farmers cannot now use hormones which were banned in 1984. The problem at the moment is that we have a beef industry where cattle can no longer be graded for intervention.  This may be a good thing because it may <Col N="371" /> encourage people in the industry to sell cattle elsewhere.  If animals do not qualify for beef intervention they do not qualify for premium payments.  This is the difficulty with the present situation.  I know it is not relevant to this Bill but this issue should be looked at by the EC and the Department.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the legislation keeps pace with the development of technology.  The pharmaceutical industry has acted very responsibly over the years, and I have to put this on the record.  They develop products for legitimate use and the fact that these products are further developed by others with ulterior motives does not suggest that the pharmaceutical companies are acting in any way irresponsible. They have contributed enormously to the high health status of Irish cattle</P>
    <P>It is interesting to see that the Bill covers more than the beef industry.  This is very important because while we could have clamped down on the beef industry in this Bill problems could arise in other areas because people could try to sell illegal substances to those involved in mariculture and other livestock sectors. It is a worthwhile Bill from this point of view.  It covers the complete spectrum and does not leave any loopholes which encourage the use of these substances.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the fines have been increased because nobody would use illegal substances if is was not profitable, and it has been profitable for a very small minority.  Prosecution on indictment can now result in fines of up to £100,000, fines of up to £250,000 can be imposed for second offences.  Such fines must be imposed because implanting a large number of cattle with clenbuterol, or angel dust as it is known, would result in substantial financial profit.  To discourage the use of hormones the fines must be greater than the profit which can be generated from their use.</P>
    <P>Overall I am delighted with the Bill.  It has come to the House not before time although I understand that such Bills require a great deal of research before they can be debated in the House.  We <Col N="372" /> have a fine beef industry and we must do our utmost to maintain our unblemished reputation abroad.  I was speaking to farmers in Europe recently and I found our image abroad is slightly tarnished at present and it can be very difficult to restore.  I encourage the Department and other bodies involved in the marketing of food to make sure that this image is restored because selling beef directly to the consumer rather than into intervention is the way forward.  While we have this tarnished image we will not be able to achieve the best markets for our commodities.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for bringing this Bill to the House and for his useful explanation because even the explantory memorandum to a Bill can be at times confusing.  I commend this Bill and look forward to debating it on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and support the tone of his Second Stage speech.  I also support this legislation.  My party and I have been calling for such legislation for some time. I hope it is passed speedily and not just becomes law but is enforced with all the vigour that needs to be brought to bear on it.</P>
      <P>It is self-evident that we have great opportunities to sell the produce of our green fields and relatively unpolluted land.  In the past we have not exploited that advantage to the degree we should and we could point to intervention as one of the reasons we have not done so.  It was more convenient and more profitable in many instances for food producers to put their beef and milk products into intervention.  I do not blame them for this, it was an understandable response. If they were not driven by profit they would not be in business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="373" /> While intervention was there producers used it, but we are now into a different situation that is becoming more and more difficult for our industry, and that is where the consumer decides.  The Minister referred to this in his speech.  It is only belatedly that we are coming to the realisation that the consumer is the person who will decide the future prosperity of Irish farming.  Irish farming and the food industry has a responsibility to respond to the needs of the consumer.  If the consumer decrees that certain substances should not be in meat it is irrelevant whether science says they are safe or otherwise.  Once the consumer has decided, and this is what European consumers have decided, it becomes our responsibility to respond and to provide the consumer with products we can stand over and which will add to the strengths we already have.  We can only do this by introducing legislation such as this to ensure that the product is safe, the consumer can have confidence in it and we can go forward in international markets.</P>
    <P>At a late hour last night I watched the rugby game between the Lions and Waikato from New Zealand. One of the things which was very evident, apart from the paucity of the rugby played by the Lions was that they had a cow walking around the touchline for the duration of the match.  In the introduction to the game, cattle were shown grazing on the grasslands of Waikato. That sends an image to the world of the virtue and value of New Zealand dairy products.  It is not costly advertising but it is effective.  We as a society, if not necessarily as a Government, do not seem to have that degree of interest in or support for our agricultural industry. New Zealand revolves around agriculture and the support given by the population is much in evidence.  A division between the urban and rural communities does not exist to the same extent because the entire society is conscious of the value of their agriculture and what it can do for the economy.  We seem to lack that.</P>
    <P>In our bloodstock industry we have <Col N="374" /> established credentials of excellence and it is accepted we produce the best in the world in that sector.  We seem unable to do the same with our agricultural products, which have the capacity to be represented as products of excellence.</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator O'Kennedy is in the House because it was he who appropriately re-christened angel dust as &ldquo;devil dust&rdquo;.  Unquestionably those who used that substance did untold damage to the industry they purported to serve and from which they derived their incomes. The damage was done on several levels. It was manifestly unfair that those who would not use such substances found themselves at an £80 to £90 disadvantage at the livestock marts compared to those who acted illegally.  It was wrong that those who operated their businesses well and ethically, producing goods of superior quality should be so disadvantaged. I hope and expect this legislation will prevent such impropriety.</P>
    <P>In 1989 during the European Parliament election campaign a large meeting was held in Portumna with candidates from different constituencies.  One candidate, whom I shall refrain from naming in keeping with the etiquette of the House, said it was anti-national to speak of these substances and their use because it would do damage to our industry abroad.  That is inverted and warped reasoning.  It was not those who spoke of the use of the substances who were doing damage; it was those who were using them.  At the meeting that person's remarks were well received by a large group of farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>Did he get elected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>He did.  I said those who used these substances were anti-national and I was received in silence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have progressed from the 1989 position but perhaps the farming organisations were not as vocal as they might have been in telling their members this type of activity was unacceptable.  I realise the economic pressures under which farming has had to operate in the past few years.  Those with serious financial <Col N="375" /> difficulties or pressures may feel compelled to follow practices they do not approve of if they believe it is the only way to survive and they see their neighbours using such methods.  This is not sufficient justification for these practices.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the source of angel dust, or &ldquo;devil dust&rdquo;.  Reasonably conclusive evidence suggests a connection between the distributors of this material and subversive organisations. Farmers and those who encourage the use of these products must be reminded of the consequence of their actions for society.  People were murdered with the help of funds raised in this way.  We must reject this, as democrats and as a people.</P>
    <P>Senator D'Arcy referred to factories and the figures for high grades as an indication of how much these materials were being used.  I am prepared to accept what he said but I also believe the use of clenbuterol was more widespread that he suggested.  The reason was in some cases factories may have been party to the use of these substances.  It is not surprising figures from the factories may understate the position on angel dust.  As the Senator said, larger producers were involved and the output from those sectors is quite high.</P>
    <P>One must return to the issue of naturally occurring hormones.  In one of my previous incarnations I was a producer of fat cattle.  Some would say they were too fat but nevertheless they were beef cattle. I used Ralgro and Finaplix and they were legal.  Later the European community decided they should not be used and we ceased to do so.  A body of opinion, one that would be well represented by Professor Raftery if he were here, would say these materials have been proved scientifically to be safe, that there is no human risk if applied following label recommendation and, therefore, that they should be used.  My point is, if the consumer wants beef without these substances that is the end of the story.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Professor Raftery changed his mind in response to the <Col N="376" /> last point the Senator made.  I made that point to him many times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should have not referred to him because he is not here to defend himself.  However, it is fair to suggest he would have represented the point of view I described.</P>
      <P>If we are to progress with our food industry and develop its potential we must realise we have to serve the European market of 350 million people to raise the level of national economic activity.  We have a responsibility to provide that market with what it needs.  That is the basic point in this argument.  Possibly because of intervention there has been a degree of indifference to this.</P>
      <P>If we regarded ourselves as Ireland plc and equated ourselves with multinational companies in the European market, we would say we should be able to penetrate the market by an extra 1 per cent.  Any multinational corporation would proceed on that basis and should have the capacity to do so.  If we succeeded it would have an incalculable effect nationally.  It is hard to understand why it has been so impossible to achieve that market penetration.  One hopes some of the initiatives being spoken of at present will result in a move in the right direction.</P>
      <P>The Culliton report referred several times to this.  The Minister may not be aware of the debate in this House on the Industrial Development Bill and the degree to which we are actually implementing that report, or the Moriarty report on the Culliton report, or the Government's version of the Moriarty report on the Culliton report.  Unquestionably, the Culliton report showed the way to proceed and indicated the capacity of this industry to produce extra jobs and wealth.</P>
      <P>It also must be said clenbuterol involves a health risk for farmers and not merely the animals they are feeding.  In one case there is reasonably good evidence to suggest death from heart failure was a result of the use of this substance because it is a beta blocker and can affect the heart beat.  People must be aware of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> There is reference in the Bill to analytical procedures.  There is a continuing difficulty about the degree to which we can test for the presence of these substances. A liquid version of clenbuterol has now been developed.  How confident are we that the analytical procedures can prove the presence of illegal substances definitely enough to secure conviction?. The reason I ask is that the person who puts the knife in a carcase in the beef boning hall can tell imediately whether that carcase has been treated with clenbuterol or some other illegal substance, because the carcase will be tougher that it would be otherwise.  That is a very subjective assessment but it is nevertheless a very good one.  However, I believe we will have a difficulty in law in regard to detecting exactly what has been used.</P>
    <P>There is no problem securing a conviction where there has been a seizure. The necessary powers to carry out investigation leading to seizures of these substances are authorised by legislation, but what can be done about the withdrawal period?  What can be done to establish empirically, scientifically and independently that a carcase tested several weeks after it has been implanted was treated with this substance?  Analytical procedures have improved dramatically in recent years and we can now detect parts per million and parts per billion of some substances, but the people who are producing these substances have also become increasingly sophisticated in their ability to produce materials which can circumvent the law.  I am sure a second and a third generation clenbuterol-type substance will come into use and we must be confident we can address that problem.</P>
    <P>I have another question to which there has been almost no reference; it is in regard to fish and the substances used in salmon farming, in particular those used to control lice in salmon farms.  My understanding is that some of the substances used are very damaging to the environment.  I ask the Minister whether much thought has been given to the materials used in fish farming.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> I am not in favour of legalising the use of natural hormones, even though I accept the scientific evidence that they are safe, because in these matters the consumer decides.  When imposing penalties for these offences we must consider the value of the livestock.  One wagon of cattle is worth a lot of money.  We must consider the penalty in relation to the added value on that wagon of livestock. If one load of cattle is seized and there is enough publicity about it, that would stop much impropriety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Animal Remedies Bill, 1993.  The Minister, in bringing it before us, has done a great service for the country, the farmers, and the consumer.  He is just not talking about a serious problem, he is doing tackling it, and I am delighted about that.  This problem is so serious that if the Minister does nothing else during his term of office, he will be doing a very good job, and will have earned his salary and his pension.</P>
      <P>This legislation is very comprehensive. It covers the control of animals to which such remedies have been administered and the testing of food derived from such animals.  At present, farmers who do not play by the rules and who use these illegal growth promoters are at a great advantage compared to those who play the game according to the rules.  The people who are breaking the law are making a lot of money in this way.  The enhanced of enforcement for Garda and customs officers in detecting misuse of regulated remedies are necessary to protect the excellent reputation of Irish meat products at home and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill for stiffer penalties for persons found to have imported, sold or administered growth-promoting substances as regulated by the Bill.  I hope that some of the people who are caught &mdash; and I hope some of them will be caught soon &mdash; will be guests of the Minister in Portlaoise.  That would deter some farmers from using these substances. It is a matter of grave concern to Irish meat suppliers and consumers <Col N="379" /> that residues of animal remedies should remain in meat products.</P>
    <P>Angel dust, which we are told is used a lot, is a highly dangerous growth promoter. The hormone present in this substance can cause a heart attack if taken in sufficient quantities or if ingested by people with heart complaints, and there is evidence to suggest that a high intake of angel dust by pregnant women could result in permanent damage to the foetus. Hormonal imbalance caused by eating meat containing growth-promoting substances has caused premature adolescence in children elsewhere in Europe.</P>
    <P>Administering angel dust to a beast reduces the natural fat content and enhances it with lean meat and muscle. This Bill provides measures to deal with what amounts to a clandestine distribution network for drugs, which has been in operation in this country for some time, and if the Bill stops that it will be worth while.  Some people have said here today that only a tiny minority of herdowners are using this stuff, but it is a fairly substantial minority according to figures which I have.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry appointed a task force in 1990 to monitor nationwide figures of positive testing for angel dust.  By April 1991, only 97 herds had been tested out of a total of 150,000 herds.  More than 10 per cent of herds sampled tested positive for illegal substances at that time, which means that approximately 15,000 herdowners are using it, if those statistics were applied across the total number of herdowners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be the case.  Those herds examined were specifically targeted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>That is according to figures I have, and which I think are correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>Any group of farmers will say that use of these substances is <Col N="380" /> widespread.  The legal back-up needed by the Department officials to search for and confiscate angel dust is now provided for in this Bill, and is very necessary. Section 3 provides for the appointment by the Minister of an Animal Remedies Consultative Committee to advise and assist the Minister in the making of regulations under the Act.  I was delighted to hear the Minister say that all sections will be represented on this committee.  I hope the committee will be very competent because it has an important task.</P>
      <P>Section 4 requires the disclosure of the composition of animal remedies on the container or outer wrapper.  This must also be stated in the advertisement.  This will be very helpful as it will not be possible to mislead people about what they are buying.  Section 5 ensures that remedies are not advertised in a misleading way, Section 6 prohibits the possession of a remedy contravening the Bill; therefore, it will be illegal even to possess a substance prohibited under the Bill. Section 7 deals with an implied condition in any contract for sale that the animal or produce being sold was never treated with a remedy contravening the Bill.  That is good, although offences under this section could be difficult to prove. Section 11 outlines the powers of the customs officers, members of the Garda and officers authorised by the Minister to investigate where there is reason to suspect that an illegal animal remedy is being used.</P>
      <P>While I said at the beginning that this Bill is good and essential, I hope the necessary finance will be provided to implement it.  Otherwise it will be of no use.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, people who use these illegal growth promoters threaten the viability of our livestock and meat industry and their action could also have serious consequences for consumers.  The Minister is doing a good job in this case, and I support the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is welcome and necessary, because consumers must be satisfied that food comes from healthy animals.  For too long the use of products such as clenbuterol by unscrupulous <Col N="381" /> farmers has put lives at risk and has damaged an industry on which thousands of jobs depend.</P>
      <P>This legislation is being introduced because of the High Court judgment in the Tipperary case.  When I was in the Dáil I frequently raised these matters with Senator O'Kennedy who was Minister for Agriculture at the time.  It was obvious then that the use of angel dust was widespread, yet, the regulations to rectify this by ministerial order were found to be unconsitutional in the High Court.  The need for the Bill arises as a result of that judgment.</P>
      <P>As far as I can ascertain the Bill covers the matter well and deals stringently with the penalties to be imposed.  However, legislation is introduced too often as a reaction to court decisions and when this happens people rightly wonder who is in charge &mdash; is it the courts or those who the people elected to govern?  With the expertise of the Attorney General, the Law Reform Commission and a plethora of legal advisers, programme managers, public servants, <i>et al</i>, at its disposal surely the Government can be expected at least to abide by the law and the Constitution. However, this is yet another instance of the High Court ruling that the State acted unconstitutionally when it found that regulations brought in by the Minister to comply with an EC directive on veterinary products are invalid.  The first duty of any Minister is to ensure that regulations introduced do not contravene the Constitution.</P>
      <P>One area where it is clear that the existing approach has failed is in the control of the drug clenbuterol.  The illegal use of clenbuterol continues despite promises made in the Dáil and the pronouncements of some farming leaders. One wonders if the farming leaders know the extent of the abuse of the drug?  I would guess they do, but have not been forthright in their approach to the matter. Clenbuterol is still in use despite the media investigation, the extensive debates and the fact that a tribunal is investigating the meat industry.  This shows the gulf between expressions of concern and the reality on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> High standards in the meat industry is the catch-cry of the day; yet, the litany of criminal activities and scandalous disregard for the law is growing.  The reality was never more clearly exposed as recently when meat plants were on the point of closing their doors, not because of any failing on their part but because the Department had to cut back on the time spent by agricultural officers in those plants.  We are all aware of the dispute between the administrative staff and the agricultural officers in recent years.  The agricultural officers' work is to ensure standards are maintained and it was only when they refused to accept these cutbacks and threatened strike action that the matter was taken seriously.  I made the point on previous occasions that there must be agricultural officers who know what is going on in their areas and they have the responsibility to report to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Shoddy practices in our meat plants, along with the use of angel dust by unscrupulous farmers and the failure of the Department of Agriculture to stamp out this activity have done serious damage to our standing as a beef-producing country.  Clenbuterol is a lethal substance known to be a killer; it can destroy humans, animals and also public confidence.  Its continued use has led EC Commissioner Rene Stéichen to advise us to be ruthless in dealing with it.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner's statement follows a study carried out on abuses of the substance in member states.  It is regrettable he has chosen not to publish his findings. Too much secrecy does not serve the public well and we should know the extent of the problem in Ireland compared with other EC countries.  Otherwise, there is a danger of complacency in presuming that by bringing in stiff penalties the problem will somehow be resolved.</P>
    <P>We need to look at the international trade in angel dust and at those criminals at home who feed off a lucrative and lethal trade in drug abuse.  If our objective is to have a beef industry of the highest quality that can flourish in an increasingly competitive market, we will <Col N="383" /> need more than a law that penalises the use of illegal growth promoters and controls veterinary products.  We need an extensive, expert and up-to-date inspection process in every part of the meat business and I will continue to emphasise this.</P>
    <P>In the area of cold meats, for example, we need to provide full training for agricultural officers.  Generally, we need proper management of resources to ensure the budget is spent most effectively. The best return for money may be not to spend so much on expensive veterinary officers but to examine how that work could be done by technical staff and by more officers employed for the same overall cost; I was blue in the face from making that point when I was my party's spokesperson on agriculture in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report carried out a comprehensive study on the future development of the food industry.  However, the report of the expert group on this industry is not entirely in line with the proposals in the Culliton report.  One of the most glaring weaknesses of the expert study group's report is that the group did not include anyone representing consumer interests.  It was left to Senator Quinn, speaking in another forum, to raise that critical point.  The failure to recognise the central importance of the consumer may undermine opportunities to create jobs in the food sector.  I expected a report such as this to include a greater in-depth analysis of changing patterns of consumer demand.  Consultation with the broadest base possible is vital.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report argued the case for business-to-business sales and for providing food ingredients in line with the growth in prepared food.  The expert group argues for a different approach in relation to branding.  I believe there is a clear conflict between the two; both cannot be right.  If we are to assess the future needs of consumers we need to know much more about them.  The failure to include any consumer interests in the <Col N="384" /> expert group shows how underdeveloped is the Department's approach.</P>
    <P>If we are to survive, if economic development is to improve and if jobs are to be created, we must consider what we can produce, manufacture and sell. Change is taking place.  An important step forward would be to include consumer representatives in any future strategy relating to the food industry.  We have only recently realised that the consumer is central to food production.  For too long the producer has benefited from our position in the EC while the consumer has come out second best.</P>
    <P>In relation to veterinary products and additives in meat, it is clear that the overwhelming demand from consumers is for a chemical-free production.  Considerable lip service is paid to green products. However, in the Estimates for the Department of Agriculture and Food this year the allocation for the development of organic farming has been reduced by 5 per cent and this will be greater when inflation is taken into account.  It is extraordinary to reduce the allocation for an area which has a responsibility for expanding and developing a niche in the market.  A green approach must be built on a firm foundation of research and awareness of what the consumer wishes to buy rather than what we can produce.</P>
    <P>The Bill covers a wide range of animals and fish.  It controls the use of veterinary products and is part of the general EC trend to protect traditional agriculture against modern technological advances. At a time when the EC is trying to reduce output, the capability of biotechnology is to increase it.  The EC decision in 1988 to ban all growth hormones, including natural implants, was a result of consumer pressure.  However, there were also economic reasons for such a decision.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 to 15 are extensive and apply where there are infringements.  I agree with section 24 which refers to the penalties which can be imposed.  When this legislation is passed, I hope illegal growth promoters will not be used by those involved in our meat industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been critical of the apparent consensus about important legislation &mdash; that is, legislation which required detailed consideration &mdash; being passed quickly through the House.  For example, yesterday legislation passed through the House so quickly that it was completed when I returned from Cork. This time I am happy to welcome the consensus which is emerging in this House and I will not question it.</P>
      <P>I agree with what has been said to date.  However, I have some reservations particularly in relation to what Senator Sherlock said.  Our support for this legislation shows a common national interest. I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, for bringing this legislation before the House.  I have a personal interest in it.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to Senator Sherlock's speech.  I recall being criticised in the Dáil by some of Senator Sherlock's colleagues. It was said that if I, as Minister for Agriculture, was as enthusiastic about curbing the use of &ldquo;devil dust&rdquo; as I was about regulating the meat business and the meat trade generally, I might be doing my job.  I am glad Senator Sherlock does not share that view.  It was a rather strange criticism from people who did not offer any evidence to support the case they were making in relation to the beef industry.  They could make many allegations but they could not substantiate them.</P>
      <P>Consistency is important and I would like to think we are being consistent. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, his Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, and I are consistent in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we are introducing this legislation in advance of European Community regulations, which will be introduced by my old friend, Rene Stéichen, who I have known for many years.  He is a former Minister for Agriculture for Luxembourg and is now an EC Commissioner.  It is vitally important that we signal our EC colleagues and the consumers in Europe our concern about their preference and our determination to ensure that only regulations <Col N="386" /> calling for the highest standards will be implemented.</P>
    <P>Even if this legislation has not been introduced, we are still ahead of our EC colleagues in areas such as disease control, animal remedies, control of the channels of production and processing, etc.  It is important that this fact is known. We must maintain this pioneering position. We could not have done this without the diligence of all concerned, particularly the officials in the Department. Senator Sherlock seems to blame the Department; the Department is always a soft target.  People may refrain from attacking people of status&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department does not need my defence.</P>
      <P>I want to reassure Senator Sherlock, if he needs my reassurance, and Senator Townsend who used an extraordinary equation.  He said that if 10 per cent of cattle were tested and a certain number had traces of &ldquo;devil dust&rdquo;&mdash; I will not use the other euphemism; I never have and I never will &mdash; then one could multiply this number by ten.  From that he deduced that there must be 15,000 cases of affected cattle.  I am glad to say that is not the reality.</P>
      <P>A special investigation team was set up in the Department to target people suspected of using &ldquo;devil dust&rdquo;.  Information was obtained from various sources, including contacts on the ground.  However, no warning was given to people about visits by departmental officials.  I remember being told by one or two farmers in my constituency of North Tipperary that I was committing political suicide.  If that was the reason I lost my seat by a marginal number and why I am temporarily absent from the Dáil, I am proud of it.  However, I do not believe it was the reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before this legislation and the specific targeting of people who were suspected for one reason or another, only in one out of ten cases, or hardly even that number, was there found to be sufficient grounds <Col N="387" /> for prosecution, but in the event not all the prosecutions succeeded.  The incidence is minimal but all of us share the view that one case is one too many because of the enormous importance of the beef industry to the Irish economy. During my five years as Minister for Agriculture I often stressed to my colleagues in Brussels the unique importance of that industry to Ireland so that it would be clearly understood whenever we needed special concessions.  No other sector in any other economy in Europe compares with it and it is the justification for the action taken in this comprehensive legislation.</P>
    <P>Consumers at home and abroad can be reassured that the bulk of producers adhere to the standards.  I agree with Senator Dardis that with regard the small proportion of those who do not keep that standard, it is entirely inequitable and unacceptable that they should apparently gain advantage over those who adhere to it.  We are all at one in this matter.  We are determined to ensure that the majority of our producers, farmers and consumers will be protected and vindicated and that no small group will undermine the standard.</P>
    <P>From my experience as Minister I can say that wherever there is abuse and illegality the subversives will be involved. Despite the strict and severe controls that were in place they were able to smuggle this substance into the country.  That is a cogent argument to support the claim that any action taken to purchase this poison, for that is what it is, supports the cause of subversion, death and destruction. It would be one thing to see the death of our beef industry, which will not happen, but to help in bringing about death and destruction in other ways is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>This comprehensive legislation is excellent in its timing &mdash; as we are ahead of Europe &mdash; and in its content.  There were indications, minimal as they were, that some people who were purporting to be purchasers for the beef industry, and perhaps were agents for the industry, were advising farmers that they would do <Col N="388" /> better if they acquired and used some of this substance.  There may only have been a small number of these people but even that small number was such that it warranted the most severe reprimand to the industry from me as Minister for Agriculture. I called the heads of all the meat factories into my office and I am sure the memory of that day is still deeply embedded in the minds of all who were in the Department at the time because I think they could hear my rage and outrage in the corridors.  I told them that if I found out that any of their agents were promoting this substance, and I could only go on suspicion at that stage, I would insist that anything that could be done to put them out of business would be done.</P>
    <P>If there is any hint that buyers are promoting the use of this substance, and I believe there are a few who are irresponsible, then we should put them out of business.  I would be happy to see those few being the first to become guests of the nation under the terms of this legislation as they well and truly deserve it. We will not allow our bona fide producers and purchasers and the industry itself to be undermined by those who have no respect for it.</P>
    <P>In the light of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, I remember I spent more time than most arguing for special consessions for Irish beef producers on intervention and I always told the farm leaders that while I would stay at that task day and night I was not promoting a policy of production based on intervention.  I am glad that the market policy is now being advanced, vigorously as it was in those days also.  I was happy to hear recently from the chief executive of CBF, whom I met from time to time, that the initatives we took, for example, with Pavarotti in Italy, are now achieving results and that the market outlets in Spain and Italy are proving effective.  I hope the intervention requirement will diminish and the temptation, unjustifiable as it is, to use any of this substance to obtain a better grading will be diminished. That will be in addition to the penalties the Minister will introduce.</P>
    <P>This is a development of previously <Col N="389" /> introduced regulations in terms of controlling outlets, it strengthes the legislation and the existing position considerably.  Although it takes a little longer than one would wish &mdash; this legislation was in gestation when I was Minister &mdash; I am happy to see this Bill come through so quickly.  It is a matter of economic interest to the nation as opposed to some of the other legislation which is passed without adequate consideration. I compliment the Minister of State, farm producers generally and all responsibile parties involved, journalists and others. I hope we will continue to be seen as standard bearers in Europe.  That is the best guarantee we have for the prosperity of this important industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank all the Members who contributed to this debate. It has been constructive, objective and supportive of the Bill.  That was also the case in the Dáil where the Opposition parties tabled amendments that helped to strengthen the provisions contained in the original Bill.  I want to pay tribute to all sides for their positive contributions. I would also like to mention Senator O'Kennedy's contribution and to acknowledge that he sowed the seeds for this legislation during his term as Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Senators have spoken at length on the various sections of the Bill and I want to refer to some of the points made. I thank Senator Dardis for his positive contribution.  He referred to the numbers of offenders misusing illegal growth promoters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not want the record to show the Minister was referring to me when he was speaking of Senator D'Arcy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I apologise. I agree with the case made by Senator D'Arcy that there is not the widespread abuse which has been suggested by some Members, not in this House but in the Dáil.  Scare tactics have <Col N="390" /> not been adopted by Members of either House who spoke on the illegal use of the substances nor by officials of the Department where the matter has been kept under constant review.</P>
      <P>There has been an urgency about this issue from the moment this Bill was presented to the Dáil because I recognised that there was a serious threat to the image of the industry.  I wished it to be established at an early stage that strong and effective action was being taken to eliminate the abuse of the illegal growth promoters and other substances.</P>
      <P>Senators acknowledged the sincerity and anxiety of my Department to deal with the matter.  I wish to put on the record the level of support I have received from my officials who have worked long hours in assisting me to bring this Bill before this House in such a prompt manner.</P>
      <P>References were made to the rumours that illegal organisations may have been involved in the importation and distribution of these dreaded substances. However, there is no clear evidence available to the Department that subversive groups are involved.  If there is evidence to this effect, I appeal to Members to acquaint the Garda Síochána. It would be appalling and unacceptable if it transpired that not only was the industry being damaged by the feeding of these substances to animals but that subversive organisations were being supported.  This matter could be addressed if sufficient evidence was supplied to the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Senators spoke of the threat to the health, for example farmers, who have used these substances.  There have been many reports of people who lost their lives as a result of handling, using and administering these substances but there is no real evidence to this effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis referred to the commitment given by a previous Minister for Agriculture, Senator O'Kennedy, that a task force would be established to deal with offenders.  This task force was established and it has been successful.  Some 40 prosecutions have taken place as a result of the task force identifying those <Col N="391" /> farmers using these substances.  In addition, there are a number of cases pending for prosecution.  I want to advise the House that a strong line is being taken on these issues.</P>
    <P>Some of the matters raised by Senator Sherlock are under appeal in the Supreme Court and, therefore, I am not in a position to comment on them. However, I can advise that this Bill has been under preparation for some time and it is independent of the cases before the Supreme Court.  The Bill covers a wider range of activities than those affected by the High Court decision.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the fact, that this country is ahead of current EC regulations regarding when it comes provisions for the control of the illegal substances mentioned in this Bill.  With the enactment of this highly effective legislation this country is giving a positive commitment to the enforcement of the regulations in the legislation.  At the earliest opportunity, I will draw the attention of the European Commission to the fact that this country has implemented the most enlightened legislation, the EC for the purpose of controlling the illegal use of all kinds of substances administered to animals and for the purpose of protecting the food chain.</P>
    <P>It is important that this message is understood by the EC and that this country is given recognition for having taken this positive action.  This will enable the country to recreate the image of a clean, healthy environment for the production of livestock and food products.  I believe that is the only way forward.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to have discussions with farming interests and with the industry generally to get their assistance for the implementation of the regulations which this House is united in providing under legislation.  I believe that no matter how strong the legislative requirements, unless the support and co-operation of the farming community, farming organisations and the industry generally is obtained the success of these regulations will be qualified.</P>
    <P>It must be emphasised that it is a very <Col N="392" /> small number of offenders which this legislation seeks to address.  All necessary action must be taken, including the closing of all loopholes to prevent the importation of the product in the first instance and the breaking of the distribution chain.</P>
    <P>I hope farmers will acknowledge that the use of these substances, while in the past providing some financial gain in the short term, will be in the long term to the detriment of the industry with a consequential loss of farm income.  Since farmers have most to lose, it is important that they understand the necessity and the significance of the provisions in this Bill.  It is important also that consumers recognise the positive efforts being made on this issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis referred to the products used on fish and salmon farms.  This has been recognised as a problem in relation to what could be a very high grade and profitable aspect of agri-business. Provision is being made in this Bill to address this aspect of the abuse of illegal substances.</P>
    <P>The possible incentive that existed for farmers to administer illegal substances in relation to the grading system and to the operation of intervention was raised by Senator Kelleher.  Of course, we now know that there have been fairly drastic changes in relation to intervention and, hopefully, in future both production and sales will be geared to the marketplace as distinct from seeking the easy outlet and option of putting meat into intervention.</P>
    <P>We should spend more money &mdash; and I say this quite openly &mdash; promoting our exports and increasing the potential market that exists within the broader European Community for Irish products.  I recently spent two days in Germany on matters relating to rural development and while there I availed of the opportunity to visit a few large supermarkets in the Ruhr valley where 5.5 million people are living &mdash; about the same population on the entire island of Ireland.  I was disappointed to discover very little evidence of any quality Irish products.  I <Col N="393" /> had to search the shelves to get the two obvious ones you would find in most supermarkets throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>There is still a lot of potential for promoting quality Irish products, and I deliberately use the word &ldquo;quality&rdquo;.  The only way we can talk about quality is if it can be clearly established that our food is produced in a healthy, clean, open, rural, agrigultural environment and that there is no misuse of the kind of substances we are dealing with in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher made the point that the grading system should be looked at because it is encouraging farmers to use these substances.  The European Commission has responded by introducing the carcase weight restriction of 340 kilos to which we all object in terms of allowing our farmers to produce beef by the most economic means possible.  I do not have to tell Members that we resisted, in every way we could, the efforts of the Commission to restrict the carcase weight to 340 kilos.  It is well established that part of the reason behind the introduction of that weight limitation was the fact that a lot of the beef which went into intervention, for example, was assisted by artificial growth promoters.  That is, and has been, a factor and we cannot deny it, but I acknowledge that the restriction is difficult for beef producers.  Hopefully, in time we will be able to address that matter, but only where it can be clearly established that we have entirely and permanently banned the use of these substances from food production.</P>
    <P>I think that I have addressed most of the points raised in this debate.  I want to avail of the opportunity to thank Members for their positive contributions and I hope that within a short time, next week in fact, we will have this Bill on our Statute Book.  I want to assure the House that from thereon I will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure its full implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to return to the House to report on the amendments been made to the Bill since it was first debated here on 15 and 16 June.  As Senators will recall, there was at that time a very full and open debate on the matters in the Bill.  It was very gratifying that what was essentially an enabling Bill provoked such a wide-ranging and well informed debate on the future of industrial policy.  I thank the Members of this House again for the positive spirit in which they approached the debate on the Bill.</P>
      <P>A number of issues arose out of the Department's ongoing consultations with the industrial development agencies and the other Departments which have responsibilities in this area and the amendments before the House today are a result of that consultation.  They are few in number but they are necessary in order to strengthen, refine and clarify the Bill in a number or areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 1 is to ensure that the existing IDA and Eolas legislation remains fully in force until the new bodies are established.  Without this <Col N="396" /> amendment the repeals contained in the Third Schedule would come into force as soon as the new Act was signed and this would deprive the IDA of all powers contained in the First Schedule to the Industrial Development Act, 1986. These include such matters as the composition and powers of the Authority, powers in relation to contracts and instruments and the production of an annual report and accounts.  By tying the repeals to the establishment day, we are ensuring that there is a smooth transition between the new and old legislation.  In fact, this is plain good housekeeping.  It means there will be no gaps, no intervening period, when one wonders who is responsible for what or who produces what.  There will be a smooth transition from the old to the new.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5, relate to sections 7 and 8.  They are to allow IDA (Ireland) and Forbairt to administer schemes which involved EC moneys coming from Central Fund direct to the agencies.  A feature of the Structural Funds in recent years has been a growing number of Community initiatives which the EC Commission formulates and promulgates itself.  Examples include Prisma, certification and training, and Retex, a programme to develop new industry in areas where traditional industries have been in decline.  Forbairt and IDA (Ireland) will now be involved in administering these schemes but the funding for them will not come through their grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>Another development under the Structural Funds is the direct co-financing by the Commission of schemes involving a contribution from industry.  An example of this is the &ldquo;Measure 6&rdquo; industry, research and development scheme under the Department's science and technology sub-programme.  In this scheme, grants of up to 50 per cent are paid to companies undertaking product or process development projects.  The company contributions is regarded by the EC Commission as matching funds for the purposes of recoupment and, as a result, there is no net cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>At present, this scheme is being operated <Col N="397" /> in its pilot phase by a firm of external consultants.  Under the next round of Structural Funds, however, the scheme will be administered by Forbairt and IDA (Ireland).  The House will, no doubt, be aware the IDA's functions are very precisely specified in the existing Acts and these predate the new Structural Funds regulations.  At present there is no provision which would allow the agencies to administer schemes such as those referred to above.  The new function will provide this facility.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of this new function will also provide a legislative basis to allow the Community contribution to the business innovation fund to be handled by Forbairt.  This will allow the IDA to contribute to the seed capital fund operated by the Dublin Business Innovation Centre and will help Forbairt increase its shift from grants to equity as recommended by the Culliton report.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 6 is to include a reference to the SFADCo Act, 1970 as this delegates certain IDA grant-giving powers to SFADCo and thus needs to be referred to in the new legislation. The text of the relevant section of the 1970 Act is as follows: &ldquo;4.&mdash; (1) ... the Authority may delegate to the Company some or all of such powers as the Authority may have to provide financial assistance to or in respect of an industrial undertaking ... and the Company may exercise any such powers so delegated&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 relates to section 12.  The purpose of this section is to make Government approval mandatory for substantial capital grant packages in excess of £2.5 million.  The types of grants covered by the limit are set out in section 34 of the Industrial Development Act, 1986.  However, the grants to which the £2.5 million limit applies are not actually made under section 34 but under sections referred to in section 34 of the Act.  This amendment clarifies the position.  The relevant sections referred to in section 34 of the 1986 Act are as follows: section 21, fixed assets; section 22, fixed assets which are leased; section 23, reduction of interest on a loan raised to pay for fixed <Col N="398" /> assets and section 24, loan guarantees for the purchase of fixed assets.</P>
    <P>The next section which was amended in the Dáil was section 17 which deals with stamp duty.  Amendment No. 8 corrects a typographical error which was only discovered after the Bill had been passed by this House.  The relevant section is in the Finance Act, 1895 and not 1985 as was originally stated in the Bill.  Amendment No. 9 amends the First Schedule.  This amendment relates to disclosure of interest and has been moved to strengthen the provisions of the section by covering not just interests in industrial undertakings but all business undertakings. The second Schedule refers to staff.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 was moved to satisfy the detailed requirements of the superannuation section in the Department of Finance.  Essentially, the objective of the amendment is to ensure that Forfás has the power to prepare and submit new schemes of superannuation, that there is a clear and unequivocal statement that the provisions in the existing legislation governing the superannuation schemes currently in operation &mdash; and indeed any new schemes made by Forfás &mdash; remain fully in force and that Forfás may amend or revoke any schemes which are carried over from the dissolved agencies.  Of course, this would only be done if a new consolidated scheme were being put in place but it has the right to do so.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 relates to the Third Schedule.  This is related to the previous amendment and provides for the retention of those elements of the superannuation provisions in the 1986 Act which it had previously been intended to repeal.  The repeals were originally proposed when the relevant sections were being restated in the new Act.  By and large, that is a factual reporting of the amendments &mdash; mainly technical in nature &mdash; which came through the Dáil.  I think the amendments add clarity and sort out matters which were raised in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to <Col N="399" /> the amendments which were made in the other House, except to say the following. We have now the new Industrial Development Bill, 1993, and I would like to think &mdash; although I know, unfortunately, it is not the case &mdash; that this would provide answers to the real problems and the people who are unemployed.</P>
      <P>The Bill was initiated in the Seanad and we discussed amendments but there are new headings in the Bill which give a number of people the opportunity to work under a new department whether it be Forfás or IDA (Ireland).</P>
      <P>People must be reassured and encouraged to invest in and start up new businesses. The people I have been speaking with over the last number of weeks do not seem to think the confidence is there. I do not believe that changing the headings is going to improve that position greatly unless the county enterprise boards are given the powers and finance to help small businesses which previously had not been in a position to receive assistance to provide jobs locally.  There is an overall acceptance that real jobs can be created in small industries.</P>
      <P>In finalising the Report Stage of this Bill and accepting the amendments from the other House, there is a crying need to get rid of the red tape but I am not convinced that the new proposals will do that.  We were given a commitment that we will have the opportunity to review progress.  I would like to think we will not have to wait three years to do that but that we will have the opportunity to do so within one year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment which relates to EC funds is welcome, particularly the change from a system of grants to one of equity.  A point made many times in the past was that we had a system of grants being given to companies. If a company did not succeed, the money was lost but with an equity system, there is some return for the State and the money can be reinvested in other industries.  I support the shift from an almost total reliance on grants to the <Col N="400" /> system where the State puts in equity and gets something back from successful companies.</P>
      <P>I would also like to comment on the amendment dealing with the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  I am pleased to see that this has been specifically included because in the region from which I come, we consider that the regional policies developed through the Shannon Free Airport Development Company have been very successful.  The policies, in many ways, set an example of regionalism in this country at a time when the concept of regional development was in its infancy.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied overall that this is a practical response to the need to streamline the organisation of industrial development through the agencies of Forfás, Forbairt, IDA (Ireland) and the county development boards.  The role of the county enterprise officer will be crucial in this area and in directing industries to the agency which is relevant to their size and needs.  There is obviously a connection between the roles of the various agencies and the umbrella role of Forfás will be crucial in ensuring that the area operates efficiently.  I welcome the fact that there will be constant monitoring to ensure the operation is effective.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Bill was initiated in this House and I also welcome the Report Stage amendments.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Minister of State for clarifying the amendments.  I was confused before I came in, but her speech has clarified matters for me.  However, I am somewhat bemused by the number of agencies we now have.  I hope I am not particularly dense but I find their connection rather difficult to understand.  I am glad Senator O'Sullivan thinks it is streamlining the procedure. I hope it is, and I hope that the relationships between the agencies, as well as the agencies themselves, are carefully monitored because I would hate to think that the main activity was within these agencies, rather than creating employment.  I agree with previous <Col N="401" /> speakers that monitoring the situation is essential.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with my collegues in welcoming the detailed and comprehensive analysis the Minister of State has given to us.  The amendments will significantly improve the Bill.  When it was introduced here I expressed reservations, and Senator Henry has also pointed this out, in relation to the precise role of the agencies and the risk of confusion arising from increased agencies and their interrelationship. My enthusiasm for this Bill is to say the least, limited for that reason. I endorse its purpose but it will be seen in time that the fewer agencies we have, tightly controlled by the responsible Ministers &mdash; and the Minister of State herself was one such Minister &mdash; the better we are guaranteed to have an effective support system.</P>
      <P>Now that we are talking, in terms of the disbursement of EC Structural Funds &mdash; and there seems to be some doubt at this point as to the extent of the funding which we will receive but I will reserve anything I wish to say on that matter for a later date &mdash; the role of the agencies will become more important.  I have an instinctive belief that what the Minister for State has persuasively presented to us does not have her wholehearted enthusiastic endorsement either.  I had the privilege of serving with her in Government and I know her precise and direct effectiveness.</P>
      <P>I belong to the school that says that Ministers have responsibility and that agencies are answerable to Ministers. There should be no doubt as to which Minister is responsible.  In some cases here, two different Departments and two different Ministers will be supervising or directing an agency.  That said, I welcome the amendments and the comprehensive explanation which the Minister of State has given.  I hope my apprehensions about this Bill are not proved correct and that we have a better result than I anticipate.</P>

      <P>
        <Col N="402" /> I wish to reply briefly and to thank Senators for their contributions. Senator Farrelly questioned whether this Bill would change matters and queried whether there would be sufficient finance for the county enterprise partnership boards.  With regard to his reservations about the Bill itself, I think that the clear focus given to each of the agencies, Forbairt for indigenous industry and IDA (Ireland) for mobile investment and multinationals, will give each the chance to design a plan of action.  I hope that will happen following the break-up of the conglomerate IDA into the two agencies.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Quinn, and I have spoken in this House about the people who contributed to the Culliton report and the economic writers from whom the ideas were drawn.  We referred to Richard Pascale who wrote <i>Managing on the Edge</i>, which is about business and the &ldquo;split and fit&rdquo; axiom.  An agency which is allowed to continue in its original format in many cases loses its original impetus, it loses its <i>raison d'être.</i>  I am not trying to make the &ldquo;split and fit&rdquo; formula an umbrella for everything, but in many cases it can facilitate the adaptation that is necessary to meet changing circumstances in the economy and the developmental needs of industry, such as the break-up proposed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the county enterprise partnership boards, they have been allocated money in the Estimate and they will have the immediacy and intimacy with the people who seek their services which is not always possible with a regional organistion.  We hear a lot about devolution.  It seems sometimes that Members of the House speak about devolution only when we want to; when we do not want to talk about subsidiarity and devolution, we put the idea to one side.  There is nothing more in keeping with the concept of subsidiarity or devolution than the country system of accountability. I think the county enterprise partnership boards will fit very neatly into <Col N="403" /> the &ldquo;split and fit&rdquo; context I mentioned.

      <P>We will talk about that on another day.  I assure Senator Farrelly that he will find the county enterprise partnership boards responsive to the needs of people who have ideas about business and services in the county.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Sullivan welcomed the move from grants to equity.  It was proposed in the Culliton report, and endorsed by Moriarty, that there be a greater shift from grants to equity.  The proposed objective was in the region of 50 per cent.  We cannot go overboard about everything, as the Senator rightly observed, because equity suits some industries and not others.  There is a general move towards equity, which is correct, because equity brings with it responsibilities and moves away from an over-reliance on grants.  The Senator was glad to see SFADCo highlighted in the amendments which came through the Dáil, and she welcomed the monitoring system which we promised when we spoke here on the Bill; we said that if faults arose we would not be afraid to admit it and see what could be done in the Bill to correct them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to thank Senator Henry for her comments about clarifying matters. However, she professed she was confused about the streamlining.  I think that large organisations, by their nature, grow in size and create within themselves a huge bureaucracy.  Returning to the &ldquo;split and fit&rdquo; theory, I think it is good for an agency to examine its operations. This agency will now be split in two and IDA (Ireland) and Foirbairt will have <Col N="404" /> clear objectives.  The job of Forbairt is to encourage indigenous industry in every way possible, to link with the county enterprise partnership boards, to encourage creativity, to examine goods, manufacturing and services for which the county enterprise partnership boards will also have responsibility.  The job of IDA (Ireland) is to sell Ireland as a base for industry, as a country with strong educational and training resources and as a country with a good environment in which industries can develop.  Forfás, far from being a rival agency, will have a unifying effect and will co-ordinate the strands in the other agencies because there will be elements in each of the agencies which will require such co-ordination.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy &mdash; whose opinions I respect &mdash; has a history of civic commitment and public service which, I hope, will continue in the other House. Indeed, I wish all the Members good look in that quest.  The Senator takes the view that there should be as few agencies as possible and that agencies are no substitute for ministerial responsibility.  I agree because there is no doubt that the buck must stop at the Minister's office. However, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, made it very clear when he addressed the Seanad on this issue that he would not abdicate responsibility for the agencies. He is not that type of person.  He intends to keep control and, in common with the political and administrative personnel in the Department, he will have an interventionist role.  For a time the word &ldquo;intervention&rdquo; was frowned on and it was considered wrong to be an interventionist. In fact, an interventionist was cast in the role of a busybody.</P>

      <P>The wheel has come round and intervention, in the correct sense, is strongly admired by Ministers. The Minister, Deputy Quinn, the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, and I, in our respective areas of responsibility, have no intention of giving the agencies a free rein.  I am sure this will be bad news when they read it in the Official Report but it is necessary that there be a political responsibility for the conduct of agencies as the politician is obliged to answer questions from Members of the Oireachtas and the media about issues that affect the agencies.</P>
      <P>It is easy to advise that the agencies be given time to find their feet.  To a certain extent that is necessary but it is equally necessary that they be monitored and guided.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, believes, as I do, that there should be an interventionist approach in this regard, and certainly in the early stages in the development of the agencies.  I remember one occasion when I was in the Department of Education a furore arose over a particular policy.  I was obliged to go on television that night to explain myself.  It is not a question of the agencies coming back with their reports after 12 months; they must be monitored at all times.</P>
      <P>The agencies are only a small element of the recommendations of the Culliton report and the Moriarty task force. Senator O'Kennedy knows this as he was a member of the Government when Deputy O'Malley presented the Culliton report to the Cabinet.  The Bill had to be introduced because the changes required legislative reform.  However, there are many more recommendations in the Culliton report &mdash; roads, ports, finance, structural reform, telecommunications, training and education, that must be tackled.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment has clearly outlined its response to the Moriarty task force and how it intends to implement these recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Culliton said there was no quick fix, that even if all his recommendations could be implemented in the morning &mdash; and obviously structural reforms cannot be that instant &mdash; they would make only <Col N="406" /> a very small dent in the unemployment problem on which we must focus.  This Bill is a beginning.  The structural reforms of the agencies are important but they are just part of an overall strategy of Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following definition:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="407" />&ldquo;&lsquo;solicits or importunes&rsquo; means the persistent and unwelcome offer of financial reward for sexual services or the persistent and unwelcome offering of sexual services for financial reward;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is curious that a Bill, whose principal intention is to decriminalise sexual activity between males in private should start with a series of definitions of &ldquo;motor vehicle&rdquo;, &ldquo;public place&rdquo; and &ldquo;street&rdquo; and although there purports to be a definition of &ldquo;soliciting&rdquo;, there is not in fact.  All it says is: &ldquo;solicits or importunes includes soliciting or importuning from or in a motor vehicle, and cognate words shall be construed accordingly;&rdquo;.  I feel it was important we should have a definition in law of what it meant to solicit or importune.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I feel it is important that we recognise this difficulty is the experiences in the United Kingdom and America where vague provisions regarding soliciting and importuning have been employed by the police to engage in the provocation of crime.  They send police persons out as <i>agents provocateurs</i> and there are policies of entrapment in certain metropolitan jurisdications in both countries that are well documented.  I felt it was useful, for the purposes of this Bill, to define soliciting or importuning as: &ldquo;the persistent and unwelcome offer of financial reward for sexual services or the persistent and unwelcome offer of sexual services for financial reward&rdquo;.  That covered the aspect of nuisance to the public in both directions.  It means that if a prostitute offers his or her services in an unwelcome, displeasing or offensive way, he or she is guilty of that offence or, alternatively, if a potential client harasses someone offering sexual services, they are equally guilty.</P>
    <P>The amendment is not intended to be obstructive but it would be helpful and, in particular, would obviate the possibility of entrapment, although I have to say at this point that my experience of the police is this area is good.  The Garda have a good relationship with the gay community; once or twice there have been some glitches when there have been <Col N="408" /> murders and there has been a widespread trawl for information, which included the gay community but by and large relations are good and civilised.  This definition is useful and is in the context of a Bill which begins with definitions such as streets, motor vehicles, etc.  I will not be flippant. For that reason, I have not tabled additional amendments, including offences taking place from or within motorcycles, combine harvesters, skates or other means of conveyance.  This is a serious matter and it is rather odd that we begin with definitions of motor cars, streets, etc.</P>

      <P>I will not delay, I do not intend to be obstructive.  However, there is a pattern in a number of European <Col N="409" /> countries of young male prostitutes, many under 17 years of age; I could instance places and cities where they can be found.  Will we treat young male prostitutes in the same punitive way as we treat others of mature age?  I certainly do not want to be seen as promoting activities of young male prostitutes. However, because of their age and immaturity perhaps we could recognise this in an appropriate section or amendment.</P>

      <P>I understand Senator O'Kennedy's concerns, but I would like to see such a section restricted to young male prostitutes.  Many female prostitutes are extremely young; some are only 14, 15 and 16 years of age.  If the Minister introduces legislation in this regard, it should not exclude young female prostitutes.  This Bill is gender neutral and I hope both sexes are included in any new section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to legalise many of the public manifestations of prostitution and, as such, I regret is unacceptable. I have explained in both Houses that prostitution is not illegal. What transpires in private between consenting adults is no business of the criminal law.  The law must be concerned with the nuisance and annoyance caused by the public face of prostitution which is, in effect, soliciting, importuning or loitering for the purposes of prostitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Norris' amendment would remove entirely the protection given by the law to persons living in areas frequented by prostitutes.  Prostitutes could offer their services in public with inpunity and clients, including kerb crawlers, could wander around an area at their ease.  Noise, rows and violence could continue throughout the night.  Littering in gardens and streets would bear witness to the night's activities.  It is not a pretty picture but it is what happens in areas where prostitutes and their clients congregate to do business.  I am not sure whether the amendment would protect women who are not prostitutes from being accosted.  Such a woman would <Col N="410" /> have to be prepared to give evidence in court and experience shows that persons annoyed, frightened or harassed in that way are unlikely to go to court.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in its report on vagrancy and related offences argued against the concept of persistence. They pointed out that a man who accosts a woman in an area known to be frequented by prostitutes in the belief that she is one, only to find she is not, is unlikely to be persistent.  Nevertheless, the annoyance caused to the woman in question is likely to be considerable. The element of persistence is designed to ensure against the possibility of a person being arrested by mistake. The requirement in sections 7 and 8, that the solicitation must be for the purposes of prostitution and not just an ordinary sexual advance is sufficient safeguard. Therefore, it is unlikely that women who are not prostitutes who are accosted for the purposes of prostitution would be protected by the amendment, despite the fear caused to them by such accosting.</P>
    <P>If I accepted the amendment, I would be failing in my duty as Minister for Justice to protect a section of the community against the considerable nuisance of solicitation in areas where people live, visit or pass through.  For that reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy raised a valid point.  It was raised in the Dáil last week and has since been spoken about publicly. The Second Commission on the Status of Women made recommendations in relation to the way we treat prostitution. They made strong recommendations in relation to the cooperation of three specific Departments &mdash; the Department of Health, the Department of Justice and the Department of Education.  Although they did not suggest the establishment of a task force, they were concerned that all three Departments should be involved in this area.  By working together, a programme of rehabilitation and support could be initiated for young male and female prostitutes coerced into becoming involved in prostitution.  I know Senator O'Kennedy <Col N="411" /> wants both young male and female prostitutes involved in this process.</P>
    <P>The Government has accepted the recommendation of the Second Commission for the Status of Women.  I have given a commitment to both Houses that the three Departments will consider how best to implement that recommendation, rather than introducing legal provisions. By combining the three Departments we can help those involved in the situation outlined by Senator O'Kennedy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her clear answer, although I do not agree with all aspects of her reply.  She has certainly reassured me on the points that caused me concern; for example, I was concerned that the ordinary social relationship of chatting to someone in a public house might be construed as solicitation.  Either in case law or by definition, there must be a definition of soliciting, otherwise I am not sure how this was arrived at.  However, I am happy to withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>I refer to Senator O'Kennedy's sensitive and appropriate intervention on the question of young males and females involved in prostitution.  Senator O'Kennedy seemed to suggest that this was a phenomenon confined to continental Europe or England.  Sadly, this situation has existed in this country for many years. One of the difficulties faced by the gay movement through the Hirschfeld Centre was the fact that groups of boys ranging from ten to 18 years of age infested the Dublin quays.  Many were not homosexuals; they were victims of broken homes, of abuse in the home, or alcoholism of parents or other social problems and they were cast out on the streets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This made it virtually impossible for us because we could not reach out to them, much as we recognised the social problem, because we felt we <Col N="412" /> would be stigmatised by the tabloid press as being involved in this.  If the Minister has suggestions as to how this can be addressed by State agencies we would welcome that.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak on the section in view of the Minister's response to a query I raised.  I am happy to note that there will be co-ordination between the Departments most appropriately involved, and that is very important. Having said that, I still have to take note of the fact that there is no legislative provision as of now that will distinguish between young prostitutes of the ages Senator Norris mentioned, be they male or female.  Under the law as we will pass it, they would be subject to the same sanction of the law as would mature people who engaged in prostitution and would be guilty of the proposed offences. I am concerned about this.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the coordination between the Departments of Justice, Health and Education and the advisory services will do everything possible to ensure that those young people, of whatever sex, will not be trapped in this unfortunate condemnation of life prospects.  I am equally concerned that if they are for the time being so trapped, despite the help we would like to provide for them in the nature of services, they would not be treated in the same fashion because they are of immature capacity due to their age.  What will happen between now and the time the various Departments co-ordinate their activities in this area?  This Bill as I see it, although I would like to be told I am wrong, does not distinguish between young people of ten, 12 or 14 years of age and others of mature age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Kennedy will have the opportunity to support our amendments which might go some way <Col N="413" /> towards assisting the situation by reducing fines or making allowance for their reduction or imposing community service orders.  He may not find it possible to support them but it is a potential possibility.</P>
      <P>Under age prostitution is tragic.  Sometimes it is engaged in not solely for financial reward.  These are very isolated and lonely people and although they may not wish primarily for sexual satisfaction from the men they engaged with, they are often looking for affection from an older person, shelter for the night and some degree of kindness.  It is a comment on our society that people should be placed in such a perilous and neglected situation.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to the extraordinary work of people like Fr. Peter McVerry in Ballymun and the inner city who have shown the proper face of what I would understand Christianity to be.  If there is any funding available I think he would be one of the people most suitable to get this funding.  I say this particularly because he has a very high reputation, he has been involved in this area for a number of years and would not have the difficulties that organisations like the one I have been involved with would have.</P>
      <P>When we were approached by the leaders of some of these young people we had great difficulty because of the misinterpretation and the misconstruction that could have been placed on any intervention by us.  We also had to be aware of the fact that in social situations within the Hirschfeld Centre, if we included people who habitually worked as prostitutes we would be exposing the decent members of our community to another kind of risk.  In one or two circumstances where the people were not of a particularly young group and where we were convinced they were gay themselves, we allowed them to be included in some of the activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad to be able to tell the House that one of them is now a sucessful businessman.  This is somebody who came to us when he was about 17 years old and was a hardened prostitute who came from a very difficult background of <Col N="414" /> a broken home in the inner city.  He has now made a life for himself.  I think it is remarkable if such people can be assisted and taken off the streets where they are selling themselves.  Nowadays they are extremely vulnerable to drugs.  Anything the Minister can do in this matter would be very much welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Minister to do everything she can in this area because it is one where we can make progress.  As Senator Norris said, many of these young prostitutes are homeless.  Why are they homeless?  A considerable number of them come not only from broken homes but have run away from homes where there has been child sexual abuse. Almost 95 per cent of the women involved in prostitution have been the subjects of child sexual abuse.  One can discuss this with the Rape Crisis Centre because they have tried to take positive action in this area.  If these people run away from home they have three options: they can beg, steal or become involved in prostitution.  They already have a very low opinion of their own worth from a sexual point of view.  Having been involved in abuse without payment, it is easy for them to continue being involved in abuse with payment.</P>
      <P>I am disgusted at the campaign that has been mounted against the Stay Safe programmes in the schools.  I am astonished at this opposition.  There is yet another article in the newspapers today expressing inability to understand it. Have the people who oppose the programme read it?  I do not see how any parent could object to it.  It is wrong to say that most child sexual abuse is perpertrated by people from outside the family.  This is not so.  Our figures for the incidence of such abuse are similar to other countries.  I urge the Minister for Education &mdash; and I have written to her about this matter &mdash; to keep encouraging this programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children are entitled to protection.  If we, as adults, have to tell them how to protect themselves it is of the utmost importance that they should learn that any sexual interference, no matter from <Col N="415" /> whom, is unacceptable.  I cannot understand why anyone would not try to help a child protect himself or herself.  Statistics are constantly being produced which show the effect of sexual abuse on young people.  It is to our great distress that we see them drifting into prostitution because they have so little value for their own physical and sexual integrity and their own bodies.  Their attitudes is &ldquo;I was not paid for it before but I am being paid for it now&rdquo;.  I urge the Minister to do what she can to alleviate this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment was disallowed because it was declaratory in nature.  The Minister said she was bringing in legislation that was in accordance with the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and that pimps and male clients of prostitutes will be treated the same as the women involved.  She accepted the commission's recommendation of an integrated approach involving the Departments of Health, Education and Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that we should be dealing with prostitutes in this Bill.  Everybody accepted that this is dealing mainly with homosexuality and it is unfortunate that prostitutes are mentioned in this legislation.  I would like to have seen the measures the commission recommended set in place before this legislation was enacted because of the effect it will have on women.  The commission recommended &mdash; and the Minister accepted &mdash; an integrated approach involving the various Departments.  It also recommended the establishment and funding of drop-in centres which would provide short term accommodation as well as opportunities for self-help and building the self-esteem of women.  It should also involve relief from isolation, informal education and advice and medical and social assistance.  These are measures Senator Henry, Senator Norris and Senator O'Kennedy would support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been assured by the Minister this will happen but we cannot be sure. Today we are voting on a provision which implements part of what the commission <Col N="416" /> recommended but we have no assurance the other recommendations will be introduced. Those developments would be ones I would like to see: the rehabilitation of prostitutes, of women who feel they must become involved in prostitution because they are homeless or in poverty.  That is why this amendment was tabled but it has been disallowed.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments because I fear this will be forgotten and nothing will happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The House wishes the Minister to reply on the substantive point relating to the position of young immature prostitutes be they male or female, when this legislation is enacted.  I will comment on what has been said by my colleagues because the impression abroad is that the majority of sexual abuse occurs in the home.  We must be careful when saying that.  It may be the case but we must also acknowledge that happy and warm relationships exist in the majority of homes in Ireland.  This is true between parents and children, and also uncles, aunts and other relations.  That is the pattern of Irish life.</P>
      <P>When we say most abuse of young people arises within the home, there is a risk that bona fide affection between uncles and nephews may be seen by young people as requiring caution.  They may decide they must be wary of a particular member of the family.  We must signal here we are confident that the pattern of life, of affection shown towards young people in the vast majority of homes in Ireland, will continue and will be encouraged by us.  There should be no taint of doubt or apprehension in the young.  There may be exceptional cases to be wary of but we should not give the impression it is the pattern throughout what is generally a happy society.</P>

    <P>My second point relates to males or females forced into prostitution through homelessness.  I do not disagree this is one of the main factors propelling them into this way of life.  However from my observations in various European cities in which I have lived and worked, not all young prostitutes are forced into the <Col N="417" /> trade because of homelessness or leaving unhappy homes.  If one visits certain arcades in Milan, Paris or Rome one sees young people dressed in a style which does not suggest they are products of broken homes.  They may be drawn in by people who have little concern for their welfare and may be kept in comfortable surroundings.  The pattern is not that prostitution exclusively involves the poor, although we must have special concern for them.  Many who do not come from broken or impoverished homes are also in danger.</P>

      <P>Very few people enter prostitution voluntarily, without strong social or financial pressure.  This is an enormous worldwide industry and women are being sold in parts of Asia.  It is a revolting, appalling traffic and a real reproach to us all as members of the world community.</P>
      <P>I return to an extremely valuable development mentioned by Senator Henry, the &ldquo;Stay Safe&rdquo; programme in schools.  At the moment there is a consistent campaign to undermine it, which is quite wicked.  The methods being used are dishonest and scurrilous and the usual connection exists with right-wing American agencies.  Many years ago when I started the campaign for homosexual law reform I was accused of being part of an international conspiracy funded by New York Jewish money.  I wish that had been true.  It is certainly true that agencies in the USA committed to profoundly right-wing philosophies are exporting their lies to this country.  There is a campaign in which possibly well motivated Irish people are involved and Fintan O'Toole's article in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning frighteningly exposes this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can look at the language used, if I recall, by an Irish person, a lecturer in philosophy in one of our universities.  He said children were being encouraged to report these attacks, even if they were carried out by the father.  That almost implied if the father was responsible it involved a certain <i>droit de seigneur</i> and that a parent was entitled to make the <Col N="418" /> first sexual advances on his own child. That is not tolerable.</P>
    <P>At a gathering at UCC in February this statement was made by a lecturer in philosophy in one of our universities: I am glad to say it is not the one which employs me:</P>
    <P>Children are being told to tell teachers if anyone interferes with them, even if it is their father.  This is a direct attack on parental responsibility.</P>
    <P>That, in my humble opinion, is taking that much abused term &ldquo;family solidarity&rdquo; to an utterly unacceptable extreme.  Simply because one is a biological parent one is apparently given by these &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; people a licence to molest one's own children.  No rational or decent person would support this attitude.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will pass on to her colleague our concern in this area.  As Senator Henry has indicated, this is the sort of situation which can create prostitution among children who are abused. She quoted the felicitous turn of phrase used to her by a young woman: &ldquo;I wasn't paid for it once but I'll be paid for it now&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These people speak of a hidden agenda in education and denounce the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Child as a secular humanist plot.  The names of these organisations are interesting as well.  One is called PASS, Parents Against Stay Safe.  Such people should be told that expressing these views is highly dangerous and in a real sense is subversive of the best values of the family of which Senator O'Kennedy spoke.</P>
    <P>Of course, the majority of families in this country provide a decent positive environment for children to grow up safely but we must also legislate for the vulnerable.  I am tired of easy phrases like &ldquo;family solidarity&rdquo;.  I also resent making an icon of the family as an institution. Then, when the word is invoked, no matter how rotten a family may be we cannot intervene.  One need only instance the Kilkenny incest case to make this point perfectly clear.</P>

      <P>When Senator Norris says he is tired of making an icon of the family as an institution, I remind him it has been elevated to the status of an icon not by any individual in or outside of this House but by Bunreacht na hÉireann. This document specifically elevates the family to a special status.  It is good to put this on the record in this context, because while one may have various views about the organisation Family Solidarity, one cannot be in any doubts as to where the family stands in our Constitution. All of our actions here must be consistent with this Constitution.  It states &ldquo;the State recognises the family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of society&rdquo; and it says &ldquo;as a moral institution&rdquo;.  We do not like using the word &ldquo;moral&rdquo; anymore, but it is in our Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is not for us to suggest that the family is being elevated to the status of an icon.  This has been done by decision of the people, and all of our actions must recognise that fundamental fact.</P>

      <P>Just because we have been fortunate enough to be members of close and loving families we cannot forget that while such families are the vast majority, there are other families where great hurt has been done to its members.  I wish to comment on people being enticed into prostitution.  The Minister has been very frank about this.  It is a criminal trade and Senator Norris was right when he spoke about women being bought and sold.  I said yesterday I do not know any of the so-called high class call girls, but I know plenty of the women who are on the <Col N="420" /> streets, and I would not describe any one of them as being the sort of person who had been enticed into prostitution for the sake of nice clothes or looking smart. Most of them are badly dressed and many of them look in very poor health.  I am very pleased the Minister introduced this Bill in such good weather.  I do not know if my enthusiasm for going on fact-finding missions would have been so great if I had had to go out on a cold November night.  Last night I spoke again to some of the women in the Dublin 4 area and the majority of them are out on the streets because they are desperate for money.  I never met one who was there for any other reason.</P>
      <P>Senator McGennis was right in her comments yesterday.  We have an extraordinarily odd idea about prostitutes, brought on, I suspect, by American films like &ldquo;Pretty Woman&rdquo;, and she pointed out that this is not what prostitution is at all.  It is a grim business for these women, and the Minister is trying to do the best she can for them.  We are doing serious work now in trying to see how we can help people to avoid becoming involved in prostitution.  I have grave doubts about dismissing it as being a soft area that people are enticed into.  That does not happen at all.</P>

      <P>I wish to speak for a moment about what Senator O'Kennedy has said about the family.  All of us value the family as the institution that it is, and as it is laid down in the Constitution, but in a minority of cases things are happening in families which are not acceptable to any of us.  The Senator spoke about people showing affection and love. Everybody needs love and affection; this enables us to be at peace with ourselves and to have confidence in ourselves. Giving love and affection to children, the affection they receive in families, enables them to cope with the difficulties of life when they go into the world.  However, if children are not comfortable with something they have a right to come forward about this and we, as a society, should help them in that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Henry and <Col N="421" /> Senator Norris have said about the Stay Safe programmes.  The only way we will overcome the problem of child sexual abuse is to convince children they are allowed to tell people if something is happening to them.  I am concerned about those who are in some way against the Stay Safe programmes in schools.  The very people who are against them are probably the people whose children need them most.  That is my greatest concern. In the past people have not come out and spoken about the abuse while it was going on, and only when they became adults, with huge psychological problems that had built up over the years, were they able to talk about it.  The Stay Safe programme encourages them to do that while they are young and, therefore, to enable all of us to help put an end to this abuse.</P>

      <P>I did not have an opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate, and I wish to take the opportunity now to congratulate the Minister on this legislation.  It was a brave and progressive step and she is to be complimented. It will be seen as one of the historic events of this decade.  The fact that there is disagreement about aspects of this Bill proves there will always be some dissent when positive and progressive steps to taken.</P>
      <P>On the question of the family which was raised by Senator O'Kennedy, there is a need to look realistically at what is being said.  The whole area of sex education and the awareness of young children is something that concerns me every day of the week having as I do 25,000 members who work in this area.  I have had to read that Constitution time and again and look at it in the context of the responsibilities of different people. Senator O'Kennedy will be well aware as a barrister that one does not in law weigh up one legal or constitutional right against another.  The effect of law must be to ensure that the rights of all groups are maintained and protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I firmly agree with Senator O'Kennedy that the family unit is given an exalted position in the Constitution.  Nothing has <Col N="422" /> been said on this side of the House which would threaten that position.  The responsibility of the State is clear.  For example, Article 42 of the Constitution gives the family or the parents the right to be the prime educators but in the event of the family deciding to exert their right to be the prime educators and subsequently not discharging it to the satisfaction of the State, the State is authorised to intervene.  It is understood that in other aspects of constitutional rights the State may be allowed to intervene in the same way.</P>
    <P>The question of sex education is very clear, because Article 42.1 of the Constitution is quite specific.  It defines education and includes moral education, as mentioned by Senator O'Kennedy, religious education, physical education and intellectual education.  When it goes on to the next section, however, to determine where the State requires a certain minimum level of education, it gives a different definition, and leaves out two aspects which were previously mentioned. It does not refer either to religious or physical education.  The reason for no reference to physical education was because of the intervention of the then Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. McQuaid, who saw physical education as touching in some way on sexual education and felt that this was an infringement of the rights of the family.  While it was not stated at the time, it is accepted that that is what happened.  We have now reached a situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He was entitled to do what he did, but it is not hearsay; it is chapter and verse.  I would not have agreed with what he did, but I would have supported his right to do it.</P>
      <P>The education of children in these areas is required of the family and if the family does not provide it, somebody else must.  What is needed here is co-operation between the State, the family and the educational institutions.  The programme we are discussing is accepted by the Church, the State and the educational institutions.  The child abuse prevention programme was designed by Irish teachers for Irish children; it was neither brought from the United States nor modelled on the British programme.  I know because I was involved in it at the embryo stage.</P>
      <P>Anybody who has examined the programme would agreed that it did not take its brief from the United States.  Last year 6,000 parents in Dublin looked at the programme and only three raised marginal questions about it.</P>

      <P>I did not introduce the topic of the family to this debate, as Senator O'Toole may think.  I was responding to an observation by Senator Norris, perhaps because of this view on Family Solidarity the people are trying or raise the family to the status of an icon.  I pointed out that even before any of us spoke here the family was raised to that status by the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quoted one subsection and I will quote the following subsection and then rest my case.  Let us recognise the status <Col N="424" /> of the family in the Constitution.  Article 41.2.2º says:</P>
    <P>The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
    <P>If that is not elevating the family to the status of an icon, I do not know what is. That is the only thing that prompted my intervention when Senator Norris made his observation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

      <P>You will be delighted, Sir, that the Minister has no intention of getting involved in a constitutional argument.</P>
      <P>To return to the points made on section 1, when I introduced the changes in relation to the laws on prostitution in this Bill, I had no intention of engaging in a fundamental reform of our laws on prostitution because it would have taken too long and delayed the Bill considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women makes specific recommendations regarding potential reform in the area of prostitution.  I am glad the report takes prostitution outside <Col N="426" /> the exclusive ambit of the Department of Justice because when people think and talk about prostitution it is in terms of the laws that are, or are not, in place to deal with it.  For the first time the Second Commission on the Status of Women has said clearly that a number of Government Departments are involved in this matter and that they should face up to their responsibilities and, more importantly, work together to produce proposals. Three Departments are now doing that and, in the event that they make specific recommendations in relation to changes in the laws, which they may well do, I will have no hesitation in bringing forward those changes.</P>
    <P>They may recommend changes in relation to the area about which Senator O'Kennedy and others are concerned and that is, young prostitutes male or female.  Senator O'Kennedy is right in saying that under the present law, and under this Bill when enacted, there is no distinction as to whether a prostitute is young or not so young.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was introduced in the Dáil, I had included very severe penalties with which a number of Deputies from all political parties, including my own, took issue.  As a result of the cogent arguments made in favour of reducing the penalties in the Bill, overnight I agreed to put forward a number of amendments and to accept a number of Opposition amendments.  As a result, significant and important improvements have been made in the penalties area.</P>
    <P>Senators made important points in relation to homes.  The vast majority of Irish homes are places young people and all of us have been privileged to be part of, growing up in loving and affectionate relationships.  Senator O'Kennedy makes an important point that because the majority of cases of child sexual abuse take place in either the immediate or the extended family we can often become paranoid about parents and adults showing affection for children.  I know of people who would be concerned about showing affection for their children, or for a niece or nephew, in public, because certain people might say that was wrong. <Col N="427" /> It would be a pity to go down that road. We need to encourage the development of loving affectionate relationships within families.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris made a point about young boys and girls becoming involved in prostitution at an early age because they are looking for affection, friendship or a relationship they did not have in their own homes.  As I said, there are loving, affectionate relationships in the majority of families.</P>
    <P>We must introduce certain changes in the law on prostitution because, as Senator Norris knows, male prostitution was not included prior to this.  When we were making the changes in the laws on homosexuality it was important that we included male prostitution when we were dealing with laws on prostitution.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 14, to delete &ldquo;17 years&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;18 years&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes that the common age of consent for both homosexual and heterosexual activity be 18 years of age.  The Law Reform Commission does not recommend that this approach be maintained.  It recommends that heterosexual intercourse for persons between the ages of 15 and 17 should not be an offence, except where the male is more than five years older than the female or the male is a person in authority. In the event of this recommendation being accepted, the Law Reform Commission has not recommended a similar change in respect of homosexual activity.</P>
      <P>It is the Fine Gael view that 18 years of age, the age of majority, is the appropriate age in the case of the Bill before us.  My party is conscious that teenage years are difficult years and that sexual orientation can sometimes be confused. My party is anxious to strike a correct balance between removing unnecessary criminal taboos and protecting vulnerable people under the law.  There is a case for making the age of homosexual and heterosexual activity equal. However, my party believes that a case has already been made by the Law Reform Commission for a differentiation in certain circumstances and a differentiation would be justified in this Bill.</P>
      <P>During the debate on Second Stage I said it was not our wish to reflect on the sexuality of anyone, whether they are homosexual, heterosexual or bisexual. Accordingly, I tabled amendment No. 3 which proposes that 17 years of age should be substituted by 18 years.</P>

We should be mature about the way we handle this matter, rather than simply rushing the legislation through the House.  We have an opportunity of demonstrating that, unlike the Lower House, we will allow proper time and consideration to this issue.  I appeal to the Chair not to have us gasping for breath as we decide whether we agree with the various sections.</P>
      <P>I have a certain sympathy for this amendment.  Perhaps the Minister could reflect on the attitude she could adopt.  I know it is not easy to accept amendments at this point because the legislation would have to return to the Dáil but perhaps I could make a suggestion to the Minister. I read her speech when she introduced this legislation in the Dáil.  Unfortunately, I was not able to be here yesterday.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was great.  The Minister in her speech referred to mature people.  I agree with that and support it if we are dealing with legislation in relation to mature adults.  However, I wonder if 17 year olds can be presented as mature or fully developed with regard to their legal, constitutional or other responsibilities?  In relation to their constitutional and legal position, 17 year olds are not recognised as being constitutionally mature because the franchise does not extend to them.</P>
      <P>In relation to all aspects of the law, whether it is civil or criminal law, 17 year olds are specially protected.  For example, if they enter into a civil contract which gives a certain advantage to the other party to the contract, the law does not recognise the contract as binding on the 17 year old.  However, I would be bound to such a contract.  Everyone else is accepted as being sufficiently mature, developed and responsible to abide by the consequences of their decisions.  The law is correct in this.  Of course, there is always a cut-off point; it was 21 years of age, then it was reduced to 18 years of age and now it is proposed to reduce it to 17 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister if she has considered <Col N="431" /> these aspects of the issue and the fact that the vast majority of 17 year olds are still at school, with the exception of those from deprived homes who do not have the benefit of education at any stage in their lives.  They are dependent in every sense of the word.  I could not describe these people as being either developed or mature to the point where they should not get or deserve special protection from legislators.  That is my position in relation to people of that age.</P>
    <P>Some people might ask what is the difference between 17 and 18 years of age?  If a person has a birthday on 31 May, does one day make a difference? However, there is always some measure of time in the law and this must be the case.  The objective analysis suggests that the 17 year old deserves and requires special consideration.  I will not quote the Constitution in support of my case again but there are many Articles in the Constitution that can be called in support of education and protection of those who have a special right or claim on us under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>While the Minister is talking about giving equal treatment to homosexual and heterosexual activity, there is a difference and that should be recognised. The vast majority of people are heterosexual and would create the family in its traditional, constitutional sense.  I recognise that there is a minority community and we must respect them. However, because of the ethos of the Constitution and our laws up to the present, I believe there is a cogent reason for making special provision for 17 year old males in this legislation.  Perhaps the Minister could persuade me, but I do not agree with the argument that we treat people the same whether they are heterosexual or homosexual.  As I see it, it is not like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats are opposed to the amendment.  We support the position as outlined by the Minister yesterday, that to be consistent it is right that the same age should apply to heterosexual activity as to homosexual activity.  The Minister explained that adequately in her reply on Second Stage and I accept what she said.  The position is reasonable.  I have reached the point of wondering if we will have a moral police force that will go around the country asking people whether they are 17 or 18 years old, or whether they are homosexual or heterosexual.  I am appalled at the thought of the complications that could arise.</P>
      <P>An underlying point that needs to be made, and which I raised yesterday on Second Stage, is that we have an extraordinary lack of confidence in our young people.  People of 17 years of age are sexually mature.  They are young adults. There are people in their 40s and 50s who are far less capable of making rational judgments than some of the young people I know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I let Senator O'Kennedy have his say and I listened to him, and I hope he would extend me the same courtesy.  The civilities which were being <Col N="433" /> observed yesterday, and to which the Minister referred, seem to be sliding progressively to one side at this stage of the debate.</P>
      <P>The section states &ldquo;in the case of an act of buggery with a person under the age of 15 years, imprisonment for life&rdquo;. There are severe provisions in the Bill which take age into account.  We allow people to buy cigarettes that will kill them without any control on the age of the purchaser.  I can visualise circumstances where sexual activity can be life threatening and they have been dealt with, I hope, in other legislation.  Could we not have a little more confidence in our young people?  They are responsible and, by and large good people, and they do not always require us to intervene on their behalf.  Of course we should intervene in the cases referred to in our discussion on section 1 but I do not see the difference it will make here.</P>
      <P>Yesterday we asked if we would enact the legislation which was originally brought into force during Victorian times if it was before us now, and the answer is that we would not.  When the records of this debate are examined future generations will wonder why we disputed whether the age should be 17 years or 18 years.  People of 17 years of age are mature; they know what they are doing and they are capable of having our trust invested in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to oppose this amendment.  I listened with interest and profound sympathy to what Senator Neville had to say.  His party has placed him in an impossible position.  He said that teenagers were difficult, which they are, and in its usual modest, helpful way Fine Gael proposes to make them even more difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He talked about people being confused. It is clear that not alone on this issue but on the telephone charges, the visit of President Robinson to the North of Ireland, hare coursing and on this Bill that the Fine Gael Party is in a terminal state of confusion.  It would be absurd for a Government that has initiated a Ministry of Equality to open the battle <Col N="434" /> by introducing discriminatory practices in a Bill whose principal intent is to remove discrimination.  I cannot understand the logic of that.  Senator O'Kennedy could not find the reference in the Minister's speech to this issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Senator will find it for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot because, unfortunately, I do not have the speech. However, I can remember the substance of it since I listened to it with great care in the Dáil and I was moved by the clarity and logic of what she said.  The Minister is able to speak for herself but, as I recall, she said that the only justification for a discrimination in this area would be the conviction that there was a difference of capacity for homosexual and heterosexual people which suggests that there was a lack of maturity or lack of intellectual ability.  I do not believe that case has been established and if Senator Neville does not think I would be offended by the assumption that I was intellectually or emotionally inferior, then I must tell him that I would be offended.</P>
      <P>I am impressed by the reasonable tones of Senator O'Kennedy, although I do not always find what he says as reasonable as his gracious manner of saying it, but I suspect he does not find my manner gracious or my substance convincing. However, despite the stridency of my tone, I do not regard myself as an absolutist. If I was an extremist or an absolutist I would have taken up a position which, perhaps, may have been indicated by Senator Neville, because I notice that there is a margin of differentiation in section 3, but I am prepared to accept that since it allows the Government to say to concerned parents that it recognises that they have concerns and that it has made some degree of legislative provision for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this section, and thoughout the Bill, I regret, although it may be unavoidable, the continued use of terms such as &ldquo;buggery&rdquo; and &ldquo;sodomy&rdquo;.  They sound so unpleasant.  They sound as if they are <Col N="435" /> attempts at onomatopoeic representations of the act.  I do not like them because, as I said yesterday, they derive from an antique religious prejudice.  If the Bill passes and I hope it will as rapidly as possible, without precluding Senator O'Kennedy or anybody else from their full right of free speech, then regardless of what it is called, I would be happy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I must speak against this amendment.  The Minister has done the right thing by applying the same age of consent to both male and female teenagers. The mother is granted an important place in the Constitution; I think I am the oldest mother in the House who has children of both sexes who have left their teenager years.</P>

      <P>I could not see myself going home and telling to the girls that the age of consent for them is 17 years, but 18 for the boys, because they do not have their wits about them until they reach that age.  That would be impossible and insupportable.  I share Senator Dardis's view that we must have confidence in our young people.  This is the most important issue.  I believe the Minister is correct in this respect.  There is no difference in maturity or intellectural ability or lack of sensibility in boys and girls in their late teenage years.  I believe that both groups would cope with such sexual situations in the way which seems most natural for them.  The vast majority of them are going to cope with these situations from a heterosexual point of view.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator. The issue of maturity is the substantive question.  It is not an issue on which one can legislate.  At 17 years of age I attended university and at 25 years of age I became a Senator in this House. Maturity is very much an individual matter.  Some people at the age of 14 are forced, by virtue of circumstances, to reach maturity at an early age.  Others reach that stage at a much later age.</P>
      <P>The legislation before this House must be addressed.  I have listened to the debate with patience and I find that while there has been diviation from the subject matter of section 1 of the Bill, the discussion has been most helpful.  I trust that the matters raised were noted by the Minister; this would be for the benefit of all.</P>
      <P>I agree with the substantive matter set out in the Bill and I disagree with the proposed amendment on the basis of equality.  This Bill deals with the issue of equality and it would be nonsensical to suggest that 17 years of age would be a proper age for heterosexuals and 18 years fo age for homosexuals.  If legislation is to enacted, especially this kind of legislation, then it must be done so on the basis of equality.</P>
      <P>The debate so far has been wide-ranging. Some Senators may have had a better opportunity to debate the legislation yesterday but those who were not present then at least have had the opportunity to participate in the debate today.  This I welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been much talk of homosexuality and heterosexuality. However, as I understand it the Bill is concerned with the decrimination of buggery and with prostitution offences.  It is <Col N="437" /> worth mentioning that the Minister is not legalising buggery; she is decriminalising it, which I believe is correct.</P>
      <P>I have some personal difficulties with the Bill.  For example, I believe buggery is immoral but I do not wish to impose my own moral beliefs on other individuals except to ask them to accept them.  I believe buggery should be decriminalised, but for different reasons than most people.  I believe that buggery is a rather sick act, that it is <i>contra naturum</i> and any activity that is sick like that should not be criminalised.</P>
      <P>Regarding the age of 17 years, I have a certain sympathy with this, but not for the reasons espoused by other people.  I believe our young people are responsible and that there is a case to be made for equality, which is an admirable aspiration. However, if our nearest neighbour has an age limit of 21, I put the question, will there be an influx into this country of older people who wish to bugger young people of 17 years?</P>
      <P>Another difficulty with the age of 17 years is that it may in some way indicate to people that buggery is an acceptable practice and should be taught in schools as such.  This is something I would be entirely opposed to as it could indicate to young people that buggery is on a par with normal sexual intercourse, which I do not believe to be the case.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment tabled by Senator Neville and I have listened with interest to the arguments put forward by other Senators.  Senator Dardis suggested that the same age should apply to homosexuals and heterosexuals and this should be applied in this legislation for the sake of consistency.  I suggest to Senator Dardis that if he is prepared to protect a person at the age of 16 years as opposed to 17 years on the basis of difference in age, then he should accept that there is also a difference between the ages of 17 and 18 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely.  I do not <Col N="438" /> believe the argument by Senator Dardis that the age of consent set out in the legislation should equate with the heterosexual age of consent is sustainable.</P>
      <P>There is a responsibility to ensure that legislation reflects the views and interests of society.  It must be recognised that for this society to introduce legislation to decriminalise homosexuality is a major step forward and it is a measure supported by Fine Gael.  However, it must also be recognised that there are limits to what society finds acceptable at any given time.  Fine Gael believes that the age of 17 years is not acceptable in Irish society at present.  This may change as the years go by and at that point legislation may subsequently be amended to accommodate such change.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris, in his usual fluent manner, disagrees with the amendment put down by Fine Gael and suggests that it has put the party into an impossible situation.  I assure the Senator that Fine Gael is not in an impossible situation at all and that the party is comfortable with its position on this amendment.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael does not consider the amendment to be discriminatory. Senator Norris and other Senators frequently refer to legislation introduced in other countries, especially the legislation in the UK.  In relation to this legislation, such Senators have conveniently omitted to mention that the age of consent set out in the relevant legislation in the UK is 21 years.  Fine Gael is proposing an amendment to this legislation to increase the age of consent to 18 years.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry referred to the difference between boys and girls and asked if there was to be one rule for boys and one rule for girls.  It is accepted by psychiatrists, psychologists, parents and people in general that girls mature at a much earlier age than boys.  The motivation of Fine Gael in proposing this amendment is to reflect as far as possible the wishes of society, to provide a balance as far as is possible and to protect young people, especially boys who are less mature than girls.  I commend the amendment to the House and I invite other Senators to give it their support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have an opportunity to speak on Second Stage.  This is an important Bill decriminalising homosexuality and I believe the age of 17 years is the correct age.  It has been well thought through and I can see no grounds to substantiate a case to increase the age to 18 years.  I could certainly not do so on the basis that girls are more mature than boys.  The point I would make is that in recent times our young people have become very mature and we should have more confidence in them.  It is now almost five years since the European Court of Human Rights found that our laws in this area were in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Minister has been given many accolades for introducing this legislation but let us not quibble over a year.  For that reason I would not support the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to oppose this amendment because when the Minister addressed the House yesterday she said that if 17 years was considered an age of sufficient maturity for consent to heterosexual sex there were no convincing grounds for arguing that persons of that age who are attracted to members of their own sex are any less mature.  I agree with what the Minister is doing in this area.  Yesterday she said she was accepting the proposals of the Law Reform Commission which recommended that the same legal regime should obtain for consensual homosexual as for heterosexual activity, and that no case had been established that the 17-year age of consent should be any different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn queried why we were doing this and why the age had to be the same.  As several Senators have said, we are doing it on the basis of equality and I fully agree with that.  We have a responsibility to look at what is happening in the country as well as the responsibility of leadership.  The Minister is proposing the same consensual age for heterosexual acts as for homosexual ones and I accept that.  We have to be mature; if we are not mature in this House we <Col N="440" /> have little hope of expecting the people who elected us to behave maturely.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in its reports on vagrancy, rape and sexual offences against the mentally handicapped gave other detailed analyses and reasons for ensuring that the age of consent be left at 17 years.  It said that it would &ldquo;encourage young people to develop responsibility and a positive sense of self which is the best defence against abusive, exploitative behaviour&rdquo;. Like Senator Henry, I am a mother; I have three children, all boys.  I would be more concerned about boys maturing because I do not have girls.  However, if one looks at individual children, one can have a child of nine who is more mature than a child of 14.  I do not accept that 18 year olds are more mature than 17 year olds.  Many 17 year olds are more mature than 18 year olds and Senator Belton said to me a few minutes ago that he wondered if men ever matured.  I sometimes wonder myself.</P>

      <P>Yesterday Senator Taylor-Quinn and the Minister referred to the fact that 17 years of age was not very low and that every other European country had a lower age of consent.  I do not think we can suggest that any of these countries is less moral than we are, and that by having the age of consent lower than 18 years they are any less moral.  The Minister also said that when the legislation was introduced in Britain the age of consent at that time was 21 years and she thought that was the reason for setting the revised age of consent at 18 years. I do not think that there is any reason for us to look at Britain and feel we should increase our age of consent from 17 to 18 years because it is higher in Britain.  I oppose this amendment and I agree with what the Minister is doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take up a few matters that were raised by Senator Taylor-Quinn.  For example, she said that some of us refer to British legislation repeatedly and that we were very shy of doing so yesterday.  She cannot possibly have been thinking of me because I referred to the United Kingdom legislation and the fact that I regretted the British Parliament chose to demonstrate in public their view that the British male was less sexually mature than anybody on the planet in the same situation.  I have frequently spoken about relations between Irish and British legislation, and almost always to deplore the laziness of Irish Governments which, in a series of cases &mdash; not even dealing with sexuality but with planning legislation, for example &mdash; took the easiest course and, since our laws have been historically so intertwined, simply reached into the nearest pigeon-hole, pull down the British equivalent and shoved it in.  I am profoundly glad, and expressed my gratitude to the Minister yesterday, that she did not do the lazy thing.</P>
      <P>I am glad a number of Senators spoke about people being mature at 17 years of age.  I cannot imagine a young person, specifically in terms of this legislation a young male, defining himself as homosexual if there was the slightest ambiguity or doubt in his mind that he was.  We are talking about the way in which people see themselves and I do not think we can afford to be quite as patronising and paternalistic as some speakers have been. The World Health Organisation, as a measure against venereal infection, has called for decriminalisation with a common age of consent, as has the Law Reform Commission and the Council for the Status of Women.  Fine Gael think they know better, or do they because I have a very good idea what Fine Gael are up to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This amendment is tabled for a specific purpose, which is that the Fine Gael Party recognises society's situation and what it is capable of actually <Col N="445" /> taking and accepting at this time.  We recognise and we believe as a party, which has always acted responsibly in this House and in the other House and which has been to the forefront in relation to progressive legislation, that 18 years is the appropriate age to write into this legislation.  We believe this is an inoperable age.  Irish society is taking a major step forward in bringing in this legislation. I commend the Minister for doing so but Fine Gael also believes that society is not yet ready to accept the age of consent at 17 years.  It would be in everybody's interests if the age of consent were raised to 18 years.</P>

      <P>The Minister, typically, introduced a reference at the very begining of her contribution when she said the purpose of the Bill is to decriminalise sexual activity between consenting mature males.  That was the term she used.  I do not intend to repeat the queries I raised but I wish her to address them.  However I feel I must address another point.</P>
      <P>I do not mind condescending references to Fine Gael, to myself or to anyone else from Senator Norris or anybody else but I resent and reject condescending references to the Constitution.  If Senator Norris wishes to ridicule the Constitution his actions must be exposed and I intend to do that.  If he finds the Preamble to the Constitution undeserving of his respect, let me remind him that it was enacted by the people.  I wish to refer to it regardless of whether he chooses to respect it.  The Preamble reads:</P>

      <P>Yesterday I quoted from a book, <i>New Problems in Medical Ethics</i> which was edited by Dom Peter Flood.  I intended to quote from <i>Passage of the Engel Through Sodom</i> but it might be too exciting or too sensational.  In these essays, which are mainly about homosexuality and were published 50 years ago, the age which is constantly discussed is the age of puberty.  We are discussing an age which is far later than the age of puberty and sexual orientation.  The Minister is even receiving support from this learned book.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it clear yesterday on Second Stage that I was not prepared to accept amendments which would set the age of consent for homosexual acts at a different age to that of <Col N="447" /> heterosexual acts.  This Bill, and it has been acknowledged by everybody inside and outside these Houses, sets a high premium on the principle of equality and equal treatment under the law.  I feel very strongly that to now establish separate ages of consent, regardless of the age and which was higher or lower, would depart from that principle in a fundamentalist manner.</P>
      <P>I listened to Senators speaking about 17 year olds and debating whether they are mature or fully developed but that debate seems to centre on homosexual 17 year olds.  I cannot understand that because if a 17 year old is not mature or fully developed, then it does not matter if they are homosexual or heterosexual. We should not make a difference because of a person's sexual orientation.  We also heard that 17 year olds are still at a very tender age and that many of them are still attending second level schools.  I have a child who is almost 18 years old and he went to university two years ago.  It is not correct to say that the vast majority of 17 years olds are in one system of education or another.  Why should we make a special provision for male 17 year olds who are homosexuals and not for female 17 year olds or 17 year old males who are heterosexual?  Senator Dardis made a very valid comment when he said we were showing a great lack of confidence in our young people.  I do not think anybody in this House wants to propose, or wants to be seen to be proposing, that we lack confidence in our young people.</P>
      <P>I go back to the points I made last night in reply to a suggestion that young people &mdash; and this suggestion has been put forward particularly by the main Opposition party &mdash; of homosexual orientation are burdened by a lower intellect or a lack of maturity.  I do not accept that.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael are regretfully proposing to end one form of inequality by the introduction of another. Senator Taylor-Quinn, when she was a <Col N="448" /> Member of the other House and particularly when she was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, was one of the strongest supporters of equality.  On all the equality issues that were discussed in the other House, she was a very active supporter.  I hope she will be able to persuade Senator Neville and the other members of her party in this House to look at this issue as one of equality and not to introduce a political each way bet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not end one form of inequality by creating another.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Senators who said not all 17 year olds are mature but I refer again to what I said previously, that that applies equally to homosexuals and heterosexuals. Homosexuality does not become more or less attractive as an option because the age of consent for heterosexual relations is the same.  As I said last night if someone decided to remain celibate or to live in a heterosexual union with another, I do not think that, because the age of consent was 17 years for homosexual activity, they would be swayed to move away from either celibacy or heterosexual union into homosexuality.  I do not understand one term which was used by Senator Taylor-Quinn and I would like her to explain it. She said that 17 was an &ldquo;inoperable age&rdquo; and I cannot understand what that means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain Members mentioned that the age of consent in the UK is 21.  Senator Norris replied to that and I replied to it on Second Stage so I am not going to repeat it.  When looking at this area, which was probably the most contentious issue I had to face as Minister for Justice, and in making my recommendations to the Government as to whether there should be a common age of consent or if it should be 18, 21 or higher, I had regard to the recommendations of one of the most respected bodies established under the Oireachtas &mdash; the Law Reform Commission. <Col N="449" /> It clearly stated that no case had been established for proving that the age of consent should be any different for homosexuals.</P>
    <P>As far as I was concerned that came as a result of the Law Reform Commission's publication of an interim report on the area asking members of the public and groups to respond to the recommendations. Those people responded to the interim report, yet when the final report was published the commission retained their original recommendation after listening to the submissions made to them.  Senator Norris is correct in relation to the age of consent.  As I said, we must compare what is happening here with those countries in Europe which have a cultural and religious heritage which is similar to our own.  In France the common age of consent is 15; in Italy, it is 14; in Spain, it is 15, it is 16 in both Portugal and Belgium and it is 15 in Poland.  They are countries which have a religious heritage very similar to our own.</P>
    <P>I am a mother and I have an 18 year old son and a 14 year old son.  I have said this publicly.  I was very interested and influenced by a mother who came to me during the meetings I held while preparing this legislation and she made a telling, valid and compassionate point. She talked about her son who had come to her and said he had something he wanted to tell her.  I suppose the first thing she thought was that he was in trouble with the law or that, if he had a girlfriend, she was pregnant and had an unwanted pregnancy with which she and her family would have to deal.  Instead, he sat down and told her he was a homosexual. She was horrified, afraid and felt threatened.  She did all the things any of us as parents and I, as a mother of an 18 year old, might do were we to hear a similar story.  We do not know how we would react in these circumstances.  She told him it was a passing phase, that he would grow out of it and that it was unnatural and abnormal.  She brought him to the general practitioner who could not help in any way.  They went through a lengthy period discussing the matter, <Col N="450" /> taking her son to psychiatrists and psychologists and so on.</P>
    <P>At the end of that painful, traumatic experience, if we put ourselves in the position of the parent who might be faced with that situation, we would have to ask ourselves what we would say to somebody to whom we had given love and affection for 17, 18 or 19 years.  What do we say to them?  Do we say that because of their sexual orientation, because they are homosexual, we do not want to know them any more and that, in some way, they are abnormal or unnatural and are not wanted as part of the family?  I do not think any of us as individuals, if we are compassionate and tolerant and have truly given love and affection to that son, can say that.  We would all like to think of ourselves as parents who would be understanding and who would continue to give love and affection to that individual even though they might be doing something of which we ourselves would disapprove.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that many Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and many people in Irish society have difficulties with the decriminalisation of homosexuality but I am not sure their difficulty is with the age.  People often have a difficulty with the issue of homosexuality, how they treat it and they may feel threatened by it.  Irish society has come a long way towards respecting, accepting and recognising difference and I think that is what we are doing here.  As I said, nobody has made a case to me that would give the lie to the case made by the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>At no time in the debate yesterday did Fine Gael or any speaker from Fine Gael indicate that homosexuals had a lower intellect than heterosexuals. The Minister suggested that this was the thrust of our approach to the age issue.  Nobody is saying that one should not be compassionate and loving to a young person who declares that they are homosexual.  What we are saying to them is that they should give themselves space and not enter into homosexual activity until they are 18 years of age. <Col N="451" /> That is quite distinct from implying that our proposal suggested that one should not be loving, compassionate or understanding of a young person who declares they are homosexual.  One should be understanding, and everybody would accept that.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about the difference between 17 and 18 as the age of consent.  Of course one can make a case for 17 years being the age of consent but, as I said in my speech, on balance we feel that 18 is the right age.  Somebody did decide that 16 was not the right age and 17 was; one can also make that case. Having seriously considered the situation we feel that 18 is the proper age for dcriminalising homosexual activities.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission recommended the legalisation of heterosexual activity for persons between the ages of 17 and 15 provided the male is not five years older than the female, but it has not said that the same situation should apply to homosexual activities.  The Law Reform Commission, in another report, indicated that there should be a difference. Having looked at the situation, we feel that, on balance, 18 should be the age at which consensual homosexual activity should take place.</P>
      <P>I am not saying we are absolutist about it.  It is a balanced opinion and for people to say that they are absolutely certain that 17 is the right age smacks of a little arrogance because one cannot be absolutist about these things.  Maybe in ten, 20 or 30 years time, 15 might be the right age if society has changed.  It is accepted that people are developing much faster now than they did 30 or 40 years ago.  Things do change but having looked at the situation, Fine Gael feel in 1993 that 18 is the age at which consensual sexual activity should be legally allowed to take place between homosexuals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that so I will not take undue advantage of the fact. We are not implying that we do not recognise people of certain age as being responsible.  It is quite the opposite.  I would not like to be represented as considering young people to be irresponsible. In my relationship with young people, at home and in the community, I would like to think that we have a happy, healthy relationship and a mutual respect which does not raise any problems in relation to age.  I respect young people and I have confidence in them.</P>
      <P>The Minister in her reply has quite significantly and understandably referred to the situation in other countries such as Greece.  In quoting ages of consent as low as 14 and 15 years, the Minister raises an interesting point.  I will not say anything about the effect of the sun on the genes. I lived in Italy for a year so I know a little about that also.  The common age of consent in Europe is 15 years of age.  It is 14 years in Italy, 15 years in Spain.  We are being told that we should take note of and respect that.  A year does make a difference because under this legislation, we would treat some of those as criminals liable for imprisonment for life.  How do we reconcile wanting to be influenced by what the Italians, Greeks or Spaniards are doing with the statement in this Bill that says:</P>
      <P>A person who commits or attempts to commit an act of buggery with a person under the age of 17 years shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction on indictment in the case of an act of buggery with a person under the age of 15 years to imprisonment for life.</P>
      <P>Apparently a year more or less does make a difference.  We are saying in this legislation that what is considered normal and reasonable in countries such as Italy and Greece renders a person liable to imprisonment for life in this country.  I ask those who say a year does not make a difference, where is the consistency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> We can only measure time by an imperfect instrument which is age.  It is not absolutely comprehensive and reliable. This section itself makes distinctions between the ages of 15, 16 and 17 years for the purposes of the penalties to be imposed.  For those who would try to imply that a year does not make a difference between the ages of 15 and 18 years, I would call into evidence this Bill which goes on to say that in the case of an act of buggery with a person of or over the age of 15 years and under the age of 17 years, namely 16 years, there is a different term of imprisonment, not exceeding five years.</P>
    <P>I will not comment on whether each of those four subsections are entirely right, but somebody has concluded that there is a difference of gravity between the offence of buggery committed with a person at different ages in those developing years.  I am not qualified to say what is the appropriate stage of development in each case; individuals vary but there are general norms.  If we are going to impose sanctions of the order of imprisonment for life and hold up other countries as examples of enlightenment, we should recognise that a year does make a great difference.  I call into evidence of that this section itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate some of what Senator O'Kennedy said but there does seem to be, if I might say with respect and I hope without condescension, a certain failure of logic in one element.  Surely it is more logical if one accepts the persuasion of European models to move in their direction rather than away from them.  There is a logic in moving towards a younger age rather than an older age. The Minister spoke movingly about a mother confronting the dilemma of her son's homosexuality.  What answer would it be to that son to tell him that he was defined as a criminal at that age?  I do not think that would be a caring response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard it as completely appropriate that there should be a wide expression of opinion from all sides of the House.  I would be happy with a free vote. However, I wish to tell Fine Gael that <Col N="454" /> one needs to be shrewd when one tries to pull a Fianna Fáil type stroke because if it backfires there are no boys better equipped or more willing to plant a boot in one's face in return.

      <P>In page 4, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Proceedings for an offence under this section shall not be taken except by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment to ensure that any prosecutions taken would have substance to them.  This is an indictable offence and, as Senator O'Kennedy said, the penalties imposed under this section are heavy; one can get life imprisonment under the first subsection.  This subsection will ensure that no proceedings would be taken due to a malicious nature, etc.  In my view, the Minister should accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>Some of the wording in this section is offensive.  Yesterday, the Minister said she found some of the words in section 5 unacceptable, and amended them.  Since we are abolishing the crime of buggery, the words &ldquo;buggery&rdquo; and &ldquo;gross indecency&rdquo; are also offensive and should be replaced.  I intend to table an amendment on Report Stage saying that these words should be replaced by &ldquo;anal sexual intercourse&rdquo; and &ldquo;intimate sexual behaviour&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment. However, I recognise that for reasons of management of political business, it is unlikely that amendments will be taken, although that possibility does remain. Senator Honan has established an important point with regard to neutrality of language and non-judgemental language in this type of legislation.  I referred to this obliquely yesterday when I took a brief look at the etymological origin of the words &ldquo;buggery&rdquo; and &ldquo;sodomy&rdquo;.  I would support her anticipated amendment in this area.  The language in the legislation should be neutralised and should not reflect prejudice in this matter.</P>

      <P>In regard to the phrase &ldquo;gross indecency&rdquo; in the pleadings in the High Court and Supreme Court, one of the arguments registered by my counsel was that there was a disparity in the treatment between women and men.  The learned judges &mdash; or some of them at least &mdash; determined that while ladies might be capable, under severe provocation, of indecency, no lady could be guilty of gross indecency, which is the province of males.</P>

      <P>I have already spoken on the principle of equality underlying the provisions in this Bill. That means that homosexual and heterosexual offences should be treated in the same way.  Proceedings for an offence of unlawful carnal knowledge against a girl who is under 17 or 15 years of age, <Col N="459" /> as the case may be, do not require the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. I can see no reason proceedings for an offence of buggery with a person, that is a boy or a girl under 17 years of age, should have different requirements.</P>
      <P>Offences under the mental impairment provisions will require the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions in accordance with the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in their report on sexual offences against the mentally handicapped; different considerations apply.  In the case of unlawful carnal knowledge or buggery with a person under 17 years of age, an objective yardstick is available, the age of the victim, when a decision on whether to prosecute is being taken.  While the definition of mental impairment does have an objective element, the position is that in cases of mild mental handicap it may be appropriate not to prosecute. Therefore, it is essential in the case of a sexual offence against a mentally impaired person that the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions be required for a prosecution as a matter of public policy and to ensure that inappropriate prosecutions are not taken.  Those considerations do not apply in the case of age where the only relevant matter to be decided is the age of the victim at the time of the alleged offence.  That is a question of fact and can be easily ascertained. I regret, therefore, I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally oppose this section on this occasion.  However, it would be tedious to repeat my opposition to sections which I oppose.  I oppose these sections because, in principle, it is a pity to link both subjects.  I understand the Minister's reasons.  She made a coherent case for the need to revise laws on prostitution and the fact that a full revision would require a comprehensive survey.  I believe this should be done.  I do not agree with the degree of criminalisation which exists, as I understand it, in these provisions.  They may make the lives of the women principally, and the men involved in prostitution worse.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister availed of the opportunity in the Lower House to remove some of the more dangerous and contentious matters; for example, section 10 (2) of the original Bill related to living on the earnings from prostitution.  It stated that in any proceedings for an offence under subsection (1) it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is shown, that a person who lives with or is habitually in the company of a prostitute was at the time of the alleged offence living on earnings of that prostitute from prostitution and was aiding and abetting such prostitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that provision has been removed because it violated a fundamental principle of Irish law, and that is the presumption of innocence.  There are circumstances where a husband, or the wife in the case of a male prostitute, is unaware of the fact that the spouse with whom they share the home is supplementing their income with earnings from prostitution.  I heard a male prostitute on the Marion Finucane radio programme say that his wife was unaware of <Col N="461" /> his activities.  In my view it would be wrong to criminalise, by presumption, the spouse in that case.</P>
    <P>I have had a number of letters from constituents and non-constituents who did not support the sections on prostitution. A letter from a doctor said he did not know what my attitude would be, and that we might not agree on this issue. However, he said that last thing we needed in this field was more restrictive legislation.  He continued to say that although we needed laws to protect women from pimps and children from abuse and that street soliciting was undesirable, the present proposals were open to abuse.  It was a thoughtful letter which presented a good and balanced argument.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of a great deal of what the Minister said in relation to this proposal in the other House.  The Minister is attempting to undermine the career of pimps, a noxious breed of people.  I remember a savage case where an unfortunate prostitute and her aunt were burnt to death by a pimp because the prostitute had attempted to separate herself from the economic connection with this person.  As far as I am concerned, the strongest measures are called for against pimps.</P>
    <P>Some sections are not as sensitive to the rights of prostitutes as they might be. I want to put on the record what might be an unpopular position.  I think that far from criminalising the activities of prostitutes, even in the softened way it is being done in this Bill, we should recognise and regularise these activities.  Prostitutes should be registered, licensed, subject to health checks and the areas in which they operate should be regulated.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear a Member of the other House suggest that much of this activity occurred on the south side of Dublin rather than on the north side of Dublin.  I have news for them.  Somebody asked would the people of North Great Georges Street like a brothel located next door to them?  I can answer that because a brothel was located next door to me. Although I do not claim the title of &ldquo;the politician in the brothel&rdquo;, I was in that <Col N="462" /> brothel.  After a football match a gang of thugs tried to beat down the door with an iron bar, but I got my mother's shillelagh which protected her in darkest Africa and twirled it around my head, letting out a string of invective and filthy language which would shatter the chandeliers, I scattered them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 38 to 43 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;a term of community service under the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment follows from my opposition to the sections.  Since prostitutes are not in a position to pay a fine this is an inappropriate response.  By imposing fines on prostitutes, it would seem that the State is living off immoral earnings, and that would be difficult to square with the Christian and democratic nature of the Constitution which we all profoundly respect.  I strongly feel that a more appropriate sanction for a social infringement, which is how I see prostitution, would be the imposition of a community service order.  First, this would not humiliate the women involved and secondly, it would not place them in a situation where they would very likely have to go to jail as they would be unable to pay the fine.  I am against the criminal conviction of these women in any case because of the impact this may have on them and their children.</P>
      <P>In the correspondence I received from my constituents, one of them makes the point that if a woman is convicted she has a criminal record which makes it impossible to her go get a visa for the United States and other jurisdictions.  Yesterday Senator Henry mentioned that one of these women discussed her fears that if, for example, her son wanted to join the Garda Síochána a conviction registered against the mother would militate against him.  The Minister is shaking her head and I am very glad, but this level of apprehension exists among the women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think many of them are all that wealthy.  I also do not think they are particularly provident people.  I am worried that they may not be able to pay the fines.  I am worried particularly about imprisonment.  I honestly do not think <Col N="464" /> that imprisoning prostitutes is a good idea.  There is no room in our jails and it does nothing but embitter them and possibly exposes them to drugs because they would be bored out of their skulls in prison and drugs are easily available throughout the prison system, I regret to have to say.  It may not be widely known but this is a fact.  I am strongly against the criminalisation of prostitution.  I am also strongly against these penalties, although I accept that the Minister has reduced them.  I welcome that.  It shows goodwill and sensitivity, but I would prefer what I see as a more appropriate sentence, a sentence to something positive, to engage them in the community in community service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that amendment No. 8 has been ruled out of order, I would like to comment on it.  Would the Minister state what services she would provide, having regard to the health aspect of prostitution?  This has taken on a new urgency because of the spread of AIDS and because the application of the law on prostitution is always focused on the prostitute, who is usually a woman.  It will take more than a change in the law to alter that and I feel it would be easier for the Garda to arrest a woman to bring charges against her.  My question to the Minister arises from this amendment, which impressed me even though it was ruled out of order.  It states that &ldquo;The Task Force shall consider all legal, social, and health aspects of prostitution ...&rdquo; This should be taken on board because it has been said that people engage in prostitution for many reasons, including social problems.  This issue merits attention from the Minister and I am anxious to hear her reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In any examination of the penalty structures provided in sections 7 and 8 the following points must be considered.  The penalties are not for prostitution nor are they specifically aimed at prostitutes.  The penalties are for the public nuisance and worse caused by prostitutes, their clients and touts in neighbourhoods frequented by those <Col N="465" /> classes of persons, and I am not an expert where those areas are but I accept in good faith Senator Norris's points in relation to this.</P>
      <P>I explained in some detail yesterday what the effects on people living in areas frequented by prostitutes can be and there is no need for me to repeat it now. Suffice to say that the persons living in, visiting or simply passing through such areas have the basic human right to enjoy their environment.  Unless the Garda and the courts are given adequate powers to deal with soliciting and loitering for the purposes of prostitution we, as legislators, would be failing those persons. The penalties will apply to prostitutes, their clients and touts.  The actual nuisance and annoyance caused by each in neighbourhoods they frequent is the same.  Therefore, it would be illogical and unsustainable to provide different penalty structures for different persons in respect of the same offence.  I would also have some difficulty with any argument which suggested that all prostitutes were poor and all clients were rich.</P>
      <P>The penalties provided are maximum penalties, they are not mandatory and, like all such penalties, they are designed to cater for the worst manifestations of the offence.  Unless they are compelling reasons, such as persistence, maximum penalties are not usually imposed.  I freely admit that the penalties in the Bill as published were on the high side, I said that at the end of the discussion on Second Stage.  I say that, even though the present inoperable law provides for a maximum prison sentence of six months and the Law Reform Commission recommended a maximum penalty of a fine of £500 or six months imprisonment, or both.  The penalty provisions in sections 7 and 8 are considerably less than those. They are also less than the penalties proposed in most of the Opposition amendments to the penalty provisions which were submitted on Committee Stage in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I can well understand the concerns of this House that prostitutes would continue to be liable for imprisonment even for a very short time. <Col N="466" /> However, I consider that it is right to retain even the possibility of such short term imprisonment, as what I would call the ultimate deterrent for the worst cases of public soliciting.</P>
    <P>Most of the amendments seek to substitute a community service order or a fine and alternatively a community service order for the penalties provided in the sections.  The amendments would have the opposite effect to that intended and I will explain why.  Section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, provides that a community service order can only be imposed by a court as an alternative to a prison sentence. In other words, if a prison sentence is not an appropriate penalty for an offence, a community service order cannot be imposed.  A community service order cannot be imposed as an alternative to a fine or as a penalty in itself.  Therefore, none of the amendments to sections 7 and 8 would be workable.  The only way the court will be able at its discretion to impose a community service order for soliciting or loitering is as an alternative to the short prison sentence in sections 7 and 8 as they stand.  That does not have to be specifically catered for in those sections; there is a general application under the 1983 Act.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry's amendment refers to &ldquo;any other sanctions which the Courts are empowered to impose&rdquo;.  These offences are statutory offences and the courts would have available to them only those provisions or penalties which are established and provided for by statute. I will conclude by informing the House that the question of extending the scope of the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, is at present being considered in the context of a very broad policy review which is under way in my Department in relation to prison policy generally.</P>
    <P>I regret I cannot accept the amendments both for technical reasons, which I have explained, and for policy reasons.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her very clear and convincing explanation, particularly with regard to community <Col N="467" /> service orders.  I particularly welcome the indication she has given that this area will be developed as a result of the review in her Department.</P>
      <P>Finally, may I put on the record some of the content of a letter I received.  This is a different correspondent to the one I quoted earlier.</P>
      <P>Prostitutes, by and large, are poorer, less well educated people.  They are essentially a disparate disorganised group not homogeneous as popular and uninformed opinion portrays them.  They do not have high-profile, articulate and entertaining spokes-persons to champion their cause or vindicate their rights.  I would therefore appeal to you to be magnanimous and oppose the recriminalisation of prostitution. There are grievous implications in this for women who are convicted.  They may be refused entry to a number of countries, they can lose custody of their children, they will suffer all the disadvantages and all the discrimination that a criminal record brings, especially one that is sexually related.  God knows they are not criminal but this law would allow the authorities to meddle in their lives, thus alienating them completely.  These are profoundly serious and the legislation has conveniently disguised them.</P>
      <P>He then speaks about the clients of prostitutes. As the Minister has indicated not all prostitutes are poor and not all clients are wealthy.  My correspondent dealt at some length with the financial circumstances of some clients.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was once employed in Fitzwilliam Square and I still vividly recall one occasion when I had to work late at my office, emerging onto the street at 10 o'clock to encounter the appalling sight of protesting women being unceremoniously herded into a van by grinning gardaí while others who had cowered behind parked cars were physically removed.  The fact that some were black only reinforced the pathos of that unsavoury vista.  Though I am <Col N="468" /> now retired and work only part-time I never again want to see or hear such actions against non-offending people in my native city.  The spectacle of police and courts being used against anybody who has not committed a crime is to my mind absolutely reprehensible.</P>
    <P>Last year the police were told to hold back arresting women going abroad for an abortion.  This year their role in relation to condoms became redundant. Now they will no longer have any legal reason to peer through the bedroom windows of gay couples. Instead they are being directed by the State against the weakest, most vulnerable and most outcast of all sexual minorities.  My citizenship of this State causes me embarrassment.  The Minister would have been better advised to leave this issue aside for the moment and not to slip it through as a mere footnote to a Bill that is otherwise sound and forward-looking.</P>
    <P>I may not agree with all the nuances of this letter but I felt it appropriate to place it on the record as an unsolicited prompt from someone who took the trouble to write to me and to put his name and address on the letter.  I received four or five letters; none of them was anonymous and some of them strongly espoused the idea of regularising and legalising prostitution on health and social grounds.</P>
    <P>As regards the nuisance caused by prostitution this may be true but we are a filthy race.  It is not only prostitutes or their clients who discard condoms everywhere. I jog on Dollymount Strand and it is the middle classes who litter them there.  On O'Connell Street people continually discard them.</P>

The house was in disastrous condition and was owned by a middle aged, middle class couple.  When I rang to complain that nuisance was being caused to the respectable married couple living in my basement flat who were being solicited by drunken sports enthusiasts to perform various acts, the solicitor laughed at me on the telephone. However, since the woman who ran the massage parlour left, was evicted or was thrown out, the place is in a deplorable state.  At least she kept it clear, tidy and swept.</P>

      <P>The Minister accepted amendments from my party about fines, and I appreciate that.  Yesterday evening I had a consultation with a legal person who represents people who may find themselves in this position.  I was told there was no way fines of this magnitude, if imposed, could be paid.  The likelihood was they would face imprisonment.  I did not put down a further amendment as the Minister had accepted other amendments and an amendment to section 8 to the effect that a person would need reasonable cause for suspicion.  That alleviated the problem.</P>
      <P>Will the Government's approach to prostitution be limited to strengthening the law and increasing penalties?  Is there any other part of the Government's or the Minister's programme to deal otherwise with this issue to help those people?</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for explaining so clearly why my amendment would be counter-productive.  I will withdraw it.  However, I still have anxieties <Col N="470" /> about these regulations being enforced in an unjust manner.  The women who solicit are easier and more likely to be picked up by the police and charged than those who kerb crawl.  The latter are a dreadful curse.  To give an example of persistence, I was followed one dark night from Burlington Road as far as Beggars' Bush and that was quite frightening.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister's intention here.  However, I hope it has been taken into account that these women will have criminal records.  The majority of those to whom I have spoken are poor and the fines are high but the Minister has explained they are the maxima.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments to the section are worrying because, as Senator Roche said yesterday, prostitution is the worst form of exploitation of a human life.  It has been suggested pimps and clients of prostitutes should be subject to the full rigours of the law but prostitutes should be treated differently. It is a horrific profession or lifestyle with nothing to recommend it.  To suggest it should be dealt with differently may send out signals to young men and women that we recognise what they are doing is a type of work.  That message should not be sent.</P>
      <P>Senator Sherlock is right to ask if the Government has another policy to deal with prostitutes.  If we were to adopt even the tone of these amendments it might become Government policy to suggest that prostitution is acceptable if a person is in particularly bad circumstances.  That could be said of 60 per cent of my constituents who are unemployed and find themselves in a position of having to shoplift.  A distinction is not made between those who shoplift because they have to and those who do not, although perhaps the judiciary should when it comes to sentencing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is suggested does not sound right although I may be mistaking the intention. We should clearly tell young boys and girls who may be considering prostitution because of desperation that it is the worst road to take.  I have a blind <Col N="471" /> spot about this and I would hate to see a softening of the tone for the unfortunates who follow this lifestyle.  The Minister says there will be a review of community service orders and that fines will not be imposed, but there must be a penalty for prostitution as well as one for those who use the services of a prostitute or else we are sending the wrong signal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to support this section.  It introduces fines and criminalises prostitutes.  I think the Government is putting the cart before the horse here.  I appreciate the Minister is attempting to tackle loitering, vagrancy and the public nuisance of prostitution. Nonetheless, we must tackle the fundamental question of why these women are on the streets.  What are their social backgrounds, their economic problems and what has forced them into this position? We also must appreciate that many of these women are on the streets unwillingly, they are forced onto the streets. They are there at the behest of people who are gaining from their activities.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission referred to the Garda Síochána; the Garda Síochána said that the non-prosecution of prostitutes for loitering seems to make little difference to its incidence.  I suggest that this section of the Bill, if it were to go through, would make no difference to the incidence of loitering on the streets, and for that reason I do not think it is useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned for these women and know many of them in my constituency. Perhaps the impression is being given here today that prostitution is peculiar to Dublin.  There are few towns in Ireland where some prostitution is not carried on, particularly in traditional port towns. Many of those engaged in prostitution come from extremely deprived backgrounds, and many of them have been victims of various types of abuses.  Most <Col N="472" /> of them come from families who have been traditionally involved in this activity and know no better.  I suggest that the Minister withdraw this section and proceed, with the Departments of Social Welfare, Health and Education, to address the real social problem &mdash; why these women are on the streets in the first place.</P>

I explained why they are not operable, and that what they were proposing could not be done for policy and technical reasons. I will confine myself to questions raised about Government policy on prostitution and what we are doing to combat this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women made a specific recommendation in this area.  This is the first time public recognition has been given to the fact that it is not only the Department of Justice which should be involved in this area, that it is not an issue that relates only to the law but that it relates to health protection and education and so on.  Therefore, at least three Departments should be involved very closely.  The Commission on the Status of Women made that recommendation because they felt there was insufficient co-operation between the Departments, and that the onus of responsibility for changes in this area had rested up to now <Col N="473" /> with the Department of Justice.  For that reason I am pleased with the commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan said she was concerned that this issue might be forgotten and that assurances I give might not be lived up to.  I wish to reassure her that that will not be the case.  All three Departments are working to see how best the recommendations of the commission can be implemented.  The commission could have gone as far as recommending a task force, a special working group or a working party to look at this area but they did not and I am not sure they had very good reason for not going that far.  In regard to taking an integrated approach of this problem, all three Departments are working on that basis.  When they come forward with proposals, I will have no hesitation, if they are within my area of responsibility, in putting them to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this section and I have already given my reasons.  The Government and the Minister may be putting the cart before the horse.  It would be advisable to proceed with the consultation required between the Departments of Health, Education, Social Welfare and Justice in relation to the social difficulties which give to prostitution, particularly as they affect the prostitutes themselves.  Why are these women involved in prostitution?  From what economic and social backgrounds do they come?  What type of under-privilege or abuse have they suffered? What are their present circumstances?  It is important that this work commence urgently to solve these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Law Reform Commission clearly suggested that the women involved in prostitution should have an input into decision making about the type <Col N="474" /> and level of service they require and designing social rehabilitation programmes. It is important that the Departments proceed along those lines because we must remember that a number of women are not voluntarily involved in prostitution.  Many of them are forced onto the streets, some work on the streets, some in brothels, some provide an up-market call service, etc.  This issue is not confined to the streets or brothels of Dublin.  Few towns do not have some level of prostitution, particularly port towns.  The issue needs to be addressed nationally.</P>
    <P>The Minister needs to address the underground operations in rural areas.  I speak of one with which I am familiar where a pimp is operating a service from a caravan, using young girls of 15, 16 or 17 years of age.  When the Gardaí investigated, they were not in a position, legally, to anything about it because they did not have a search warrant.  In a number of instances the Garda have tried to prevent prostitution operations but the operator had the upper hand under the law because the gardaí investigating were not in possession of the necessary search warrant.</P>
    <P>One issue which needs to be addressed is the social deprivation suffered by some of the prostitutes.  Admittedly there are some who are not poor, who are operating at a sophisticated level, and that issue needs to be addressed separately.  It is a wide ranging matter which needs exhaustive and extensive research and all Departments need to address it.  To bring the heavy hand of the law down on these unfortunate people without taking the initial steps of providing a rehabilitation service is unacceptable; it is putting the cart before the horse</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to this debate and it struck me that there is a mood in the House that prostitutes cause prostitution. I do not believe that is the case. It is a case of supply and demand.  The area in Limerick city where prostitutes originally were to be found was not a place anyone in their right mind would go, but to seek out prostitutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> To use a sledgehammer to hit the poor unfortunate prostitutes over the head ignores the real issue: why are they there in the first place?  Nobody has ever answered that question.  If you moved all the prostitutes from the streets, the brothels and the caravans Senator Taylor-Quinn mentioned, what would happen?  The problem would still be there, albeit in a different form.  In other words, the prostitutes are the victims and not the cause of the problem.  We need to address the reason men seek out prostitutes. If that was not there, where would they go and what would happen?</P>
    <P>This matter must be seriously addressed before we begin jailing all the prostitutes or forcing them to engage in other activities to pay the fines.  The fines are severe and I imagine many of the women involved in, for example, dockside prostitution would not have that kind of money.  If they are to pay the fines they will be further in the power of pimps and moneylenders, they will get into worse financial circumstances and may become a greater danger to themselves than before.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a brief comment on the amendment establishing a task force on prostitution which I regret was not allowed.  I will not go on tediously about it because I poached that amendment from the Workers' Party amendment in the Dáil to which the Minister responded there.</P>

      <P>I beg your pardon, the Democratic Left, what a solecism.  I altered it slightly by suggesting 12 members including representatives of the gay and lesbian community.  The response that the Second Commission on the Statue of Women did not call for the establishment of such a task force is inadequate.  It is still open to the Minister to establish such a task force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the basis for a task force is in what the Minister said about the network of relationships between the Departments <Col N="476" /> of Health, Justice and so on, dealing with this problem.  The Minister said she included the sections dealing with prostitution, although that is not the principal intention of this Bill, because a lengthy and comprehensive review would otherwise have been necessary, thereby, putting the matter on the long finger. That implies that this is an interim solution, that there wil be a long term examination and that this area may not be neglected.</P>
    <P>I recognise the difficulties in accepting the amendment at this stage and that I have spoken a great deal during the day, perhaps to the tedium of the House, but I urge that this matter not be completely dismissed.  A task force to tease our some of the problems highlighted in the House might be established specifically to look into the health and welfare of prostitutes.</P>

      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn said the the Minister is putting the cart before the horse and that we need to look at this social problem.  I agree. However, we should not look only at prostitution, we need to look at the whole area of crime &mdash; why it happens, how we respond to it and the effects of punishment.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris complained about people loitering, causing a nuisance, etc. He rings the same garda who will now have powers to concentrate on the poor, unfortunate prostitutes.  What if the Garda responded that they agree loitering is a nuisance but are looking into the social problems behind it and are not going to impose any penalties in the meantime?  That could be done across the board.</P>
      <P>Politics is probably the only other profession as old as prostitution and we still have not figured out why people engage in it.  It would seem daft to suggest that, because we are looking into the social problems behind prostitution, there will be no penalties imposed in the meantime. I could suggest many areas where we could withhold the penalties and pump money into looking at the causes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State is dealing equally with the prostitutes and the people who are using <Col N="477" /> their services and everybody who is causing the nuisance.  It is not enough to say we are looking at the social reasons and there are no penalties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I supported the amendment Senator Norris says we poached from the Democratic Left.  A task force should be set up, although the commission did not recommend it.  I put down this amendment because I am concerned at the prospect of women being put in prison.  The Minister said, that under the Criminal Justice Act community service could not be imposed on somebody unless this was commuted from a prison sentence and I withdrew the amendment.</P>
      <P>We do not want to put unfortunate women from deprived backgrounds in prison.  We are more concerned with the safety and health of, and social supports for, women involved in prostitution.  I would like to see an end to prostitution, because like the rest of society I am not content to see women &mdash; in this case prostitutes &mdash; remain as part of an under-class. We should work towards eliminating this.</P>
      <P>Senator McGennis said that prostitution is one of the oldest professions.  I do not see it as a profession but as one of the oldest forms of women's exploitation. It is only now that we, in this country, are beginning to do anything about it.  I found it very offensive when the Minister for Health spoke about women sex workers in the House last week.  I would not like the signal to go out that this is how we see these women. The exploitation of prostitutes is an exploitation of all women which we should be working towards ending.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Honan that prostitution is an absolute form of women's exploitation. If we proceed with this section not alone will we be part of that exploitation but of the further victimisation of these women. In many instances an unfortunate woman could be arrested on the street, whereas the person, usually a man, who put her there will escape the law.  I do not see that as fair in natural justice.  It will be <Col N="478" /> far easier for a garda to arrest a woman on the streets than to find the pimp.  That is not fair.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann commends the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Education on the allocation of 200 positions for additional remedial teachers and additional teachers for disadvantaged schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, should be commended for her proven commitment to remedial education in this country.  Her allocation of extra teaching posts must be viewed as the first step in a five year plan.  Already thousands of Irish children stand to benefit directly from decisions taken by her Department.  The Programme for a Partnership Government states this Government's <Col N="479" /> commitment to improve the position of Irish schoolchildren who are economically or educationally disadvantaged. The 200 appointments sanctioned by the Department includes remedial teachers and extra teachers for schools which have been designated as disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>A recent report calculated that approximately 10 per cent of the total population are illiterate.  This problem can be traced directly to disadvantages which people suffered in school.  In its report, &ldquo;Education, Inequality and Poverty&rdquo;, which is a response to the Green Paper on Education, the Combat Poverty Agency states:</P>
    <P>It is at primary level that interventions designed to address educational disadvantage are likely to have their largest impact.  Research evidence has shown that the effects of poverty have, to a significant extent, occurred before children leave primary school (Morgan, 1992).  The elimination of disadvantage, therefore, requires an attempt to identify and change those aspects of schooling which cause problems for disadvantaged students.  This fact has been borne out by research done by Mr. Mark Morgan in 1992 for the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
    <P>Recent educational research (Morgan, 1992) shows that educational disadvantages can be caused by the discontinuity between home and school experienced by disadvantaged children.  Such discontinuities flow from both the child's inability to cope with school and the school's inability to cope with the needs of disadvantaged children.  In short, this research places educational disadvantage in a socio-economic context and argues that socio-economic factors are of relatively greater significance in causing educational disadvantage, than socio-psychological ones.</P>
    <P>The submission recognised that socio-economic disadvantage is different from other disadvantages such as <Col N="480" /> physical or mental handicap.  While the Agency's focus is on addressing socio-economic disadvantage and ensuring that education is a fundamental right, it recognises the importance of ensuring that children with disabilities are catered for within the education system.</P>
    <P>We must look at the education system and see what can be done to remove disadvantages.  One way to do this is to ensure that schools have a psychological service which will help students with psychological problems.  This will ensure that every child with a learning or behavioural difficulty has access to help at the earliest stage.</P>
    <P>We should also consider socio-economic disadvantages.  Perhaps the best way to do this is to introduce some form of pre-schooling for children from a disadvantaged area.  The people who were involved in the Rutland Street project 25 years ago experienced more advantages than the children who were not involved, although they all came from the same area and socio-economic background. Some 20 to 30 years later, the children involved in that project are still experiencing its benefits.</P>
    <P>We must look at this issue in the context of a five year plan because this programme cannot be achieved overnight. The Minister must be complimented for using some of her Department's resources to create 200 remedial teacher positions.  By doing so, she is helping those who are at a disadvantage.  As a former remedial teacher, the Minister is aware of the problems faced by the education professionals.</P>
    <P>It was said in a previous debate that children should not suffer as a result of economic disadvantage.  Schools should not perpetuate this problem.  Instead, they should make a conscious effort to break the cycle of disadvantage because in some areas economic disadvantage is experienced by many generations.  We should address this problem in this generation, otherwise it will continue into the next.</P>
    <P>Since taking office the Minister has classified an extra 50 primary schools as <Col N="481" /> disadvantaged.  Within this classification, 18 schools have been given crisis status, in other words, these schools should have extra teachers.  This is acceptable because it has been proved that the numbers of children in a class will determine the teacher's effectiveness.  It is easier to identify and overcome learning difficulties if the class is small.  An attempt can be made to solve these problems if crisis areas and areas of extreme economic disadvantage are identified.</P>
    <P>Sometimes there is no point reducing the pupil-teacher ratio, although this is desirable.  It would be better if the Minister allocated the available funds to the areas of greatest need.  In some better off areas it is possible for parents to overcome any disadvantage to their child resulting from being in a large class.  They can supplement the child's education with art and music classes, grinds, books and home aids.  In a poor area and in a socially and culturally deprived home the existence of books is limited.  Some homes do not have books and there are homes where the parents are illiterate. In those circumstances it is difficult for those parents to help their children.  Help for these children must come from agents outside the home and the best agent is their local primary school.  Having identified areas which are extremely disadvantaged it is only by providing the necessary resources for those areas that these problems can be readily overcome.</P>
    <P>It is often the case that economic disadvantage and learning difficulties go together and in many ways it is easy to understand why this may be so.  If a family is poor, there may be a number of children, the father may be unemployed, the mother may not be very well educated and it could be difficult for her to identify that her child has special problems.  Problems of reading, such as dyslexia, are not often identified quickly in homes where reading is not the norm.  It is difficult for a parent to identify a reading problem in a child when the parent does not read or where the habit of reading is not there, whereas in a middle class or a better off home a mother will quickly realise that the child is not absorbing what they are <Col N="482" /> reading and they are falling behind in class.  In other words, the problem will be more easily identified in better off homes.</P>
    <P>To compensate for the inability, through no fault of their own, of the parents to identify the problems experienced by the child it is necessary that the school has the facilities whereby to identify and deal with these problems. When one talks about areas of disadvantage one is inclined to think of inner city schools or schools in the larger urban housing estates but this is not always the case.</P>
    <P>In rural areas, and in particular the poorer rural areas, economic disadvantage also exists.  Difficulties are compounded if the school is physically remote from the pupils and, they do not have access to ancillary facilities that might be available in urban areas.  For example, if a child in rural west Limerick is dyslexic and the local school does not have a remedial teacher, they will have to travel many miles to get help.  I ask the Minister when allocating more remedial teachers, as I presume she will over the next few years, to consider some of the rural areas that may be experiencing difficulties.</P>
    <P>The additional 86 remedial posts the Minister has sanctioned are shared among nearly 300 schools.  That means the numbers of pupils in some areas that have access to remedial education has increased greatly.  A previous Minister for Education admitted that in one year she allocated 19 remedial teachers to 19 schools.  We must commend this Minister for making sure that this year that number is greatly increased.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for the beginning of what I hope to be a long and successful programme.  In overcoming the disadvantages that many children have in school and in providing the extra remedial teaching posts, she has taken the first step on a programme we all hope will be a great success.</P>

      <P>I second this motion.  The problem of under achievement in schools is not unique to Ireland but is a subject <Col N="483" /> of concern for most other developed countries.  It is possible for any child not to be able to achieve at school to the extent that they themselves, their parents or their teachers would wish.  Some of them even complete formal education not having acquired the basic literacy and numeracy skills which are necessary for independent living.  Furthermore, they may not have enjoyed their experience at school.</P>
      <P>One view of learning difficulties is that there is a gap between the attainment of pupils at school and their potential. Remedial education aims at closing this gap by providing additional specialised teaching on an individual basis or in a small group.  The first teachers assigned exclusively to remedial work were appointed in the early 1960s.  Since then many schools have been crying out for such a service.  This year the Minister has appointed over 80 additional remedial teachers which, in effect, brings the total number to 200.  However, this is but a drop in the ocean and there are pupils in every school in the country who need this extra specialised help, and until it is available our education system will have failed them badly.</P>
      <P>The withdrawal model of remedial education which is widespread in our schools is not without its disadvantages, but in most cases it is the only workable option where the remedial teacher is servicing three or four schools.  However, it has a number of disadvantages; there is an emphasis on remediation rather than on prevention, it leads to the concentration on disabilities rather than abilities, it disrupts timetables, it can isolate children from the classroom work, co-operation with class teachers can be difficult to achieve and it labels the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good remedial programme should be preventative rather than be a cure.  It follows that addressing any problem that exists in infant level is crucial and this can only be done where infant classes are of manageable size.  It is impossible in infant classes of 30 or 40 pupils.  Traditional remedial education has been <Col N="484" /> centred on the learning of the less able children.  However, it is also necessary to respond to the special needs of the brighter children.</P>
    <P>Programmes of remedial education should respond to the total needs of our children.  In the case of many learning difficulties in children, which express themselves as under-achievement in reading and in mathematics, they may be the symptom of more deeply rooted problems.  With some pupils, intervention aimed at helping them to come to terms with their problem of emotional adjustment is achieved with special focus on reading and mathematics.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Cork north-west we were pleased to receive four remedial teachers.  Two were placed in my home town of Kanturk, one at St. Colman's convent national school and one at Lesmire, an outside school.  The other two have been placed at Newmarket boys and girls national school.  I congratulate the Minister for providing a remedial teacher to Meelin, regarded as the highest village in the country.  This village has in the past supplied limestone for the building of many houses of learning such as St. Coneman's College, Fermoy.  To add a little geography to the proceedings, the village also had the distinction of having oil prospectors in the past.</P>
    <P>I also contratulate the Minister for providing teachers for Rockchapel, Kilbulane-Milford, Tullylease and Drumcollogher, which is across the county boundary.  This is a rural area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>After &ldquo;schools&rdquo; to add: &ldquo;; and urges the Minister for Education to ensure that the grossly underfunded primary sector receives adequate resources to provide remedial teachers for the pupils in the other 1,500 schools around the country, which do not have access to any remediation service.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I support the motion and commend the Government and the Minister for providing the extra remedial teachers and the extra teachers for schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>In moving this amendment, which I urge be accepted, I have examined carefully the Programme for a Partnership Government and I note the commitment in the programme to provide, before 1996, an additional 500 remedial teachers.  I have examined the number of schools which at present do not have access to remediation.  I conclude that an additional 500 remedial techers to the number in the system at present &mdash; which is approximately 1,100 &mdash; will mean that virtually all schools will have some form of access to remedial teachers.  Between 1,500 and 1,900 remedial teachers are required to achieve this objective.</P>
      <P>Since, deliberately, I have not put a time scale on the amendment I see no reason the Government cannot accept that this is a logical proposal in line with that part of the Programme for a Partnership Government dealing with education. Furthermore, in that part of the programme dealing with employment and job creation, I note the Minister made a statement in Cork over the weekend on the relationship between investment in education and economic development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this is the first Minister for Education to address that point in recent times.  If more than 50 per cent of the 300,000 people who are unemployed have no qualification beyond primary level, then there is a problem at this <Col N="486" /> level.  I speak of the area in education I represent and it does not give me any pleasure to express that view, however, it is one I hear from my members.</P>
    <P>The view of a primary level teacher, a view with which I am sure the Minister would agree, would be that 95 per cent of children should know the basics of the &ldquo;three Rs&rdquo; leaving primary school.  It is clear that 95 per cent of children have the ability and the potential to learn to read in some form and if these children have not acquired these skills &mdash; and they have not &mdash; there must be a problem.</P>
    <P>In making this point, it is clear that remediation ensures that the basics are implemented.  In the recent report adopted by the European Parliament last month on the commitment to education and the connection between education and employment, specific reference was made to the need for remediation and literacy programmes to ensure employment.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the 150,000 who are unemployed and have no qualification beyond primary level are unlikely &mdash; and I choose my words carefully &mdash; either to gain or create employment.  This is where the issue of remediation arises.  I believe, and I understand from her statements that the Minister also believes, that an investment in remediation is a long term investment in job creation for the future.</P>
    <P>It is important that it be stated in this House today that the Minister has clearly indicated the direction she is taking on these two areas and that there is a consensus of support.  However, the majority of Senators have discussed with me in the last three or four months the need for a remedial teacher in their area.  It is an issue of which people are very aware.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister does not have sufficient money to meet all these needs at present, however, I ask for confirmation that the Government and the Minister will ensure that moneys will be available at some stage to provide access to remediation at primary level for all children. This is all the amendment seeks.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the EC Cohesion Fund is to eliminate levels of inequality, especially social inequality, within the <Col N="487" /> EC.  The issue of disadvantage is important. For example, a task force on crime was established in Clondalkin recently arising from difficulties in the area and the task force examined ways the Government might make an input into the Clondalkin area to reduce this disadvantage. I was dissappointed with the findings of the task force on the issue of education.  I believe there was a lack of understanding on their part.  I met teachers in the area and requested their views on the task force's report on education. These teachers spoke to the local police and to those involved in crime prevention.  The majority of the people the teachers spoke to said the first thing young people steal is food.  This shocked me to the core, although given the reports in the news today of the man charged with stealing food, perhaps I should have not been so surprised.  Such children begin stealing food and proceed to robbery and larceny.</P>
    <P>In dealing with disadvantage, a novel and imaginative approach is required whether it be by home school community liaison co-ordinators or support teachers in areas where there is high level of unemployment, underprivilege, poverty, other social problems and so on.  I understand that tomorrow the Minister will issue the list of schools which will come under&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been issued today. It is good that it was issued this week because there could have been a major controversy.</P>
      <P>The list was compiled on the basis of a consensus approach by the partners in education as to the needs of various areas.  However, in terms of specifics, in the north Clondalkin area it was felt that, apart from providing more teachers, it would be beneficial if hot meals were available and if special areas within the schools were designated for children with serious problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a daft debate going on about whether to hold parents responsible for <Col N="488" /> the crimes of their children.  It is a polite debate to have in Dublin 4 and the suburbs where most of us live, and where we can have a conversation about it over a pint but the reality is that many of these parents are afraid of their children when they get to this point and teachers, even in primary schools, are dealing with pupils who have been joy-riding through the night and come to school regularly suffering from hangovers.  You cannot blame the parents for that.  You can make certain demands of parents but it is thoroughly unfair to say that parents can be held responsible for the way their children behave.  Parents often fear these tyrants and thugs &mdash; and that is all they are.</P>
    <P>An approach that might give them some sense of well-being at school level is important.  If we approach this in a two-handed way, with remedial support and support for disadvantaged areas, at least we will begin to break that vicious cycle of deprivation and underprivilege which begins with poverty and leads to poor school attainment and qualification levels, low levels of employment and unemployment.  These are the same people who create problems down the line.  It is not coincidental that the same areas provide the highest levels of unemployment, the majority of our prison population and the largest number of drop-outs in society.  A movement towards improving that situation through remedial teaching and aiding disadvantaged areas is a step in the right direction.  I would urge the Minister to indicate that she will accept the amendment. It does not put a time limit on implementation but it does give an intent with which I hope the Minister would agree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to second the amendment because it provides an opportunity to highlight the issue raised in the original motion.  Like Senator O'Toole, I welcome the motion and I rise not in a spirit of criticism but to add my voice that the Minister accept the amendment in the spirit in which it is proferred.  I agree with Senator <Col N="489" /> O'Toole's wishes for the long term but I recognise the reality of the lack of resources in the short term.  All education areas lack resources in the short term and by comparative criteria they can all make special cases for themselves in terms of pupil-teacher ratios or staff-student ratios, for example.  The highest priority, however, ought to be remedial teaching where there is a choice of resources being shifted in one direction or another.</P>
      <P>I have said frequently that the education system bears too heavy a burden of expectation in terms of rectifying social injustice, and that the education system cannot, on its own, compensate for structural injustice in society.  On the other hand, there are some things that only the education system can deliver, and effective remedial teaching is one of them.  The needs of remedial teaching extend far beyond the immediate needs of the classroom and impose enormous demands on remedial teachers whose occupation is a skilled one.</P>
      <P>Normally when one reads responses to the Green Paper on Education one normally makes allowance for the special pleading of various groups that reply. While I presume there is some special pleading in the response by the Association of Remedial Teachers of Ireland, their special interests happen to coincide with general interests to a much greater extent than is the case with a number of other responses.  While I am no expert in the area, it seems to me that the bulk of what they say is cogent and coherent. They argue that remedial teachers should be specialists in the field of compensatory education and they are disappointed that no reference to their training is included in the document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Training in general is grossly neglected in that document.  While accepting the pressures that are on the Minister, we devote a derisory proportion of our total education budget to training of all types. Remedial teaching is one area where training is essential, and on-going in-service training should remain a high priority.  I am aware of the inadequate funding elsewhere in the education system and in my own university department <Col N="490" /> I have a staff-student ratio of 1:40. Even so, in discussing the application of whatever funding may be coming from Europe, priority ought to go to the most defenceless areas, such as primary education and remedial education, and at as young an age as possible.  The earlier children can be catered for the better the chance of something emerging before they are lost, because it becomes a losing battle later in the system.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly referred to the problems in rural and urban areas, and I accept what she said.  However, there is a cluster of disadvantage in many of the urban areas which are suffering in a number of ways, and although ancillary services are available there are many parallel pressures in urban areas that are not replicated in rural areas.  In urban areas there is an intensity of the type of vicious circles &mdash; or vicious lines because they are not circles at all &mdash; of deprivation and underprivilege that incorporate unemployment and anti-social behaviour in generation after generation of families.</P>
    <P>Given that resources are scarce, one has to have enormous sympathy for the demands from these deprived urban areas, and that is not to speak against the legitimate demands of rural areas.  When the Minister is setting her priorities, however, I would understand her dealing first with those urban areas while keeping the plight of rural children in mind.</P>
    <P>Another reason I hope she will accept the amendment is that it does not, as Senator O'Toole says, impose time pressure but tries what is a worthwhile, commendable and admirable initiative which we hope will be continued with all the energy and commitment the Minister has already shown.  In so far as our amendment can be helpful, I hope she will take it in that spirit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and am glad of the opportunity to say a few words on this motion and the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one knows better than I what remedial and disadvantage mean because I work in a disadvantaged area as a career guidance counsellor.  I deal with students <Col N="491" /> whose socio-economic background means they are in need of extra teaching resources.  What do we mean by &ldquo;disadvantage?&rdquo; It really means that if there is no remedial teacher in a school, that school is disadvantaged and we need a remedial teacher in every school in the country.  The Minister has started going down that road and is aware of the importance of having a remedial teacher in every school because whether they are primary or second level schools, there will be a minority of students who need extra help.</P>
    <P>Looking at the transition from primary to secondary education one recognises the lack of remedial teaching in the primary school.  In other words, students from homes with a lack of resources, no support group, and stress-related problems, feel at a disadvantage in school because they are not able to cope with the normal curriculum.  They have nowhere to go and, because the class sizes are so big, they are lost.  They may not necessarily be in need of remedial teaching in the sense that they have learning disabilities &mdash; it may be that they just need extra help &mdash; but they are lost to the education system and to society at large.</P>
    <P>Researchers have pointed out that very few students from disadvantaged backgrounds go on to third level education. References by Clancy and Kathleen Lynch from UCD clearly indicate that the needs of students from the lower socio-bracket are not being recognised because of the lack of resources in schools to help along the way by giving them the necessary props before they go into second level.  These problems must be tackled in primary school before it is too late.</P>
    <P>If a remedial teacher is to be introduced into every school a whole range of resources must be provided.  It will also cost a lot to find a suitable programme which will vary from school to school and from pupil to pupil.  Small numbers in classes and a withdrawal system in schools are necessary because pupils may not be remedial in every subject.  They <Col N="492" /> may be remedial in one or two subjects and in that case there would have to be a timetable arrangement within the system which will free teachers and complement remedial teachers.</P>
    <P>We are discussing 200 remedial teachers, and I do not know whether those teachers have been allocated to primary or second level schools.  This motion states 200 positions for additional remedial teachers and for additional teachers for disadvantaged schools.  I would like this clarified.  I hope not all the 200 teachers will go to primary schools. While I know that primary education is the foundation, nevertheless the schools in the large urban areas must be examined and prioritised.  I would not like to think I am neglecting my rural background because there is a better chance of finding students who may be less skilled in certain subjects or have a lower IQ in a less populated area.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the pupil-teacher ratio is reduced.  The school population is declining and that must release more teachers and resources.  I know this is happening because I deal with this area and the drop in numbers of students coming into second level is obvious.  This is something that should be examined.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about child centred education but, so far, I do not see much progress in that regard. I hope we will move futher in that direction and that it will be tied in with the education programme, the book schemes and a range of subjects.  The Department of Education will also have to examine the subject range for the junior certificate examination.  In first year all classes are often required to cover a wide range of subjects.  As Senator O'Toole said, we are back to the three Rs.  If one loses sight of the three Rs &mdash; and this relates to my background and to that of my father who was a teacher and always held this view &mdash; and if we cannot get that right by the time the pupil is 11 or 12 years of age, there is no foundation.  Reading, writing and arithmetic must be part of the Department's education strategy in primary schools.  If we get that right and <Col N="493" /> if we bring in a remedial teacher to make sure they can read and write by the time they move into second level we can give them a junior certificate.  We can train them for skills orientation jobs, and we can place them, but if we lose sight of the three Rs we can forget it.</P>
    <P>There is a discipline problem in second level.  I welcome the idea of the school home link and the guidance counsellor However, if there are to be remedial teachers in school, consideration must also be given to having a guidance counsellor an education psychologist and child guidance clinics.  All these areas must work together because remedial teachers cannot work in isolation because if they need to refer a student to an education psychologist very often one cannot be found.</P>
    <P>While I welcome this move, there is still a lot to look for in terms of the broader education for the less well off student.  I do not blame the Department entirely.  It has been said that education starts in the home and one is taught in school, so we must consider involving parents not only when things are bad but when they are going well.  We must make schools user friendly so that parents can come without feeling apprehensive about meeting teachers.  If that was the norm when things go wrong the parents could help to work out a programme for the child and this could be continued in the home.  Very often the ethos in the home and the ethos in the school are not correlated and that destroys what is being done in the school because all is forgotten at home.</P>
    <P>Remedial teaching is about educating parents in terms of what is involved for a student.  I welcome the remedial programme. There should be liaison between a remedial teacher and an education psychologist.  The programme can only work when they operate together for the overall benefit of the child.  Ideally we should consider education for life and not just education in a particular subject or for an examination.  We are talking about preparing students for the new world and jobs in the future will be different from the jobs of today.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> Things are changing all the time.  I hope there will be equality of opportunity for all students because they should be cherished equally.  Perhaps in the next decade Clancy will be in a position to state that there are many students from disadvantaged areas in second level going on to third level colleges.  I would welcome that because I am not happy with the current situation.  I hope there will also be a guidance counsellor in every school.  I suggest that remedial teachers should be considered as ex-quota, that they will not have any other teaching or administrative duties.  We are going in the right direction and I look forward to progress in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is good that she has returned here and that we have another opportunity to exchange views.</P>
      <P>We must consider having a remedial teacher in every school.  It does not make sense otherwise.  This motion gives the impression that everything is fine and that every student is being looked after properly but that is not the case.  I do not know where the figure 200 came from because as the Department is aware the figure is 86.  The Minister has evidently sanctioned 86 posts and I note she has looked after Senator Cashin very well. He is very happy because many schools in his area have been looked after but everybody cannot say the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department could not tell me today to what the 200 referred, and I assume the Minister has a number of things in the pipeline that she will announce during the summer.  We look forward to that but I have a list of the 86 posts in front of me; this figure of 200 mystifies me.  It does not refer to 200 schools either because the service the Minister has put in place this year takes in 305 schools.  The mystery will continue until the Minister replies.  The impression might be that things are fine in the country but this is not the case.  When the Minister has increased the figure of 86 to 200, as I assume she will, half the schools in the country will still be without a remedial service.  If the Minister is proud <Col N="495" /> of her achievement on one side, she will have to be ashamed of it on the other. That stands to reason.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>It does; there are many students in Cork who do not have the services of a remedial teacher.  That is one of the bald facts on which we must ponder for a while.</P>
      <P>Next September half the schools will not have the services of a remedial teacher and some of those schools will be incredibly disadvantaged.  It is difficult to discern the definition of disadvantage. Are we aware that 580 schools around the country have two, three or four classes with between 30 and 39 students in the same classroom.  This places a great deal of stress and strain on the system. One has third, fourth and fifth classes and between 30 and 40 students in the classroom and no remedial teacher available for as little as a quarter of an hour per week.  It is stressful for the teachers who are in that position and it is difficult for parents who have children in such classes.  The parents are responding and regularly call to my clinics and to my house asking how they are going to get the services of a remedial teacher for their children who are not doing well in school.  It is aggravating for parents because they are aware that if their children do not have education, they will be disadvantaged in the workplace as well.  We are all conscious of that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister expresses pride in what she has done she must also apologise to the schools which will not have remedial teachers next September.  I have heard many stories over the last few years. Somebody with dyslexia can slip through the primary system and enter secondary education before it is discovered. Teachers have told me that they notify the psychological section about students who have difficulties, years pass and the students are never called for assessment. It is a terrible indictment of the education system that this can happen but it is happening. Students are passing through the <Col N="496" /> national school system before they are assessed, and that is happening in schools where there is no remedial service.</P>
    <P>We would all like students to leave education feeling confident and able to cope with the basics of communication and with life.  We are sending students out of school every year who do not have the basic skills required to cope with life. Until such time as that problem is addressed we cannot really congratulate ourselves. If we do, we must apologise as well.</P>
    <P>The system needs more resources.  This may or may not mean money.  Because the population cohort for national schools is decreasing, there will be more teachers available without the need for additional financial resources and over a few years the required number of teachers will become available.  The proposed amendment is attainable without committing extra resources to the area.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with some of the information I have received recently.  It has been suggested to me that there is an element of politics involved in the appointments which were made, and that is disturbing.  Indeed, Senator Cashin's comments would tend to lend weight to that as he was very proud of the fact that his own little area was looked after; that would imply other areas were looked after not quite so well.</P>

Schools have informed me that having applied ten years ago, they were <Col N="497" /> by-passed, even though they had well over the 10 per cent quota in favour of other schools which applied recently and in some cases, schools got teachers even though they never applied.  I think the Minister will be able to verify that if she is pressed.  The schools are also annoyed because Labour Party people have been informed of appointments before the schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the Seanad.  She was a remedial teacher so she will know the significance of having a remedial teacher in a school. Under the Programme for a Partnership Government there was a commitment given that more remedial teachers would be appointed, and I welcome the appointment of another 86 at this time.  I also welcome the fact that, in Donegal, four remedial teachers were appointed to cover 17 schools.  The people in the area also welcomed the appointments.  I was examining some figures in relation to schools in the Clonmany area which showed that in one school with a roll of 114 children, there were 30 in need of remedial help; in another school there were 132 pupils and there were 21; in another school there were 132 pupils, 21 of whom were in need of remedial help; the third school had 85 pupils of whom 24 needed remedial help in English and 23 in mathematics.  Of those 85 pupils, 78 came from families which held medical cards and 72 from families in receipt of unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that many of the additional remedial teachers are going to rural areas because most of them were sent to urban areas before this.  This means that 76 per cent of all pupils now <Col N="499" /> have access to remedial services.  I congratulate the Minister for seeing and responding to the urgent needs of deprived children in rural areas.  In the allocation of the new posts she gave priority to schools which had no remedial support.  For example, in County Mayo remedial provision increased from 36 to 56 per cent and provision for County Leitrim increased from 43 to 63 per cent coverage.</P>
    <P>Home liaison officers are important to forge links between school and home. When there is a huge cultural difference between home and society many teachers, for example those of itinerant children, find that a liaison person is vital if parents and children are to learn that education is important for the future.  The system should work both ways and the need to recognise home values should also be understood.  Often schools and teachers seem to reinforce middle class values to the detriment of other value systems, particularly in the case of itinerant children.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator O'Toole point in relation to Structural Funds, the ESRI report on Structural Funds stresses the need to have educational disadvantages addressed at primary level.  I have no doubt that the Minister will work hard to see that this is done and that the proper funding is given to the areas where help is needed.  It is easier and cheaper to solve learning problems at the youngest level than to attempt to remedy the problem later on with Youthreach programmes.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the work which she has done.  I have no doubt that if she had more funding it would have been spent providing remedial teachers in disadvantaged areas.  I welcome her commitment and thank her.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment and I would be surprised if it was <Col N="500" /> not supported by Senators on all sides of the House.  Young people are leaving primary school illiterate, which is the worst situation one could envisage, and the number has increased over the last few years.  Consequently, I support the amendment which seeks to provide remedial teachers for the pupils in the 1,500 schools which do not have access to remedial services.  If we are to cherish all the children of our nation equally, the Minister has no choice but to appoint remedial teachers.  Not to do so would be an abdication of responsibility.  It is a vitally important area on which I hold strong views.</P>
      <P>I know Senator Cashin has been working hard and he referred to areas west of Kanturk, The parish of Glantane is outside my area but I received a letter which stated that in this school year, 1992-93, there are more than 270 pupils in the four primary schools in the parish, and quite a number of children have been identified as having learning difficulties and urgently need expert tuition from a remedial teacher.  I wrote to the Minister and received a reply on 4 May 1993 which mentioned that as a first step towards honouring the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government 80 additional remedial teachers would be appointed with effect from September 1993.  However, I received no indication that Glantane was included.</P>
      <P>Kilcredan and Chonpriest national schools have applied for remedial teaching services on a number of occasions during the last decade and on the last occasion the divisional inspector visited both schools to verify the number of pupils needing remedial teachers.  On that point I think the requirement of a catchment area of 500 pupils to justify the appointment of a remedial teacher should be examined.  The schools were advised in 1991 by a former Minister for Education that their case would receive urgent priority.  To date I have not heard that a remedial teacher has been appointed to those schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wrote to the Minister on that question and had discussions with a number of schools.  There is something radically <Col N="501" /> wrong with our primary education system.  Where such a high percentage of our children require additional tuition from a remedial teacher, it is an abdication of responsibility not to appoint such teachers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support Senator O'Toole's amendment.  I regard it as being moderate in tone and a good amendment.  My record of having amendments accepted in this House is particularly unfortunate, so saying I support this amendment is probably conferring upon it the kiss of death.  I want to raise a particular case with the Minister.  I do not expect her to have an immediate answer but perhaps, throught her Department, she would investigate the situation for me.</P>
      <P>I should say at the outset that I have a vested interest in the matter in that I am a member of the board of management of the school in question and my children received an excellent education there. Fortunately, they did not require the services of a remedial teacher.  An important principle which would be accepted by all is that people at a disadvantage should be looked after by society, particularly disadvantaged children.</P>
      <P>The school in question is Scoil Bhríde, in Athgarvan, County Kildare.  In 1982 that school applied for a remedial teacher.  In 1986 the principal of the school was told by an inspector of the Department that they would be getting a remedial teacher to be shared with the neighbouring school of Two Mile House. It even reached the point of discussing the allocation of time for this teacher but nothing happened.  The most recent state of affairs is that Two Mile House, which was to share with Athgarvan, has been included with Brownstown and Suncroft, two other schools in the area, and a post has been advertised for a remedial teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These advances are to be welcomed. However, even apart from the aspect of geography, it does not make sense because the school in the middle is being ignored.  The other school involved is St. Patrick's Church of Ireland school in <Col N="502" /> Newbridge, County Kildare.  Both schools would be prepared to share a teacher.  My question is, what is the status of the application from the schools at present?</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Cotter about the numbers mentioned in the motion.  There is a belief among parents and teachers in the area &mdash; and I am not just putting forward my own view &mdash; that politics has had a bearing on this matter and that objective criteria have not been followed. It is a cause of concern that certain public representatives are notified of decisions &mdash; not in respect of this matter but in respect of other matters &mdash; while others are not; they may receive late notification or no notification and only find out what has happened from talking to other people.</P>
    <P>These are the only two schools within a 30 mile radius and they have no remedial teacher.  A school in Newbridge with 500 pupils has two teachers and, although those teachers may be necessary, it seems wrong that one school has no remedial teacher while other has two.  I ask the Minister to investigate this matter.  Perhaps she would outline the objective criteria followed by the Department when making such appointments.  I would also like to know when Scoil Bhríde will be allocated a remedial teacher.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the amendment.  I wish to outline what has been achieved not only in the area of remedial teaching but in the provision of educational services in the other disadvantaged areas.  I think it is accepted by the House that as Minister for Education, I accorded top priority to addressing the needs of those who are the victims of socio-economic deprivation and those who suffer from physical or mental disability and I am pleased to have been able to allocate an additional 200 teaching posts to this task, with effect from September next.  Those teachers are freed for other duties because of the drop in the number of schoolgoing children at primary level. They will be allocated not only to remedial teaching but also in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="503" /> My experience both in the teaching profession and in political life has long ago convinced me of the need for a special effort to focus on the needs of the educationally disadvantaged in our society.  There is abundant evidence that educational qualifications or the lack of them determine to a large extent the life chances of our young people.  The likelihood of obtaining educational qualifications is closely associated with social background and the children of socioeconomically deprived groups constitute a majority of those who do not benefit from the educational system.</P>
    <P>The link between educational deprivation and unemployment is clear.  The majority of those who are long term unemployed have few or no educational qualifications, have left school early and have not benefited from an education system which should cherish all children equally.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that education plays an indirect but important part in the perpetuation of poverty.  The children of deprived groups are themselves most likely to leave the education system early, experience unemployment and to have limited life chances.  Thus the cycle of deprivation is perpetuated.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Education I see breaking this cycle of deprivation as the single greatest challenge facing our education system.  I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to take concrete measures to break this cycle and in so doing to have the firm backing of all my colleagues in the Government, whose commitment to this area is strongly reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    <P>To combat educational disadvantage we must focus on intervention in the early years of the child's life.  Research findings indicate that pre-schooling is effective in improving school performance, especially with significant parental involvement.  Where areas of socio-economic disadvantage are concerned, therefore, I see a particularly important role for pre-schools as a means of generating early awareness of the role of education <Col N="504" /> in children's overall development.  The importance of this area was specifically recognised in the Programme for a Partnership Government and I am pleased to announce that I will shortly introduce an initiative in this area under which my Department will resource the establishment, on a pilot basis, of a number of pre-schools attached to primary schools in areas of recognised particular disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the service will be to expose young children to an educational programme which would enhance their overall development and prevent school failure and to offset the effects of social disadvantage.  The service will provide an opportunity for parents to develop their capacities to educate their own children by involving them in all stages of the development and operation of the service including planning, organisation and implementation.  It will also allow for community partnership and participation in developing and operating an important local service.</P>
    <P>The service will be accommodated in vacant classrooms in primary schools in the selected areas.  The teachers involved will be on the staff of the school and will be under the general supervision of the board of management and of the principal teacher.  I intend to allocate 16 teaching posts to this important pilot pre-school service in areas of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Partnership between parents and the school is essential in combating educational disadvantage.  Our partnership approach must emphasise that the parent is the child's principal educator whose relationship with the teacher is one in which the roles are equal and complementary.</P>
    <P>It is evident that a crucial consideration in developing greater participation in education by children from disadvantaged areas is the need to interest and involve parents in their children's education.  The home-school-community liaison service is targeted specifically at this area.  The liaison teachers attached to this service, who are referred to as co-ordinators, are engaged full time in working with schools, parents and local <Col N="505" /> groups in fostering closer contacts between parents of pupils and their schools.  By developing a greater appreciation on the part of parents of the positive contribution which they can make to their children's development and by breaking down barriers between parents and those who deliver the education service, the home-school-liaison service is making a very valuable contribution to overcoming educational disadvantage in these areas.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to have been able to appoint an additional 15 co-ordinators to the service with effect from September next.  This will bring the total number of co-ordinators involved in the service to 60 and will facilitate the inclusion of an additional 27 schools in the service.  The home-school-liaison service will now cover a total of over 33,000 pupils in disadvantaged schools.  Evaluations of the effectiveness of this service to date suggest that it is having a most positive impact in the areas in which it operates and I have decided to put the service on a permanent footing with effect from September next.  I intend in the coming years to develop the service further in line with the Government's commitment to this area.</P>
    <P>The disadvantaged areas scheme plays an important part in our initiatives to break the cycle of deprivation by early intervention at primary school level. Schools included in this scheme not only receive an extra teaching post but qualify for a supplementary capitation grant at a rate of £17 per pupil over the increased and approved capitation grant that is now £33 per pupil.  This means £50 per pupil in a disadvantaged school.  I have approved the allocation of an additional 50 concessionary teaching posts to facilitate the inclusion of an extra 50 schools in the disadvantaged schemes.  This initiative will result in 258 primary schools which will involve 73,000 pupils being included in the scheme.</P>
    <P>Schools selected for inclusion in the scheme are being chosen on the basis of priority of need as demonstrated by a range of socio-economic criteria.  I would ask for evidence of political interference to be brought to my attention.  I have <Col N="506" /> withstood many persuasive arguments because I accepted the criteria laid down in this report long before I became Minister for Education.  Perhaps the situation has changed &mdash; I do not wish to judge previous holders of this office &mdash; but I am satisfied, in my commitment to transparency, with this criteria.  Some schools who never contacted me got a remedial teacher because writing a letter to me is not one of the criteria established in 1990 and under which I have and am making, these appointments.  Some Senators have been involved in political life much longer than I and know we must adhere to criteria already laid down and I am satisfied with what is happening.  Perhaps the Senators should listen and then look at the schools to which they have referred.  Senator Dardis has not asked me to comment on his school because he accepts that I would not have the relevant information.  If two different schools are considered, the criteria taken into account are not the number of pupils there, but the incidence of unemployment, medical card holders and local government housing occupancy. Account is also taken of an assessment by my Department's inspectorate of the needs of individual schools and the prevailing pupil-teacher ratios in schools seeking disadvantaged status.  All primary schools not already included in the scheme were recently invited to apply for these 50 posts to be allocated and Senators will be pleased to hear that the decisions on the schools selected will be made early next week.</P>

      <P>Additionally, another 18 of my 200 posts are being allocated as extra concessionary posts to schools already included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  These posts will be based on pupil numbers and will go to the largest schools already in the scheme, which currently have one concessionary post, and to schools which have been identified as having particularly acute difficulties at present and would benefit from additional staffing resources.  Details on the schools selected for receipt of these posts will be announced early next week.</P>
      <P>In addition to these posts, I am also allocating a significant increase in the levels of funding to schools in disadvantaged areas in the current year.  The level of expenditure under the disadvantaged areas fund in the current year, at £2.618 million, represents close to a 40 per cent increase over the 1992 figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various measures I have outlined above concern the allocation of additional staffing resources and while I have no doubt that these resources will be greatly welcomed &mdash; I thank the Senators who thanked me on behalf of those schools who have already received these resources &mdash; I am also conscious that, in many cases where socio-economic disadvantage exists, the need can be of a financial rather than a staffing nature. Therefore, I have decided to specifically target financial assistance to schools whose primary need is financial.  I have decided to allocate £250,000 in the current year to selected schools identified as having particularly acute financial difficulties at present.  The process of selecting recipient schools for this special <Col N="508" /> support has been agreed between my Department, the INTO and the schools management and will be based on attested financial data submitted to my Department by the schools management. I am confident that this new initiative will provide welcome relief for schools in disadvantaged areas whose current burden is inhibiting their potential for development.</P>
    <P>I have also decided to allocate £100,000 for distribution to schools which demonstrates a significant level of socio-economic disadvantage but which did not qualify for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme this year.  The schools selected will be given a supplementary capitation grant at a rate of £17 per pupil and decisions on those schools will also be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>Moving from what we would recognise as the remedial area, there is a disadvantaged group, already referred to in this debate, who require special attention and they are the children of traveller families.  My Department already provides 160 special classes for such children around the country and a special teaching post has been allocated in each case to deal with the special needs of these children.  Additionally, a valuable support system for this group is the visiting teacher service for travellers, which provide the extra back-up which such children need so that they can maximise their educational potential.  I have decided to appoint a further two posts to this service &mdash; with effect from September 1993.  This will bring to 11 the number of visiting teachers in the service who, together with the national education co-ordinator for traveller children, will ensure that the children in question receive the extra support they need.</P>
    <P>Individual pupils can experience disadvantage within the education system if learning difficulties are not recognised and remediated in good time.  I recognise the value of remedial teaching and I am pleased to have allocated an additional 86 posts to this service, bringing the total number of such posts to 1,031.  As a result, a total number of 390,000 pupils in our primary schools now have access <Col N="509" /> to a remedial service.  This represents a coverage, not in the number of schools but in that of pupils, which is the most important factor of all.  Some 77 per cent of all primary school pupils now have access to a remedial service.  Everything in the garden is not rosy but I am satified that the situation is improving and I am committed, with the support of the Senators, in ensuring that further resources are obtained so that, during this Government's term in office, the roses will bloom in Senator O'Toole's garden.</P>
    <P>Over the coming years, I intend to make further progress in this area in line with the Government's commitment to appoint an additional 500 remedial teachers by September 1996.  Disadvantage exists not only among socio-economic groups and individuals with learning difficulties but also among children who suffer from physical and mental handicap and they have their own special needs.  It is the policy of my Department to encourage the integration of handicapped pupils into ordinary schools and classes to the maximum extent possible. The extent to which this can be achieved and the pace of this development will, of course, depend on the capacity of individual children to cope in the integrated setting.</P>
    <P>There will always be a need for special facilities to meet the needs of those who suffer from more severe forms of handicap and special schools and classes will continue to provide this service, where necessary.  However, where integration is possible, it can be extremely benefical to the children concerned and I am anxious to encourage schools to foster this process.  I am pleased to say that many of our schools have already successfully embarked on this course and I take this opportunity to compliment them &mdash; the teaching profession on their initiative and dedication.</P>
    <P>Since it is important that the efforts of schools in fostering the integration process should not go unrecognised, I have, decided to allocate a number of additional resource teacher posts to this area.  These posts will be allocated to <Col N="510" /> schools which have been identified as having a number of handicapped children in ordinary classes.  The resource teacher will act in support of the ordinary teaching staff in dealing with the handicapped children and will thus ensure that these children are given that extra support they need in the classroom.  It also recognises the extra support which teachers who take on this job need in their classrooms.</P>
    <P>I consider that the initiatives I have detailed provide a firm indication of the Government's commitment to the needs of primary schools and their pupils in disadvantaged areas, to children with learning difficulties and to children with special needs and that they will be a sufficient encouragement to the schools, teachers and parents involved.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators from both sides who have given me the opportunity to highlight what has been achieved in this area. In the six months since this Government took office, Senators can see the progress which has been made in relation to the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  During the next four years, Senators will be able to see where we are going and I ask for their support for the sake of the children and their parents, the partners involved in education.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Statistics, press reports and Members have emphasised the problem of the increasing number of young people leaving school unable to read or write.  This highlights the need for more remedial teachers.  I speak not as a Senator but as a teacher working with disadvantaged students in County Galway vocational education committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am Chairman of the Adult Education Board in County Galway vocational education committee.  We have under our jurisdiction ten training centres of which we are proud.  Those attending these centres <Col N="511" /> are early school leavers who struggled through primary school and could not cope with secondary school.  If remedial teachers had been available the majority of those young people would not have been early school leavers or attending these centres.  A number of these young people have fallen by the wayside and have been in trouble with the law.  This sad situation could have been averted had remedial teachers been available.</P>
    <P>This problem has always existed but it is getting worse.  I bring to the Minister's attention a rare situation in rural areas which is causing concern and economic hardship for parents.  I highlight an example from my parish.  The parish of Lackagh, Turloughmore, County Galway, has four schools, but no remedial teacher; 480 pupils attend these schools.  During the past number of years we have appealed to the various Ministers for Education to have a remedial teacher sited in the parish.  However, the call has fallen on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>Parents with children in need of remedial attention must travel 12 miles to the nearest city, Galway city.  They must pay approximately £12 per hour for grinds &mdash; I have no quarrel with that fee because it is difficult work.  These children must travel at least once a week to the city to receive remedial attention and it is an expensive exercise.  Parents face travel expenses and perhaps babysitting costs.  This a major problem in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Although my family can afford a motor car, many families face transportation difficulties.  At four or five o'clock in the afternoon, when these children must go to the city, buses are not available and one could not contemplate getting a taxi at that time of the day.  This a major problem for parents in rural areas with children in need of remedial attention.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in places like the parish of Lackagh, a remedial teacher could be shared in the ratio of one teacher for 400 pupils.  I realise that this ratio is high, but it would be of enormous benefit.  While I am pleased that a number of neighbouring <Col N="512" /> parishes have been allocated remedial teachers, the parish of Lackagh, which has four national schools, is still in limbo.  Many parents face the dilemma of having to bring their children to Galway city for remedial attention.  We would appreciate if something could be done in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the city of Galway a number of mildly mentally handicapped students have been removed from the system and have been integrated into ordinary national schools.  This will not be successful unless the appropriate services are provided.  I refer, in particular, to the Holy Family school and the Burrenview school where major problems exist.</P>
    <P>As a teacher, I highlight an area with which I am conversant.  I ask the Minister to consider the idea of a parish module for rural schools.  A teacher with remedial qualifications could be allocated to rural parishes with four or five schools and approximately 400 pupils.  In addition, I ask the Minister to consider the allocation of remedial teachers to schools in large cities, particularly where mildly mentally handicapped children have been removed from mildly mentally handicapped schools and placed in ordinary schools.  While there are problems in relation to funding, perhaps the Minister for Finance will respond favourably to the Minister's requests.  I hope the Minister will respond favourably to the amendment being tabled this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank her for her contribution. I put forward my case in relation to the proposed remedial teachers.  There are two areas I wish to mention and I know the Minister is dealing with one.  In the Glin area of west Limerick, the school which services the disadvantaged areas of Ballyhahill, Loghill and Ballyguiltenane, out of 300 plus children there are approximately 30 in need of remedial teaching.  I ask the Minister to give this matter her favourable consideration as quickly as possible. The other school is my own local school which has been applying for a remedial teacher for many years.  This school has <Col N="513" /> pupils from Kilfinny, Croagh and Cappagh and about 40 children in the school require remedial teaching.  In Bawnmore there is a child in urgent need of remedial teaching, the family are paying £6 for group therapy with a remedial teacher. There is a special problem in this area which has an unusually high incidence of cystic fibrosis and many of these children fall behind and require remedial teaching.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister spoke about traveller children.  I wish to raise the issue of traveller children in Rathkeale and the provision of a liaison officer for St. Annes's school and the boy's school in Rathkeale.  I raised this matter on the Adjournment some time ago but the Minister was not in a position to come to the House.  There are 100 traveller children in St. Anne's school and from now on there will be a similar number in the boy's school.  Most of these children are in special classes.  There are special problems in St. Anne's school.  We need to encourage the parents of these children to continue the children's education and we should stress to them the importance of primary education to the traveller community.  A home school liaison officer is very necessary.  When this problem is mentioned outside Rathkeale, people cannot believe that the Department do not give it the attention it needs because of the unique problems there.</P>
      <P>The school staff works very hard with the traveller parents.  Traveller children usually attend the early years of primary school but they do not see the need for continuing education at a later stage because the parents cannot help the children with their homework.  People are entitled to educate their children as they wish and this also applies to travellers but it would be of help to the children if a liaison officer was available to liaise between the school and the parents.  I hope some of the money which the Minister mentioned will be allocated to travellers will be used in this area.  I ask that the school be designated as disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>I will speak for five minutes.  I welcome the Minister.  I appreciate how well she has done in what is an extremely difficult job in the months she has been in the Department.  It must be one of the most difficult Departments because of the vast amount and variety of work.  I sincerely hope that she can adhere to her aspiration of laying down criteria because it will be a difficult one to implement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to briefly refer to the pre-school pilot programme which is a very good initiative and is welcome.  The home school liaison scheme is undoubtedly a very good one and I am delighted it is being made permanent and expanded <Col N="515" /> and that the visitors service for teachers is also being expanded.</P>
    <P>I wish to dwell for a few moments on two areas, disadvantaged areas with particular reference to the remedial teaching and the integration of special needs.  It is welcome that there are 200 new posts in remedial education. However the Minister would agree that many more posts are needed.  I would describe Senator O'Toole's amendment as aspirational.  We would all like to see 1,500 extra remedial teachers provided, however, the reality is that the resources are not there to provide as many teachers as the Minister and all of us would like.</P>
    <P>While there is a cry for remedial teachers to be appointed to schools throughout the country, and I would join in that demand, I am convinced from experience that if parents were more significantly involved in the education of their children, many of the remedial problems we have in primary schools today would not exist.  Some effort should be made, perhaps on a pilot basis, to educate parents as to the necessity for constant attention to and assistance for their children.  I am convinced that many remedial problems are due to the fact that parents do not give any attention or assistance to their children when they are doing their homework.  Teachers cannot be expected to provide the level of assistance that is necessary.  Many children who find learning difficult would, in my view, perform much better if they received pesonal attention at home.</P>
    <P>There is no liaison of significant degree between teachers and parents.  There is liaison to a certain level.  Teachers do their best to communicate with parents and to involve and motivate them, but I am not aware &mdash; and the Minister can correct me if I am wrong &mdash; of any structured system where the Department provides support services for teachers in schools to involve parents in an effective and meaningful way.  If this were done it would alleviate many of the problems for school children who cannot read or write because they do not get help at home.  If my wife did not sit down with our children <Col N="516" /> every evening they would not learn.  I am convinced that in deprived areas especially, because of the difficulties with which parents have to contend and which I am glad that the Minister is tackling, not enough support and assistance are being provided.</P>
    <P>With regard to disadvantaged areas, I made the point the last time the Minister was in the House that there is a growing gap between the haves and the have nots. The initiatives the Minister announced this evening will help to narrow that gap but a much more radical approach is needed.  I welcomed the Minister's interest.  It is clear from her speech that she is very keen to tackle the problem of deprivation.  I suggest that until we identify clearly disadvantaged areas, such as Neilstown &mdash; and I do not mind mentioning it &mdash; and provide them with resources, they will not achieve the results they deserve.</P>
    <P>The problem will be, as the Minister and her officials will know, that the Department of Finance will simply not want to provide money for this.  I would say to the Minister for Finance, his officials and the Taoiseach &mdash; I know I do not have to say it to the Minister present &mdash; that a good return on investment would be achieved if there were a significant increase in the amount of money granted to the Department of Education to prevent the problems we are seeing in this and other cities because of the cycle of deprivation suffered by these people.  Until we adopt a radical approach and are prepared to provide a huge level of resources, the problem will not be tackled effectively.  Investing in these areas would provide a good return.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that tourists are being attacked by children who are deprived. There but for the grace of God go I because, if I was reared in the deprivation I have seen in some parts of this city I would be a bigger blackguard than any of them.  We do not give these kids a fair chance and until we do we can expect to have problems associated with crime and vandalism.  The integration of special needs should be pursued by the Minister, but that will require a great deal of courage. <Col N="517" /> Specialist interests do not want integration but it is the correct way to help the children involved.  There must be special schools with special needs but many of the children in such schools should not be there and they are not being educated as well as they would be in an ordinary national school with proper support services. Again I accept these are costly.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  I also thank Senator Gallagher and Senator Fahey for sharing their time with me.  I welcome the Minister.  I take tremendous pride in the work she has done on the issue of remedial teachers.  She more than anyone else present knows how much is still to be done in this area.  If there had not been financial constraints, I am sure this work would be at a more advanced stage.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister has started to tackle the problems for the travelling community.  It has already been said this area must be investigated and the faults remedied.  A good education is the best way to gain respect in society.  If the travelling community is not given a chance to be educated that respect will not be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>We must also consider the parents in that community.  As Senator Fahey said, communication between parents and children is vital for education.  This must also happen in the travelling community. I ask the Minister to consider the travelling community as a group, parents and students, to achieve a satisfactory result and ensure they do not become further segregated.  Unfortunately this could happen if we consider students who are travellers in isolation from their parents. Both should be given the same regard.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on her achievements to date and I am sure her greatest moments are to come.  I hope the Department of Finance will appreciate her excellent work and see it as essential for the future of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on her work to date.  I had sympathy for her on her appointment because the area of education had been neglected in the last number of years. Everyone knows schools are in bad repair and undoubtedly the Minister is inundated with queries on this subject.  The fault may lie with previous Governments and it is good the Minister has addressed this at an early stage.</P>
      <P>I went to a two-teacher school in the country.  For my first four years in education I was taught by a teacher who had serious personal problems, alcoholism among them.  Many have suffered in rural areas from similar circumstances, especially in smaller schools where pupils may have the same teacher for a number of years.  This matter has not been addressed before but many people have been through this system and suffered as a result.  They never received the basics in education.  The possibility of remedial teachers did not arise because they did not exist &mdash; and that was true not very long ago.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken a big step by allocating this number of remedial teachers for the current year.  Her programme indicates this is only the first step, and it has been long awaited.  I congratulate her because the value of remedial teaching can never be overestimated. It is a basic form of education. If pupils suffer or lose out at national school level they never have an opportunity to catch up subsequently.</P>
      <P>It is crucial that this problem is tackled, considering how many children in modern society come from disadvantaged and socially deprived backgrounds. In addressing this issue the Minister has shown she understands what education involves and this knowledge is derived from her practical experience. One could never overemphasise the value of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am more than delighted to see seven teachers appointed to Cavan-Monaghan <Col N="519" /> to serve approximately 40 schools.  These appointments will add immense value to education in the area.  It is petty to dispute who first announced the news.  Some schools were urgently seeking remedial teachers for ten to 12 years and they were pleased that someone had heard their calls and that teachers were given recognition for what they were trying to achieve in small rural communities.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also reversed the decision in the Green Paper on Education. Smaller schools are to be protected against closure to a greater extent. This was reported in today's newspapers. I am aware of this problem having attended a small school.  It is important to protect these smaller rural schools if we are serious about rural development and maintaining standards in such communities. As has been mentioned, deprived people have to travel for remedial services.  It is important that we have primary schools in each locality and that they are not amalgamated as many other services seem to be.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been more than transparent about the existing cirteria for the appointment of remedial techers.  Those were already established and she cannot be criticised for them.  The value of <Col N="520" /> remedial teaching has been acknowledged. The Minister has outlined the comprehensive programme she has embarked upon which is focused on the disadvantaged.  This shows she understands the education system and its role in tackling problems rather than having to provide a cure at a later stage.</P>
    <P>As has been said, crime and all our other social problems stem from primary school days and the lack of a good education. Until now, some schools may have been privileged in that regard while others permanently suffered.  The Minister's programme attacks that and seeks equality for school children which is long overdue.</P>
    <P>Regardless of where one lives or one's background, one is entitled to a certain standard of education.  Had that issue been addressed earlier fewer people would have left school after the intermediate certificate because they were no longer able to face the future.  The Minister intends to ensure equality in standard in our system of education and this must be welcomed.  I trust she will continue with her marvellous programme and I wish her every success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 replaces a number of existing provisions, some dating back to the last century, dealing with soliciting in the street by prostitues.  The purpose behind the existing provisions is not to criminalise prostitution &mdash; that has never been an offence &mdash; but, to protect the public from the nuisance, annoyance and harassment we have all discussed that can be caused by soliciting in the streets.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if Senator Taylor-Quinn wants to retain the existing offences &mdash; she has not put down an amendment to that effect &mdash; or whether she wants soliciting in public to be completely decriminalised. The effect is the same either way because the existing provisions are constitutionally flawed and unenforceable. She is, therefore, asking to remove all legal restraints on soliciting in public for the purposes of prostitution.</P>
      <P>My views run directly counter to this &mdash; and I was glad to receive support for my proposals on Second Stage.  I understand what the existing provisions were trying to achieve; my objection to them is not that they apply to prostitutes who solicit in public, but that they do not apply to prostitutes' clients and the Second Commission on the Status of Women agrees with this.</P>
      <P>Section 7 is not a measure designed to suppress prostitution; I recognise that the criminal law can only achieve a certain amount in regulating sexual behaviour. It is designed, instead, solely to protect members of the public from the nuisance, harassment and intimidation which can be, and are, caused by soliciting in the street.  It is not enough to say a person who is approached for the purposes of prostitution can simply ignore the solicitation and walk on.  Anyone who thinks that does not know what it is like to be a woman intimidated by kerb crawlers or to be a resident in an area frequented by prostitutes and clients.</P>
      <P>In addition to the support of the Second Commission on the Status of Women on this matter, the Government has the support of the Law Reform Commission which recommended such a provision in its report on vagrancy and related offences.  To clarify something Senator Taylor-Quinn said in relation to the clients of prostitutes, pimps, touts and so on, they are all included in the Bill and I would not like the Senator to be under any mistaken impression in that regard.</P>

      <P>In page 7, before section 12, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="523" /> 12.&mdash;(1)  A person who, being the publisher of any book, newspaper, magazine, leaflet, or other publication intended to be sold or distributed to the public, or any part of the public, publishes any advertisement therein, which advertises or promotes any premises or services in circumstances that give rise to the reasonable inference that the premises is a brothel or that the service is prostitution, shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>(2)  It shall be a defence in a prosecution under subsection (1) for the accused person to show:</P>
    <P>(a)  that he was not aware that the premises was a brothel or that the service was prostitution, and</P>
    <P>(b)  that he had reasonable grounds for believing that the advertisement related to some other lawful purpose.</P>
    <P>(3)  Without prejudice to the general provisions of subsection (1) where in a prosecution for an offence under that subsection it is proved that the premises advertised is or was a brothel, or that the service advertised is or was prostitution, it shall be presumed unless the contrary is shown that the publisher was so aware at the time of publication.</P>
    <P>(4)  A person shall be deemed to be a publisher for the purposes of subsection (1) if he publishes, or is knowingly connected with the publication of, or appears to the Court to be in effective control, either alone or with others of, the publication, and where any publication is done by a body corporate, the body corporate, and any director or officer or employee thereof who is aware of the publication, shall be deemed to be a publisher.</P>
    <P>(5)  A person who commits an offence under subsection (1) of this section shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or a fine of £10,000 or both.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="524" /> (6)  In this section, &lsquo;publication&rsquo; includes broadcast and cognate words shall be construed accordingly.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, on Second Stage, many of us believed this Bill would impact on the women operating as prostitutes on the streets.  The Second Commission on the Status of Women argued that pimps and people who are making money from women prostitutes and those who abuse prostitutes should be punished.  Many people are profiting from the operation of brothels in Dublin and from the abuse of women involved in prostitution.  I do not accept that we should punish women who are soliciting in the streets and women who come from the poor sections of the community, or that we should turn a blind eye to this type of behaviour.  The real criminals of prostitution are those who make large financial gains from it.</P>
    <P>The advertisements to which I referred are offensive to women.  If we are to deal with prostitution realistically and fairly, we should accept this amendment.  If we do not, we are avoiding our responsibility because we are encouraging people who are promoting prostitution, making money from it and organising and advertising it.  The full rigours of the law should be applied to these people in the same way as it will be applied to prostitutes. Otherwise, we will be operating a two-tier system.  We should put an end to prostitution which is the exploitation of women, If we are to be consistent, the Minister should accept my amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. There is an inherent inconsistency in the fact that it is illegal to run a brothel, but it is not illegal to advertise one.  If prostitution and brothels are to be legalised, it should be legal to advertise them. The Minister made the point that advertising assists the gardaí in their investigation and identification of these brothels.  However, it is an insult to the gardaí to suggest that they have to use advertisements to obtain information about where these practices are carried out.  Senator Norris lives next door to a brothel and he is aware of its existence. <Col N="525" /> Surely, the gardaí who are patrolling that area are also aware of its existence. Advertising is not necessary and it is an insult to the gardaí to suggest that they can only identify brothels through advertisements. For that reason, there is an inconsistency and it should be corrected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not support this amendment.  I will not discuss my reasons at length because I might bore the House. However, I will give one technical reason I do not support the amendment.  It seems to be flawed even in its intention.  For example, it says &ldquo;any director or officer or employee thereof who is aware of the publication, shall be deemed to be a publisher&rdquo;. This means that even the person who makes the tea in an office is a publisher and he or she could be sentenced to two years imprisonment or a fine of £10,000.  Again, there is this presumption that someone is nefariously implicated in the situation.  This is not a good principle in law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  This Bill must include a section prohibiting advertising for prostitution if it is to be complete.  That section should cover the various ways of advertising, whether on local radio or in local newspapers.  I suggest that the Minister should look at the situation which occurred in Grafton Street this afternoon &mdash; a young woman was handing out leaflets which advertised prostitution.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important to consider the matter of advertising.  It is recognised that there are gentlemen in this city and elsewhere who are making a lucrative living from women who are involved in prostitution.  It is an abuse of women.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> The Minister said there were some words in the Bill which came from another era and she had changed some of them.  It is a pity to retain words such as &ldquo;buggery&rdquo; when we are abolishing buggery between persons as an offence. Therefore, I propose that in all cases in the Bill &ldquo;buggery&rdquo; should be deleted and substituted with &ldquo;anal intercourse.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This is an inexact phrase.  This is one of the problems in the American jurisdiction where &ldquo;buggery&rdquo; and &ldquo;sodomy&rdquo; mean different things in different states. For example, in the most restrictive states in the United States &ldquo;sodomy&rdquo; means everything except straightforward heterosexual intercourse in what is popularly known as the missionary position.

      <P>This is a straightforward description that is in common parlance. Everything apart from that is described in certain states as &ldquo;sodomy&rdquo;.  It is, therefore, a wide description.</P>
      <P>The reason I support Senator Honan's amendment is that the terms &ldquo;buggery&rdquo; and &ldquo;sodomy&rdquo; go back directly and clearly to a time of religious intolerance, religious prejudice and religious persecution. They reflect a dishonourable tradition in terms of the treatment of gay people.  The terms are offensive to many people but since they contain these echoes or shadows of intolerance and persecution, if they are retained, then at least they remain a reproach to the sources of those prejudices.</P>

      <P>I can appreciate the points made by Senator Honan and Senator Norris as to how they view the terminology used. When the Bill was being prepared and my officials and I were discussing it with the Parliamentary Draftsman, we tried to come up with a formula of words which would remove the word &ldquo;buggery&rdquo;.  The Senators will appreciate that there were difficulties in relation to that.</P>
      <P>Buggery is a felony at common law with a common law definition which includes intercourse per anum or per vaginum, by a man or woman, with an animal of either sex.  Any word or expression which was to replace &ldquo;buggery&rdquo; such as &ldquo;anal intercourse&rdquo; would also have to be defined.  Apart from any difficulty in arriving at a suitable definition, any term such as &ldquo;anal intercourse&rdquo; would be inadequate to describe the meaning of buggery in the law.  That is because we are not repealing or otherwise dealing with buggery with animals in this legislation.</P>
      <P>For those reasons, I regret that I am unable to accept amendments Nos. 1 to 9.</P>

      <P>Bill received for final consideration.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Bill has reached its Final Stage and effectively has passed, I would like to make some remarks on what is in the Bill.  I have seen this Bill represented publicly in the media and elsewhere in terms that I, and I am sure other Members, find offensive. A Member of the Lower House referred to this legislation as a &ldquo;wanker's charter&rdquo;. I am sure I share the views of most in finding that term offensive and the Bill should not be represented as such.</P>
      <P>This Bill effectively decriminalises what has hitherto been the crime of buggery.  I have reservations about elements of the Bill.  I find the term &ldquo;buggery&rdquo; as offensive as I found the conduct of some people outside this House who verbally abused people on their way into this House to discuss these issues.  I also found the attitude they adopted and the manner in which they wielded rosary beads, for example, both an affront to the House and offensive to those who have some respect for rosary beads.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, this is something the Committee on Procedures and Privileges could examine because there is provision in the Constitution for protecting access to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Article 40.6.1ºii states:</P>
      <P>Provision may be made by law ... to prevent or control meetings in the vicinity of either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time we started to consider that. This Bill, which has attracted so much attention and reaction from different elements in the community, stimulates me to make this observation.  It is equally <Col N="531" /> offensive to find children of eight or nine years of age being brought outside the gates of Leinster House by teachers and parents to support the cause of a school in such a way that one can hardly gain access.</P>
    <P>I want to ascertain from the Minister what regulations she might envisage following the passing of this Bill.  If she is not in a position to say that now, I have some apprehensions about the consequences of another understanding of this Bill.  Senator Norris has mentioned this and I can understand his reaction as being informed and enlightened.  It was also said that this Bill puts us light years ahead of England.  Having decriminalised buggery we must keep the consequences of this legislation under constant surveillance. I ask the Minister to examine this matter regularly.  If a consequence of this legislation is that it might be interpreted as a signal that there is now an acceptance of a pattern of conduct which is not in accordance with what most believe to be the standards of public order and morality, that will require vigilance.</P>
    <P>All kinds of individual rights are guaranteed by the Constitution. However, it is significant that all those fundamental rights are subject to public order and morality.  The term &ldquo;morality&rdquo; appears in the Constitution and one would sometimes be surprised to recognise that fact from the attitude there has been to any reference to morality or the attitude that morality formed no part of our function as legislators.  If the Constitution invokes the term &ldquo;subject to public order and morality&rdquo;, it follows that the laws passed by the Oireachtas at any given time must also be subject to public order and morality.</P>
    <P>If there were gatherings of groups publicly displaying patterns of conduct which offend the order of morality as most people perceive it to be, that is something the Minister should consider.  It is known that from time to time people of a certain disposition congregate in certain places and that is their business if it is private but if it is public we, as legislators, are <Col N="532" /> obliged to consider whether such congregations could offend public order or morality.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris referred with a sense of ridicule, I believe, to what he said is known in common parlance as the missionary position, which is the normal position of intercourse for most people. I wonder is there an attempt not only to vindicate the individual rights of people who may be of a minority disposition but also an attempt to start to undermine the pattern of behaviour, and of morality, of the community at large?</P>
    <P>In this context I notice that in discussion on these matters there appears to be an equation of the homosexual community, properly so called and with the rights to which it is entitled and which must be vindicated, with what is now being termed the heterosexual community. I do not believe there is, in terms of definition, such an entity as the heterosexual community.  If there is such a community it is not on a par and should not be equated with the homosexual community in the sense that it represents the bulk of the Irish people, whatever about people elsewhere who have their own legislators.</P>
    <P>It is important that the standards of the heterosexual community, so called, and the ideals that most people would like to promote for that community, both in their families and their communities, must be adhered to.  Such ideals give the heterosexual community a special place in the Constitution.  If there is one distinction between the heterosexual and homosexual communities it is that, as I understand it, the heterosexual community can and does play a fundamental role in creating and procreating the family, a role given special recognition in the Constitution.  By definition and by physiology, I am not aware that the homosexual community can play that role.</P>
    <P>For that reason, if no other, there is a real difference between heterosexual and homosexual relationships.  I believe this should be noted as a matter of record in case that in our anxiety to show tolerance and understanding, which is understandable, <Col N="533" /> we conveyed the idea that all such activities are of one norm.  The norm of society is that which is practised not by the heterosexual community but by people who happen to be heterosexual. That is of vital importance as we address the consequences of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to quote figures that have been submitted to all Senators from American universities, medical schools, doctors and so on.  Senator Norris referred to: &ldquo;pestilential American figures&rdquo;.  On reflection he may wish he had not used the word &ldquo;pestilential&rdquo;. However, I do not intend to quote from such figures but from the address by the Minister for Health to this House on Thursday, 24 June 1993, when, speaking on the spread of AIDS he said: &ldquo;Our current data base indicates that the infection is largely present in certain groups of the population &mdash; intravenous drug users, homosexuals, haemophiliacs. ...&rdquo;.  There is a distinction to be drawn between these three groupings.  There is no human contact with intravenous drug users or haemophiliacs unless it is accidental. However, there is a physical human contact in homosexual activity. That is the distinction.</P>
    <P>Homosexuals represent a small minority of the total population, a minority that must be respected and recognised. However, significantly, and regrettably, this minority represents the vast majority of the 1,368 people who have tested positively for the HI virus.  The objective evidence will illustrate that this has been a feature of homosexual communities, whether in San Francisco, Bangkok or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>I accept the purpose for which the Minister has introduced this legislation, namely, to decriminalise homosexual private conduct.  However, if it is established that the HIV virus, which I would regard as a pestilence, is more prevalent in that community than in the public at large, then our medical resources should comply with the wish expressed by the Minister for Health in this House on Thursday, 24 June 1993 when he said: &ldquo;We must make a concentrated effort <Col N="534" /> therefore to ensure that those who are not infected remain so, and to ensure that those who have contracted the virus do not transmit it to others&rdquo;.  If there is any evidence of an increase in the HIV virus I hope this is precisely what will happen, especially if there is an increase in the homosexual community which must be protected in terms of health and the impact on the community at large.</P>
    <P>I do not have the breakdown in data between the intravenous drug users, the homosexual community and those have contracted the HIV virus through the haemophiliac condition.  I am prepared to listen to those who would argue that the virus is more prevalent in one such grouping than the other.  Without relying on any data or statistics, it is clear that the level of AIDS in the homosexual community is out of line with that found in people who are heterosexual and engage in what is regarded as normal intercourse, particularly in committed relationships in marriage.  That means we have an obligation.  I have found that, though a small minority was of the other view, the apprehensions of the public at large were not so much about the decriminalisation of what has been called buggery among consenting adults in private but, when this is seen by parents and others as the signal of a different kind of order and attitude in our society, then they are concerned.  If it is also seen in this way by people abroad who would come here to celebrate the new liberation with us, then that is something we have to be careful of.</P>
    <P>I am conscious, as we address issues of this kind, that no one of us has a right, least of all myself, to imply judgment on the part of anyone else.  I am trying to talk in terms of the order of society.  In respect of our colleague, Senator Norris, who has argued his case consistently not just here but outside, I do not want to cause undue hurt or sensitivity, but I would not feel I had discharged my obligation as a legislator if I was so sensitive to the fact that I might feel misrepresented. I am not saying Senator Norris would do that, he is capable of speaking for himself and, I have to <Col N="535" /> acknowledge, has always done so publicly and without any degree of doubt as to his position and conviction.</P>
    <P>I will make a final observation, and then perhaps this particular document may not be referred to again as often as it has been in this debate.  The press representatives were here earlier, perhaps to see what might happen on a certain vote, and it will be interesting to see how they refer to that vote tomorrow.  As I said in another debate recently, we have an obligation here.  Mostly one is promoted and lauded as being courageous if one happens to have a view that coincides with that of the arbiters of our standards, those who set for us, according to their enlightenment and their tolerance as they see it, how we should behave, and if we fall short of those standards we are referred to as cowards, troglodytes or in phrases such as we heard recently &ldquo;people suffering from moral flatulence&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Because the education of public opinion is such an important matter, it is guaranteed in Article 40.6.01º i of the Constitution which says:</P>

If by that definition I am a coward, then I willingly plead guilty.</P>
      <P>I hope that what has been done here in terms of decriminalisation will mean that those who have that disposition and who have an instinctive or inherited reason for their particular disposition, will feel that this legislation significantly recognises that fact.  Equally, public order and morality, which are literally the theme of our Constitution, are sacred.  That is not my judgment, it is there.

I even referred to Brehon Law which mentions that the fifth generation of the male line should be included.  No matter what grievances we may have with our neighbours, we are bidden to love them as ourselves.  We were not told that they were to behave in any specific way but that we were to have an overall generosity towards them.

      <P>The enactment of the Bill will bring a great sense of relief to the members of the gay and lesbian community who will no longer be regarded under our laws as criminals.  The passage of the Bill is a tribute to those members of the gay and lesbian community who courageously campaigned for reforms over a very long period.  It was no mean achievement to bring a case to the European Court of Human Rights.  Our fellow Oireachtas Member, Senator Norris, deserves to be congratulated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, congratulate the Minister.  During the debates in both Houses she has been very open and willing to take on suggestions made by Members.  I also congratulate Senator Norris.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, this Bill is a fundamental development in human rights.  It will make equal citizens of tens of thousands of gay and lesbian people in this country who, up to now, have felt marginalised.  On the basis of equality this Bill is very welcome.  I congratulate Senator Norris and all those who campaigned for so long.  Again the Minister deserves to be congratulated sincerely by us all.</P>

      <P>I support much of what was said.  However, although I fundamentally disagree with Senator O'Kennedy's articulate contribution, he spoke with courage.  I respect his courage as I respected former Senator Des Hanafin when he put forward a point of view that <Col N="539" /> was neither popular nor fashionable.  I respect that view too although we approach it from different points on the spectrum.  We can all say at least as this Bill passes into law that we wish the people it benefits well.</P>
      <P>We can also congratulate two people without reservation.  The first is Senator Norris who became the spokesperson &mdash; it was thrust upon him in many ways &mdash; of a group who were becoming increasingly marginalised as the years passed.  That is now over and the Senator deserves and has received the plaudits of the House. All fair minded people respect what he has done.  The second person is the Minister for Justice for the courageous way in which she introduced this Bill in the Dáil. As I said on Second Stage, bully for the first female Minister for Justice.  Long may she reign because we have seen what common sense can do when a difficult issue is addressed fairly and honestly.  I congratulate her and I congratulate the House.  It was a good debate and I wish the beneficiaries of the Bill a happy life.</P>

      <P>Yesterday I congratulated the Minister and Senator Norris.  Courageous seems to be the term being used but it is a very good Bill, particularly the sections which decriminalise homosexuality.  I also pay tribute to Senator O'Kennedy.  He knows I disagree with him and we clashed noisily and furiously last week but I respect his right to make his views known.  He probably finds himself in the same position as the people who were trying to have this legislation passed were in ten years ago. It takes a great deal of courage to stand one's ground and make one's point when it is not popular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I misunderstood something in Senator O'Kennedy's contribution this evening but I thought I heard him say that what was the norm in a loving relationship, usually marriage, and how it differed from homosexual relationship was that it was for procreation and the <Col N="540" /> creation of families.  There is a large number of people who are married and living together who are not lucky enough&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank both Houses of the Oireachtas but especially the Minister for her great courage, humanity and skill in piloting this Bill through her party and through the lower House before it came here.  Senator O'Kennedy has spoken of the consequences of the legislation.  I can tell him exactly what I think they will be. They will be a sigh of relief.  They will be the fact that young people will not live under the shadow of the taint of criminality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the House that one of our greatest artists, Oscar Wilde, was judicially murdered and that is the only way it can be described.  He was sentenced to two years imprisonment on a charge he could have defended himself against by challenging the evidence but, chivalrously, he protected his friend who was the guilty party.  He collapsed during a church service he was forced to attend and burst his eardrum which remained untreated.  It was that untreated infection of the ear that actually killed him in Paris. The British succeeded in judically murdering one of our greatest artists.  If this Bill had not been passed and these criminal provisions rescinded, Oscar Wilde could until today have been sentenced again to the term of imprisonment which killed him.  He said that the road would be red with monstrous martyrdoms but justice would triumph in the end, and it <Col N="541" /> has been red with monstrous martyrdoms.</P>
    <P>I listened with astonishment in the other House to a representative who indicted the gay community in America because he said there was such a high proportion of murders committed against them.  That was a most astonishing comment &mdash; that people should be guilty of being murdered.  Surely we should be protected against being murdered.</P>
    <P>It would be very wrong of me to engage, particularly since I have done it persistently throughout the afternoon, in a carping match with Senator O'Kennedy but I respect absolutely his courage.  He is an independent minded spokesman and I respect his right to hold certain views but I cannot always respect those views.  I say this, I hope with a certain degree of courtesy, because when he spoke about people gathering together and the need to monitor the Bill, I felt that was dangerous and insidious.  Under the Constitution, which he so effectively quoted throughout the day, there is guaranteed a fundamental right, the right to assembly.  If gay people cannot assemble and cannot, for example, on gay pride day celebrate their existence as citizens of this country, what is the use of a Constitution like this?</P>
    <P>People have been embarrassingly kind in their words about me, and particularly Senator Neville because I have been consistently uncharitable about Fine Gael throughout the day.  I think it was most gentlemanly of him to forgive me and to pay me the generous and kind tribute he did.  I feel I must mention a couple of people, in particular a man who was instrumental with me in founding the gay organisation, Seán Connolly, a general secretary of great genius; also Kieran Rose, who is in the Gallery, and Susie Byrne and Chris Robson who mounted a very effective, low key and clear campaign, and my colleagues in the campaign for homosexual law reform, Bernard Keogh and Edmund Lynch.  There are others who are not with us today for sad reasons.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention one issue I feel <Col N="542" /> should be put to rest immediately and I know that Senator O'Kennedy did not have the opportunity to listen to my contribution yesterday, but I hope I dealt effectively with the question of AIDS. The information he placed on the record is totally inaccurate.  On a global basis, according to World Health Organisation statistics, the mechanism of transmission of the HIV virus in 70 per cent of the cases is heterosexual intercourse, <i>per vagina</i> since the other phrase I used caused offence.  That would not lead me to campaign for the criminalisation of heterosexuality because such a position would be absurd.  It is most regrettable for anybody in however tangential a way to suggest that a disease can be used in some way to repressing a community of people.  If that were so, it would be very dangerous indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not oppressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The implication was clear because what was said was that the law should be monitored if there were certain implications with regard to the health service expenses due to an increase in AIDS and so on.  The highest rate of increase in HIV infection in this country is in the heterosexual community.  I regret that, it is a pity but that is the fact.</P>
      <P>I know that many people respect greatly the family and the institution of marriage, as I do but that is not directly relevant to the issue of disease.  Faithfulness, chastity or whatever one likes to call it is relevant but no self respecting microbe crawls up one's right leg and, before it sinks its teeth into a vital, gentle or delicate part of one's anatomy, asks if he or she can see the marriage licence.</P>

      <P>I am sure that Senator Norris and the rest of us are delighted that we can take credit for expanding the Chair's education.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the point raised by Senator O'Kennedy.  Basically, he was asking what the position was in relation to privacy.  The laws relating to the commission of an act of buggery or gross indecency between consenting adults in public will be the same as for any other act or actions of public indecency.  The offence of public indecency is set out at section 18 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935, which provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every person who shall commit, at or near and in sight of any place along which the public habitually pass as of right or by permission, any act in such a way as to offend modesty or cause <Col N="544" /> scandal or injure the morals of the community shall be guilty of an offence under this section ...</P>
    <P>It would not be possible to define what is or is not public indecency as times change and what might be unacceptable to one generation might be acceptable to another or what might be acceptable in a particular place might be unacceptable elsewhere.  It is up to the courts to decide in any case before them whether an offence has been committed under section 18 of the 1935 Act.  There will be no difference in the offence of public indecency after the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis referred to what Senator O'Kennedy said and I think Senator Norris, while he might disagree vehemently with points which Senator O'Kennedy made, would defend equally as vehemently his right to make them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Kennedy and I have often diagreed vehemently on issues within our own parliamentary party but we have both been mature enough on all occasions to respect each other's point of view.  I would remind Senators that when it came to the crunch Senator O'Kennedy supported the Bill both in his comments and in the vote earlier.  It is important to make that point and I thank him for his support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to another point which Senator O'Kennedy made, I also found grossly offensive the actions outside the gates of the Houses of the Oireachtas in the past week.  I know Senator O'Kennedy was only one of many people who were accosted.  It does not only relate to this issue; I have seen a pattern develop. Last year my office was across the road and I had to come across on a regular basis for votes and meetings.  Inevitably, on the three main sitting days of the Houses of the Oireachtas, there have been groups outside protesting about one thing or another.  While the vast majority protest in a very calm manner, an issue arises for both the Committee on Procedure <Col N="545" /> and Privileges and for the members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>As a result of what happened to Senator O'Kennedy and others last week, I spoke to the Assistant Commissioner with responsibility for the DMA.  There are laws which affect demonstrations within half a mile of Leinster House when the Houses are sitting and there are powers available to the gardaí. The Assistant Commissioner is looking at this as a matter of urgency and will be consulting with the Superintendent, the Captain of the Guard, the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach.  That is important.</P>
    <P>We are all entitled to have access to the Houses of the Oireachtas without interference from any members of the public.  This problem affects not just the Ministers who have offices across the road but also political parties, Members of both Houses and anybody coming in and out of Leinster House.</P>
    <P>I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Members of the Seanad who took part in the debate and those who came to support the Bill.  It was treated with great sensitivity and everybody, regardless of their point of view, was courageous in standing up and stating those points of view.  I have held portfolios in various Departments over the years and, like Senator O'Kennedy, many groups have come to see me; pressure groups and others come looking for changes in the law or for amendments to regulations and so on.  Some of those groups can very often allow intolerance to enter into their demands of any Minister, and I am sure that Senator O'Kennedy has often come across such groups. Since February of this year, when I met the first group representing the gay and lesbian community, no such demands were made of me as Minister for Justice. I would like to say publicly that they came and put their case in a clear and coherent manner.  They did not put pressure on me, they made no demands and they said, as they were leaving, that I was the Minister for Justice and that they looked forward to what my proposals might be <Col N="546" /> and when they might come.  I would like to pay tribute to them for that.</P>
    <P>We have done a great day's work in the Seanad and I would like to express my thanks to Members on all sides of the House for their support and for a most enjoyable debate.  May I say that I enjoyed the banter between Senator O'Kennedy and Senator Norris.  It enlivened what might have been a very dull debate and I look forward to returning to this House on many occasions in the future with other pieces of criminal law reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  Major roadworks, including the Rathkeale and Newbridge by-passes, are undertaken and completed to everybody's satisfaction. I think it is important, now that we are a member of the European Community, to have easy access for transport to cater for the needs of industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have raised this matter because last week I travelled from Dublin to Cork to attend a funeral.  My time was limited but I observed the rules of the road &mdash; I do not break speed limits. Approaching Mitchelstown there were <Col N="547" /> roadworks which caused a small delay. Between Mitchelstown and Fermoy there were three sets of roadworks on ten miles of road.  I cannot understand why one job could not be completed before the next was begun.  There was only one set of roadworks in the other 150 miles.</P>
    <P>There should be better organisation and planning.  Many road users are not locals but come from overseas and it projects a bad image to have three delays in ten miles.  The resulting built-up of traffic in Fermoy caused a delay of between 20 and 30 minutes and subsequently on the road to Watergrasshill and Rathcormack and on into Cork.  All these delays added an hour to the journey from Dublin to Cork.  I am sure similar situations arise in other parts of the country.  County councils should organise their roadworks to cause least inconvenience to road users, especially tourists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): I thank Senator Rory Kiely for raising this issue and I appreciate the problem.</P>
      <P>The aim of road improvement schemes is to enhance safety and/or improve the capacity of the road when completed but during the course of the construction work some disruption is inevitable on existing roads.  However, I am anxious that any disruption caused should be minimised.  In this regard my Department has included in its memorandum on road grants which was issued earlier this year to all road authorities, certain advice and guidelines relating to measures they should take during the course of such works.</P>
      <P>The memorandum draws the authorities' attention to the fact that roadworks, whether executed by a local authority or by a statutory undertaker, should be carried out as quickly as possible so as to minimise the period during which road users are inconvenienced.  In the execution of the works, due regard should be had to the safety of road users generally, including pedestrians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there is concern that <Col N="548" /> road openings &mdash; which may not always be related to road improvement works &mdash; cause undue disruption to traffic, particularly in urban areas.  Local authorities have, therefore, been advised to pay special attention to minimising the frequency and duration of road openings and to seek the co-operation of statutory undertakers to ensure this.  Authorities are expected to make every effort to coordinate road openings so as to minimise traffic disruptions and hazard to road users.  Road openings should be permanently reinstated as quickly as possible after the completion of the work.</P>
    <P>In addition to concern about disruption I am also aware of the safety aspect of roadworks and the need for proper signage.  Local authorities have been advised by a circular letter of a system of traffic signs to be used exclusively when roadworks are being carried out.  These signs are based on designs proposed in a booklet called <i>Guidelines for Signposting Roads in Urban Areas</i>, prepared by Dublin Corporation and <i>Guidelines for Traffic Control at Rural Roadworks</i> prepared jointly by An Foras Forbartha and the County and City Engineers' Association. I am satisfied that the use of the signage codes set out in these guidelines would ensure a high level of safety for such works if they were adhered to.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the points raised by Senator Rory Kiely.  There are some aspects of major road construction about which I would not be happy.  As the Senator said there seems to be a tendency to have a number of roadworks going on at the same time.  I will bring the Senator's views to the attention of the local authorities concerned.  If Senators have any complaints in this area they should pass them on to my Department or the local authority concerned and we will make arrangements to have them resolved as quickly as possible.  I am not happy that the safety standards are being adhered to by some road contractors at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea.  I know he is equally concerned about this issue because it affects his constituency.  The dental services in County Clare are now at a critical stage.  In the national schools dental treatment is only available for second and sixth class pupils.  There is only an emergency service available for the others which is not satisfactory.  The situation for adults is worse; there is only an emergency scheme in operation for adults.</P>
      <P>There are about 700 people on a waiting list in the mid-west area even though the list has been closed for the past two years.  There are more than 400 people on the waiting list for orthodontic treatment and 2,500 people on the assessment waiting list.  There is a three year waiting list.  The position is becoming critical and parents are genuinely anxious about it. The work is extremely expensive in many cases.  The Minister of State might consider a scheme whereby private individuals, in conjunction with the health board, could come together to provide the service.  In many cases parents would be willing to make a contribution towards the provision of such a service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About a year ago it was proposed to build a new dental clinic at the County Hospital in Ennis.  The dental service is at present provided in prefab accommodation which is very old and dilapidated. The working conditions for staff would not be tolerated in any other section of the health services.  I ask the Minister of State to pay special attention to this problem, investigate what must be done and ensure that additional finances are allocated to the Mid-Western Health <Col N="550" /> Board to enable it to effectively tackle this chronic problem which is causing untold hardship for parents and children. It can also have psychological effects on children as they must wait for many years for the necessary dental treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the school dental services in County Clare the position is that the Mid-Western Health Board, in common with other health boards, is now adopting a systematic targeted approach for the delivery of these services.  This ensures a more equitable distribution of the dental resources available.  The approach aims to examine all children in specific classes and to provide treatment as necessary. The classes chosen in County Clare are second and sixth classes.  These classes are chosen with preventive treatments in mind and to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school.</P>
      <P>Children for whom a service was previously rarely, if ever, demanded and those in greatest need of dental care, will be screened, advised of the services available, educated in dental hygiene and provided with treatment as necessary.  In this way the optimum service is provided for those in need within the resources available.  Under this targeted approach about 3,800 children in County Clare are screened annually which represents about 28 per cent of the total number of children attending national school. Emergency treatment for the relief of pain is available to children on demand.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the board is experiencing difficulties with suitable dental accommodation in Ennis and is actively considering measures to improve the situation. A consultant orthodontic service is provided to children from County Clare through the regional centre at St. Camillus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in regard to the adult dental service in County Clare is that an emergency service for the relief of pain is available to all adult medical card holders on demand.  The board has not been able to provide a routine adult dental service <Col N="551" /> for some time because of budgetary constraints. However, the Minister for Health, after consultations with me, has recently made additional allocations available to the health board for the development of the dental services in the current year in accordance with the provisions contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  Following my consultations with the Minister I am <Col N="552" /> hopeful that a number of extra dentists can be employed quite soon which will considerably reduce the waiting list.</P>
    <P>The board is reviewing the recommencement of a routine adult dental service for County Clare in the light of the additional allocations provided.</P>
