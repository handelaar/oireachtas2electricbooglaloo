      <P>I have notice from Senator McGennis that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide a new second level school for Castleknock, Dublin 15.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Sherlock of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to give further consideration to the application by South Community Television Group for a licence to operate a service side by side with Cork Multichannel, so as to provide an alternative legal <Col N="2" /> system in the Cork area under the Broadcasting Acts.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Roche of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to outline the application of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts to wine licence sales from certain small retail outlets in Bray and Greystones, County Wicklow, and the threat posed to the outlets in question by the application of the law in a manner which is not general throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Kelleher of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to provide funding for the acquisition of the old <Col N="3" /> North Infirmary Hospital, Cork City, for use as a museum or cultural centre.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator O'Sullivan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to impose stricter control on activities of out-of-State shooters, particularly in regard to over-exploitation of irreplaceable migratory game birds.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Reynolds of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to allow the coal burner power station at Arigna, County Roscommon, to continue production until all the coal deposits in the area are exhausted.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to carry out an immediate investigation into the life threatening explosion at Balleece Quarry in Rathdrum, County Wicklow and to suspend its operation until appropriate safety measures have been put in place.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to intervene with An Post so as to ensure that Cranny Post Office, County Clare reopens.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators McGennis, Sherlock, Roche, Kelleher, O'Sullivan, Reynolds and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator McGennis' and Sherlock's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Roche, Kelleher, O'Sullivan, Reynolds and Ross may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret that I have had to rule the matter raised by Senator Daly as not <Col N="4" /> suitable for discussion on the adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.  It is a matter for An Post.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Items 1, 2 and 24.  Item 1 will be taken without debate.  Item 2, the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1993 will be taken at the conclusion of Item 1 until 6 p.m.  Debate on Item 2 will be resumed at 8 p.m. until the Second Stage of the Bill is completed.  I suggest 30 minutes for spokespersons and 20 minutes for each Senator thereafter. Item 24 will be taken between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.  Matters on the Adjournment will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree to today's Order of Business.  Could the Leader of the House, first of all, indicate to us what other legislation he intends to bring before the House between now and the end of this session, whenever that may be?  Secondly, could he give us a guarantee that, in accordance with the best traditions of this House, when the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, 1993 is brought in to this House, it will be debated in the full light of day and not rushed through furtively under cover of darkness as appears to be happening elsewhere?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I share some of Senator Manning's concerns with regard to the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, 1993.  It is a pity it is being introduced in the Dáil, although I welcome the fact that it is being introduced, because it seems to me that this is the appropriate House in which to introduce such a Bill, first, because we are constitutionally established as a reflective House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to make a speech, I just wish to make a point on the Order of Business.  May I ask the Leader of the House if, in the light of this and the fact that the Suicide Bill was whipped away from under the noses of Senators, he would seriously consider allowing the introduction of a small amount of private Members' legislation from this side of the House?  The House would be greatly strengthened by this.</P>
      <P>I wish to make two points.  The first arises from the Memorandum in which attention is drawn to the fact that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is meeting this afternoon.  This committee is still referred to consistently in the media as the Dáil Committee on Foreign Affairs, particularly during the televised reports of the select committee of the Dáil which has responsibility for passing the Estimates.  It is important that this House be allowed to participate in that select committee by presence and by speech although not by vote.  I wish to end by serving notice that I propose to represent this House at that select committee the next time it sits and will demand my right to speak although I will of course, accept that I do not have a vote.</P>
      <P>Can you a Chathaoirligh, or the Leader of the House say if moves have been made about Item 18 in my name relating to an Oireachtas press officer?  I have spoken to people in the other House and they seem to be supportive of the suggestion. Some of the confusion about the role of the Upper House could be cleared up if this appointment was made.</P>

      <P>When the Leader of the House says we are to resume Second Stage of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1993 at 8 p.m., does he mean in the unlikely event that many Senators wish to participate in that debate we will be here all night?  He has not indicated otherwise.</P>
      <P>When is it proposed to take Item 4, the Animal Remedies Bill?  There is a certain urgency attaching to that.  When it is taken we should be afforded enough time to debate it in full.</P>
      <P>My last question was also raised last week.  Has any progress been made in bringing forward publication of the proceedings of the House?  We still seem to be experiencing a delay.</P>

      <P>The Cahill blueprint for Aer Lingus is a serious and urgent matter.  Can time be afforded in this House for a discussion of the details of that plan?  I also ask the Leader of the House to ensure the plan is fully published and full consultation takes place, including the Shannon Status Committee.  The Taoiseach and Tánaiste should meet the committee since they have met the unions.  It is important that all sides be heard.  I hope the Leader of the House will communicate these views of the Taoiseach and Tánaiste and afford time here for discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to request the attendance of two Ministers in this House before the recess, which I understand is to take place in three weeks.  I ask that the Minister for Agriculture attend a two to three hour debate about the disadvantaged areas appeal.  No one seems to know his position <Col N="7" /> on payments for 1993.  This must be resolved.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Minister of Finance to attend for a short debate about the current conduct of financial institutions. Interest rates vary from 9 to 16 per cent and people are confused.  The issue is being debated at all levels on an ongoing basis and a debate in this House would be beneficial to all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Leader of the House provide time for a debate on Item 25?  The matter is creating much concern among the public and the Garda Síochána. Offences such as muggings, breakins and car thefts are termed minor offences although they are not minor in the eyes of the people affected by them. Those who commit these offences are now brought to court by summons rather than being charged.  The Garda find the same people are being brought in several times a week to have their names taken and be charged later.  This has implications for consecutive sentencing because those accused are not on bail pending trial.</P>
      <P>I also ask for a debate on Item 23, about the Law Reform Commission consultation paper on occupier's liability. This is an appropriate forum for such a debate.  Because it is a consultation paper this House should have an opportunity to give its view on the commission's proposals. Not everyone agrees with the suggestions made in the paper.  We debated this subject prior to its publication last November and this House could give its view to the commission before it writes its final report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House give time to debate the proposal that the ESB pay a dividend to the Government?  This could lead to job losses or increased electricity prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator D'Arcy's proposals for a debate on disadvantaged areas.  The appeals system was to operate and grants were to be paid from 1993.  It now appears it will be 1994 before the scheme gets <Col N="8" /> under way.  I would like that issue clarified in a debate.</P>
    <P>Difficulties are being experienced by Members contributing to debates in the House.  Senators like to have copies of their contribution as quickly as possible. Up to recently in the short period I have been a Member of this House it has been possible to get copies of the debates but now apparently it takes a minimum of three to four weeks.</P>

      <P>To deal with legislation the House will sit on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of next week.  We will debate the Animal Remedies Bill, 1993 and the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, 1993.  The House can be assured as much time as necessary will be given; the Whips can arrange the time today or tomorrow.  The Minister for Justice would have preferred to initiate the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill in this House but it was needed in the other House for business reasons.  I will prepare a list of business for the time up to the summer recess.  Ample time will be given to everybody who wishes to speak on the Bill today.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before the House today is but the first step in a comprehensive package of proposals on broadcasting legislation I have already indicated I am in the process of formulating.  These will include proposals for the long term restructuring of Irish broadcasting.  It is important, therefore, before I turn to the detail of this Bill to place it in a clear philosophical context and to share with you the shape of <Col N="10" /> my thinking on my comprehensive review of broadcasting structures.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware of the ongoing revolution in the development of telecommunications technology which in the space of a few years has already changed the broadcasting map beyond recognition. Foreseeable technological developments will eliminate many of the current constraints in the use of the broadcasting frequency spectrum and enable the possibility of virtually unlimited programme choice.</P>
    <P>In these times of rapid and fundamental change, it is all to easy to be swept away by the excitement of the technology itself as if it was neutral and accept readily and uncritically that because a particular feat is possible technically and can be made commercially viable it is automatically good and that there are no consequences to consider.  This is to forget that broadcasting services &mdash; both radio and television &mdash; are already an integral part of our lives, our culture, the way we see ourselves and the world and the way we communicate with each other.  Fundamental changes to broadcasting inevitably must mean changes to all these things; in short, changes to the way we live.</P>
    <P>Many of the new broadcasting services which have become available to Irish viewers, particularly, though not exclusively, those that are international in nature and delivered via satellite feature a relatively new breed of broadcaster with roots in purely profit motivated businesses. We have recently had a very useful debate in this House on the unsavoury nature of some of these new services.  The only objective of the operators of many of these services is to maximise their audience share &mdash; provided it is the &ldquo;right&rdquo; kind of audience.  In this scenario the only way of determining the worth or success of a programme is the number of viewers it attracts.  With the growing internationalisation of television services, audiences are being separated into segments to be chased and harried and exploited.  I am sure many Senators have seen recent newspaper reports about a survey into the role of television <Col N="11" /> in shaping the thinking of American children. One of the findings of the report was and I quote:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the first time in human history, most of the stories about people, life and values are told not by parents, schools, churches or others in the community with something to tell, but by a group of distant conglomerates that have something to sell.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a frightening thought for the future of our civilisation and cultures.  It is of particular interest to me, committed as I am to the pluralism of cultures.  The reality is that international competition for Irish viewers is here to stay.  It will not go away and there are no technical means at our disposal to prevent reception of these services.  For these reasons we must attain the primary objective of the Programme for a Partnership Government on broadcasting which is that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our policy will be to ensure that Irish TV and Radio Programming is of the highest quality and that it remains the preferred choice of a majority of Irish viewers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In my view, the philosophy of public service broadcasting with its fundamental democratic values offers us the best model on which to base our long term strategy.  We must ensure that Irish viewers and listeners can exercise the maximum amount of control and choice. We must also be able to ensure that the audience remains in control of its culture and its own development as a community and as a nation.  As I have stated at international gatherings, every story has a right to be told.</P>
    <P>Given that the framework of broadcasting in this country is based on legislation that is over thirty years old and which was drawn up at a time when extensive programme choice, particularly on television, was not technically feasible, I am sure Senators will agree that a fundamental review is now necessary to ensure, as the programme for Government states, that Irish television and <Col N="12" /> radio remains the preferred choice of the majority of Irish viewers.</P>
    <P>However, it must be recognised that this process of review of the existing structures will take time.  My aim is for whatever revisions are made to stand the test of time and to be relevant into the next century.  In the meantime I am satisfied that there are urgent issues to be addressed arising especially from our experience of almost three years operation of section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990.  With the immediate problems which the Bill addresses out of the way the regulatory structures for broadcasting in the longer term can be examined and considered calmly and completely in all their complexity.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House has essentially two elements.  Firstly, it provides for the repeal of section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990 and restores the situation with regard to broadcast advertisements on RTE services that obtained prior to the enactment of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, that is that the total daily times and the maximum time in any one hour for broadcast advertisements fixed by the Authority shall be subject to the approval of the Minister. In this connection it should be noted that it restores the situation to what it was when applicants for independent broadcasting contracts sought their franchises from the Independent Radio and Television Commission.</P>
    <P>The second element of the Bill provides that RTE must make specific amounts available for programmes commissioned from the independent television production sector in each financial year.  The independent production sector has already proven itself to be able to make programmes of the highest quality and capable of significant international success.</P>
    <P>To return to the issue of advertising, section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, placed two restrictions on RTE in relation to advertising.  The first was a limit on the revenue which RTE could earn from advertising and the second was a reduction of 25 per cent in the amount <Col N="13" /> of airtime which RTE could make available for advertising.</P>
    <P>This latter restriction was perhaps the most damaging for all the sectors associated with broadcast advertising.  The intention was to divert advertising revenue from RTE to independent broadcasters, chiefly an independent national radio station which unfortunately closed down and a proposed national television service which never emerged.  I have to say I never accepted that one sector of the media has to be artificially starved in order to promote another so it is no surprise to me that the capping provisions have failed manifestly to deliver any of the intended benefits.  Tragically, the very inflexibility of the provisions has resulted only in serious and continuing damage to RTE, advertisers, advertising agencies and independent programme makers.  I looked at all of their situations very closely in the preparation of this legislation.  We were losing jobs, threatening jobs, and we had lost revenue.</P>
    <P>The basic difficulty with the 1990 capping provisions is that they impose an artificial and arbitrary limit on the way RTE seeks to provide a truly national public broadcasting service.  For the 1990 Act to work, if that is the right term, broadcasters would have to accept that their audience is simply a market to be broken up into segments and shares.  In this scenario the creative process &mdash; the true heart of any worthwhile broadcasting service &mdash; is stymied and subverted by the all-consuming desire to maximise market share of the advertising cake and of audience.  Nothing else matters. Citizens within a communicative order are regarded, instead, as market segments.</P>
    <P>To my mind, this negates what I believe broadcasting to be about.  This philosophy rejects the potential of broadcasting to release and express the creativity of the nation in all its constituent elements and fails to involve all our citizens in the ongoing development of our culture.  The philosophy of the 1990 Act prevents citizens from taking charge of changes which affect their lives in the <Col N="14" /> most fundamental way and insists that they be satisfied with the least objectionable rather than being able to demand the best.  In my view, it is part of our job as legislators to ensure that Irish audiences continue to be informed and educated as well as entertained by our broadcasting services.  Indeed this definition seems to me to be passive in intent and I would add another obligation that Irish audiences should have the facility through the broadcast media to communicate.  I regard Irish people as citizens in a communicative order.</P>
    <P>Since I took office I have consulted with all those with an interest in the fate of section 3 of the 1990 Act.  Virtually all sectors directly affected by the 1990 Act have stressed to me the severe operational difficulties they have experienced with the legislation.</P>
    <P>RTE have found it impossible to live within the provisions of section 3 of the 1990 Act unless they literally turn away business or employ some mechanism which would have distorted the advertising market to a devastating extent.  As a result of the capping provisions many advertising production companies are now understood to be in severe financial difficulties.  To continue with the provision would leave RTE faced with the prospect of letting go up to a possible 300 staff.</P>
    <P>Advertisers' and advertising agencies' main concern has been the huge rise in the cost of advertising which resulted from the reduction in advertising minutage imposed by the 1990 Act.  Industry sources estimate an increase of almost 55 per cent in the cost since the introduction of the 1990 Act.  This alone is resulting in difficulties for small to medium-sized advertisers in marketing products and in developing/promoting new or small indigenous brand names on RTE television; diversion of advertising to other television stations &mdash; there are also indications that significant amounts are simply being withheld and of increasing amounts of non-media &ldquo;below the line&rdquo; expenditure; indications that bigger diversion to UK terrestrial and satellite <Col N="15" /> channels will occur if the Act is not changed; and marketing control and/or the budgets of international companies reverting to head offices outside the country with negative consequences for advertising agencies, production houses and industry generally.</P>
    <P>Not to bring in this legislation would be to ignore all these consequences which were repeatedly represented to me.</P>
    <P>Independent television producers are seeking the removal of the cap on RTE advertising revenue as its imposition resulted in a reduction in the amount of independent programmes commissioned by the station.  They also believe the continuation of the cap is preventing RTE from developing a constructive policy on commissioning independently produced programmes.  Members of the House are aware that this proposal is part of a mosaic of proposals of mine to assist the film industry.</P>
    <P>The national newspapers industry is virtually alone in its support of the Broadcasting Act, 1990.  They contend that significant advertising would be diverted to them in the long run if the Act remains in force and that to revert to the pre-1990 situation would have serious implications for the financial viability of the newspaper industry.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that the newspaper industry has difficulties.  They are faced with increasing competition from UK papers which can be produced more economically than Irish newspapers given the UK economies of scale. However, I have not seen any evidence to convince me that newspapers have benefited significantly from the 1990 Act or would in the future.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, major advertisers have made it clear to me that their advertising budgets for media other than television &mdash; newspapers, both national and provincial, local broadcasting, etc. &mdash; have had to be curtailed in order to maintain their presence on television.  Industry figures also show a catastrophic drop in the number of days spent shooting commercials in this country from 147 in 1989 to 75 in 1992 reflecting a huge loss of <Col N="16" /> income to freelance film makers in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The reduction in advertising time imposed by the Act and the resulting increase in advertising costs have clearly demonstrated that certain categories of advertisers are prepared to spend virtually any amount to maintain a presence on television.  Smaller Irish companies have been forced off television altogether. There has been a reduction in the level of promotion for smaller brands and a reduction in the number of new television advertisements being made.  It is vitally important to the economy that indigenous companies and companies promoting brands developed in Ireland have access to a domestic television advertising medium at a reasonable price, and that RTE does not have to rely on multinational companies to provide their advertising revenues.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the fact that television advertising spending is being diverted out of the Irish economy.  I am very concerned that revenue should have to be diverted to foreign stations simply because of an artificial distortion of the Irish television advertising market.  While there are differences of opinion as to the amount actually being diverted to non-Irish stations so far, there is no doubt that non-Irish stations are aggressively seeking advertising here and it must be accepted that the current situation allows the real possibility of significant diversion.</P>
    <P>I believe that the majority of the concerns expressed to me are genuine and need immediate attention if the situation is not to get progressively worse and significant job losses throughout the economy are to be avoided.  I am also anxious, to put it more positively, to create jobs and I regard this as an area for job creation.  It is for these reasons that I am proposing the repeal of section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990 as an immediate measure.</P>
    <P>Turning to the independent television production sector, I believe the sector can sustain a dramatic growth in skilled jobs but to realise its full potential the sector must have a guaranteed domestic <Col N="17" /> base through RTE services, as the national, and at present, only television broadcaster.  More and more reliance is being placed by broadcasters in other countries on the output of their independent production sectors.</P>
    <P>As part of my longer term proposals for the restructuring of Irish broadcasting, I plan to create a regulatory environment which will further foster the development of the sector.  However, I feel that immediate statutory provisions, aimed at ensuring its short term survival and development are necessary.  To this end, I am proposing a provision whereby RTE would be required to make available specific amounts of money each year for programmes commissioned from the independent sector.  I should emphasise of course, that the money available for commissioning programmes cannot be confined to the Irish independent production sector, but I am confident that the Irish sector will be able to secure the maximum number of commissions consistent with the resources available to it.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the main provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that the total daily times for advertising, and the maximum time for advertising in any hour, on RTE services fixed by the RTE Authority shall be subject to the approval of the Minister. This is, in effect, a restoration of the situation which obtained under the Broadcasting Authority Acts before the enactment of the Broadcasting Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the repeal of section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, with effect from 1 September 1992.  RTE would have reached the limit on revenues imposed by that section after this date.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that RTE must make specific amounts of money available in each financial year for programmes commissioned from the independent television production sector.  The amount to be set aside for this purpose will be £5 million in 1994, rising in stages to £10 million in 1998 and to 20 per cent of television programme expenditure in 1999 and thereafter, or £12.5 million, whichever is the greater. <Col N="18" /> The amount of £12.5 million will be adjusted annually in line with changes in the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>Under this section, the RTE Authority will be required to keep a special account, termed the &ldquo;independent television programmes account&rdquo;, into which the moneys to be made available under this section for programmes to be commissioned from the independent sector are to be paid.  The funds in the account can only be used for this purpose except that RTE will be allowed to use up to 10 per cent of the annual amounts for programme support and development and to enable projects which they have not commissioned but which have encountered financial difficulty to be completed.  In each financial year the amounts specified above must be paid into the account and all the funds in the account must be spent or contractually committed in that financial year, unless it is impracticable to do so.</P>
    <P>The requirement to spend all the money in the independent programmes account is not, therefore, absolute.  I believe that RTÉ must remain in control of their own schedules and must be responsible for determining the quality of the programmes which they transmit. I feel that an absolute requirement to spend a specific amount of money in each year or, indeed, a requirement to devote a particular quota of broadcasting hours to independently produced programmes could lead to a situation where money was being spent on independent commissions regardless of quality and I want to avoid that.</P>
    <P>However, I should stress in the strongest terms possible, that I do not foresee any realistic prospect of any significant amount of money being left unspent at the end of any year because of lack of capability in the independent production sector to meet RTE requirements.  I expect RTE to work closely with the sector so that independent film makers are commissioned to provide quality programmes across the whole range of RTE output.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (5) provides that if any of the moneys in the independent television <Col N="19" /> programmes account remain to be expanded after the end of the financial year in which they were paid in, the amount not spent must remain in the independent television programme account in addition to the following years' allocation unless I, as Minister, authorise RTE to withdraw the unspent portion.</P>
    <P>Under section 6 RTE will have to make a special report to me on the operation of the independent television programme account each year, including its activities as respects the commissioning of programmes and any other matter which I may direct.  It is my intention that this report shall contain a complete list of the programmes and programme makers commissioned in each financial year.  The section also provides that the report shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This will ensure that the independent programmes account is operated in a completely transparent manner.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (7) allows for some flexibility in the annual amounts which RTE must set aside under this section for the commissioning of programmes from the independent sector.  These amounts, particularly in the later years, are very substantial and could become too great a burden on RTE if there was an unexpected downturn in the fortunes of the station or if, for whatever reason, the independent sector are unable to fully grasp the opportunity which this Bill presents.</P>
    <P>We have all learned about the dangers of inflexible provisions from the 1990 Act.  Under this provision I, as Minister, will be enabled to review the operation of the section and to vary by order the annual amounts stipulated in the table to this section.  In determining whether a variation is necessary I must have regard to the state of RTE finances; the effect of the operation of this section on employment in RTE and in the independent production sector; and the effect of the section on the ability of RTE to carry out its functions generally.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that any order made <Col N="20" /> under this section will not come into effect until a positive resolution approving the order has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This will ensure that any variations to the amounts specified in this section are effected again in the most transparent and democratic way.  It is my intention to review the operation of this section before the end of 1995.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes to considerable lengths in section 5 to define &ldquo;independent television programme&rdquo;.  The essence of the definition is that an independent television programme is a programme made by a person who has control of the participants, the persons involved in making the programme and the equipment and facilities used in making the programme and is neither a subsidiary nor a holding company of a broadcaster.</P>
    <P>Senators will also be aware that in section 7, I have taken the opportunity in this Bill to ensure that from the appointment of the next RTE Authority, women will be adequately represented on the RTE Authority.  This is a legislative first of which I am quite proud.  I hope that as time goes by the need for such specific provisions will be obviated and that all citizens will be represented fairly on State boards.  I am taking this step now because the crucial role that RTE plays in forming and reflecting our culture and value is of such importance that it must be informed by the views of women and the issue is simply too important to be left to the discretion of individual Ministers and Governments.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to address the question of local and community radio.  I am aware of concerns expressed by some local radio operators to the effect that while the 1990 cap imposed on RTE has had no identifiable beneficial effect on their sector, to restore the pre-1990 situation in the minds of many, without any further measures to assist the local radio sector will damage the growth of independent broadcasting. Fears have also been expressed that the restoration of the pre-1990 situation will allow RTE to unfairly use their dominant broadcasting position to undermine local <Col N="21" /> radio stations.  I wish to emphasise again that I am personally committed to the undertaking in the Programme for a Partnership Government to the effect that measures will be taken to ensure the continued viability of local radio.  I will be looking, in particular, at what I consider to be the crucial role of community radio.</P>
    <P>However, in general, I believe that there are few immediate measures that can be taken to meet the objectives of developing a strong independent radio sector.  Such measures that might be taken are of a more long term nature and should be dealt with in the context of my proposals for the radical restructuring of the broadcasting sector as a whole.  Since my appointment as Minister, I have established an ongoing consultation process between my office and representatives of the local radio sector. They have had many meetings and indeed I have met them myself in order to address the problems currently being experienced by the local radio stations and to explore possible solutions and I have put forward some proposals in that regard.</P>
    <P>I want to reassure the House that I would be seriously concerned if, after the enactment of this legislation, RTE were found to be abusing their position in Irish broadcasting.  RTE, as our national station, was established to provide a range of broadcasting services that is responsive to the needs and desires of the nation.  It must recognise that the public demand alternative locally based radio services and that if this means some reduction in audience share and some reduction in advertising, so be it.  RTE is not in existence to frustrate this public desire for choice.</P>
    <P>After the enactment of this Bill the total daily times for broadcasting advertisements fixed by the Authority and the maximum period so fixed to be given to advertisements in any hour shall be subject to the consent of the Minister.  I will be giving very careful consideration to RTE's proposals particularly in regard to radio advertising and I will be anxious to ensure that local radio does not run the <Col N="22" /> risk of being made commercially unviable as a consequence of any proposal to which I might give my consent.</P>
    <P>I regard the provision in the Bill as interim measures designed to address specific issues that are immediate and to give prompt effect to the commitments on broadcasting in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  They are the necessary first steps to pave the way for an overhaul of broadcasting structures which will create an environment in which Irish broadcasters can meet the challenge of the late 20th century and to continue to be successful in fulfilling the needs of the Irish audience well into the 21st century.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House with what is the first piece of major legislation he will be introducing.  I am at a loss to know why this legislation, a broadcasting authority Bill, is under the auspices and direction of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  Personally, I feel there is nobody better than the present Minister to introduce such a Bill in this House and no one could have more clearly explained the Government's intentions than the present Minister. However, the fact that it is the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht who is introducing a broadcasting Bill tells us a fair amount about the position of RTE and the regard which the Government has for RTE.  Throughout the Minister's speech, here and in the Dail, there was a personal imprint and a personal philosophy about the state of our broadcasting and what it is going to look like in the future.  I do not personally disagree with a great deal of what the Minister <Col N="23" /> said, but I do find the principle of ministerial control, Government control and Government input into broadcasting a dangerous one.  I also find it difficult to see how easily the philosophy the Minister explained to us today sits with the philosophy of Fianna Fáil, his comrades in Government, which is in direct contrast. That is not necessarily a bad thing. The Minister is in control at this stage but, in the future the powers he has given himself in this Bill may be exercised in a different way by someone with a different philosophy.</P>
      <P>The first problem with this Bill is, in some ways, a credit to the Minister.  He has got this Bill to the House in record time.  He has managed to repeal section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, in record time and persuade his colleagues of the importance of this and of the second strand of the Bill, which is to hand over some of RTE's money to independent producers.  That is a great credit to him but the problem with the Bill is that it is incomplete as it is presented to us today. As the Minister said, it has two important strands, but there are many aspects of broadcasting in this country about which we have had positive, but unclear, promises. It is difficult to approve this Bill without knowing where the other pieces will fit in.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister knows exactly what I am talking about, because the Bill leaves many people in the Irish broadcasting industry in a limbo of uncertainty. I know from being lobbied by them that the Minister has seriously considered what they have had to say, and has met with them.  He has not, I think given many of them any commitments of a rash nature.  However, he has left certain elements worried about their future because it is not catered for in this Bill. There is also no indication from the Minister as to when that will be catered for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt of his integrity and intention to bring a far more comprehensive and, as he said, radical Bill before this House and the Dáil in the future.  The problem here is that this Bill is piecemeal and not part of a set of <Col N="24" /> general broadcasting proposals, which we would like to see at the same time. One cannot really assess what is proposed here without knowing the other side of the equation.  We do not know that from what the Minister said.</P>
    <P>To be more specific, the Minister has made certain people happy but other people and interest groups unhappy.  He knows, and he acknowledged in his speech, that the local radio industry is deeply unhappy; not only with this Bill, but with its uncertain future and its continuing losses and haemorrhaging.  He knows that while RTE is allowed end its advertising cap in this Bill, there is also a promise of further interference with and control of expenditure in RTE.  He knows the national newspapers are extremely unhappy with this Bill because their future does not seem quite so bright as a result.  Some of us strongly opposed the Broadcasting Act, 1990, for reasons which I will go into later.  The Minister knows from the consumer's point of view, that there will be more advertising on RTE as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a large number of interest groups who are not only dissatisfied with the Bill but who remain in the dark.  I accept completely the Government's, or part of the Government's, desire to repeal that part of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, which was so appalling and illmotivated &mdash; the introduction of a cap on RTE.  Of course it would be impossible for the Minister to say openly in this House now, that the cap was motivated by a desire for revenge on RTE after an election in which Fianna Fáil felt that the Minister and the Government of the day had been treated in a partisan manner. That was the perception and the cap action was thought to be a revenge by the Minister of the day.  For that reason alone, the capping should be repealed.</P>
    <P>However, the ostensible reason for the capping has also, I am afraid, been exposed as inadequate and unworkable. It was supposed to divert advertising revenue to other areas of the media, in particular to Century Radio.  It patently failed to do that despite the best efforts <Col N="25" /> of the Fianna Fáil party at the time.  The capping was to a large extent by-passed by RTE, but rejected advertising did not find its way to the station to which it was hoped it would go.  The result, as everybody knows, was that Century Radio collapsed and went bankrupt.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, was totally negative.  It soured relations between the Government of the day and RTE, leaving RTE in a position where it felt it had to by-pass the Act and exceed its permitted income.  Other elements of the media did not receive the sort of boost intended by the cap.</P>
    <P>However, we have returned to the problem which RTE presents to successive Governments, with which the Minister is now struggling, but with which I do not believe any Government has properly grappled.  That problem is the monopoly situation of RTE within our broadcasting service, particularly our television service.  There is no rival in national television to allow people a choice.  There is no prospect, as far as I know, of such a rival in the light of recent events.  There is no rival in national radio either.  I do not believe anything the Minister said today addresses that problem or points towards a solution of the Irish broadcasting monopoly problem.</P>
    <P>We have not been able to square the circle whereby RTE receives both licensing money of over £50 million per annum and a huge chunk of the advertising revenue available to the media.  The more we interfere the greater the mess we appear to make.  The Minister today, while lifting the cap and to some extent deregulating RTE, is on the other hand, diverting its funds and deciding that expenditure should go in a certain direction of which he approves, which is his right.</P>
    <P>However, there is a danger that the national broadcasting station, while retaining its monopoly for many years to come, I suspect, will continue to be a tool of whatever Government is in power.  It will not be in the overt way of which we have been conscious in the past through blatant political interference because I think the present Minister is above that. <Col N="26" /> However, it will take the form of Government dictating how RTE money is spent and how revenue is raised.  That is a more subtle way of deciding the philosophy, programming and culture of RTE &mdash; an expression which the Minister quite rightly uses.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves the fundamental question &mdash; what is public sector broadcasting and what is it for?  Throughout the Minister's speech he spoke, as eloquently as ever about: &ldquo;the future of our civilisation and cultures&rdquo;.  I think he was talking about his culture.  I would like to contrast that with the Programme for a Partnership Government and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  There is an extraordinary contradiction between the two requirements for RTE set out in the Fianna Fáil and Labour <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997.</i>  The programme states: &ldquo;Our policy will be to ensure that Irish TV and radio programming is of the highest quality and that it remains the preferred choice of a majority of Irish viewers...&rdquo;.  These two aspects are not necessarily compatible.  Whereas the culture which the Minister spoke of exists, and it is his wish that RTE should promote this culture, I am not sure it is the preferred choice of the masses.</P>
    <P>There is a presumption among those with strong opinions on this issue that the masses want culture imposed upon them. I believe, however, that the last thing the masses seek is culture.  I believe that the masses often want what the Minister referred to as the lowest common denominator.  They want tabloid television which is spoken of in such a derisory manner by&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>And tabloid newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to tabloid newspapers. The masses buy them and they want them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke of his wish that there should not be market-led television.  The Minister is entitled to <Col N="27" /> express those views but it is dangerous to equate what he wishes for television with what the masses must have.  I accept that the Minister is seeking to strike a balance between&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;what is market-led and his own ideas as to what constitutes the culture of the nation which the people should have.  However, there is an inherent contradiction in this which also exists in RTE.</P>
      <P>The Government should consider spending the TV licence fee on those areas which the Minister describes as public sector broadcasting and spending the advertising revenue on what is termed more popular broadcasting.  This is a division which would be difficult to make; it summarises the contradiction in the broadcasting service.  To a large extent RTE is meant to be educational, to cater for minority programmes, to be managed in a non-commercial way in a reflection of what the Government believes the people ought to receive.  However, at the same time it is endeavouring to compete in a popular way with other broadcasting stations throughout the world.  It is a difficult if not impossible task because we are pursuing incompatible and contradictory objectives.</P>
      <P>In speaking to the House of his philosophy, the Minister spoke eloquently of the &ldquo;norms of creativity&rdquo; and &ldquo;critical capacity&rdquo; and of his wish that there would not be any uncritical market-led ideology. He spoke of his desire that RTE should be an expression of our culture and aspirations.  Indeed, in the Dáil he said he wanted it to take control of change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister desires, as is his entitlement, that RTE should give a philosophical lead to people.  That is fair enough but it should be acknowledged that it reflects the belief and philosophy of a particular Government and Minister. While I share to a large extent with the Minister the philosophy behind these <Col N="28" /> expressions, they are highly charged and they are open to subjective judgments. Presumably this philosophy will be reflected in any additional legislation which the Minister will introduce in this area.</P>
    <P>While this Bill reverts to the pre-1990 position, it increases ministerial control of RTE in many respects.  The 1990 legislation imposed a rigid cap which the then Opposition in this House voted against. Under this Bill, RTE must seek ministerial approval for its advertising times, ceiling and expenditure.  There is a real danger that RTE could abuse its position in this respect, that it could chop and change prices in advertising, that it could alternate its times and abuse the monopoly position it has established over the years.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult for any competitor to succeed against RTE in terms of advertising because of its dominant position.  It could undercut advertising revenue from another source and it could engage in predatory pricing.  The onus would be on the Minister to intervene in that situation. This would invest the Minister with too much power in the daily working of the national broadcasting station.</P>
    <P>I had hoped for an indication from the Minister today that at some future time RTE would be released from political control.  I had hoped to hear that perhaps the RTE Authority would no longer be appointed by the relevant Minister of the day.  The fact that the RTE Authority is appointed by the Minister means there is political sympathy with the Government of the day at the highest level which permeates downwards in terms of appointments, philosophy and decision-making.</P>
    <P>It would be a grand gesture if in the future, broadcasting was removed totally from the political arena.  However, that is not being done today; rather it appears that matters are taking a step backwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the independent sector, in the Bill there is a welcome and refreshing initiative in the desire of the Minister to assist this sector.  It is an initiative aimed at assisting native Irish industry although I understand that under EC regulations this cannot be specified.  It is likely that the money which the Minister is diverting from RTE to the independent sector will go to independent Irish producers.  However, I do not like the idea that so much money should be directed to independent producers as a gift without strings.</P>
      <P>In this Bill it is unclear how this money will be distributed, what sort of body will distribute it, and what criteria will be attached.  There is an assumption in this Bill that this money will be distributed to people who produce what the Minister calls &ldquo;quality productions&rdquo;.  I am doubtful about that and I think RTE should be unhappy that it is once again being interfered with in a rigid manner.  I do not know where these figures of £5 million in 1994, £6.5 million in 1995, £8.5 million in 1996, £10 million in 1997 and thereafter £12.5 million or 20 per cent, whichever is the larger, came from but they appear to be arbitrary.  They are large in terms of RTE's expenditure and appear to be going to independent producers whether RTE makes a profit or a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may be subject, as a result of amendment, to ministerial direction, but I would have thought there must be a <Col N="30" /> stipulation that sums as great as that could not possibly be paid out of RTE's coffers if the station is making a loss. Obviously, that is something the Minister would want to consider.  It appears that the idea of independent producers receiving what it, after all, a direct subsidy when the national broadcasting station cannot afford it, has not been thought out.  It is possible that this provision could be recalled with the permission of the Minister of the day, but the effect of this is to allow the Minister to put the screws on RTE, to permit him to play with millions of pounds of RTE's money and to decide that £10 million will go this year and £5 million next year depending on how they behave and whether they accede to his pressures.  This is a matter I regret.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, everybody in this House has been strongly lobbied by local radio groups who are unhappy about the state of Irish broadcasting and their position.  They maintain they received no benefit from the cap on RTE and that advertising simply did not come in their direction.  They also maintain that RTE will now be able to reduce its advertising charges because of the 45 per cent increase in time.  The effect of this will be to continue the sort of losses they have already suffered.  They claim they have had cumulative losses in their short existence of £6 million which, if added to Century Radio's losses, come to £10 million. Their lobbyists say that the future of local radio will be bleak &mdash; if it can exist at all &mdash; if the Minister does not come to their rescue shortly.  They estimate that because of the Bill, several hundred jobs will be lost.  They have seen the Minister on this issue about which he has said he is sympathetic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister here to deal with his first major Bill. In 1990 when one of his predecessors brought the previous Bill before the House, I said amending legislation had been long awaited and I expected another Bill to follow within 18 months to two years.  With the passing of time such amending legislation was badly needed. RTE has served the Irish people well over the last 70 years in radio and 32 years in television.  They have brought us every important event in Irish life, be it sporting, political or religious.  We remember only too well 30 years ago this <Col N="33" /> week.  In 1963, the visit of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, President of the United States. A special commemorative programme of that visit will be televised next Sunday night.  It was a fantastic occasion and was captured magnificently by RTE, even though the station had only been established two years at that time.  We also remember the worldwide interest in 1979 of the visit of His Holiness the Pope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator left out the Bishop of Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Mother Teresa?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also remember the visit to Ireland in recent weeks of Mother Teresa of Calcutta and how magnificently RTE covered that event.</P>
      <P>RTE's expertise and quality of work was clearly displayed during the coverage of the Eurovision Song Contest in Millstreet, County Cork, a few weeks ago.  I congratulate everyone associated with that occasion, including the Minister. It was the first time 25 countries were allowed to participate in the event. It was the largest song contest ever broadcast by a television company.  The European Broadcasting Unit allowed the coverage to proceed because of RTE's experience at televising previous Eurovision Song Contests.</P>
      <P>These great occasions increase our confidence in our national station.  Therefore, we are here today to amend this legislation to help RTE in the future.  I am involved in the music industry and I compliment RTE for the great encouragement it gives to Irish talent by broadcasting it on television and radio.  I congratulate RTE television, in particular, for promoting new talent on the television screen.  RTE has a 25 per cent commitment to broadcasting Irish talent on Radio 1 and 2FM.  I would like more middle of the road Irish-style programming during peak listening daytime hours.  I accept that RTE's policy is committed to 25 per cent Irish content at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need the same interest and commitment <Col N="34" /> from the independent commercial radio stations.  It may be to the long term detriment of our local radio stations that they are not committed to broadcasting Irish recorded material.  It is only natural that the initial broadcasting figures have declined, as can be seen in the new survey reports which were published recently, given that some local radio stations are broadcasting pop music from American and other cultures.</P>
    <P>In this legislation the Minister has agreed to address RTE's financial difficulties while, at the same time, ensuring television output for the independent producers.  I am aware of RTE's commitment to the use of independent productions. However, RTE is also concerned about maintaining the quality of these services.  This is no mean achievement, given the fact that they provide 2,000 full-time jobs for talented people in this country.  No one else could achieve this.  Therefore, we should ensure that future prospects for RTE are protected.</P>
    <P>We must enable RTE to fulfill its existing mandate and the extra obligations imposed under the legislation.  In this regard, the licence fee has not been increased since 1986.  Other industries have increased their products and their charges, yet the RTE licence fee has not been increased.  Perhaps it could be index-linked to the rate of inflation.  We must have one of the cheapest licence fees in Europe at present.</P>
    <P>People are paying £10, £12 or £20 each month for Sky television, which seems to be a popular channel at present.  RTE must keep a high standard to compete with these stations that are now broadcasting into our homes.  We must be realistic and objective.  No other television channel in Europe has the same problems as RTE.  It broadcasts to 3.5 million people.  It has four to 14 channels to contend with, depending on whether one lives in the multi-channel or the satellite dish area.  All these channels broadcast in the English language.  France, the UK or Germany do not have this number of native language channels beaming into their countries and competing for the <Col N="35" /> same viewers.  Perhaps the licence fee could be index-linked in the future so as to have a more realistic approach to the services and facilities which we will be able to obtain.</P>
    <P>The local radio stations must meet the public's requirements.  Everyone in the entertainment business knows that, as with television, radio listeners will not be retained unless suitable entertainment is provided.  The programmes broadcast at present are not suitable for the available listenership.  For example, there is no point playing pop music at 11 o'clock in the morning when young children and students are at school and the housewife or factory and office workers are the only people listening to the radio station.  In this regard, the radio stations are not meeting consumer demand.</P>
    <P>I had reservations when the independent radio licence were issued and the record will show that my reservations were correct.  Too many licences were granted.  On that occasion I said that four or five local radio licences were sufficient. I suggested that an opt in-opt out system be made available for areas looking for a radio licence.  For example, there are 100,000 people in Tallaght, which is more than the combined population of Longford, Leitrim and Roscommon.  It would not be a viable proposition for Tallaght to have its own full-time radio station. However, it could opt in-opt out in the same way that Cork local radio does on Radio 1.  That station then broadcasts during the time it is not possible to broadcast from the Cork area.</P>
    <P>Radio stations have been granted these licences but many of them should come together and form a co-operative.  A licence should then be given for the south, the west, the midlands, Cork and Dublin.  There are two stations in Dublin, although the Broadcasting Act, 1990 was introduced to give alternative radio listening.  We were all told that alternative radio listening was being offered through the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  It granted two pop stations for Dublin, but there was no alternative radio station.  People from the <Col N="36" /> age of 25 to 85 have no alternative radio station in the Dublin area.  This is a shame and a scandal.  One third of all money spent in Ireland on products is spent in the Dublin region.  From that point of view, it made economic sense to have alternative radio stations in Dublin.  A Leas-Chathaoirligh, you would be astounded if I told you that one of these two channels in Dublin plays only 2 per cent of Irish recorded material.  It is a disgrace.  These stations in Dublin are putting Irish musicians out of work.  Since these new stations were established, over 1,000 jobs have been lost in the past three years among Irish musicians, record companies, publishers and songwriters.  The other station in Dublin broadcasts only 4 per cent of Irish recorded material.  The Minister is committed to the arts and I am glad to see him in this important portfolio, but he and Department officials must examine the abuse by 98 FM and FM 104 who were granted licences to broadcast an alternative service to listeners in the Dublin area and are not doing so.</P>
    <P>The concern of Government now, as in 1987 and in 1989, is to create jobs. Broadcasting is a top service industry for the creation of jobs for young people. What is happening is that two separate radio stations are operating with nothing in mind but profit; they are not concerned with creating employment.  Ireland has a wealth of talent in the fields of music and song.  There is no greater ambassador for any nation than its music or song, or, as the Minister knows, its poems.  We must examine, in context of the regulations governing those licences, the commitment of those who have taken the licence and how they have been used or, rather abused by some.</P>
    <P>In fairness, RTE give an unwritten commitment to play 25 per cent of Irish recorded material on radio and that can be seen by looking back through their records.  On Radio 1 from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., which is peak listening time on any radio station since television takes over from that time, RTE still maintain the 25 <Col N="37" /> per cent level between those times and later on in the evening.</P>
    <P>As someone in the music industry who has made commitments to it in terms of investment and as a employer, I would say that the industry is in severe decline because it has no shop window, so to speak, to display its wares and without that the industry cannot sell its products. We all witnessed the concern over Digital in Galway and how tragic the loss of 800 jobs was for that city.  The music industry has lost 1,000 jobs in the last two years and will lose another 2,000 jobs in the next two years.  There are music groups and others in the music industry clinging on in the hope that something will happen, that this legislation will alleviate the plight of the live music industry. However, with the support of only 2 or 4 per cent air time from two new stations in the capital city, and one third of the total spending on advertising in this area, what chance do young people have of getting employment in the industry when their talents cannot be promoted or marketed?</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I will return to this issue, and I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton who is with us now, through her officials, to check the percentages relating to 98 FM and FM 104, and if I am proved wrong I will be amazed.  One has to listen for hours to hear an Irish record played on those stations.  The Minister of State will be aware of the importance of music.  It is uplifting.  People go out in the evenings to be entertained and music would be involved in 70 per cent of all entertainment. A music group is an attraction which draws people into the hotels and cabaret lounges, and generates extra employment in the services industry. Music is a main attraction for tourists. The Arts Council gets millions of pounds and the film board will get similar amounts.  However, there is no music council or board.  I ask the Minister to set up a music board to create jobs for our young people.</P>
    <P>How important is it to have ten people employed in Castlepollard, County <Col N="38" /> Westmeath in the music business?  There are 53 people employed full time in Moate, County Westmeath in the music business.  Those are good levels of employment in enterprises which are not getting one penny of assistance from the State and are not asking for State assistance. What do music groups get from the State?  After saving for eight or nine months and spending £5,000 or £6,000 to make a record they go to radio stations with it where they do not even get an acknowledgment of the receipt of the record.  That is a shame and a scandal.</P>
    <P>Mr. Paudge Brennan, a distinguished former Member of the Oireachtas, told me once that it is never the wrong time to do the right thing.  The Minister is committed to the arts and now is the time to make a start in acknowledging the expertise of all great Irish talent.  Look at the track record of Irish artists, of U2, Chris de Burgh, Daniel O'Donnell and Foster and Allen.  These artists have brought millions of pounds into the country. The success of Irish music artists has been far greater than that of any film made here or any play written by an Irish writer.  There are few enough people with expertise in the industry and it is going to lose 2,000 jobs over the next two years. We have already lost 1,000 or 1,500 jobs because this scandal has been allowed to continue.  We fought for 10 years to legalise local radio and it has left young people without a chance of getting employment.  Local radio stations committed to the music industry in rural Ireland are the only ones keeping the music industry alive.  They are the only ones who will survive because the people who go to see musical groups at venues at night, from 250 to 1,000 people, can identify with a radio station next morning if they hear that artist on the station. Stations are also at a great loss if they do not hear the artists to whom people are listening.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about this matter and I call on the Minister and his officials, before Committee Stage, to check the facts behind the serious allegations I have made.  If they are true I want them addressed and corrected in this Bill.  I <Col N="39" /> want a provision in this Bill that all radio stations must play 25 per cent home produced recorded material.  I am not talking about any particular type of music, rather about supporting the Irish music industry. Everywhere else in the world local music goes hand in hand with local radio stations because it makes commercial sense from the station's point of view. We cannot survive as an industry without a place to display our talents.  In fairness RTE television excels in promoting Irish artists and musicians.  It is a credit to those who are in charge of RTE and to the Oireachtas that set it up in the first place.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the previous Minister on saying that one third of the members of the RTE Authority are women, and the Minister said in his statement today that he intends to increase that percentage.  That is a step in the right direction.  I welcome the Bill and I wish to be positive about it.  The Minister has taken a personal interest in addressing the serious problem of repealing section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990.  I knew then it would not work.  It did not work and when the Minister took office he addressed the matter immediately.  I congratulate him on that.</P>
    <P>In relation to independent film producers and independent film makers, this fine industry was growing and showed promise.  I hope those with expertise in this area, who are still living in Ireland, will now get together.  This is a magnificent opportunity for them to make home produced films which can be transmitted on RTE.  The amount of money allocated is enormous.  It may be too optimistic to hope for a growth of 20 per cent each year over the next number of years. RTE consider 10 per cent is achievable and the Minister hopes for 20 per cent, but I suggest that 15 per cent would probably be a more manageable figure. Approximately 500 to 1,000 jobs can be created almost immediately in the private sector with people making half hour television documentaries and half hour or one hour series.  We are all in favour of anything that will create jobs and we <Col N="40" /> should not allow anyone who will eliminate jobs stand in the way.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for bringing the legislation before the House and I look forward to its speedy passage.</P>

      <P>I have listened with great interest to the contributions of the Minister, Senator Ross and Senator Cassidy and I share many of the views expressed.  There has been a great deal of creativity in the area of music and Senator Cassidy made a very cogent case for the establishment of a music board which would further foster the type of development he so eloquently summarised and outlined.</P>
      <P>On the other hand I share some of Senator Ross's reservations at a philosophical level about some of the principles behind the Bill and the potential for abuse if the most maligned scenario that could be envisaged was to come to pass.  We have to strike a balance between all the variables and the Bill strikes a sensible, positive and welcome balance.  I cannot, unfortunately, pronounce with any authority on what the Irish people want in terms of television.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear I lack Senator Ross's intimate familiarity with the mind of the masses and I am unable to accompany him on his daily pilgrimage to the soup kitchens.  It seems to me that we simply discover it as we go along and the Minister has made a reasonable effort to strike a balance between the various desiderata.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross said he thought it told us much about the Government that it is a Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht who is introducing this legislation. I hope it does.  I would very much like to think that the rest of the Government shares the Minister's views and his commitment to the approach he has adopted I would feel happier with the Government <Col N="41" /> if I honestly believed that everybody did share that view but I will not linger on that issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the repeal of that odious legislation, section 3 of the Braodcasting Act, 1990, which was not only one of the more vindictive but one of the more obtuse pieces of legislation passed in this State and that is saying something in terms of the competition for that position.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the general thrust of this legislation.  There are only two or three specific aspects upon which I wish to linger.  I do not know the rights and wrongs of the arguments about local radio but many of the local radio stations are making a very positive contribution to fostering a sense of local pride and identity and I would not wish to see anything in this legislation that would damage their potential for continuing to do that.  Cognisance should be taken of legitimate interest in that direction.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the commitment to what we call gender balance in the composition of the board.  I am not one who takes the view that there ought to be automatically and axiomatically a gender balance on a mathematical basis on all boards in all circumstances.  I can envisage circumstances in which there ought to be a majority of one sex depending on the type of board.  It is self-evident in television that there is a case for as mathematically even a balance as possible.  I am delighted that the Minister is introducing it in this way.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>I hope that as time goes by the need for such specific provisions will be obviated and that all citizens will be represented fairly on State boards.</P>
    <P>That will never happen because there is no way all citizens will ever be represented fairly on State boards.  This is an important step in the right direction but there is a whole range of other representational equities that have to be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>There is the question of representation in terms of class relations, perception of class as presented on television, relative <Col N="42" /> levels of education, geographic representation, status representation and town/country balances.  There is a whole range of variables in addition to gender. I am assuming that the Minister is talking explicitly about gender in that instance. While striking a balance so that all citizens would be fairly represented incorporates gender balance it also transcends it.  It poses questions which are less spectacular and of lower public profile than gender but which nevertheless deserve to be kept in mind when considering the composition of boards.</P>
    <P>A question also arises regarding the phrase that the Minister used, that &ldquo;RTE as our national station was established to provide a range of broadcasting services that is responsive to the needs and desires of the nation&rdquo;.  In practice that is the needs and desires of the State, and not of the nation.  Perhaps it was a slip on Senator Cassidy's part when he talked about RTE serving a market of 3.5 million people.  In practice that is probably the case but in terms of values and culture and what it represents, it has to go beyond 3.5 million.  Striking a balance between representing northern issues in the South and southern issues to whatever audience it has in the North ought to be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>In terms of the composition of the board, serious attention should be given to whether there is a mechanism by which representation of both communities in Northern Ireland could be taken into account.  I know that the Minister takes a capacious view of culture and that he would wish to incorporate Unionist culture as well as Nationalist culture in our national television station.  I am not sufficiently familiar with the mechanisms to suggest how this could be implemented in practice but it ought to be kept in mind. We should be aware of the distinction between State and nation when we talk about them.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the legislation.  I know it is only a first step but it is an important first step and I hope the legislation the Minister intends building on this will be constructed on the same principles and values and that we can look <Col N="43" /> forward to an early introduction in these Houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, and if she is successful in her job, perhaps many more of our citizens can enjoy the arts and culture that the Minister, Deputy Higgins, is so anxious to improve.  I was anxious to say to the Minister before he left that it is very refreshing to have a Minister in power who means what he says and does what he said in Opposition he would do, in this case to repeal the cap.</P>
      <P>Before I deal in detail with the cap, I must turn to my friend and colleague, Senator Ross, who has the capacity to turn himself inside out and face both directions at the one time.  In this House he advocates Government intervention and distortion of the market.  In his column in the Sunday newspaper he castigates the Government for such intervention. He laughs at the status of Shannon in the context of Aer Lingus and sneers at Government intervention in State or private companies.  At the same time he wishes to retain probably the most distorting legislation ever introduced which capped RTE's advertising revenue.  Perhaps Trinity College produces graduates who can face in more directions than even Professor Lee.</P>

      <P>There is an adage: &ldquo;If the cap fits, wear it&rdquo;.  It is manifestly true that this cap did not fit RTE and it would therefore be ridiculous to suggest that <Col N="45" /> RTE should wear it.  Where does the diverted revenue go?  Century Radio was one possible beneficiary and there was the suggested establishment of an independent television company.  Century Radio did not survive.  There is no possibility now, and I do not believe there was then, of the establishment of an independent third television company to absorb this revenue.</P>

      <P>The removal of the cap makes eminent sense.  Everyone, except certain vested interests, understands that.  The freedom of RTE to seek revenue from advertising is part of the free market.  People who wish to advertise <Col N="46" /> on RTE will not necessarily advertise in other media such as newspapers or television stations outside the State.</P>
      <P>RTE, through the services it provides, is a magnificent public institution.  I visited Millstreet for the Eurovision Song Contest.  Although I had no great interest in the music, it was fantastic to see the technical brilliance with which the show was staged by our own professionals.  I met and listened to a number of people from foreign broadcasting companies &mdash; companies with resources far in excess of what RTE could command &mdash; who were laudatory about the scale of the Millstreet project and the level of expertise demonstrated by RTE.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the national television company has not make a greater effort to televise programmes about life &mdash; apart from the bombings and violence &mdash; in Northern Ireland.  It has not broadcast programmes about Northern Ireland in the same way as it broadcasts programmes about other areas of the country like, for example, Cork and Kerry.  I would like to see programmes which bring the North of Ireland closer to us: programmes that go into people's homes similar to programmes made about people's lives in other parts of the country. If RTE has a role to play in bringing the two communities together more programmes should be made and broadcast about Northern Ireland.  There is an appalling level of ignorance in the South about life in Northern Ireland.  People are more familiar with the streets of New York and Boston than they are with the streets of Belfast and Derry.</P>
      <P>The Bill has two main elements: the repeal of the cap on advertising revenue for RTE and the statutory requirement on RTE to make specific amounts of money available each year for programmes commissioned from the independent television production sector. The latter element is a good provision. Some of the best programmes I have seen were on Channel 4 television, the majority of whose programmes are, as far as I know, independently produced. They were excellent programmes.</P>

I welcome the fact that the evident talent in private production companies in this country will be utilised and supported in a positive way.  RTE programmes should not be in-house production always.  The independent production sector should be encouraged.  The Minister said that movies like <i>My Left Foot</i> and others have brought great credit and honour to this country and show the high level of talent available in directing, producing and acting.  Senator Cassidy said that there were 54 people working in music production in Moate.  To be honest, I did not think there were 54 people living in Moate.</P>

      <P>Nonetheless, many people are employed in radio, television and independent production.  It is ironic that the only people who favour the 1990 Broadcasting Act are the newspaper owners.  They believe the Act should not be changed and should be rigidly implemented although there is no Century Radio or independent television channel to absorb the advertising revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the newspaper industry is in difficulty.  That difficulty is caused by newspapers imported from the UK which have an economy of scale and seem to provide sports coverage at an affordable price.  I am appalled that these newspapers are popular in this country. They are usually anti-Irish and have different headlines to suit the British and Irish markets &mdash; it is absolutely disgraceful. They are establishing a bridgehead here, which I deplore, and I <Col N="48" /> sympathise with our national and local newspapers in trying to cope with that sort of competition.  I do not know what the answer is, but it is not State intervention or giving money to newspapers.</P>

      <P>I am not going to accuse you of bias, a Leas-Chathaoirligh; it is the last thought in my head.</P>
      <P>Advertising spent on newspapers and television is not necessarily interchangeable. If RTE kept turning away money for advertising, this does not mean it would go to newspapers instead because companies, especially small companies, do not necessarily need or want to advertise there.  Furthermore, some products look better on film than on paper; some products cannot be advertised in newspapers.  Therefore, advertising on television is essential for them.  The only possible beneficiary in this case would have been Sky television or ITV.  The cap on advertising forced smaller companies from advertising on RTE and it reduced the level of promotion for small indigenous brands and the number of new television advertisements being made.  It also made an effect on the production companies making these advertisements.  I am not an expert in this area, but I understand that making advertisements for the entertainment business, whether for television or music, is an important and integral part of their income&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>A massive part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that any reduction of that activity brings about <Col N="49" /> other difficulties, including job losses. Indigenous companies developing their brands must have access to reasonably priced domestic television advertising and RTE should not have to rely on multinational companies to provide their advertising revenues in the future.  This House may not have the power to instruct RTE to offer indigenous industries better rates &mdash; presumably it is prohibited under EC competition law &mdash; but there must be some way of doing this.  RTE could give more economic packages or reduce their rates, depending on the size of the company, but I do not know if that is legally possible.  Television is a powerful medium for product development but their advertising charges are prohibitive for many companies.  In RTE radio, some of the demands made on advertisers were outlandish.  The technical data required to produce a simple advertisement seemed to be to be extraordinary and was stopping smaller companies from using the service.  It was much easier to approach private local radio stations because they were more flexible in accepting an advertisement than RTE, who had 25 restrictions on what one could do.</P>
      <P>RTE operates in the most competitive broadcasting environment in Europe, it is in competition with the BBC, ITV, and an increasing number of English language satellite services, all of whom have enormously larger operating budgets.  I understand that some of the satellites being sent up can now take 40 to 50 channels; yet, RTE is holding its own in this market.  Advertisers still wished to come to them, even when the cap was in place, indicating that the ordinary Irish consumer was watching RTE, rather than Sky, ITV or others.  They should be credited for maintaining their market share, considering the high level of competition brought about by technology.  Indeed, some of the channels being transmitted are bad and extremely boring.  How these stations keep going is beyond me; even a dog would fall asleep watching them, but someone must be viewing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the establishment of the independent <Col N="50" /> braodcasting sector, a debate has developed concerning the dual funded status of RTE.  The independent broadcasting sectors argue that the licence fee is intended to finance public service braodcasting and obligates that the sector should have access to some of the licence fee revenue.  The definition of &ldquo;public service&rdquo; was referred to by other speakers.  I do not believe it should consist of wall-to-wall broadcasting.  I may offend Senator Cassidy when I say that music played 24 hours a day irritates me, whether it is from an American pop star or Foster and Allen.  My favourite radio programme is produced elsewhere because I like to listen to discussions on today's issues and do not like to be subject to continuous pop music.  Senator Cassidy is correct in saying that Dublin is badly served in relation to informative, entertaining and alternative radio.  When one switches to an alternative Dublin radio station, music is all that can be heard and in many cases, they are playing the same records.  I am sure that was never envisaged when independent broadcasting facilities were being discussed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the lifting of the advertising cap because it protects those employed in RTE.  It was forecast that up to 300 jobs could have been lost there if this phoney embargo was kept in place and I am glad it has been removed.  I am also glad to have had the opportunity to draw attention to the contradiction between the writings and utterings of Senator Ross on State intervention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation will effectively repeal the advertising cap on RTE, which was imposed by a previous Minister in the Broadcasting Act, 1990. The Bill will enable RTE to improve the quality and extent of its broadcasting and will also create the interesting precedent of requiring the RTE Authority to keep a special account of moneys to be made <Col N="51" /> available to the independent television production sector.</P>
      <P>This Bill will enrich RTE, which already receives substantial funds from broadcasting licence fees and independent television film makers.  In effect, it fulfils two of the commitments in The Programme for a Partnership Government &mdash; I would refer the Minister to page 52 of the programme &mdash; at a huge cost to local radio.  The Minister has now chosen to move on two of his broadcasting commitments and to stall on the third.  The Programme for a Partnership Government states that measures will be provided to ensure that commercial local radio broadcasting remains viable.  I believe the Minister is leaving local radio high and dry.  This Bill abandons local radio, not even proposing a White Paper similar to that proposed in the Programme for a Partnership Government for the film industry.</P>
      <P>This legislation will put intolerable pressure on local radio stations, many of which are already surviving against the odds.  They deserve a proportion of the licence fee or a share of the surplus funding which is being directed to independent film making, because they will not be playing on a level pitch or operating in a climate of fair competition.  This case has been made by the members of the Association of Independent Radio Stations.  These independent radio stations were set up without public funding, and given the current economic climate that is an important factor.  They have to absorb the considerable cost of providing and servicing a full national and international news service and a transmission network.  On top of this they must pay on ongoing levy of 3 per cent to the Independent Radio and Television Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will generate difficulties for local radio stations.  How can the Minister justify this?  Every Senator and every public representative, particularly those serving rural constituencies, are aware of the special role of the local community radio station in their areas.  They do not play wall to wall music, they broadcast <Col N="52" /> local news, sports coverage, political discussion and provide a platform for local music and drama.  This legislation will silence and kill the valuable public service aspect of local radio.</P>
    <P>The Minister is dealing with this issue in a ham-fisted manner.  He must accept the need for a radical reappraisal of broadcasting at every level, particularly an assessment of the three year old independent radio industry.  I am aware of the difficulties faced by local radio stations, having been a board member of Galway Bay FM.  This station plays an important role in this area, a role which RTE could not fulfil.  I ask the Minister to be fair in his dealings with local radio.  He must state what provisions he intends to make for local community radio stations.  Kind words and commendations are an inadequate response and will be seen for what they are, a long fingering device.</P>
    <P>To sustain the future viability of the independent radio sector provision must be made for local radio stations.  They need State funding to support their transmission networks.  Stations broadcasting to a dispersed population are those with difficult transmission problems and the lowest economic base on which to rely. Top quality news and nuacht services cost money, as does the sustenance of community based radio.</P>
    <P>Local stations could concede defeat and reduce programmes to an unending stream of middle of the road music, but this is not what the people want.  The most up to date listening figures prove that the programmes broadcast by the independent sector are what people want.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Local radio stations are out-performing RTE, the national broadcaster. More people are listening to local radio stations than to RTE.  Yet, all the licence fees go directly to RTE, no funding is <Col N="53" /> given to the popular stations.  Where is the fairness in that?  Does the Minister agree that the local stations are as deserving of funding as the national station, if not more so?</P>
    <P>The Minister has already shown himself willing to appropriate a portion of the licence fee for redistribution to the independent television sector and has set up an accounting mechanism to facilitate this.  I ask him why he cannot do the same for local radio stations and thereby guarantee their survival.</P>
    <P>I cannot emphasise strongly enough how critical the situation is for local radio and how vital it is that he outline his proposals in this area.  Will he produce a White Paper?  That is the key issue.  When will the heads of another Bill be ready? When will local radio be given practical representation on the board of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, the body whose rent is paid by these stations?</P>
    <P>An increase in licence fees was suggested. This would be a retrograde step considering the current economic climate and the problem of unemployment.  Such action should not be taken at this time or in the near future.</P>

      <P>I would like to pay tribute to the Minister for the removal of the cap on advertising revenue for RTE. Members have welcomed this proposal and have long since come to the conclusion that this experiment was illjudged and a failure.  I welcome the availability of funding for programmes commissioned by the independent television sector, which is capable of making programmes of the highest quality.  The Progressive Democrats support both proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the debate surrounding the Broadcasting Act, 1990, it is disappointing that the Minister, in his first legislative initiative, has presented a limited set of proposals.  The Minister said this was the first step in a comprehensive package of proposals on broadcasting legislation.  He indicated that he is in the process of formulating proposals for the long term restructuring of broadcasting. <Col N="54" /> The measures introduced will impact on other sectors in this area.  Signals received by other sectors are a cause for concern.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister should have waited until the proposals for long term restructuring were finalised before introducing these proposals.  These measures could have been introduced together. The Bill fails to deal with fundamental questions which have arisen in this area. The Minister has failed to put forward a comprehensive structure for the development of all sections of the media.  Concentrating on certain aspects has left other areas concerned and confused about the intentions of the Government and I think this is a pity.</P>
    <P>In the area of broadcasting until very recently we have had State monopoly in radio and television through the medium of RTE.  The competition from local radio stations has been of great benefit. It has given people in local communities a greater range of programming and has enabled a range of local community issues to be broadcast and debated.  This would have been impossible for a single national radio station like RTE.  It has also given broadcasters an opportunity to become involved in local radio.  We have seen a host of broadcasters coming to the fore who would not have had the chance to do so but for local radio.  The outcome has been a healthier industry.  The extent of the listenership of local radio stations shows the vast majority of people support this development.</P>
    <P>As previous speakers have said, there are a large number of people employed by these stations.  Over 400 people work full-time in local radio and a large number are employed part-time.  We have to acknowledge that local radio has been a success.  There are 21 local radio stations operating at present.  Local radio has been able to provide something different for its listeners, something which is community based and locally centered, a service RTE has been unable to provide until now.  All of us, particularly those of us living in rural areas, accept that local radio provides a vital public service function.  Until recently it <Col N="55" /> was felt that only RTE could do this. Local radio was compelled by the Government to provide a certain amount of international and local news and they have succeeded in doing so.  They have provided information, debate on local issues and educational programmes.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for people who live outside large centres to realise the huge energising effect local radio has had in rural areas.  It has given people a sense of community and a great sense of self-awareness and self-confidence.  It is promoting the kind of initiatives and enterprise in local areas which we in this House, are constantly saying need to be generated. We have a Minister of State with responsibility for rural development and he and a majority in this House are trying to encourage enterprise and initiative in local areas.  Local radio has played a huge part in such encouragement and this should be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>As Senator McDonagh said, local radio stations are facing huge difficulties. They face the financial implications of providing international, national and local news and the cost of the transmitter network.  These costs are a huge drain on their resources.  Nothing in what the Minister is proposing indicates that he is going to help these stations.  He said he is aware of their difficulties but does not think there are any immediate measures which can be taken.  The local radio stations, when lobbying the Minister, suggested measures which he could take. He acknowledged that he is going to divert certain sums of money, up to a limit of £10 million per year, to the independent producers sectors.  This is welcome but he could also allocate a certain amount to help the local radio stations maintain viability.  As he said, this is one of the aims of the Government.  I would like to see him give a greater commitment to this aim.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the attempts of previous Ministers for Communications to deal with some of these questions.  The monopoly of RTE and the fact that it received funding from both television and a large proportion of the advertising <Col N="56" /> revenue posed problems for other sectors. The approach taken by a previous Minister in imposing the infamous cap on RTE's advertising revenue and the associated proposal to deflect some of the licence fee to the alternative national broadcasting radio and television stations was not successful.</P>
    <P>I accept and appreciate what the Minister is proposing but he should look to the local radio sector and local newspapers. He acknowledged that there is little doubt that the newspaper industry faces difficulties; this applies particularly to provincial newspapers.  In my area we have five such newspapers and they are finding it extremely difficult to maintain viability.  In his speech the Minister said that major advertisers have made it clear to him that &ldquo;their advertising budgets for media other than television &mdash; newspapers both national and provincial, local broadcasting, etc. &mdash; have had to be curtailed in order to maintain their presence on television&rdquo;.  Local newspapers have felt the effect of this.  The Minister should make a statement of his intent to support them.  There are 50 provincial newspapers in the country.  They have to cope with the imposition of VAT and the increased competition they believe they will face as a result of the lifting of the cap.  The Minister has to provide a supportive framework within which they can operate.  I ask him to consider this in the light of the factors we are discussing today which I believe hinder progress in this area.</P>
    <P>I turn to the proposal in the Bill to provide annually a specific level of funding to the independent producers sector. This stems from the monopoly position that was enjoyed by RTE and is a recognition of one of the unsatisfactory consequences of this monopoly, namely, the existence of an independent non-RTE film and programme making sector which is almost totally reliant on RTÉ for its survival and livelihood.  I welcome the provision the Minister is making because a huge pool of talent exists and the Minister's commitment of funds from RTE would be a huge boost to this talent.  In fairness to RTE they have consistently <Col N="57" /> commissioned programmes from the independent film making sector although their capacity to do so was constrained by the cap, but its removal will improve the situation.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have no objection to making provision for independent programme makers and we very much welcome this proposal.  However, the Minister has failed to give any guidelines as to how this money is to be spent. Many of the independent film and programme makers find this situation unsatisfactory. I wish to see the Minister outline how he proposes this money should be spent.</P>
    <P>My only disagreement with this Bill is not with the two measures it proposes to introduce but the fundmental one that it is too narrow in focus and only deals with a very small segment of the broadcasting spectrum.  I ask the Minister to frame a much more comprehensive Bill.  I know he has promised this but we have to look at public sector broadcasting and the relationship that ought to exist between the public and private sectors.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the Seanad and also my constituency colleague, the Minister, who was here earlier.  I welcome this Bill but immediately concur with previous speakers by saying that it falls far short of the requirements of broadcasting at present. While I accept that the Minister stated this is only a first step he could have provided for further developments in the broadcasting industry.</P>
      <P>It is particularly welcome that the Minister has provided a significant amount of money for the independent programme and film making industry. This move is indicative of his vision and I say this having observed him in the constituency of Galway west for a number of years.  It is a significant step forward and I support it.  This move will release much energy in film and programme making in Ireland.</P>

    <P>The money provided as a result of this legislation will not alone help the industry to develop but also provide important <Col N="58" /> extra job opportunities and ensure economic growth in the sector.  In recent years we have seen the talent in film and programme making.  This extra money and RTE's wish to give air time to quality Irish produced material is a major boost for the industry and will provide good possibilities for economic growth.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it is disappointing the Minister and the Government did not see fit to include in this legislation a provision for local radio.  That sector has had considerable success in Ireland but without State financial support the true benefits of local radio are not being achieved. The success of local radio stations and programmes is based on good production, good presentation and, above all, good content of local material.  &ldquo;On a Clare Day&rdquo;, made by Caiman Jones for Radio Clare, is one of the best radio programmes anywhere.</P>
    <P>People and money are required to produce such programmes and local radio cannot affort to employ those people.  That is indicative of the current difficulties faced by local radio.  It will not be able to provide the public service the community desires and deserves unless and until the Government provides financial support.  A number of proposals should be in this legislation.  I ask the Minister and the Government to consider them as a matter of urgency in order to assist local radio.</P>
    <P>When the cap on RTE revenue is lifted, approximately 6 per cent of the licence fee should be diverted to the Independent Radio and Television Commission or another statutory body.  This should be used to fund public ownership of local radio transmission facilities.  The Independent Radio and Television Commission should then lease the transmitters and compensate stations for their maintenance.</P>
    <P>A central service should also be established using the licence fee money to provide national and international news and nuacht for the local stations, which could act as paid regional bureaux for the central service.  Current affairs, Irish, <Col N="59" /> educational, historical, cultural, local arts, heritage and special interest programmes should be commissioned for broadcast on local radio stations and all such programmes should have to comply with defined public service broadcasting criteria.</P>
    <P>Training programmes and grants should be available for radio programme makers and presenters, general development and support of the local radio sector and the training and management of community radio projects.  The Independent Radio and Television Commission should be reformed to give greater emphasis to its role as a developmental body.  Local radio stations should be given representation on the commission. The 3 per cent levy currently payable by stations to the Independent Radio and Television Commission should be discontinued. The Independent Radio and Television Commission should be maintained from the television licence fee.</P>
    <P>The overall cost of those proposals would be about £3 million.  It would be money well spent providing local radio with the kind of support that is urgently needed to give it the strength to provide the service we all wish to see for local communities.</P>
    <P>The Minister should define in legislation the criteria under which public service broadcasting would qualify for funding from the licence fee.  He should legislate for mandatory minimum fees for those who participate in, are involved in or place advertising with or accept advertising from illegal unlicenced broadcasters.  The effectiveness of measures dealing with pirate radio should be immediately reviewed in conjunction with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications with a view to setting up a task force to deal with this ongoing problem.  The Minister should encourage greater spending by Departments on advertising campaigns on local radio.  Those proposals or proposals of this nature should be included in the Bill. Before long I hope we see further legislation which will provide support for local radio.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> Unfortunately, up to now we have not seen the main benefits of this service from many local stations largely due to commercial demands.  Many of the stations provide a diet of music and a limited news and current affairs service.  Good local radio should be the voice of development and progress and should tackle the problems in local communities.  For £3 million this Government and the Irish people could get an extremely valuable, good and commercial service.  I urge the Minister to examine the possibility of showing the same vision to local radio operators that he showed to the film makers in providing for a contribution from the licence fee.</P>
    <P>I believed the imposition of the cap on RTE was a bad decision.  I made efforts to stop the Government proceeding with those proposals.  Who developed these ideas?  I may be wrong, but since I became a Member of the Oireachtas the Departments responsible for communications have developed ideas which have been difficult to accept &mdash; the decisions on CB radio, MMDS and more recently the advertising cap.  I assume there was departmental input into these decisions. Questions must be asked of those who put forward those proposals.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to accept much of the logic coming from the Department of Transport and Communications on these issues.  I fail to accept the reasoning on the MMDS or CB issues where we were told repeatedly by the Department of Cummunications, as it was at the time, that it was impossible to licence people who wanted to use CB radios.  We were and are being told the same about the deflector system.  I cannot see why this system cannot be legalised.  We are told it is not possible for reasons of copyright and the ownership of signals by the BBC, but nobody, it seems to me, has actually tested this system.  I do not accept the reasons given by the Department on those issues.</P>
    <P>The cap on advertising imposed on RTE was very hard to understand at the time, and it is now shown to have been a ridiculous proposal.  I am pleased it is to be discontinued.  The only people still <Col N="61" /> complaining are the newspapers and as the Minister pointed out, there is no evidence to suggest that the newspaper industry fared any better as a result of the cap being in place.  The newspaper industry has faced severe difficulties in recent years and action needs to be taken to improve the commercial climate for that industry, but I do not accept that any such action will be adversely affected by lifting the cap on advertising.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the philosophical aspect of broadcasting.  He talked about the significant changes which are taking place in telecommunications technology at present.  I urge him and his Department to embrace the changes in broadcasting which will inevitably take place because of those technological changes.  I hope he will provide a further explanation of what he means by &ldquo;further steps in broadcasting legislation&rdquo;, which we all accept will take time, but which should now be a matter for public discussion.  People should be informed of the potential that exists in the area of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>While I have been urging support for local radio stations, I must admit that over the years RTE has done a splendid job despite many constraints in radio and television.  I am satisfied that there is plenty of room for RTE as a national radio station, and for the two national television stations and this need not be affected by the development of local radio stations.  It is clear that there is different audiences at different times of the day for national and local radio.  Local radio can enhance RTE as a national radio station, and in that respect the effectiveness of the morning programmes such as the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Hour&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Hour&rdquo;, shows that RTE can respond successfully to the competition for listeners provided by local radio.  Programmes such as the Marian Finucane programme show that national radio can still be the most effective form of communication in terms of current affairs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as far as it goes, but I urge the Minister to come back to the Oireachtas as quickly as possible with further proposals to support local radio <Col N="62" /> in the same way that he is supportive of the film and programme making industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember speaking in this House when the cap was put on RTE advertising revenue some years ago and there was concern about possible job losses.  I made one point very clearly: I said I was proud of &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo;, a programme which is produced in Ireland and to make up the shortfall RTE should sell &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; to other European countries. Now that the cap is removed, the pressures are coming on other areas.</P>
      <P>The entire country is proud of what RTE achieved in Millstreet.  It was a magnificent performance.  Many tourists will be attracted to Ireland by the show RTE provided.  It was the best £2.5 million we ever spent.  Various shots of Ireland were shown to one million people right across Europe.  I compliment RTE.</P>
      <P>My only concern is that when the cap is removed RTE could take on a different role, creating a monopoly through low cost advertising.  Since programmes like the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; attract an enormous number of listeners no one can say the local stations will interfere with RTE. From a rural point of view, something will have to be done to maintain local radio programmes.  People listen to local stations during the day, but they listen to the national station for specific programmes. I ask the Minister to see if part of the licence fee could be made available to help the local stations.</P>

      <P>I will not delay the passage of the legislation unduly, except to avail of this opportunity to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Higgins, who has already made a significant mark in this area.  It is time this legislation was put in place.  However, the absence of specific financial commitments to independent production is a gap which should be filled without delay.  While I welcome this Bill and compliment the Minister on it, I would like to see the further provisions he mentioned implemented soon, especially in relation to the financing of local radio. The Bill is long overdue; I presume the legislation in place is over 30 years old <Col N="63" /> and it is important to legislate to account for the widespread technological changes taking place internationally.</P>
      <P>Not only is it important for legislation to keep abreast with technological changes, but training of personnel in telecommunications is equally important and finance is required for this.  It is vital for the development of broadcasting that training be given more attention.  Some colleges and other educational institutions are organising special media courses. It is important to pay attention to the specific skills and expertise needed in this evolving area as well as to changes in technology.  It is, therefore, important to acknowledge the necessity for highly skilled training and professionalism.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill setting aside a specific amount for the provision of quality programmes.  A number of years ago I said that if a situation developed in television when most of our programming consisted of canned products from various countries it would be bad for this country.  I still believe that; it is more important now than ever before that in the provision of material for television we should endeavour to have as much Irish produced material as possible.  We should not rely on imported canned material to form the basis of our programming.</P>
      <P>I was never enamoured of the decision to cap the advertising revenue.</P>

Within reason, I am not enamoured of the idea of a cap on advertising revenue. I welcome the proposal in this legislation to change that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to acknowledge the contribution made by Radio Telefís Éireann to both radio and television nationally.  Another Senator mentioned Marion Finucane's radio programme.  She has created a <Col N="64" /> greater awareness of issues affecting women than any other broadcaster in the last 20 years.  The same may be said of Gay Byrne.  Although some may not like him and some may wish to put him in prison, Gay Byrne has made an enormous contribution to national broadcasting. There are exceptional occasional broadcasts we may be critical of, but overall the thrust of television broadcasting has been very good.  The quality of stations, programming and personnel could hold their own with any station in the world.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important not to forget the regions.  There is criticism in my region of the lack of coverage by the national Authority of many important events. RTE should re-examine its coverage of major cultural events in the mid-west region.</P>

      <P>The legislation we are amending today was brought before the House around the same time that Aer Lingus was being deprived of routes and when much negative pressure was being put on semi-State industry.  I have always taken the view that RTE should have been allowed to compete in the marketplace and that it should have been part of the Broadcasting Authority.  The licence fee which was paid to RTE should be set off against the requirements of public broadcasting, of minority programming and the requirements of educating, informing and entertaining which are the three objectives outlined in the statute establishing RTE.  It has done it, and done it magnificently, and it is appropriate that RTE be sustained and supported. The attack on RTE in an attempt to cut back on revenue in an artificial way by depriving it of advertising income was always doomed to failure and it was more certain to be doomed to failure coming as it did from a Government which was in favour of market forces and the rules of the marketplace while, at the same time, going overboard to stop RTE from competing.</P>
      <P>I welcome this movement forward.  It has been long awaited and, without being patronising, I wish to congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this legislation. It was badly needed and will at least allow one semi-State body to work in the marketplace and to do what is required of it in order to ensure that it retains its peak positions in Irish life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirements that money be made available to support independent production has been needed for a long time. It is an area I have discussed regularly <Col N="67" /> with people in RTE who, as we are aware, resisted this approach in the earlier days, although there has been somewhat of a metamorphosis on that issue also.  I have now heard much support in RTE for this move forward.  In this country there is a strong indigenous industry in the area of independent programming which has not had an outlet and which will now get sustenance from this proposal.  This is the best way for a semi-State company to be controlled by the State.  In other words, it is given a direction to support the private sector where it can.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in this element of support for the independent programme makers because, as I have said regularly in this House, the lack of educational broadcasting at primary level has been a source of constant irritation to me for that past 15 years and I see this as one of the opportunities for moving forward.  There is now an opportunity for independent programmers to put together broadcasting material or a series of programmes tied in with the curriculum at primary, post primary and third level.  This will, in effect, allow the introduction of educational broadcasting through the side door if not the back door.  I would prefer if the Minister were to take a firmer approach in this area and I ask him to look at it at some stage.  I have had talks with some people in the independent sector over the past number of months with a view to getting movement in that direction.</P>
    <P>We need to point out to a sceptical public the reason for advertising revenue and licence revenue.  Recently I had discussions with the representatives of the Association of Independent Radio Stations where they were putting forward the view that in order to increase their news coverage some of this money should have been made available to them.  I think it would have been wrong to make the money available to them.  That is not to say that I object to support for the independent radio stations who, despite what I said to the Senator from Clare, I acknowledged they are doing a superb <Col N="68" /> job.  However part of their remit was 20 per cent news broadcasting and, having put in that requirement, I do not think we should support the other suggestion.</P>
    <P>In light of the need for transparency and accountability which is demanded of all of us what is needed is a breakdown of where the license money goes.  Anybody who listens to RTE radio from 7 o'clock in the evening until closing down will know there are a series of programmes, some of which are aimed at a minority audience, for example, the arts programmes, and which appeal to a small audience.  RTE is not taking the line of other stations which are simply maximising their audience in order to attract advertising revenue.  I do no think that RTE has any advertising on radio between 7 p.m. and midnight, or at least they have very little.  This is where the licence revenue comes into it.  They have done magnificent programming in responding to minority needs and this is what is required on us.  RTE has done substantial work in the areas of drama, arts and culture.  This is an area where we get a response to our licence fee and there is also the benefit created in those areas in RTE.  There is a strong need to explain to the public how the money is being invested.  It is being said, very often in the print media, the RTE receives two different revenues inputs, that somehow it is being paid twice for doing the same job.  That has never been the case.</P>
    <P>There has been little discussion about the money which was earned above the cap during the period of the cap restruction. I would like to hear how we explain that money in legal terms in the context of the legislation which now exists.  What was supposed to happen to the revenue when the amount of money coming into RTE was more than what it was allowed to take in?  My grandfather always told me that the first tenet of business was never to refuse money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if one was not getting the whole amount, it was important to capture whatever was there.  RTE took <Col N="69" /> that approach and it took in that money. What was it supposed to have done with it?  Was it supposed to send it back, was it not supposed to take it in or was it supposed to give it away?  We are legislators and this is a question that needs to be asked.  RTE handled itself correctly but I would like to know how it is explained under the terms of the current legislation.  I was worried at one stage during the RTE industrial action in the early spring of last year when one senior executive was quoted as saying &mdash; or should I say had attributed to him because he denied it afterwards &mdash; that he had an £8 million &ldquo;war chest&rdquo; with which to fight those lefty-types who were causing problems in his station.  I was worried about money being channelled in the wrong direction.  I ask the Minister to clarify this matter for us.</P>
      <P>The legislation will be welcomed by people in broadcasting generally.  The stations live off each other.  RTE give sustenance to the local stations.  We have now reached the situation where peak audience levels are being attained by all stations.  There are local stations who have managed to achieve the magical 51 per cent audience in areas such as Kerry, Clare, Louth, Meath and the mid-west. There is also a great improvement in the Cork and Limerick areas where stations are close to coming near their maximum audience.  They have proved one thing which is important, that the stations that began as music stations outside the Dublin area are the stations that have lost out.  The stations which went far beyond the 20 per cent information and news, which was supposed to be unachievable, have proved to be more successful.  The stations which I mentioned, all have a one or two hour news and current affairs programme in the morning, which is of top quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation allows RTE to compete and to have money to invest in projects such as the Eurovision Song Contest where the question of costs becomes a huge issue.  No other organisation would take on projects such as the Eurovision Song Contest which do not break even. Such projects benefit the State, providing <Col N="70" /> a boost to the tourist industry and to local investment.  The money was spent by RTE but the network itself will not necessarily benefit.  When considering the role of RTE we should acknowledge the service which we are receiving as a State and the value the consumer is receiving for the licence fee.</P>
    <P>If we are to make demands of RTE, we should realise that those demands must be paid for through the licence fee. The licence fee payment should be broken down so that people will know the value they are receiving in terms of minority programmes, cultural programmes, overseas listeners, specific music interests and so on.  Advertising revenue should sustain both independent programming and programming within RTE.</P>
    <P>I think a superb job is being done here and I welcome the legislation.  I regret it has been necessary to bring it in to repeal an abominable piece of cap legislation, which was supported so enthusiastically by Fianna Fáil Senators.  I congratulate the Minister on convincing the majority partner in Government of the need for this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the House.  I also want to welcome the removal of the capping which came into existence in 1990 because it meant that many small advertising firms suffered a loss of business.  I hope they will be able to recover that business.  Many international firms have sophisticated broadcasting facilities, and if they were to use their own advertisements on stations which are received here, it would be very detrimental to the Irish independent production sector.  We are also bombarded with UK and satellite programmes.  If we lose out on advertising to those it will have a severe effect on staff in RTE and on the advertising industry.  I think this Bill is most welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his address the Minister spoke about local radio.  As far as we are concerned in Cork south-west, the country wide service which is provided by County Sound is second to none.  It <Col N="71" /> has developed an excellent broadcasting service, and sometimes the day time service is split in two with one service for Cork city and the other for north and west Cork.  It is of tremendous interest to the local people and great work is being done.</P>
    <P>In a rural community, such as mine, local radio can run into physical and financial difficulties.  I will speak about the physical difficulties first.  In areas such as west Cork, where there are many hills and mountains, it is quite difficult to transmit a signal to the scattered population, and often extra booster stations must be put up at great cost.  On the financial side, in a scattered rural area there are few commercial groupings which can afford advertising.  The money is not there to be spent.</P>
    <P>Sometimes, local radio or national radio provides a type of social service in an area which is important for peripheral areas such as west Cork.  I want to compliment again the local radio station which is doing tremendous work.  In parts of west Cork we can also receive Kerry Radio, which is welcome in that area.</P>
    <P>We need co-ordination of programmes because there is no point in having programmes of a similar nature on at the same time on two stations.  We need to ensure that local programmes do not coincide with programmes on the national network.  From 7 p.m. until 11 p.m. there is often a wide variety of programmes available which are of great interest locally.  Sometimes, there are similar programmes on RTE Radio 1, County Sound in west Cork and Kerry Radio.  We need a programming policy which avoids such collisions; co-ordination would be of benefit to all concerned and to the national network.</P>
    <P>I also wish to discuss the need for a policy on community television in the constituency.  For a number of years a deflector system has been in operation in our area.  Alongside that, there was the MMDS service in the Cork area.  We had only two channels for many years in the west Cork area.  We are happy now to have alternative viewing to which west <Col N="72" /> Cork is as entitled as any other part of the country.  The deflector service is being&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí go léir a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht seo.  Bhí an díospóireacht ar ard-chaighdeán agus tá brón orm arís go raibh mé as láthair ar feadh tamaill toisc go raibh sé de dhualgas orm féin freastal ar chruinniú Rialtais.  Tá mé buíoch de na daoine a sheas isteach dom.</P>
      <P>I want to thank all of the Senators for their thoughtful contributions which reflect the great national interest in matters cultural, specifically matters of broadcasting.  I took notes before I had to leave for the Cabinet meeting.  Notes were also taken by the Minister of State who stood in for me, for which I am very grateful.  The contributions were practical and stimulating and I would like to take up some of the points to indicate to Senators the shape of any such further legislation I will be making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must repeat that I stated at the outset that this Bill was a first, practical and <Col N="73" /> urgent step towards creating an environment in which all our broadcasting structures could be looked at critically and calmly.  It will ensure that changes which take place will put the broadcasting services into a shape that will carry them into the next century.</P>
    <P>A Minister who introduces policy is often accused of having ideas whereas a Minister introducing no policy is accused of having no ideas.  I have no difficulty with carrying the burden of ideas.  It was suggested that my recent appearance on RTE reading poetry, an engagement that had been arranged before I became a Minister, was an act of gratitude on the part of RTE because of the removal of the cap on advertising and an abuse of my position as Minister in an attempt to sell my poetry books.  The reference is scurrilous, however it is part of the world we live in and reflects the low standards prevailing in certain parts of the printed news media.</P>
    <P>The current legislative regime is based on legislation that was enacted over 30 years ago at a time when international competition, particularly in television, was virtually non-existent except in areas where overspill of signals was possible. There have been dramatic changes in recent years.</P>
    <P>As a philosophical indication of my thinking, technological change cannot be opposed but an effort can be made at understanding such change.  In this respect I have spoken elsewhere of my indebtedness to ideas expressed by people such as the great philosopher of communications, Raymond Williams, who titled one of his last papers &ldquo;Be the arrow, not the target&rdquo;.  It was about the peoples of the world, in a communicative order, exercising direction rather than being passive.  There is a difference between activity within an active participation in a culture that has a communicative order to it and being a passive member of a market segment.  I have decided to address these issues, making my views on broadcasting fit within such a theory of a communicative order and a democratic theory of culture.  That is an <Col N="74" /> indication of the fundamental legislation I will be introducing.</P>
    <P>International competition is a reality and it is useful to reassess our situation and establish the structures that are now necessary to ensure that Irish broadcasting services remain the preferred choice of Irish viewers and listeners.  The issue I am addressing here is the retention of the capacity for standards.  I am not in a monopoly position myself and for most of my life I have been in a minority on many issues that have later become majority issues.  There is no suggestion that in my conscious attempt to ensure standards I am making any impositions, I am in favour of a pluralism of editorial communication and in the communicative order throughout, whether it be the print media or radio and television. If a narrowness of choice emerges in any part of the media the Government might address this issue.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Ross for his kind remarks and his belief in the views I have proposed.  However, I must take exception to his suggestion that the provisions of the Bill give the Minister many new powers of interference in the daily affairs of RTE.  The removal of the cap restores the position in relation to advertising to its precise position immediately before the enactment of the 1990 legislation.</P>
    <P>A dilemma arises in that on the one hand I am asked not to have powers and, on the other, I am asked to have powers to prevent distortion of the market-place in relation to local radio.  I have no problem with this dilemma in that I am happy with the powers at my disposal.  I have no statutory power to interfere in the charges RTE may levy for advertising. However, that does not prevent me from expressing concern that RTE could be tempted to abuse its dominant position and engage in the cut price selling of advertising on radio to the detriment of the independent local sector.</P>
    <P>It surprises me that Senator Ross should detect the sinister process of interference in the daily affairs of RTE in my proposals in relation to the independent television production sector.  There is no <Col N="75" /> power in the legislation before the House that gives the Minister any say in how the money allocated to the independent sector in RTE is to be spent.  RTE retains total control of this money and the programmes on which it is spent.  The Minister's only function arises if and when RTE fails to spend all this money.  The Minister may then allow RTE to spend some or all of such unspent money on general broadcasting purposes and even then it would be a matter for RTE to dispose of this money itself.</P>
    <P>Any change of substance in regard to the amounts of money to be devoted to independent production must come before both Houses of the Oireachtas and the draft of a statutory order proposing change must be approved by both Houses.  I ask Members to note my commitment to the Oireachtas in this regard. I have asked that these orders require Oireachtas approval which is a positive recognition of the role of both Houses.  I am confident, therefore, that Senators will accept that none of the provisions is sinister in intent whereby I, as Minister, could interfere in the day to day activities of RTE.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy complimented RTE on the excellence of its productions since its inception.  On behalf of the Government I would like to be associated with such compliments to RTE.  Those of us who are old enough will remember the excellent coverage of the visit by President Kennedy and, more recently, other distinguished visitors.  There has also been spectacular coverage of the Eurovision Song Contest.</P>
    <P>Two aspects of the recent Eurovision Song Contest deserve comment.  First was the manner in which technology was moved to a new setting and the way the staff of RTE excelled themselves when faced with the great challenge.  Secondly, I was delighted when visiting the the technical division to observe that for the first time the contest was directed by a woman, assisted in technical tasks by five other women.  I wish a film could have been made of this so that every girl in the country could see that not only were <Col N="76" /> there jobs as presenters in the audio visual area, but that there is no task, however technical, that cannot be provided by a person irrespective of gender. The achievement of Anita Notaro in this respect was noted by me publicly.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy referred to the level of the TV licence fee which has been static since 1986.  The Senator will appreciate that there is no necessity to increase the fee if RTE can comply with its statutory obligations and meet its other obligations on a budget derived from the fee as set at present plus commercial revenue.  The RTE Authority has not sought an increase in the fee; however I take his point that it needs to be reviewed</P>
    <P>Regarding Senator Cassidy's remarks on the number of independent stations and their commitment to Irish artists, such issues fall within the remit of the Independent Radio and Television Commission. The statutory responsibility for deciding on the number of stations rests with the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  It is also a matter for the Independent Radio and Television Commission to satisfy itself that the conditions of the contracts between the stations and the commission are complied with.  If the stations to which the Senator has referred are not complying with the conditions of their contracts with the commission, it is for the commission to secure enforcement.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House relates solely to the RTE Authority.  It would have been inappropriate to include any provisions that relate to the independent broadcasting sector.  However, it is my intention to address these issues, including a review of the 1988 Act when I make a fundamental review of broadcasting.  I intend to conduct a comprehensive review of all the structures, and I said at the outset I will take all the remarks and valuable suggestions made here into account.  The role of Irish artists in the programme schedules of the independent sector is something which concerns me. However, I have to say I have a philosophical problem with quotas of anything <Col N="77" /> in relation to broadcasting.  I have to take account of European Community legislation as well that prohibits giving preferential treatment to nationals of one member state over another.  I am committed to this; I think in the end the specificity and attractiveness of products in the television and film area is assured by their excellence and I have great confidence in our capacity in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would like to be associated with Senator Lee's compliments to certain local radio stations.  From the outset, some stations set out to be public service-oriented; while others had different ideas in the beginning, the demands of their listeners brought about a change.  It is significant that many of the more successful stations are deeply involved in the community.  In fact, it has encouraged me enormously to see how valuable the term &ldquo;community&rdquo; has been.  I have had several meetings with different interests involved and my staff have had several meetings with for example, AIRS.  These meeting are ones in which I have not just been making a commitment to what is in the Programme for a Partnership Government to put them on a viable basis, but I have sought to extract details and profiles of costs so that I can see how they can best be assisted.  That is my approach; calmly and systematically to look at the dozen different areas of major cost and to see how many of these can be addressed because the stations told me themselves that the last thing they wanted was for me to fire money indiscriminately at stations good, bad and indifferent.</P>
    <P>The lesson is interesting; it is that rather than the Irish radio public wanting tabloid radio, they voted with their ears in favour of news, current affairs and documentaries.  The stations that set out from the beginning on that path are those that have done best, and others later converted.  I take the point that they have an important role, as local and national newspapers do, in being part of the social service of communities.  They serve and enable communities to communciate with themselves and break down barriers. That really is telling us something else too.  That our story-telling and narrative <Col N="78" /> propensity in our tradition of broadcasting is not as easily knocked out as people think.  People have brought to radio a different set of requirements in terms of demand than they have for example, to newspapers when they have been swamped.</P>
    <P>I can confirm for Senator Magner that RTE cannot give preferential rates to Irish advertisers.  However, I would expect that advertising rates, particularly on television, should fall as a result of the extra time that will become available as a consequence of the repeal of section 3 of the 1990 Act.  Senator McDonagh referred to the position of the independent radio sector and, along with Senator Ross, referred to the submission made by AIRS.  I could say, and leave it at that, but I will not, that the independent radio stations were established without any promise of State subsidy for any element of their programming under a regime that they knew in 1988.  They knew the playing pitch, but I am not ending it at that.  I know now that they are in difficulty and I am looking at ways in which I can assist them, but on the basis of a thoroughgoing examining of costs, circumstances, development and standards.  The structures that will govern them, will be reviewed on my overall review of legislation.  Frankly, I think the sections on development in the 1988 legislation might have been better, more forcefully, and energetically used.</P>
    <P>Any changes in the regime represents a fundamental change in the way in which our broadcasting services operates.  I am convinced that such changes in relation to the independent radio sector must be considered in the context of the total review of my broadcasting legislation and I intend to proceed quickly with the development of such proposals for the restructuring of broadcasting.  I do not think that Members of the Seanad could accuse me of being dilatory about bringing forward change.  It will be carried out with the same speed, and, I hope with the same enthusiastic response.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators refered to the alleged monopoly position of RTE.  I would like to point out that while RTE <Col N="79" /> may have had a monopoly on the business of broadcasting in the State until recently, RTE operates in perhaps the most competitive broadcasting environment in Europe, particularly through the widespread availability of foreign broadcasting services through cable and MMDS systems.</P>
    <P>Current legislation allows for the establishment of a national independent radio and television station and it is a matter for the Independent Radio and Television Commission to invoke these powers if they consider that such services would be financially viable.  May I also say that RTE &mdash; perhaps from competition with the BBC which has a very high standard &mdash; itself achieved high standards, it had a good standard with which to compare itself.  In that sense, that is why you have had such continuous, high quality work over such a long period.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the demands of their particular local stations and I am glad Senators are enjoying such a warm relationship with them all.</P>

      <P>Senator Fahey referred specifically to the need for training and development support for the sector.  In the list of ways in which I can help I have noted all the different submissions that have been made by way of news, contributions, the cost of an authority, and other ways such as training. These are matters in which I have a very open mind.  I have always been of the view that the flexibility of the 1988 Act was not full explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senators, including Senator Fahey, said that independent production should be funded from the licence fee.  RTE is required to allocate a specific sum of money to the commissioning of programmes for its own purposes and nothing is being diverted away from RTE <i>per se.</i>  I would like to thank Senator O'Toole for the number of points he made.  He correctly paid tribute to excellence, and we should not <Col N="80" /> be afraid to do that even if it is repetition. Let us pay tribute each day to excellence, if necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also spoke about excess revenue which I found fascinating. As you know, in the Programme for a Partnership Government, such sums as were accumulated under the cap are stated as being available for bringing on air Teilifís na Gaeilge.  The Cabinet has approved a sum of £4.5 million for such needs as I have this year in that regard. Technically, RTE would have begun to get into difficulties if amending legislation had not been in place by next September but, in fact, this legislation redresses the situation.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to Senators from all sides who have welcomed the changes I have made in relation to the independent film sector.  I am completely convinced of the strength and creativity of the Irish independent film sector, and I saw it as a launching pad towards the development of a viable sector.  It should be taken in conjunction with what I have been doing in co-operation with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, under section 35 for financing film, my re-establishment and re-funding of the Film Board, other proposals in relation to film training, and a series of other matters including co-production arrangements.</P>
    <P>I am convinced there is an exciting time ahead in film and I appreciate Senators' support for that.  It is important that we create an environment in RTE and outside RTE that celebrates creativity.  As I mentioned at the outset, I hope I will not have to legislate in future for an equality of representation on the RTE Authority, because of the involvement of people, men and women, in equal proportion in Irish society.  I thought that women's experience is so important in Irish society that I took the opportunity in this legislation to make sure that women would comprise half the members of the RTE Authority.  I am glad I did that.  It goes beyond what was asked of me by the Commission on the Status of Women, it exceeds the Government's commitment. What it means is that you will have that experience involved in decision making. <Col N="81" /> No one should worry about the fundamental question of the relationship of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht with broadcasting institutions, including RTE.  My view is that RTE is an authority that is supported by statute, It exercises its views and releases the creativity which exists.  I am happy about this.  However, I must deal with the shape of future broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Senator Calnan raised a specific point and I discussed it in relation to local radio.  My responsibility in relation to community television is for broadcasting <Col N="82" /> rather than transmission.  However, when I review broadcasting I will look at the community's place in the media, both aural and visual.  I will consider ways in which to address issues such as these.</P>
    <P>It is important that we regard this area as a sensitive one.  It is part of our cultural identity and the things which form our attitude of mind.  We are not talking about neutral products.  I express my gratitude to the Senators for the effort they have shown in this debate and for the quality of their contributions.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann views with concern the absence of a national determination to reduce the level of personal liability accident litigation which is currently causing economic hardship and lack of competitiveness through the consequent high level of insurance cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An amendment to the motion has been proposed by the Government side with which I have no problem.  I will dwell on this for a moment as I am anxious to make my intentions clear.  This motion <Col N="83" /> does not fall into the category we are familiar with in the Seanad.  Private Members' time tends to be taken up with motions criticising Government policy and calling on the Government to do something, or complimenting the Government.  Those motions have their place but this is not one of them.  This motion is not a criticism of Government nor does it say what the Government should have done about personal claims. I have no problem acknowledging what has been done by this and previous Governments and giving them a pat on the back.  The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke, will know that we have established a good relationship on her previous visits here and will realise that I am not just being nice to the Government.</P>
    <P>I agree with the thrust of the Government amendment but the objective of this motion is different.  It has two aims and, in the tradition of Independent Senators, I will speak for myself.  The motion's seconder, Senator Henry, will give her own perspective.</P>
    <P>There are two things I wish to highlight. First, I want to make the public aware of the size of the issue.  This is a major problem which affects every family, person and business in the country. It is a significant obstruction to us in the most important task we face, that is, the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>The second point I wish to highlight is that the way we have looked at this problem in the past has been wrong.  We have been addressing the fringe of the problem and treating it as if it were the core.  We have seen this as a problem for the Government to fix but it is not.  All the Government can do is tamper with the fringe.  This is important but nevertheless it is just a fringe.  The core of the problem is one that only the people of Ireland can address.  It is not something to be dumped on the Government.  It is a problem for all of us as citizens of Ireland.  I do not think that has been said before, or if it has it has not been said loud enough.  As a result up to now we <Col N="84" /> have concentrated on what the Government can do.</P>
    <P>The time has come for us to redefine the problem and to attack its core.  In doing so our first task as a nation is to realise the importance of the problem. People do not realise just how much of our national resources go to settling personal injury claims.  Figures as long as telephone numbers tend to lose meaning. I will put it another way and perhaps views will change.  Personal injury claims cost every household in this country £26 every week, that is approximately £1,350 per year per family and well over £1 billion a year.  That, as the Minister knows from experience, is more than half the amount spent on education.  People are inclined to say that the £26 is not out of their pockets and that insurance companies and big business can afford to pay.  This is not so.  People may not know it, and that is part of the problem, but they do pay.  The insurance companies do not pay, their customers pay.</P>
    <P>When a motor insurance company pays a claim, it is not the company that pays but the policy holders.  As I am sure the Minister will be able to tell us, all but a tiny amount of the vast sum of money collected in motor insurance is used to meet claims and when claims increase premia rise in direct proportion.  They have to because it is the motorist who pays.</P>
    <P>The same applies to business insurance.  The insurance company does not pay, it gets back in premia what it charges a business.  People may not realise that business companies do not pay either, they could not.  They have to pass these expenses on to their customers through price increases.  Every time a person buys a packet of sugar in a supermarket or in a corner shop part of what he pays goes towards the cost of overall personal injury claims in this country.  It is not a negligible part of that cost either. Many claims do not involve insurance companies at all.  I understand that CIE does not insure itself any more nor do many local authorities.  They have to meet the cost of their own claims and that <Col N="85" /> means an increase in local rates or the fares charged by CIE.</P>
    <P>It involves a large amount of money, the kind of money that actually makes a difference, and the general public ends up paying.  The bad news does not end there because what we pay out in personal injury claims is out of line with other countries.  I understand that in terms of the amount of our GDP paid out on personal injury claims, we are No. 2 in the world and that in the EC we have by far the highest level of personal injury claims.  According to a survey carried out some years ago, in comparison with the UK, which is the most important coustomer and competitor for many of our businesses, we had seven times more personal injury claims and seven times more on average was paid out per claim.  That is a cost difference of 49 times, not 49 per cent, but 4,900 per cent more.  I gather the gap has since narrowed but the difference is still enormous.</P>
    <P>Do these international comparisons matter?  I suggest they do because, to be blunt, they cost us jobs.  They cost us jobs because the higher cost undermines the competitiveness of Irish companies when they sell in competition with companies from countries that have lower costs.  In effect, we sent our companies into the marketplace with one hand tied behind their backs.  It is not only on Irish-owned companies that this has a bad effect on growth and therefore on job creation. We are also trying to attract foreign companies to set up business here.  We need them to establish here while, at the same time, developing our own companies. These mobile investments go where they get the best package, and costs are part of that package.  The fact that we have a personal injury cost that is higher than any competing location is a negative factor in job creation.  Since many of these decisions are finely based, there is little doubt that this is a factor that has cost us jobs in the past and will continue to do so in the future.</P>
    <P>Mr. Jerome Karter is a recognised international expert in this area and he highlighted the problem about five years ago in a publication called <i>Business</i><Col N="86" /><i>Insurance.</i>  He referred to the claims environment in Irish manufacturing compared to the rest of the world as appalling.  Let us not fool ourselves that we can sweep this under the carpet or that our international competitiveness is not a critical issue.  This week we learned that Ireland had slipped four places this year in the rankings of the world competitiveness report, published yesterday by the World Economic Forum and the International Institute of Management Development. We pay for being out of line on personal claims, we pay for it in the price of everything we buy, in higher taxes and in the job opportunities we fail to create or fail to attract.</P>
    <P>We also pay for it other ways.  Black-rock Park, a lovely park, is just across the road from one of my supermarkets. That park no longer has slides and swings.  I understand the reason is that Dún Laoghaire Corporation found it could not risk the cost of having to cover itself for injuries that might take place and the slides and swings were removed. That is just one example.  Others are the number of hotels which no longer offer trekking holidays &mdash; which used to attract tourists &mdash; and the number of pop concerts, sports days and private fund raising events which cannot be held because of insurance costs.  It has a social effect too.</P>
    <P>Our first task as opinion formers is to persuade people that is a very important issue.  What can we as a country do about it?  This is where I suggest we need the biggest change.  There are two aspects to the cost of personal injury claims.  One is that there are so many claims and the other is that so much is paid out on each individual claim.  What we have done up to now, largely I feel because we expect the Government to do everything for us, is to concentrate on the second aspect. We have had a raft of measures, and I know more are in the pipeline, aimed at curbing the amount that is paid out in claims and at reducing legal costs.  I welcome those measures &mdash; and I am sure we all do &mdash; but it should be clear by now that this is just the fringe of the problem and not the core.  The core of the problem is the number of claims made and the <Col N="87" /> number of accidents that occur.  We are the second most litigious country in the world.  To judge from the number of whiplash cases, I gather that Irish necks, for some reason or another, are four times softer than British necks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They could be hard necks as well.  The real problem is that we make too many claims and it is time to address this aspect of the problem.  We can do this to some extent by reducing the amounts paid in personal injury awards. Obviously the more attractive the awards, the great the temptation to make a claim.  However, reducing the amount of the award, although that is important, will not be sufficient to create the necessary change.  We must also change our attitude to the issue &mdash; that is the challenge. We must realise that it is not other people who pay these claims: it is us, as customers, motorists, parents, taxpayers and job seekers.  We must accept that our easy-going attitude to people who make unjustified claims is not in the national interest.  It must be our national priority to make our attitudes and practices in this matter more like those of the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>The object of this motion is not to call on the Government to do more about the problem.  The object of the motion is to alert the nation to the problem and to impress on people that the solution is in their hands.  The motion sends a message to people that the personal liability-accident litigation is hurting the country and that we should stop hurting ourselves in this way.  I hope this is the start of a national crusade against this problem.</P>
      <P>I offer my apologies as I am unable to stay to hear the Minister's response. Senator Henry has agreed to keep me informed as I am very interested in this issue.</P>

      <P>Although I complained to the House some days ago that I was employed in a semi-secretarial capacity <Col N="88" /> due to the lack of secretarial staff for Independent Senators, I assure the House that on this occasion I do not mind acting in that capacity for Senator Quinn.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to second the motion.  I am glad the Minister of State with special responsibility for Labour is present for this debate.  Senator Quinn has highlighted the extensive economic costs for Ireland that result from major claims and the consequent high cost of insurance.  I wish to look at the problem in the Minister's area of responsibility as that aspect is too often forgotten.  If we did not have accidents we would have not have claims and costs.  I have no difficulty with the proposed amendments as the motion was put down to draw this appalling problem to the attention of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I wish to begin by discussing present legislation on safety and health in the workplace and also our attitude to this issue.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act of 1989 is excellent legislation. It established the National Authority of Occupational Safety and Health as well as the statutory provisions and codes of contract for employment in this country. Previously only about 20 per cent of employees were covered by legislation but now all areas of employment such as agriculture, fishing, shops and supermarkets in addition to factories are covered. The Act deals not only with accidents in the workplace but also with disease contracted there and, most importantly, methods to prevent the occurrence of both.</P>
      <P>However, in the four years since the Act was passed how successful have we been in enforcing its provisions?  I suggest that in many areas we have not been successful.</P>
      <P>There are 12.2 accidents per thousand workers per year in Ireland.  In other words, there were 13,000 accidents in the workplace last year and 30 per cent of these claimed costs for injuries, a higher level of claims than that of other countries. Education in accident prevention should begin during childhood, when the child is playing in the home, and continue through the school years and into the workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> The National Safety Authority has only 87 employees and at any one time there are only 30 inspectors with responsibility for one million people.  The corresponding ratio in England is about 90 inspectors to one million people, three times higher.  All workers improve their performance on the imminent and unexpected arrival of an inspector and this is one area where we must be more realistic.  A second aspect of this issue is that although the regulations are well known to large industries and efforts are made to enforce them in the workplace, I wonder how well these regulations are known to smaller firms?  Some do not appear to have heard of the regulations at all.  There are only 50 or so people in the National Safety Authority who must publicise the regulations and deal with all queries.  It would be cost effective to employ extra people in that body.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that 60 per cent of accidents would not take place if the following advice was followed: improved training for employees, good workplace practice &mdash; in other words not removing safety equipment from the workplace &mdash; and the application of common sense. Like Senator Quinn, I believe something can be done about such accidents.  It would certainly be worthwhile to focus on the areas mentioned.</P>
    <P>With regard to improved training for workers, an enormous number of accidents occur within a few weeks of the commencement of employment.  Very often, particularly in manual work, workers are given little or no training. Good workplace practice is difficult to enforce but is essential.  Unfortunately, many people appear to leave their common sense outside the door when they start operating machinery.</P>
    <P>Companies, under the Act, are obliged to train their employees for the job and to point out the job's inherent dangers. Safety representatives should be appointed in each workplace.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, recently urged workers in various industries to appoint safety representatives.  Senator O'Toole appears to have decided that I have <Col N="90" /> undertaken the role of safety representative for the Independent Senators following my queries about our working conditions.  It is extraordinary that more workers do not elect safety representatives to liaise between employer and employees.  While the dangers must be pointed out to employees there must also be a return of information from the employees to the employers.  The importance of safety representatives must be stressed.</P>
    <P>How many firms display a safety statement or distribute one to their employees?  How many companies explain in their annual reports how they have dealt with health and safety in the workplace and how much time and money they have spent on this issue?  I have never seen such information in a company report although the Act &mdash; which imposes that obligation on companies &mdash; has been in force for four years.</P>
    <P>We have a very casual attitude to employee safety in this country.  In German factories all employees wear protective clothing.  That is not the case here.  It is almost impossible to persuade employees who work in noisy factories to wear protective headphones despite the well established fact that hearing is rapidly damaged by loud noises at work. Even workers who operate pneumatic drills are regularly seen without their protective headphones.  I do not know if they do so because they consider it macho or because they have always worked without headphones.  Many do not even wear protective glasses.</P>
    <P>The unions have made strenuous efforts to encourage their members to abide by safety standards and the unions also help to provide safety training.  It has been pointed out to me that SIPTU has been particularly good in those respects. However, not all workers, especially those in small concerns, are union members and some large firms are not unionised so we cannot rely on the unions to carry out all the training.  Publicity of accidents in the workplace would be worth while.  There has been a considerable drop in the number of agricultural accidents, especially those <Col N="91" /> involving tractors and young drivers.  This may be due to the publicity given to terrifying stories of 14 year olds reversing into slurry pits and other such incidents. More publicity of accidents in the workplace would help prevent those accidents.</P>
    <P>It would also help if employees realised that, under the Act, they have a duty not to interfere with or misuse appliances; that they should wear protective clothing; that they are obliged to ensure their own safety and the safety of other employees and that they are obliged to point out safety deficiencies to their employers. Senator Quinn referred to the lack of cover by occupier liability insurance on playing fields and recreational facilities and I wonder how many facilities, which were given free gratis to community bodies, have now had to be withdrawn because of huge occupational liability claims being taken against, for example, a school or a holiday complex because they allowed others to use their facilities. As Deputy Deenihan said in his motion on occupier liability in the Dáil, access to the countryside is gradually being restricted and fields are being coralled.  Those on the front line, such as the borough corporation have had enormous claims imposed on them.</P>
    <P>My own personal experience will further illustrate these insurance increases. This year, I paid £8,142 in medical liability insurance, while I paid £6,000 last year &mdash; the highest rate is £21,000.  If I worked in England, I would only have to pay £1,950 and their top rate is £4,000. The Minister for Health pays £14 million to insure approximately half our doctors. That amount would run a couple of small hospitals and our legal costs are on the same scale.  We do not even have mutual disclosure of expert witness reports so that claims may be settled earlier.  While solicitors assure me they do not allow fraudulent claims to be pursued, there is a major report in one of today's papers about a solicitor being severely reprimanded and reported to the Law Society by Mr. Justice Martin for his third bogus claim.  He had claimed for special damages, loss of employment and <Col N="92" /> insurance costs for a woman who had not claimed them at all &mdash; he had been involved in two previous bogus cases. While I have a healthy respect for the legal profession, I am sure he is not the only one involved in this practice and I refer again to the £14 million the Minister for Health is paying out, which could be put to great use in our hospitals and which provides only limited cover for half our doctors.</P>
    <P>What really upsets me is that no one will take note of this Seanad motion, which affects everyone in the country while everyone will notice the debate taking place in the other House, which I doubt affects one per cent of the population. A national realisation of how much claims in every field cost the State is required &mdash; we talked about defamation here last week.  Drunk driving is no longer acceptable &mdash; at least we have solved that problem &mdash; but what has been done about MOT tests and why are people not penalised for having unroad-worthy vehicles?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the proposer and the seconder of the motion for the generous way in which they approached the issue and the amendment.  I will briefly refer to what both Senators Quinn and Henry said and I will be present for the course of the debate and will, therefore, be able to absorb what is said on all sides of the House.  Senator Quinn said a crusade needed to be initiated and this theme <Col N="93" /> was echoed by Senator Henry, although in different words, who claimed that a more focused and determined approach was required.</P>
      <P>The high sums of money given out in claims are frightening and they place us at the top of the table in this regard &mdash; we would be delighted to be there with regard to any other matter.  I was most interested in Senator Henry's comments on health and safety at work and was impressed with her great knowledge on it because that area comes under my remit, but fatal agricultural accidents have been halved, which was a dramatic improvement and greatly delighted the health and safety authority.  This is due in part to the massive publicity given whenever a farm accident occurs.  Only yesterday, I received notification &mdash; they must be notified to the office of the Minister in charge &mdash; of a particularly horrific accident involving farm machinery.  It is often young people who are involved in these accidents, but the widespread publicity has led to greater care being taken on farms and the health and safety authorities tell me that the statistics bear this out.  A serious or fatal accident causes much grief not only in the immediate family but also in the surrounding community and there is an economic cost as well.  We are currently reviewing staffing levels of the health and safety authority. Senator Henry said they have scant resources and I agree with her but they are highly professional and dedicated people and should be commended for their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government shares the concerns expressed in this House tonight, and indeed on other occasions, about the current level of non-life insurance costs in this country.  The cost of motor and liability insurance claims totalled almost £661 million in 1991, which represented 2.7 per cent of GNP.  The cost of insurance is determined, as we know, by the frequency and cost of settling claims.  This cost can only be met by insurers if an appropriate premium is forthcoming to cover the risk.  Ultimately, of course, the cost of claims is met by insurance policy holders, including business and private <Col N="94" /> individuals.  All politicians have encountered cases where the cost of motor insurance causes economic hardship to private motorists, both young and mature.  We have met many young people in our constituencies who find it difficult to get to their jobs because of the cost of car insurance.  In many cases, the car they own is worth less than than the insurance required to cover it.</P>
    <P>Insurance premiums are undeniably a major cost to business and statistics show that such costs are higher here than in many competing countries &mdash; that is the competitive theme Senator Quinn raised earlier.  The Department has estimated that the cost of claims, both insured and uninsured, to business, arising from road accidents and accidents at work, exceeded £400 million in 1991.  I also understand that employers' liability costs to Irish manufacturing industry represents some 2.2 per cent of payroll, whereas the equivalent figure for the rest of Europe is put at 1 per cent.  The magnitude of these costs is undeniably a burden on the retention and creation of employment.  The Government has been aware of those problems for some time and has been attempting to identify and implement measures to improve the cost environment for insurance.</P>
    <P>Following the work of the inter-ministerial group on motor insurance, measures were taken and more are planned, with the objective of reducing the number of motor insurance claims. They include strict and sustained enforcement of existing road traffic legislation; Senator Henry referred to the fact that drunk driving is regarded by many young people as a social obscenity and I commend them for that.  Publicity has heightened awareness in this regard.</P>
    <P>These measures include strict and sustained enforcement of existing road traffic legislation, amendments to the road traffic acts designed to reduce the accident rate and improvements to the court system for resolution of personal injury claims.  Improvements to road traffic legislation, which will have a beneficial impact on motor insurance, include evidental <Col N="95" /> breath testing, post-accident hospital sampling of blood and urine, reduction in blood alcohol, and increase in the disqualification period for drunk driving, the closure of loopholes in the drunk driving code, impounding of uninsured vehicles and the introduction of a mandatory disqualification period for those convicted of uninsured driving.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided that the-work of the inter-ministerial group should continue, with a wider brief to include liability insurance as well as motor insurance.  Data obtained by the Department from the insurance industry shows that approximately 67 per cent of total motor insurance claims in 1991 arose from personal compensation and cost a total of £328 million.  A substantial proportion of this was borne by business. For employers and business almost all the claims, costing £172 million, would arise in respect of personal injury compensation and is carried almost totally by business.</P>
    <P>A report prepared for the insurance industry by Coopers and Lybrand, publised in February 1992, demonstrated that the cost of personal injury compensation in Ireland is significantly higher than in the UK.  Some key statistics to emerge from that report indicated that the percentage of claims with personal injury award is five times higher in Ireland than in the UK, and that personal injury claims are four times more expensive than in the UK.  This is remarkable given the similarities between the two countries.  Fewer than 5 per cent of personal injury actions proceed to a verdict in the courts.  However, the level of awards by the courts sets a bench mark for the level of settlements in all personal injury claims, including those covered by motor employers' and public liability insurance.</P>
    <P>Compensation for third party injuries may be broken down as follows: pecuniary loss, losses which are quantifiable and non-pecuniary loss.  According to data on High Court awards it is estimated that approximately 75 per cent of the compensation awarded is attributed to general <Col N="96" /> damages.  The level of general damages would need to be reduced by an average of 70 per cent to bring them in line with other EC countries and by 58 per cent to match those in the UK, according to a 1990 report by Davies Arnold Cooper.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about tackling the high cost of insurance, we must take action regarding the high level of general damages awarded in personal injury actions.  Some people may not share the view that awards are excessive and may resist attempts to cap or limit such awards because it could lead to a legal or constitutional challenge.  Nevertheless, in the absence of persuasive arguments why the value placed on factors such as pain and suffering, loss of amenities of life and loss of expectation of life should be of a substantially and consequently higher order in this country than in any other EC state, it may be concluded that the values placed on such factors are too generous.</P>
    <P>The Government is concerned about the effects the high cost of motor and liability insurance is having on the community and is attempting to remedy the situation.  Consultation has taken place between the Department and interested groups.  If persuasive action does not work, more punitive action will be required.</P>
    <P>In terms of reducing the cost of personal injury compensation there are a number of options which could be considered. These include eliminating compensation for general damages for all injuries, the introduction of limits which would be lower than the present awards for the various categories of injuries and limiting general damages to cases where the injury is permanent and serious.</P>
    <P>We should not seek to reduce the level of compensation for serious injuries or introduce a system which could increase the adversarial nature of the settlement of personal injury claims and thus increase the costs associated with such settlement.  The bulk of compensation costs arise in the area of small to medium sized claims, where injuries may not be permanent and serious.  It is, therefore, <Col N="97" /> in this area of small and medium sized claims that we need to make a choice &mdash; reduce pain and suffering compensation and lower insurance costs or retain the present regime of compensation that is higher than in other EC countries and thus our current high level of insurance costs.</P>
    <P>One way we could reduce personal injury compensation costs and thus insurance would be to implement the option of limiting compensation pain and suffering to cases where the injury is permanent and serious.  This option might also reduce the level of costs, especially legal costs, associated with the settlement of a number of personal injury claims. This course of action would not preclude those injured in accidents on the roads or at work from recouping economic loss or expense sustained through the negligence of others.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for this discussion which affords me an opportunity to share my views on this matter.  This issue will require the support of all sides if the necessary radical decisions are to be pursued. In the interests of a unified approach from legislators and bearing in mind that appropriate initiatives are being considered, I ask Members to support the proposed counter-motion.  I was in this House last year for a motion tabled by Fine Gael Members and we had a sustained and insightful debate on this issue.  The past 12 months have not been wasted because there is now a greater awareness of this problem.  At last there is a determination to deal with this controversial issue.</P>
    <P>We are aware from television and radio debates that there are vested interests involved in this issue.  These groups have had a lucrative outflow from the figures mentioned.  I foresee turbulent times ahead in dealing with this issue.  I know from experience that vested interest groups can become vociferous when they see a disturbance in what has been a lucrative area.  This motion, tabled by the Independent Senators, is of importance given the increased awareness of this issue.</P>
    <Col N="98" />
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important motion and I was impressed by the manner in which is was dealt with by Senator Quinn and Senator Henry.  It is an issue that will have repercussions.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to groups in society with vested interests who may have other viewpoints.  I do not know exactly to whom or what she is referring but I presume there are various people who have legitimate views on this which may be contrary to the views of others.  I am a solicitor and see this issue at first hand.  I believe the views I offer are fair and reasonable and I hope the Minister will pay attention to them.  It is important that we examine this matter carefully. The Minister's speech was thoughtful and careful, but I disagree with some of the points she made.  Nevertheless, this is an argument that we should examine.</P>
      <P>Insurance companies in Ireland are experts in public relations and are one of the most effective lobbies in the country. The people in this industry have enormous power and influence.  Their power extends to the granting of insurance cover to individuals and companies or the refusal to grant such cover.  These are very important powers.  We have seen the way insurance companies can charge different premiums, they can vary between £200 and £800 to £1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manner in which premiums are assessed should be examined very carefully. The premiums being charged by insurance companies at present are excessive and these companies cite the level of awards granted by courts to justify such excessive premiums.  The insurance companies stated in the past that juries were making excessive awards.  A highly sophisticated campaign developed to abolish juries.  The carrot used by the insurance companies at that time was that the cost of premiums would be reduced by between 50 and 70 per cent.  Juries were composed of ordinary citizens who went to the Four Courts and other courts.  They travelled in their own cars and paid insurance and were charged with the responsibility of assessing and awarding damages.  Most jurors did so under a sense of public duty.  This <Col N="99" /> responsibility was taken from them and awards are now being made by judges alone.</P>
    <P>The new approach being adopted by the insurance lobby is that courts established under our Constitution are paying excessive awards which appear to be unjustified, unreasonable and out of line with what should be paid, in other words, our judges are out of touch and are not making correct awards, they are not suitable people to be making such awards.  It is serious that such a view should be emanating from the insurance lobby and from people who may have an interest in such matters.  Discretion should be given to the judges, who preside in courts established by our Constitution.</P>
    <P>I have very serious reservations about, and am strongly opposed to, recent suggestions that we should remove cases involving personal injury and accident from our courts.  The implementation of this suggestion would mean that an innocent person who is injured as a result of the negligent action of a third party would be denied the right of access to the courts to seek to have the level of compensation to which that person is entitled assessed. This would be very wrong.  A person must be allowed access to courts and judges.</P>
    <P>In this House we must consider carefully the rights of ordinary citizens and ensure they are fairly and properly compensated for injuries suffered.  A judge listens to all the evidence, evaluates it and then decides on the level of the award to be paid to the individual who has suffered injuries.  Many people are not happy with these decisions.</P>
    <P>In order to reduce the cost of insurance premiums it is now proposed to penalise the victim.  The injured party is the person who will be affected by these proposed changes if the insurance lobby gets its way.  Surely the victim should not be further penalised?  Senator Quinn referred to injuries such as whiplash.  I had experience of a back injury but I did not claim against anybody, I think I sustained the injury when playing golf.  I experienced extreme pain and suffering at the time but luckily I recovered.  Many <Col N="100" /> people who make justifiable claims are frequently regarded in a poor light.  They suffer odium when bringing claims and it is often assumed that they are feigning injuries but in most cases they are not.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a number of suggestions. The insurance industry should not seek to penalise the easiest target, which is the injured party.  Many people are feigning injuries and insurance companies are hiring private investigators to follow them.  Statistical information is now available on computers which make it possible to trace individuals who have had a number of accidents and are bringing claims.  Also, if a person has had an injury some years earlier, information on this injury is on file for the insurance company.  If it is not available, it can be obtained by a motion of discovery.  This would be a step in the right direction for the insurance companies to take.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a few suggestions.  A number of issues need to be examined. Our roads are the cause of many accidents. We need improvements in our roads, driving standards, the repair and maintenance of vehicles and, most importantly, the efficiency of our courts.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some of the changes which have been made by the Government and in doing so I am not making political points.  The medical expenses of medical card holders and those paying PRSI who are involved in motor accidents were, until now, paid by the State. They are now paid by the insurance companies. Many changes need to be made. The Minister compared the number of accidents in the UK to the number in this country.  A report by Coopers and Lybrand shows that while the rate of accidents per 1,000 vehicles each year is about the same in both countries, the percentage of accidents giving rise to personal injury claims is five times higher in the Republic of Ireland than in the UK. The number of fatalities is 2.5 times higher.  Thus, road accidents are more serious in Ireland although I do not know the reason.</P>
    <P>A person suffering injuries in Ireland has to pay hospital and medical expenses. In Britain to a large extent those are <Col N="101" /> met by the State.  It is difficult to make comparisons.  I would be happy at some stage in the future to discuss this matter. I represent the victim, the person unable to speak for him or herself.  That is the person we have a duty to protect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all Members of this House I welcome the initiative of Senator Quinn in bringing this motion before us. My main interest is in the high cost of public liability insurance as it affects small communities.  Last week I sat on a committee in my home town who through their own efforts had acquired a community centre at considerable cost.  They wished to pay off the substantial overdraft by organising dances and discos. Astonishingly, when they approached an insurance company for a quote for organising the dance they were given a figure of £400 for the evening.  This is an outrageous sum of money by any standards and the insurance situation is the same all over the country.</P>
      <P>The solution is unclear but the Government has a responsibility to open avenues of negotiation with the insurance industry. The main topic of the Minister's speech was motor claims and the high cost of motor insurance.  However the cost of public liability insurance has exceeded the wildest imaginings of some years ago.  Why are these costs so high in Ireland?  The Minister said a number of surveys were carried out on the available statistics on the effects of high costs.  No survey has yet been carried out to discover why our nation has become increasingly litigious in recent years.</P>
      <P>Why is there such a high proportion of motor injury claims?  I appreciate what Senator Enright said about victims.  It is always possible to generalise about people but some injuries seem to become &ldquo;flavour of the month&rdquo;.  For a long time whiplash has been popular and it is extremely difficult to prove, like back injuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also difficult to endure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting <Col N="102" /> people who pursue claims through courts do not suffer from whiplash but it seems incredible that it is so widespread.  I can speak from experience in that I was the unfortunate victim of a road accident ten years ago.  I pursued a civil claim which eventually came to court three years after the accident.  This also appears to be part of the difficulty because in assessing the loss to me that period of delay was taken into consideration.  Therefore, the figure rose each year.  Why is there no facility for civil damage claims to come before the courts more quickly?</P>
      <P>On the evening of the first day of my hearing, the gap between my legal representatives and those of the insurance company was not significant.  However the legal representatives of the insurance company insisted on going to court the following day.  The legal people did well but put an increased cost on the claim which was shamefully far in excess of the gap between the two sides.  As the Minister has correctly pointed out, the consumer is the person who loses.</P>
      <P>I suggest the insurance industry and the legal profession look at this problem. Senator Enright and Senator Gallagher are members of the legal profession but I speak as a consumer.  Lawyers and insurance companies should consider the mote in their own eyes on occasion rather than quoting statistics about our high rate of insurance claims.</P>
      <P>There may be an economic reason for the problem.  People find it increasingly difficult to make ends meet and may see a civil action as a way out of financial difficulties.  Strange ideas to solve this problem have been offered.  Some years ago there was lobbying to abolish juries. It was said all claims would be reduced and insurance premiums would decrease. All one has to do is read the Minister's speech.  The effect of the abolition of juries is outlined for all to see.  Prices rose and continue to rise.  I can appreciate the Minister's difficulty.  How can a Government legislate to place a limit on a person's misfortune?  Nonetheless the nettle must be grasped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rail against the cost of public liability insurance.  It is obscene that voluntary <Col N="103" /> organisations have to pay high and spiralling costs for public liability insurance when they attempt to enhance their communities. They are trapped at every turn by the insurance companies who I see as money eating giants with voracious and unceasing appetites.  My local committee was charged £400 last week, next month it will probably be £500.</P>
    <P>In some defence of insurance companies, one of the reasons given for the high cost of premiums was the consumption of alcohol.  The community centre which ran various sporting and leisure activities was given a quote within the means of the committee.  It was only when an extension of the policy was sought to cover dances and discos that the insurance company gave the higher figure, citing alcohol as a contributory factor.  Why is this so important?  Is it because people who become inebriated are more likely to stumble and fall and make a litigious claim?</P>
    <P>As someone who was involved in the hotel industry, I support Senator Enright's point about vexatious litigants. People may not deliberately go out to find cause for a claim but may at some stage see an opportunity to make a claim. A pool of water or of spilt beer may cause a slip and a serious accident may be caused.  By the time the case comes to court people may have limps.</P>
    <P>A media report some months ago stated that a number of agencies in Dublin including Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Bord Gáis Éireann decided to pool their information about vexatious litigants.  This seems to have had some effect if one is to believe subsequent reports of legal cases that have been dismissed because this information was made available.  A month ago one case involved a gang apparently arranging for people to fall at a Dublin Corporation street repair site. The individual charged had been witnessed asking people to walk up and down to make sure they fell in the right places.  That case was thrown out of court.  Perhaps the Minister has evidence of the wider implication of that act.  Is <Col N="104" /> there a gang or an organised crime syndicate operating in this country who see litigation as a means of financing their activities?  If there is, I suggest that the agencies under the Minister's control, the local authorities and semi-State agencies, pool their resources in order to identify individuals who have been seen to pursue claims on a regular basis through the courts.  I understand this is happening to some degree in Dublin and the Minister might pursue that line of inquiry as another way of helping to reduce in some small way the high cost of insurance.</P>
    <P>I am delighted this motion has come before the House.  I am equally pleased that the Minister is addressing it in her usual efficient fashion and I look forward to seeing a reduction in insurance premiums at some future date.</P>

      <P>My party supports the motion.  I do not see the need for an amendment and while I appreciate that Senator Quinn has no difficulty with the amendment, I do not see that there was any difficulty with the motion in the first place.</P>
      <P>There is a saying in insurance circles that the client is insured for everything except what they claim for.  There is a certain degree of truth in that.  We must strive for a balance.  We must protect people who are seriously injured through no fault of their own, whose livelihood or lives may be disrupted, and ensure that they do not suffer as a consequence of what has happened to them.  Against that we have reached the point where there are claims which are fraudulent or of questionable origin.  The difficulty which society and the Government have lies in trying to balance those needs and responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Quinn's statement that this issue has more to do with society than with government.  We could argue about the extent to which government is society, and to what extent society is government, but the Government has responsibilities in that area.  It was by fulfilling its original responsibilities as a caring Government and society that we found ourselves in some <Col N="105" /> of our present difficulties.  The Government, rightly, attempted to protect citizens when they were injured in certain circumstances.  I agree with Senator Mooney when he said we have now reached the point where voluntary organisations, trying to improve their local community and their society, are required to pay such a high level of insurance that they frequently throw in the towel.  If a field day or an outdoor event is organised for charitable purposes, the first difficulty to be dealt with is the cost of insurance.  I am a trustee of two sporting organisations and each year, I go to the annual general meeting and ask one question, and that is, whether the organisation is insured for third party liability.  In one instance I had to ask to see the policy because, in the event of a claim and if the sporting organisation does not have a policy, the trustees are liable in law.</P>
    <P>There was a famous case in Offaly several years ago, where there was an incident in a community hall and the organisation did not carry the insurance but the trustees, local business people and farmers, were held personally liable. Such a situation should not be allowed happen.  If these individuals were directors of a company they would have limited liability, but because they were trying to help the organisations in their community, they were held to be personally liable.  That needs to be looked at.  While I take the point that there is a need to improve the way society looks at making claims, I also believe that Governments have a responsibility to ensure that the playing field is a level one.  I hope we do not have an amnesty on claims as well as an amnesty on foreign money.</P>
    <P>We have also reached the point where certain members of the legal profession have gained a reputation, whether warranted or unwarranted, for being very conscious of claims.  I can cite personal experience in this regard.  I was involved in a car accident, through no fault of my <Col N="106" /> own.  I telephoned a solicitor who asked me whether I was all right.  I said I was. He asked again whether I was all right, and again I told him I was.  He asked me a third time and I assured him that I had not been injured.  Several months later I met a colleague of his in practice in the South.  This legal practitioner had heard I had been in an accident and asked me whether I had been injured.  I told him that I had not, and we went through the same story again.  I pointed out to him that I had had a bad neck since I fell out of the apple tree as a child, and he said that made it a case of aggravated injury, for which a claimant could claim a higher level of damages.</P>
    <P>In my local town there is a publican who runs a good business, and runs it well.  Somebody coming from the upstairs lounge fell down the stairs and claimed damages.  Fortunately for the other businesses in the town, my publican friend put a detective on the case for a fortnight, and at the end of that time the person who could not walk the day after the accident was playing football.  This shows that a certain number of claims are fraudulent.  We must be vigilant and the Government must ensure that measures are taken to stop this practice.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of mandatory disqualification of people who drive uninsured cars, and this should be done, but there are many people disqualified for driving who are still driving.  It is necessary to do more than introduce a law to disqualify people.  It is necessary to be vigilant, to ensure that, once disqualified, these people do not drive again.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's views that uninsured vehicles should be impounded or seized.  As to whether these claims should be heard by judges alone or by juries, my view is that there should be a tribunal.  I use the word with a certain degree of reluctance.  There should be a non-judicial way of dealing with these cases.  New Zealand uses tribunals for these claims, and I know the system works extremely well, that it disposes of <Col N="107" /> cases quickly and there is always recourse to the courts, if people wish, as an appeal system.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this system in Ireland would release the courts from much of their present work and would also mean that insurance companies would not be so eager to settle immediately. The level at which a claim is pitched has been brought to a fine art.  If it is pitched at a certain level, the insurance company knows that to go to court will cost them more, whether they win or lose, so the case is settled out of court. This aspect of insurance claims also needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>Several references have been made to the fact that by international standards our claims are very high.  I wonder how awards can be so high if our incomes are relatively low and our hospital charges are not high by English and American standards?  As Senator Mooney said, insurance companies do not make mistakes; they work on an actuarial basis and meet their costs and make profits from the charges they impose on their clients.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the board of management of a school &mdash; Senator O'Toole may wish to return to this matter &mdash; and we cannot have activities outside of school hours or make the school available to the local community.  Children in the national school want to learn the violin after school hours and the board has a serious difficulty about insurance.  We have the choice of going to our broker and inquiring about taking out an additional policy.  School premises, however, should be of use to the community.</P>
    <P>Circumstances should be defined in which people accept their own liability for entering land, public buildings or, for example, a field day run by a local community.  If someone at a funfair is hit by a dodgem they may have a claim, but if they fall over themselves going in they should not.  We must in some way be <Col N="108" /> responsible for the actions we take.</P>
    <P>I could speak at length about how the prospect of litigation affects farmers, although, it has been dealt with in other debates.  The people who come to fish in the Liffey around my farm are fully covered by both my personal liability insurance and more importantly by the angling club's insurance if they are members.  If I had no personal liability insurance I would be liable if a poacher met with an accident.  The angling club of which responsible anglers are members, is forced to take out insurance while a poacher could sue me as the landowner. That makes no sense at all.</P>
    <P>If people cross farmland to visit State monuments or to fish in rivers they should accept a certain degree of liability.  If my tractor is parked by the side of the river and an angler falls over the plough they may be justified in suing, but if they fall into the river in the absence of any tractor it should be their own responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this belated opportunity to contribute to this debate on the related issues of civil litigation and insurance.  I should also remind Senator Mooney that I, too, represent the Government.  Perhaps, he was keeping the best wine for the last in the order of speakers for this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that this debate has been beneficial to all concerned and that we all appear to agree on the matter.  I face the problem of insurance from both sides of the coin &mdash; as a solicitor acting for the claimant in one case and for the defendant in the next.  I also face the problem personally, albeit in a mundane way, in trying to get motor insurance.  I thought when one reached the golden age of 25 one was supposed to get cheaper insurance.  Last year I reached that age and was told the age for cheaper insurance is now 27 years.  I am beginning to think I will never get cheap insurance and I have real difficulty in getting cover. I was refused by several insurance companies yesterday and I now feel like a <Col N="109" /> criminal.  Any insurance companies listening might give me a call tomorrow to console me.</P>
    <P>However, insurance cover is a serious matter which affects many people at different levels.  Insurance is an essential commodity and, therefore, has to be addressed properly.  I am told there are a number of reasons for the high cost of motor insurance.  The 1992 Coopers and Lybrand report, referred to earlier, on the costs and cover of private motor insurance in the Republic and in the UK identified three areas of difficulty.  We have a higher accident rate, we have a greater preponderance of personal injuries claims and the Irish courts make higher awards.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that if we are serious about bringing our insurance costs into line with the rest of Europe we have to look at the level of awards granted in personal injuries cases.  I understand the average awards in Ireland are almost 50 per cent higher than in the UK and over 70 per cent higher than the EC average &mdash; and I am sure the Minister of State's department is well aware of that.  It was mentioned in a different context that the report also found that the average claim cost for personal injury was almost four times greater in Ireland than in the UK.</P>
    <P>A few years ago I used to laugh at people in the United States for being so claims conscious.  Irish people are now the highest claimants in Europe.  It is time we looked at our system and dealt with the reasons for this in a fair way to all concerned.</P>
    <P>Several references have been made to the legal profession.  Obviously, solicitors are not advertising to take personal injury claims predominantly.  In my experience, the average citizen is well aware of his or her rights and has already estimated the cost of a claim when they come into my office.  Solicitors are obliged to accept their instructions in that regard.</P>
    <P>People who have suffered injuries must be fully and properly compensated.  They <Col N="110" /> incur medical costs, hospitalisation costs, loss of earnings and will incur other future costs.  However, compensation for pain and suffering awards vary extensively and I often question their fairness. Often, people with genuine claims who have suffered greatly do not appear to be adequately compensated and continue to suffer pain through no fault of their own. On the other hand one often sees awards made which, at least on the face of it, appear grossly excessive.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Brennan, recently announced his intention to review the present court awards system and that is welcome.  It is suggested that insurance premiums will not be reduced until awards are capped for pain and suffering in such cases.  The matter is wider than that, however, and I urge the Minister of State to review the way in which insurance companies themselves operate.  Insurance is a necessity for many people, yet, there is no legal obligation on insurance companies to give quotations to individuals of organisations &mdash; something must be done about this.  Even in difficult times financially the insurance companies appear to make a profit and that is because we, the insured, are paying for it.</P>
    <P>I also have a personal complaint &mdash; and I ask the Minister of State to address it in regard to the way insurance companies complicate matters.  The small print means that people cannot find out what they are, or are not, covered for and in most cases it is too late when they do find out.</P>

      <P>It would be a great help.  The Spring Show in the RDS suffered the brunt of the cost of insurance but it has had a domino effect in rural communities.  I have received representation on many occasions and in <Col N="111" /> particular this year from voluntary groups and organisations who run agricultural shows each year in small towns throughout the country.  They are facing enormous problems this year regarding insurance and it was highlighted in the farming supplement to the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 1 June 1993.  It said that last year's total premium, all paid through the Irish Shows Association, is understood to have been around £42,000 but this year it is £94,000 and that many show committees are aggrieved that their premiums have been increased by as much as 400 per cent.  These are voluntary committees who are trying to provide a service to a rural community which is more than appreciated by the local people but it is impossible for these committees to raise the finance to cover current insurance premiums.  They have been refused by all the insurance companies in Ireland and I understand are now being insured by a Dutch company.  That is a disgrace and it must be examined.  The people involved in Castleblaney and Virginia in County Cavan and Tydavnet in County Monaghan face enormous problems in their effort to run the shows this year.  This is a direct result of the problem of insurance.</P>
      <P>It is not just major industrial businesses that are affected by insurance costs; it impinges also on voluntary groups and groups organised for the benefit of the community.  These groups are run by hard-working and dedicated individuals and it is a disgrace they are asked to find so much money to cover the cost of insurance.  It is deterring many people from doing constructive work in small communities.  I wholeheartedly agree with what Senator Dardis said with regard to schools.  It is a practical problem and one faced by everybody throughout the country and it is time we dealt with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems faced by local authorities regarding public liability claims were referred to earlier.  A person has to <Col N="112" /> be very careful when travelling in County Cavan and County Monaghan as the roads are in such an appalling state.  We should deal with the root cause of the problems and deal with the insurance afterwards.  It is sad that the high level of premiums are impeding many worthwhile activities in Ireland and making them impossible in many cases.  The fear of huge claims is a real one.  We all suffer as a result of it, either directly in paying insurance or indirectly because our local authorities, which we must fund, have to find the cost of covering the large number of claims for accidents that seem to occur all too frequently in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We also need to introduce legislation to deal with the way insurance companies operate and the way they seem to take a high-handed approach.  As was mentioned earlier, there seems to be no agreement as to what they can and cannot do.  One can contact one company and be refused out of hand and another company seems to think that one's circumstances are quite reasonable.  There is no rhyme or reason to the way in which they deal with people who are genuinely seeking cover.  I hope the Minister will address the problem faced by individuals involved in agricultural shows and in other voluntary activities as soon as possible because it demands attention.  I trust the Minister will grasp the nettle, as she said earlier, and make this a matter of priority not only for investigation but also for legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my privilege to support the motion put forward in the names of Senators Quinn and Henry. There appears to be unanimity in the House on the problems Irish people face getting insurance today.  There are four reasons I believe that insurance here is far higher than in most other European countries.  Senator Gallager referred to the condition of our roads which is a major contributing factor to accidents. The cost of repairs and of parts is also a factor and, as we all know, unfortunately <Col N="113" /> once it is known that an insurance claim is involved the cost immediately goes up by 100 per cent.  Of course new parts are supposed to be used, whether they are or not, and that is how the cost of the job is calculated.  Thirdly, there are large medical expenses and, as with the car repairs, if one is unfortunate enough to go into hospital knowing that it is an insurance case and that there is going to be compensation one's bill is loaded accordingly by the public hospitals.  That is a matter of public record.  Finally, another major cost is the legal fees, with all the problems outlined by Senator Mooney earlier.</P>
      <P>We, as a people, and the Government will have to challenge the insurance companies because the cost of insurance is prohibitive for many small industries, particularly those involved in heavy engineering.  Public liability insurance and insurance for employees places a large financial burden on that type of industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area of car insurance should also be examined.  As Senator Gallagher rightly pointed out, we were all led to believe that once one was over 25, there would be a reduction in insurance but, from dealing with clients for whom I am trying to organise insurance, I know this is not the situation.  There are many other difficulties when one tries to get insurance.  One company will quote at a loaded rate while another company will not even consider offering insurance, It is a Catch-22 situation.  I share fully the view expressed by Senator Enright earlier, and I think every Member who contributed to the debate has said very much the same thing, that where there are genuine injuries nobody is questioning the right of a person to be compensated for loss of earnings, pain and injury and perhaps permanent damage for the rest of their lives.  However, I think, many insurance companies are opting out. Senator Dardis rightly pointed out the case where a detective was employed to check to see if a worker was injured and he was found to be playing football. <Col N="114" /> There are many cases that are settled out of court for fairly sizeable sums.  I was in that situation myself where my own insurance company settled a case, which I was stunned to discover they had settled. I was also stunned to find out they had paid £15,500 to somebody who had no injuries at all.  I would have gone to any court in Ireland to defend the case and I told the insurance company that, but instead they had the nerve to pay out over £15,000 to a person who was not injured in any way, good, bad or indifferent. My insurance doubled as a result; in fact, I eventually ended up paying for it.  When I questioned them they said it was the cheapest way out.</P>
    <P>Voluntary bodies who are doing excellent work throughout rural communities are at a major disadvantage; if they want to run a fund-raising function or other activities they face enormous problems because of public liability.  If I pay into a function and I am injured inside, having gone in of my own free will, I fail to understand how I could be in a position to sue that committee.  A person can claim compensation just because they walk into somebody's property and slip, perhaps in some cases it is more by design than accident.  The law is crazy and it should certainly be examined.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis mentioned trespass on land.  If a member of a gun club or an angling club comes on to my land &mdash; I have lands adjacent to the Shannon &mdash; as long as they are a member of a club, there is no difficulty as they are covered by insurance, whether it is the gun club, the angling club or any other body but if they are trespassing I could be held liable.  I think it is crazy that if somebody enters my land without my invitation and slips climbing over a wall, I could be found liable.  It is another area which should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>We pay lip service to the development of our tourist industry, but development, earning potential and so on, have been hindered by our liability laws.  The Cathaoirleach and the Minister of State <Col N="115" /> will be aware of the magnificent ancient site at Rathcroghan where development is held up at present.  It dates back to the days of Queen Maeve, and there is nothing similar in the rest of Europe. However, it cannot be developed because farmers are afraid to allow people to travel from one mound to another. There is a series of mounds over a 20 mile radius.  It is one of the most historic sites in the country and it cannot be developed because people are afraid to allow people on their land.</P>
    <P>There are certain steps the Government can take in area of medical costs.  I do not see why, if somebody is hurt in an accident, the insurance company should have to pay the hospital charges.  Those people are paying PRSI and taxes to provide a medical service and I do not see why they cannot avail of it.</P>
    <P>I believe there is another area where the insurance companies are not facing up to their responsibilities, and that is the settlement of claims.  There is no question that they take the soft option and the client must pay.  I do not see why my insurance company should be allowed to pay out money in my name without consulting me and that is happening daily. They go for the soft option because they reckon it is cheaper than having to fight the case in court.</P>
    <P>I support the motion which I think is timely.  I hope the Minister of State and the Government take steps to reduce the high costs of insurance for car owners, particularly young people trying to get insurance.  As the Minister said, sometimes the cost of insurance is prohibitive; it exceeds the cost of the car.  I have two teenagers named on my car insurance and it is a huge additional cost.</P>
    <P>I welcome the motion.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware of the problems with all types of insurance. There can be difficulties where a father has his family named on his car insurance policy.  I know of one such case where the insurance policy cost £750.  When the father died, one of his children was quoted £1,800 car insurance.  I think that is crazy.  Insurance costs have escalated and people have gone insurance mad.</P>
      <P>For a long time I have been interested in shooting and fishing and I have had to enter people's lands.  I want to thank them for allowing this.  If something happens to me on somebody's land, I cannot see why the landowner should be liable. Something will have to be done about that.</P>
      <P>As an experienced businessman, I know that most business people cannot afford public liability insurance for their premises.  The quotations range between £25,000 and £40,000, which may be ten or 15 times more than the rates they are paying, and they complain about paying water charges.  These people are now operating out of uninsured premises and are taking the chance that nothing will happen to people who frequent their premises.  If somebody breaks a leg on their premises and sues them, they could lose their business because they could not afford the insurance premium.</P>
      <P>For the last 25 or 30 years I have worked on, and chaired, many festivals. I was the founder of the Ballybunion Bachelor Festival and many other festivals in Kerry.  Many important people came to them.  I was the director of that festival for seven years and every year I made money to build swings, chutes, roundabouts and so on in a local park, which is now closed.  I spent many years organising that for the families who came to Ballybunion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  The park is closed because the local authority could not afford the insurance.  This is where <Col N="117" /> things have gone wrong and something must be done about it.  If a person commits a crime in somebody's home or backyard, or falls through a window and gets hurt in an attempt to break into somebody's home, he can sue the home owner and their insurance company has to pay. That is wrong and something will have to be done about it.</P>
      <P>I am quite critical of lawyers who look for any excuse to take a case.  If a person has no money, these lawyers say they will fight the case on a no foal, no fee basis. Such people must be questioned.  In my county legal people are taking on cases against the local authority.  Last year Kerry County Council, paid in the region of £300,000 in cases where people tripped over their shoe laces or fell into potholes that were not there.  The local authority is responsible for the first £5,000; this is wrong.  In Kerry County Council we are fighting these people and winning.  I know a case where a woman was injured outside a premises.  She then went into the chip shop and alleged she had been injured inside the shop.  The owners, who have worked hard to make a living, were then faced with a claim which the insurance company settled.</P>
      <P>This kind of activity must be stopped. While I will support any person who suffers a genuine injury which impedes their life, I condemn those who allege injuries that are fraudulent, for example the individual who throws out a fishing line and then claims whiplash.</P>
      <P>It is now impossible to organise rural events such as regattas and sports days. As a promoter of such events for 25 to 30 years, I can confirm that the fear of litigation is preventing the running of these events.  For example, in a case in which I was involved in Listowel 15 years age, a youngster picked up a flare a week after the festival and burned his finger. The festival committee was sued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A consequence of this situation is that festivals will take place elsewhere, for example in Munich, but not in this country as the local communities will be <Col N="118" /> unable to organise them.  This cannot be allowed to continue and I appeal to the Minister to give serious consideration to the situation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the cost of motor insurance, young people are heavily penalised as a Senator pointed out earlier in the House. The threshold age for cheaper premiums is steadily increasing from 25 years to over 30 years.  At the other end of the scale people over 65 years of age are penalised.  It is getting to the stage where reasonable insurance will be available between the ages of 40 and 50 years only.</P>
    <P>A scale of awards depending on the type and severity of injury should be established and steps taken to ensure that abuse of the system is not allowed to continue.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the motion before the House today is an agreed motion and that the amendment by the Government has been accepted by the proposers of the motion from the Opposition.</P>
      <P>Insurance is an actuarial calculation of a financial risk.  Insurance companies want to protect themselves and make a profit and this must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Problems arise in motor insurance, particularly with uninsured drivers. Uninsured driving is appallingly irresponsible and should be severely penalised as there is always the risk that a driver will cause serious and possibly fatal damage to others.  Drivers who are not insured are abrogating their responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a problem with young drivers who are heavily penalised when they seek insurance.  During the last year there was a large protest by motor cyclists, not all of them young, against the additional <Col N="119" /> loadings placed on them.  These problems should be examined in the context of actuarial risk to ascertain if companies are exploiting a perceived risk which may not reflect economic realities.  If the risk exists in actuarial terms then it has to be accepted that insurance companies must survive and make profit.</P>
    <P>Rates of insurance are abnormally high in this country.  The Minister has confirmed that rates are over 2.2 times higher here than in the UK and Europe. Members have spoken about the difficulties this causes for organisers of local events and so on.  However, if the loss statistics are correct what alternative is available to insurers?  One option is to close amenities and regretfully, amenities such as swimming pools and community halls are closed to the public because of the enormous cost of insurance premiums.</P>
    <P>Regarding the settlement of personal injuries, I slipped recently on exiting a shop on a wet day.  The floor was tiled with a mat resting on top but the mat slipped from under me and I fell. Undoubtedly I could have sustained a claim in court.  I did not consider this to be an honourable course of action as I was not seriously injured.  However, I did advise the shop to rectify the situation as an older person could fall with more serious consequences.</P>
    <P>If premises like the shop in the above example have insurance, and not all of them do, it usually means that premiums increase dramatically subsequent to a claim.  Perhaps the Minister should consider this and undertake a study on the impact on premiums of making a claim. I believe it to be unfair that payments may be made for up to 30 years to an insurance company and that as soon as a claim is made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

These were on the <Col N="120" /> point of being cancelled a week before commencement date due to insurance difficulties but fortunately with the help of the GAA the problem was resolved. However, I fully sympathise with the points made by Senators who have been involved in festivals and various sporting events throughout the country.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, between one third and one half of the total capitation grant to primary schools is expended on insurance for schools.  This illustrates the way in which facilities to pupils are being eroded.  Not a week goes by without my receiving some claim for negligence against a school, its board of management, teachers and so on.</P>
      <P>It appears to be a national pastime to bring professional people to court.  It is now time to convince people that accidents arise.  Time and again parents are misled by unscrupulous professional people, a tiny minority of solicitors, who are prepared to take cases on the basis of no fault, no fee with the fee set at a percentage of the reward if successful.</P>
      <P>This is a disgraceful activity.  I have been in court when judges have said to solicitors that parents have the right, necessity and responsibility to take cases on behalf of children involved in an accident. However, they go on to say that solicitors should not waste the time of court on cases that are not viable.</P>
      <P>Insurers, too, often settle claims on the basis that it is easier to settle than to go to court.  I have pleaded with them on this issue and on two occasions the INTO offered to pay the total costs to be allowed to fight a case which the organisation believes would have given a headline for other similar cases.  It is a problem time and again where the insurance assessors say a case can be settled for £10,000 although it would take £20,000 to win it in court, but it gives a headline to everybody else.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her response as well as all the Senators who participated in this debate. <Col N="121" /> Listening to everyone I can see what passion this issue arouses and I am glad Senator Quinn and I moved the motion. The situation is obviously serious since it involves so many areas.  Senator Quinn raised this matter with me first because of problems he saw with increased insurance costs for business.  I raised the matter because of the increased claims I saw, the serious lack of care and the number of accidents that occur.  Senators from both sides have approached the debate from different angles.  The most important thing to stress is that no one is trying to deprive a genuine victim of his rights.  A large award of over £2 million was granted in the courts recently to a young man who is now 24 years of age but was brain damaged as a child.  No money will ever compensate that person's mother for the last 24 years or help her son.  In really serious cases money does not compensate at all.  It is quite plain that no one is trying do deprive a genuine victim of his rights.</P>
      <P>There is a fair number of vexatious and fraudlent claims coming before the courts, and that is a problem.  One does not have do very much research in this area because such cases appear regularly in the newspapers.  I spoke earlier of the solicitor who was advised of a third bogus case he had brought before the court and he feared being reported to the Incorporated Law Society.  The judge said that the man who brought the claim had been involved in bringing eight claims for accidents since 1987 and had settled for a total of £12,000.  This person is either very unfortunate or not very careful.  Several Senators suggested that as we are now in the computer age we would need to have a spy in the sky watching for people who were making multi-claims because it is these situations that cause many problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various public bodies, like the corporations and CIE, reckon that between one-quarter and one-half of the claims against them are vexatious or fraudulent. It is not just the fact that these people <Col N="122" /> do not get money eventually &mdash; they do because often these cases are settled just to get rid of the problem &mdash; but there are incredible legal costs and a great deal of time is spent on such cases.  One man told me that instead of managing a corporation he felt he was spending 70 per cent of his time acting as a solicitor's clerk trying to deal with claims.</P>
    <P>Cases which could be defended are often settled to avoid high legal costs, and our legal costs are very high.  Very little effort is made by the legal profession to get people to settle.  In England, getting medical cases involving personal injury settled out of court &mdash; and not on the steps of the court which, as one Senator pointed out, is another day's legal costs &mdash; is greatly helped by the fact that there is mutual disclosure of expert witnesses' reports.  This means that instead of playing what is called here, blind man's bluff, you have to disclose your expert witnesses' reports to the other side.  This means each side can, if the case is likely to be decided in their favour, decide whether to continue with the action or settle for whatever is being offered.</P>
    <P>The situation regarding public liability is an appalling problem.  An enormous number of events will not be held because of the cost of insurance.  It is important to remember that insurance companies do not mind if you do not insure with them.  It is not worth their while to take on this insurance because the claims against them are so high.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister of State said she was going to provide more money and scope for the National Safety Authority because the prevention of accidents is very important.  Very little training, if any, is provided in this country although a large number of accidents occur within the first few weeks of a person being in the job.  No consideration is given to teaching people about the dangers in certain jobs.  I hope this provision is enforced soon and that we will <Col N="123" /> see from company reports that the finance provided for training and safety measures was money well spent.  We need safety representatives elected in factories and other workplaces.</P>
    <P>A ministerial group is currently looking into the cost of motor insurance.  Our roads are the cause of serious accidents. I am sorry we have sought derogation from vehicle testing for so long because there are too many cars on the roads that are not roadworthy.  One often finds that when victims with serious injuries come into hospital they have been travelling in defective cars.  People involved in accidents in well maintained cars are often not so badly injured.  It is important that we look again at the possibility of introducing vehicle testing.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is right about impounding uninsured cars, banning uninsured drivers and making sure they do not continue to drive.  I fine it extraordinary that a car owner is liable for injuries caused to people even if their car has been stolen.  It seems incredible that if your car is stolen you can still be found liable for a traffic accident.  Insurance companies should be questioned about that, because I cannot see the sense in it.</P>
    <P>Many public bodies &mdash; such as CIE and Dublin Corporation &mdash; are not carrying public liability insurance.  They are paying the claims against them, and that concerns all of us.  In 1989 Dublin Corporation paid out £2 million in claims and in 1992 it paid out £6 million.  I acknowledge that the corporation should not leave barrels on the road but the condition of the footpaths and roads in Dublin did not deteriorate between 1989 and 1992 to the extent that the cost of claims could increase so much.  At present Dublin Corporation has on its books 2,000 outstanding claims totalling £27 million.  What could we do with that £27 million if we had it?  What could we do with the £14 million from the health service, if we had it?  A most aggressive attitude has to be taken towards the prevention <Col N="124" /> of accidents, reducing claims and their cost on this society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Aylward, for taking this matter. I am sure the fact that the Minister of Education is not here is not an indication that she does not take this matter seriously.</P>
      <P>The situation is the greater Blanchardstown area, and particularly Castleknock, is that the electorate felt so irate about the lack of a post-primary school that during the last general election they fielded not one but two candidates; they put forward one candidate in Dublin North and in Dublin West because that constituency is divided.  This was to highlight the fact that they wanted the post-primary school which they had been promised 20 years previously and which has never been built.</P>
      <P>This matter has a long history.  A decision was made that a site and a certain type of post-primary school was not suitable.  However, a small village with a population of 1,000 has now grown to a large town with a population of approximately 60,000.  The facilities have not kept abreast of that growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="125" /> There are post-primary schools in the greater Blanchardstown area and two of the community schools have a student population of approximately 1,000.  Educationalists have recognised that it is not possible to provide the best type of educational opportunities for pupils whose numbers exceed 1,000.  A considerable number of children are commuting from outside the Blanchardstown area and they have been able to avail of places in schools in Stanhope Street, Brunswick Street, North Richmond Street and on the Navan Road.  However, this option is no longer available as the population has also grown in these areas.</P>
    <P>Each June I receive numerous telephone calls from people who have been told that there is no place for their children in school.  Fortunately, these situations are rectified by September. However, this will not continue.  Pickets will continue to be placed at the Dáil gates.  I know that every area makes their case for a post-primary school.  I am not asking the Minister to be Solomon.</P>
    <P>Prior to the general election, the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, comissioned an independent report by Professor Bannon to identify the educational requirements, particularly the post-primary requirements, for the Blanchardstown and Dunboyne areas.  As a result of that report, a post-primary school, which will cater for the needs of that areas, was sanctioned for Hartstown before the temporary structure was in place.  There is now a prefabricated building on the site.  However, by the time that school is built there will be insufficient places to cater for the needs of the greater Blanchardstown and Castleknock areas.</P>
    <P>There are two private schools in the area, St. Joseph's Convent, Mount Sackville and St. Vincent's, Castleknock. Each time the argument is raised about the provision of a second level school in Castleknock, both of these institutions state that they will provide for the urgent need which exists.  However, this has not <Col N="126" /> happened and the people in Castleknock who need post-primary places for their children are unable to afford private education. I am not asking the Minister for Education to be Solomon and decide that Castleknock should have a school and Dunboyne should not, or <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>When the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, appointed the Bannon Commission and prior to the last general election, candidates from every party, particularly from the Labour Party demanded that the results of that report be made public.  The Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, has not acceded to the request by the local community to make that report public.  If this report substantiates the call by the local people for a post-primary school in Castleknock, then the Minister must respond.  If it does not, then we can tell the people that the independent report which was commissioned does not state there is a need.  The representations I have received indicate there is a need for this school.</P>
    <P>Today in the Dublin County Council offices an action plan was presented for the extended area of Castleknock, in Porterstown and Diswellstown, where 2,900 houses will be built.  A site is being reserved there by Dublin County Council for a post-primary school.  Permission has also been given for a further 1,000 houses in Clonsilla.  There is no post-primary school there to cater for the needs of that area.  This is probably the fastest growing area in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am not asking the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Aylward, to give a commitment on this matter this evening.  The people of the area have their own statistics to show there is a need for this school.  I want the Minister to publish the Bannon report.  It will prove there is a need for a post-primary school in the greater Blanchardstown and Castleknock areas.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator McGennis for raising this matter. It gives me an opportunity to clarify the position on behalf of the Minister.</P>
      <P>There are two post-primary schools in Castleknock at present, Castleknock College and St. Joseph's Convent, Mount Sackville.  Both are fee-paying schools and cater for day and boarding pupils. There has been increasing demand in recent years from local pressure groups for the provision of a non-fee paying school in Castleknock.</P>
      <P>Over 90 per cent of pubils from the Castleknock primary schools receive their post-primary education in either St. Dominic's secondary school, Navan Road, St. Declan's CBS, Navan Road, Coolmine Community School, St. Joseph's secondary school, Mount Sackville or St. Vincent's College, Castleknock. Other post-primary schools which are attended by Castleknock pupils in significant numbers are O'Connell's CBS, North Richmond Street, for boys, and Loreto secondary school, Stephen Green and St. Joseph's secondary school, Stanhope Street, for girls.</P>
      <P>The Department owns a site in Castleknock on which it was originally intended to build a post-primary school. The question of adequate post-primary accommodation in Castleknock is closely linked to the provision in Hartstown and Dunboyne.  In August 1991, following meetings with parental representatives, the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, commissioned consultants to assist the Department in a study to determine the need and provision for post-primary school places in the Castleknock, Hartstown, Huntstown and Dunboyne areas.  During the course of the study, the local interest groups were afforded the opportunity to meet the consultants and their views were taken into account in the preparation of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The findings of the study indicated that there was an immediate need for a new post-primary school in Hartstown to be <Col N="128" /> followed by a new school in Dunboyne. The findings also indicated that the needs of the Castleknock pupils could continue to be met by the post-primary schools that currently cater for the majority of them.  Arrangements have been made on this basis, starting with the provision of a first block of semi-permanent accommodation, to cater for 100 to 150 pupils on the site already acquired for a new second level school in Hartstown in September 1992.  A further block of permanent accommodation for 850 pupils is being provided for September 1993.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that the data relating to housing and population trends in the Castleknock area, and the capacity of neighbouring schools on which the consultants report, that is the Bannon report, was based now needs to be updated. Accordingly, a further report is being commissioned which will take account of the more recent developments in the area.  In the light of the findings of this report and on the basis of the information already available, the second level needs of the Castleknock area will be further considered by my Department.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the concern expressed by Senator McGennis in this case and we will communicate with her as soon as the Department has an opportunity to consider the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">

The Minister's reluctance to release the Bannon report speaks volumes.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Aylward, to the House and I welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue.  However, I am disappointed that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, is not present because this matter is creating conflict in north, west and south Cork.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry has been briefed on this issue but due to another engagement cannot be here to speak on it but she wishes to record her support for the case. The case is to ask the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to give further consideration to the application by South Coast Community Television Group for a licence to operate a service side by side with Cork Multi-channel so as to provide a legal alternative system in the Cork area under the broadcasting Acts.  The only solution to the problem is to grant such a licence and I have no doubt that the community group will meet whatever terms of reference are applied to the granting of the licence.</P>
      <P>Recently the local authority received a communication from the Department which stated:</P>
      <P>The basic problem with the deflector systems is that they transmit their signals in a part of the radio frequency spectrum known as the UHF broadcasting band.  The physical facts are that there just are not enough frequencies available under the agreement to enable a nationwide network of deflector type systems to be established, which could bring a range of external television services to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is happening already.  For a number of years both systems have been operating and I do not see why that should not continue.  Following recent discussions, I want to reassure the Minister that the <Col N="130" /> South Coast Community Television Group are prepared to comply with whatever regulations are laid down.  It also states in the correspondence referred to that:</P>
    <P>... unfavourable cost comparisons play a role in the controversy surrounding illegal deflector systems and in that respect like is not being compared with like.  MMDS operators are required to pay an initial licence fee of £20,000...</P>
    <P>South Coast Community Television have not been given the opportunity because they are being denied a licence.</P>
    <P>Within the last fortnight over 1,500 people attended two public meetings in Fermoy, County Cork.  A similar problem exists in west Cork.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that the basic problem with the deflector systems is that they transmit their signals in a part of the radio frequency spectrum known as the UHF band.  There has been an ongoing dispute between Cork County Council, who are the planning authority, and the MMDS operator Cork Multi-channel because Cork Multichannel refused to have an independent monitoring system.  They have now agreed to the independent monitoring of the radiation emissions from the MMDS system at Cork Airport and this is merely to comply with the condition of the planning permission that the emissions must be within the parameters of the licence granted by the Department.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in the same area of north Cork there are ten breaches of planning permission.  This is not the main point I wish to make but I want to show that there are breaches by both sides.  Ten beam benders that have been erected by Cork Multichannel require planning permission.  They did not have permission to erect them and the county council are seeking to force them now to obtain permission.</P>
    <P>My main point is that we want consideration to be given to the application <Col N="131" /> for a licence by South Coast Community Television Group.  I am told that there is nothing under the technical conditions relating to the establishment of a programme retransmission system with which they do not comply.  If a licence is granted that will be the time to monitor this compliance.  The relevant statutory instrument has also been carefully studied. I ask the Minister to consider this matter on these grounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Sherlock for sharing time with me.  I want to ask the Minister to grant a licence to Birr Multichannel TV to operate a community TV service side by side with Horizon TV Distribution so as to provide a legal alternative system in Counties Offaly and Laois and north County Tipperary under the broadcasting Acts.  Birr Multichannel was set up in 1987 to provide community television for Birr, Banagher, Clara, Ferbane, Kilcormac, Kinnitty and many other areas of Counties Laois and Offaly.  A wider area of Counties Offaly, Laois and north Tipperary can benefit from this excellent service, as far away as Clonaslee, Cadamstown and even Roscrea.</P>
      <P>This multi-national viewing is provided by means of a deflector system situated near Kinnitty.  Everyone in the area benefits from this quality service provided by Birr Multichannel TV at a reasonable, affordable price.  The present charge is £20 per year.  The Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988, makes it illegal to use the necessary apparatus to deflect signals, and it is also an offence to allow land to be used to site the apparatus. There is a fine of up to £20,000 for these offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original franchise for this area of Counties Offaly, Laois and north Tipperary was awarded to Cablelink.  They applied for planning permission for a 400 foot mast and then withdrew it some time later.  There were no further developments and the people in the area were <Col N="132" /> satisfied with the service being provided. Horizon TV has now installed an MMDS transmitter on the Radio 3 mast without planning permission as far as I am aware. I do not remember seeing a planning application.  Was the franchise for this service advertised in the national or local papers so that people could tender and the franchise be awarded after fair competition?</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to approve a licence for Birr Multichannel TV so that they can operate a legal alternative system according to the broadcasting Acts.  This is a fair request.  Birr Multichannel TV charge £20 a year as I am sure the Minister of State is aware.  Horizon TV will charge £99 to instal the service and there will also be an annual charge of £127.50, a high charge for those on low incomes. The Minister has the power in this matter and in the interests of fair play and justice I ask him to grant a licence.</P>

      <P>I wish to apologise on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, for his not being here this evening.  I am sure that the Members of this House will appreciate that he is busy at present due to the many problems faced by one of the prominent semi-State companies.  A series of meetings is taking place today and it was not possible for him to be here.</P>
      <P>I want to thank the Senators who have raised this matter.  The Minister recently dealt with the issue in some detail in the Dáil and the raising of the matter here this evening gives me an opportunity to repeat the factual position in the Seanad. Senator Enright referred to Birr and while my reply deals with Cork he will find the reply relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government policy in regard to multi-channel choice is that the licensed means of bringing such choice to the non-cabled public is through fully licensed MMDS systems.  Let me stress that there are no plans to review Government policy on <Col N="133" /> this issue.  It is not the case that viewers in Cork are denied the privilege of multi-channel viewing by our Department's refusal to grant a licence to illegal deflector operators for the transmission of such services in the area.  The simple truth of the matter is that under the Wireless Telegraphy (Television Programme Retransmission) Regulations, 1989, Cork Communications Ltd., has been granted an exclusive licence to retransmit television programme services to homes in County Cork and west Waterford.</P>
    <P>Due to the constraints of good frequency management, the licence is exclusive and was issued after an open competition for the franchise &mdash; a competition open to even the operators of the illegal deflector systems.  It is not the intention at the Department now, or at any time in the future, to license any of the so-called deflector operators in this, or indeed in any other franchise area.</P>
    <P>I am aware that private actions, and the threat of action, taken under the planning Acts and before the High Court. have resulted in the closure of a number of illegal transmitters in the Cork region in the recent past.  I am also aware from press reports of the weekend events in the Fermoy area.  The fact of the matter is that the removal of transmitting equipment from Coillte lands in Fermoy over the weekend was carried out pursuant to a High Court injunction.</P>
    <P>The Department's information is that the MMDS multichannel service is available to all those homes in the Cork region which were receiving illegal services until recently and this fact has been advertised extensively in the local press.  For instance in the Fermoy region legal multi-channel service is available in the following areas: all of Fermoy town, Ballyhooley, Ballynoe, Glanworth, Glenville, Castletownroche and Kildorrery. The contention therefore that multi-channel services are not available is far from accurate.  They are available and are being provided in an orderly and legal fashion in a part of the radio frequency <Col N="134" /> spectrum which will not prevent or hinder the development of our own national television services in the future be they RTE, Teilifís na Gaeilge and any future national television service independent of RTE services.</P>
    <P>Let me reiterate that successive Governments have examined this problem a number of times at length and have concluded, without exception, that it would neither be practical nor in the national interest to licence the illegal rebroadcasting or deflector systems such as those alluded to by the Senators.</P>
    <P>The basic problem with the deflector system is that they operate in a part of the UHF frequency band which is governed by the international treaty.  Under that treaty there are simply not enough frequencies available to Ireland to enable a nationwide network of deflector transmitters to be established and, at the same time, meet other national requirements such as RTE's frequency requirements.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that if the non-cabled public want multi-channel television &mdash; and all the evidence is that the vast majority of them do &mdash; then MMDS is the only practicable option open to us at present to provide it.  The technical and internationally binding constraints on us with regard to the use of the radio frequency spectrum &mdash; and particularly that part of it used by &ldquo;deflector&rdquo; systems &mdash; are such that we believe it is not possible to legalise them.  We simply do not have acces to sufficient frequencies, first to allow countrywide operation of community or deflector systems and, secondly, to give viewers in non-cabled areas something approaching the choice of television programmes available in cabled areas while still conserving frequency spectrum to meet foreseeable developments in Irish broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Much is often made of the supposed cost differential between services provided by the properly licensed companies, such as Cork Communications Limited&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that provided by the illegal deflector services.  Unfailingly such comparisons do not compare like with like.  The transmission facility per MMDS cell can cost up to £250,000. there will be up to 29 cells throughout the country.  Up to £200 or £300 worth of equipment has to be installed in each subscriber's premises.  Members of the House can readily appreciate that the investment required is sizeable by any standards.  The annual cost to an MMDS subscriber will approximate to the subscriber charge for the more modern cable systems installed in recent years, that is around £100 to £125 rental per annum. While the costs are dearer than deflectors, the comparisons made are invalid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The MMDS system is an 11-channel service and MMDS operators must pay licence fees, £200,000 in advance and 5 per cent of annual rental, VAT and copyright fees &mdash; obligations avoided by the deflectors because of their illegal status. Many people complain about the installation charge of around £100 to £125 for MMDS but forget that every deflector subscriber has to have a UHF aerial installed, which in many instances costs £100 or more.  In its franchise area, Cork <Col N="136" /> Communications Limited has spent in the region of £3 million on its MMDS infrastructure to date and plans to spend £12 million in total.  In addition, there is the very significant employment being generated in the region.  The number of people employed by Cork Communications Ltd. has grown from 60 to 120 with the advent of MMDS and I understand the company has plans to employ even more in the future.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I would say that the Department is not unappreciative of the fact that there has been some controversy about the introduction of MMDS.  We also sympathise with those who have become accustomed to the illegal deflector services.  Nevertheless, we counsel caution against those who pretend that there are easy solutions to this problem. MMDS provides the possibility of professional, high-quality multi-channel service on a countrywide basis, at a reasonable cost.  The service is now available in Counties Dublin, Kildare, Louth/Meath, Wexford, Cork, Kerry, Clare, Galway, Sligo, Roscommon and Offaly and I understand that there are in excess of 28,500 subscribers of which 3,500 are in the Cork region.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 24 June 1993.</P>
