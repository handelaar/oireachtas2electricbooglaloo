      <P>I have notice from Senator Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to make an early decision concerning the merits of an eastern bypass or a motorway through Killmacanogue village, County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2 and 30.  Item 2 will be taken until 6 o'clock and will continue tomorrow morning and afternoon.  I am suggesting 20 minutes per spokesperson and 15 minutes thereafter on item 2.  Item 30 will be taken between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I move that item 2<i>a</i> on the Supplementary Order Paper be taken in place of item 2 on today's order paper:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1278" /> In view of the statement by the Tánaiste of 20 July 1993 that there was certainty in regard to the figures for the EC support for the national plan and his further statement that he was 100 per cent satisfied that these figures would not unravel, Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to clarify immediately the actual level of EC support for the plan, its consequential effect on the plan as published and the implications of these discrepancies for the competence of the Ministers directly involved in conducting international negotiations on behalf of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have to ask, are we living with Alice in Wonderland?  As you may remember, a Chathaoirligh, one of the characters in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> said: &ldquo;Words mean what I say they mean.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Irish people were given a solemn commitment by the Tánaiste on 20 July that the financial underpinning for the National Development Plan was 100 per cent in place and that there would be no unravelling.  Over the last 24 hours &mdash; as this party warned would happen due to the way in which the negotiations took place &mdash; there has been clear disagreement between the Irish Government and the President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors.  It has reached the stage where Mr. Delors, perhaps carried away with Gallic excitement, has described the Irish Government as a liar, such is the gap between the figures presented by the Government to the Irish people and the figures now being discussed in Brussels. For that reason there is a sense of unreality about debating a national plan whose financial basis is now seriously in question.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste earlier today in the Dáil clearly backtracked from commitments he had given to the Irish people on a number of occasions.  In such circumstances a debate on the national plan is pointless.  We understand the importance of the national plan and we support every demand to get the greatest possible amount of money from the Community <Col N="1279" /> for the development of this country but there is no point having a sham national unity based on specious or incomplete statements given by our leaders on their return from Brussels.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a proper debate we must know beforehand if there was an agreement.  Was it a written agreement? What was in the agreement?  Who signed the agreement?  Where is the certainty that our leaders told us we could take for granted?  Until these points are answered in this and in the other House the debate as proposed today is pointless.  Our amendment gives the Government the opportunity to come clean with this House and with the Irish people on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given Senator Manning a degree of latitude for the obvious reason that he was moving amendment No. 2a.  We do not want a debate on the National Development Plan on the Order of Business.  We will have a debate on it, whether it is Item 2 or Item 2a and I appeal to Members to adhere to the spirit of the Order Paper and have our debate on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Manning's proposal.  It is not my intention to be critical of the Government on this until information is available, if it becomes available.  I second the motion because it seeks clarification.  I have no intention of referring to the plan in deference to you, a Chathaoirligh, but it would be a debate in a vacuum.  There is a great deal of uneasiness, uncertainty and confusion among many people who have put much time into this.  I presume that would apply to both sides of the House as the Members on the Government side have precisely the same need for clarification as we have.  Holding a debate without knowing where the money is coming from, the amount of money, when and how it is due to be paid is not recommended. Therefore we seek a certain level of clarity.  I withhold judgment on the rights and wrongs of the plan but there are unanswered questions and <Col N="1280" /> before we can discuss the points, issues, paragraphs and sections of the National Development Plan we must know if the bottom line is correct.</P>
      <P>There is a need to have legislation on the Order Paper as soon as possible.  I recognise and accept the fact that debating the National Development Plan is as important as any debate on legislation.  I am not being critical of the Order of Business for today and tomorrow but I am seeking an indication of the legislative programme before this House over the next number of weeks.  I ask the Leader of the House to outline this as soon as possible and also to indicate the legislation which will be initiated in this House so that Members can prepare their contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment proposed by Senator Manning.  I want to know what we are meant to debate this afternoon.  Is it this particular document? Is it the Government's intention to give back the £9 to the people who bought this plan from the Government Stationery Office?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>What exactly are we being asked to debate this afternoon?  This morning in the Dáil the Taoiseach said he did not want us to undermine Ireland's position.  I can assure those on the opposite benches that it is not the intention of anybody on this side of the House to undermine Ireland's position. Ireland's position has already been sufficiently undermined without us contributing to that process.  It is our intention to defend Ireland's position but there are serious questions which have to be asked and they need answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who lecture us on our national responsibility should not confuse our desire to fulfil our national responsibility with acquiescence to incompetence. They are not the same thing.  We do not need a lecture about our national responsibility but we need to know what we are being asked to debate this afternoon <Col N="1281" /> as it has serious consequences for the future of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the amendment to the Order of Business because taking into consideration what has happened since the plan was published and the debate that has taken place in the Lower House, at this stage it bears no relation to what will happen eventually. I put it to the Leader of the House that what we are going to debate today is not a reality.  In other words, what we will debate until 6 p.m. today and tomorrow are not the true facts of what will be the case.  Could we perhaps turn the position around; would the Minister come into the House and tell us that the plan as it was presented to Brussels is not a fact and take contributions to improve the plan we have already&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Leader of the House last week on two occasions and he failed to answer &mdash; maybe he is in a better position to answer today; is there any possibility of having a debate on agriculture? This industry is in deep trouble and the wisdom of Members of this House is needed to help the wisdom of the Minister &mdash; which has not been portrayed well recently &mdash; to protect the incomes of Irish farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I respect your request that we would not debate the national plan on the Order of Business but I must reject two allegations. First, the allegation of Senator Manning that the Tánaiste backtracked in his statement in the Dáil this morning; second, Senator Dardis's allegation that there was ineptitude.  There was a solemn agreement between the President of the Commission and the Tánaiste on 20 July&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The national plan is the national plan and it stands.  I will reserve any further statements until later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader when we will have a debate on the North of Ireland; I think it would be timely.  I noted with some wry amusement that Senator O'Kennedy seems to be out of touch with his leader when he was saying last week on the Order of Business that it was vital that we have a debate on the Opsahl report &mdash; with which I agreed; simultaneously the Taoiseach was saying it was inappropriate for the Dáil.  I was moved by the passionate demands for the debate from the Government side but it was put in an ironic perspective when I discovered that the debate collapsed through a lack of speakers on the Government side.  Many of us on this side were precluded from speaking because we had spoken before the break on the Opsahl report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to support the passionate pleas from Senator O'Kennedy and his colleagues that we have a full and proper debate now not just on the Opsahl report but on the Hume-Adams talks and the general situation in the North.  If Senators on the Government side were prepared to support this, I would be most humbly grateful, and I emphasise humble because I did detect a sense in which the Government side were indicating that I <Col N="1283" /> was rather pompous and self-promoting which, I have to say with regret, was probably true.</P>
    <P>I also support the motion in the names of Senator Manning, Senator Farrelly and Senator Howard.  I do not do this in a carping sense.  No one can take pleasure in the unravelling situation because it is disadvantageous to this country.  As Senator O'Sullivan said, there is a clear conflict of evidence.  It is most worrying that the President of the European Commission, Mr. Delors, should suggest on the radio that the Irish Government was lying.  That is strong language and this issue needs to be handled with great sensitivity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two matters for the Leader of the House.  The first relates to the Supplementary Order Paper and the motion in the names of Senator Manning, Senator Farrelly and myself.  I will respect your request, a Chathaoirligh, that the national plan should not be discussed on the Order of Business. However, it is pointless to have a debate at this stage in view of the uncertainty that has arisen.  The &ldquo;paymaster&rdquo; of the EC on radio today indicated a gap of £500 million.  That is the equivalent of many programmes already costed in the national plan.  Given that, it is unrealistic and impossible to have a reasonable and constructive debate on the subject.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with the Leader because he has been placed in this position. Common sense calls for a review of the proposal to debate this subject, particularly because of the events of recent hours.  The Leader should reconsider the Order of Business, not alone in view of the comments made here but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You have moved into the realm of the plan itself.  I would prefer that you did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude, I have made my point.  I understand the difficulty for the Leader.  I do not intend to engage in political point scoring on this <Col N="1284" /> matter because the national interest is involved.</P>
      <P>My second point concerns papers laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, specifically one on the Order Paper for 12 October, entitled European Communities (Trade in Bovine Breeding Animals, their Semen, Ova and Embryos) Regulations, 1993.  I ask the Leader of the House if he would be prepared to provide Government time to discuss the implications of these regulations.</P>
      <P>We tend to pay little attention to papers of this nature laid before the House.  This document runs to 81 pages and is a product of Brussels bureaucracy. It has dangerous implications for the principal industry in Ireland and for the standard, status and health of our livestock and pedigree animals.  It would be better for Ireland if at least part of this document were rescinded.  Could the Leader also confirm these regulations do not come into effect for 21 sitting days after 12 October?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the opportunistic approach taken by the Opposition this afternoon regarding the National Development Plan.  I consider it a cheap political ploy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator needs a halo.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that they are putting their political situation, which is in trouble already, ahead of the national interest at this stage.  Only Senator O'Toole has adopted a constructive approach in so far as he said that he is prepared to await clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  We are independent over here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not agree very often but obviously we agree on this.  As regards the Progressive Democrats, they were selling us down the road for £4.5 million on 30 June.  Their position has <Col N="1285" /> been exposed.  It appears that the Opposition is lining up with a Commissioner from across the water who is not very supportive of the Irish situation.  They are helping out his case if anything and that is not in the national interest.  It would be more appropriate in today's debate on the National Development Plan if they supported the efforts of the Government and of the Irish people to get the full return on what has already been committed.  This should have complete support from all sides of this House. I am amazed that Senator Manning and the Fine Gael Party have gone down that road.  The national interest is at stake here and they should support the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the issue raised by the Opposition Members, it shows short-sightedness on their part that they cannot appreciate the vision of the document laid before them and debate it constructively without trying to make cheap political gain out of the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Order of Business I wish to raise an issue I raised last week and several times previously.  I ask the Leader if it would be possible in the very near future to have a debate on extradition.  I have been informed by the Department of Justice that at some stage in the next session it intends to introduce a new extradition Bill with a view to reforming the extradition law as it stands.  Before that Bill is drawn up account has to be taken of the situation that pertains in Britain now, especially with the right to silence being abandoned by the British Government and the miscarriages of justice, not only the Guilford Four, the Birmingham Six and the Maguire Seven but also the recent cases of Joseph Matthews and the other gentleman whose name eludes me at this moment.  It is important that we discuss this issue before a Bill is drawn up so that the Minister may be made fully aware of the facts, how the <Col N="1286" /> Members of this House see those facts and what should be included in that Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with those who are opposed to the change in the Order in Business.  I have never heard such carping, whingeing and crying.  It epitomises a party which is in crisis, as one of its front bench members said this morning. They would like to get away from discussing their own problems and try to turn round an argument which could be building up against them in both Houses today.  They are carping, whingeing and criticising the largest amount of money ever granted.  Whether it is £8 billion, £7.5 billion or whatever&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to propose the Order of Business as it is and to forget about the whingeing from the other side.  Jealously will get them nowhere.  In the near future may we have a debate on the sentencing procedures or lack of sentencing in our courts?  There was a case in court over the past couple of days where £810,000 worth of an illegal drug was being transported through this country and the judge, in his innocence or perhaps ignorance, let the people who <Col N="1287" /> were transporting this drug out on the streets again.  There is a lot of concern regarding the amount of drugs being transported and delivered around the country.  There was evidence that those involved in this case were transporting the drug, yet they are back on the streets damaging the children of Ireland and, indeed, Europe.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Manning in relation to debate on the National Development Plan.  Regardless of what Members on the other side say, the President of the Commission, Mr. Delors, used the word &ldquo;liar&rdquo;.  Do we want to create further confusion in regard to the National Development Plan or do we want to hear the truth?  We cannot debate <Col N="1288" /> a plan when we do not know what the figures are.</P>
      <P>Is the Leader of the House prepared to allow one or two days to debate agriculture? There is a lot of confusion in this regard; it is like the National Development Plan.  One cannot get last year's grants in relation to the slaughter premium, the 21 month premium, etc.  The entire agricultural sector is bogged down in regard to these grants and other grants which have been promised between now and Christmas.  I ask that the Minister come to the House to clear up these issues for farmers and to make alternative arrangements if he is unable to pay moneys due from Europe.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Manning's call to amend the Order of Business.  We have an opportunity to clarify this matter in the House today. Decisions will be taken and figures will be finalised in Brussels tomorrow.  It is imperative to put this matter on the record of the House.  Some Senator on the Government side stated that joint representations must be made to Europe to ensure maximum funding.  The situation is indicative of an incompetent Government which is in crisis.  Members have a responsibility to act in the national interest.  I call on the Leader of the House to reconsider his position on the Order of Business and to do as Senator Manning requested by affording this House the opportunity to put its views to Europe on this matter.</P>

      <P>We have acted in a responsible manner in this matter.  We are all anxious that Ireland receive maximum funding for the National Development Plan, but we must bear in mind that these funds must be matched by semi-State bodies and the private sector.  If the Government cannot get its figure right, the private sector will lack confidence and that will seriously affect the plan.</P>

      <P>We reject the proposed amendment to the Order of Business. This morning in the Dáil the Tánaiste <Col N="1289" /> gave a clear commitment to implement fully the National Development Plan, while the Taoiseach also stated the Government's resolve to implement the National Development Plan in full.  If Members on the opposite side of the House expect me to believe a report by a Commissioner rather than the Tánaiste or the Taoiseach, I reject that.  We in this House should be seen to be absolutely in full support, united in our efforts to ensure that the agreement which was reached recently on these figures is implemented tomorrow.  For us to call off a debate on the National Plan which we have submitted only weakens our case.  I listened to Members on the far side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have spoken today and they are both on record as saying that the plan will be implemented in full.  Some Members may want to go down the road some of them travelled in the last election, when one party was suggesting £4.5 billion and another party was suggesting £6 billion.  In fairness to all concerned, the people who spoke this morning have been proved right and this House should <Col N="1290" /> be in total and utter support of their efforts.</P>
      <P>One or two other issues were raised.  I have no problem whatsoever with arranging an agriculture debate, but I would like to know which aspect of it the Senator wants to speak about.  Senator Farrelly should bring forward some wording and tell me what aspect of agriculture he wants to speak on.  Senator D'Arcy has mentioned some agriculture matters.  To talk in global terms and claim that everything is going badly at the moment is totally wrong and Members know that.  If Senators tell me what aspect of agriculture they wish to debate, I will have no problem asking the Minister to come in.  I will come back to Senator Howard on the issue he raised.  On Senator Crowley's request for a debate on extradition, I am sure with the agreement of the Whips that we can find two hours for that on a Thursday.  Next week we will deal with the Matrimonial Home Bill.  With regard to Senator O'Toole's and Senator Manning's request in the last week for new legislation, I assure the House that we will be extremely busy in the next couple of months with many Bills being initiated in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Senators on all sides.  I wish to make a few points before giving the background to the framing of the <Col N="1293" /><i>National Development Plan, 1994 to 1999.</i></P>
      <P>Job creation has been the highest priority of the Government.  I want to make clear the position of the Government in relation to reports that Ireland's share of the Structural Funds will fall short of earlier expectations.  We agreed an allocation in July and this agreement was endorsed by the President of the European Commission.  This established our allocation from Structural Funds and the new Cohesion Funds at approximately £8 billion for the years 1993-99.  It was on this basis that the Government gave its assent to the adoption of the framework regulation which is the legal basis for the disbursement of the new tranche of Structural Funds.  We removed that obstacle to the regulations in the early hours of the morning of 20 July, which was three months from today.  The Irish Government expects and envisages that the assurances given by the President of the Commission will be honoured in full.  The National Development Plan has been prepared and will be implemented on this basis.</P>
      <P>This morning the Taoiseach recalled the events which led up to the agreement of 20 July and outlined that:</P>
      <P>Following on the conclusions of the Edinburgh European Council, the Commission prepared a draft framework regulation as the key legislative instrument for the implementation of the 1993-99 Structural Funds decisions and for that reason requiring unanimous agreement of member states for adoption.  The draft regulation was considered by the General Affairs Council on 2 and 3 July.  At that meeting Ireland did not agree to the adoption of the regulation.</P>
      <P>The reason for withholding agreement was clearly laid down, as the Taoiseach put on the record of the Dáil this morning, in a statement jointly prepared with the European Commission and in direct consultation with the Belgian Presidency which was issued on 9 July.  For the record, I will quote what the Taoiseach said this morning:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1294" /> When the Council established its common policy on the six regulations on the 2 and 3 July, the Irish Government made it abundantly clear that its agreement on a final decision would depend on satisfactory assurances as to an equitable outcome on the question of the allocation of resources.  The reservation it entered on the framework regulation has to be seen in this context. The Irish Government will not agree, in the Council's second reading, the overall package of the six regulations without such assurances.  Since last Saturday a number of contacts have taken place both with the Commission and with the Presidency.  These contacts have been helpful but need to be continued in order to reach a satisfactory outcome.</P>
    <P>While maintaining its overall reservation in connection with the allocation of financial resources, the Irish Government &mdash; having obtained assurances from both the Presidency and Commission that the text of the six regulations in no way prejudge this fundamental issue &mdash; does not object to proceeding to the Second Reading of Parliament on the common position on the six regulations as transmitted to Parliament.  It reiterates, however, that its final agreement to the formal adoption by the Council of these regulations will be subject to the satisfactory outcome being sought in continuing contacts.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also said:</P>
    <P>There was no doubt on the part of the European Commission, or on the part of other member states, of the Irish Government's determination to obtain assurances on an equitable share of EC Structural Funds and of the European Commission's acceptance that the determination was legitimate and could be met.  The draft framework regulation was next considered by the General Affairs Council on 19 and 20 July.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> The Tánaiste in his speech this morning put on the record the facts of that morning:</P>
    <P>Early in the morning of 20 July last, following intensive discussion and negotiation between the delegation that I led and some of the most senior officials in Europe, I met with President Delors in the company of several of his officials and several of mine. We agreed that granted the quality of Ireland's national plan and the projects we would put forward, Ireland would ultimately receive 9.35 billion ECUs in 1992 prices from the new round of Structural Funds.  That sum was to cover the period 1993-99.</P>
    <P>We understood, as did the Commission, that ultimately the Commission would meet formally to agree indicative figures that would be allocated as targets for each of the countries affected by the nest round.  These indicative figures would, in all likelihood, be expressed in ranges, or in what the Commission calls &ldquo;fourchettes&rdquo;&mdash; that is to say, a minimum and a maximum that could be achieved, depending on the quality of the plan put forward and on the efficiency of the member states in implementing their plans.  The figure of 9.35 billion ECUs in 1992 prices translates into 9.7 billion ECUs in 1993 prices and into IR£7.84 billion.</P>
    <P>That is the figure which the Tánaiste announced at the conclusion of those negotiations and which has been in the record since.  I thought that it would be helpful to restate the position as outlined this morning.</P>
    <P>Both myself and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fitzgerald, who had responsibility for the National Development Plan, are glad to have this opportunity to outline the work, the views and the underlying aspects in the preparation of this plan which we presented to Brussels ten days ago.  In addition to the £8 billion EC aid, associated investment by the Irish public and private sectors will bring the total investment <Col N="1296" /> package to over £20 billion.  The plan set out the main priorities for the largest investment programme ever undertaken in this country.</P>
    <P>It is essential that these resources are invested prudently in order to achieve not only an impact on growth and jobs during the plan period, but also lasting improvements in the economy that will leave it primed for continuing growth into the next century.  As I said at the outset, all considerations in relation to the plan were based on trying to generate growth and investment in the economy and to help develop our infrastructure and the economy in the long term.</P>
    <P>The strategy set out in the National Development Plan follows on from the macro-economic policies which we have been pursuing.  The plan builds on and improves policies which have contributed most to the recovery and growth in output and employment in the Irish economy in the recent past.  The expenditure programmes for the EC Structural and Cohesion Funds incorporated in the plan fit into and enhance the effectiveness of the broad, integrated and consistent medium-term strategy which the Government are pursuing.</P>
    <P>The macro-economic dimension of the plan must be evaluated in the context of Ireland's status and role in the development, integration and expansion of the European economy.  The EC Structural and Cohesion Funds provide opportunities to consolidate the benefits gained by the Irish economy from the completion of the Single Market, the first Community support framework and the beginnings of the process of creating an economic and monetary union.  It is essential, therefore, that we maintain our commitment to policies which will keep the Irish economy in conformity with the basic requirements for participation in building this new European economic order.  Specifically this means continuing to adhere to the nominal convergence criteria contained in the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>The central objective of the National Development Plan is to ensure the best long term return for the economy by <Col N="1297" /> increasing output, economic potential and long term jobs.  It is further designed to reintegrate the long term unemployed and those at high risk of becoming long term unemployed into the economic mainstream.</P>
    <P>The plan sets out the Government's strategy to achieve the national and European Community objective of greater economic and social cohesion. The basic elements of the strategy are investment in the growth potential of the economy in industry, tourism and services, agriculture and natural resources; investment in the country's productive infrastructure to improve the capacity and competitiveness of the economy; investment in the development of the skills of our people through education and training in order to increase productivity and growth capacity; and a special increased emphasis on harnessing local community leadership and local initiative.</P>
    <P>This strategy will be given effect by a wide range of carefully selected development measures.  I propose to give an overview of some of these measures.</P>
    <P>The main vehicle for direct job creation in the economy will continue to be industrial development.  The industry programme is, therefore, one of the most important and largest programmes put forward in the plan.  Total public, that is national and EC, investment in industrial development will amount to almost £1.4 billion.  Private sector investment associated with this public input will bring the total investment in industrial development to over £3.8 billion.  At this stage, I stress the need for partnership based on a commitment to competitive excellence.</P>
    <P>The industry programme will reflect the recommendations of the Culliton and Moriarty reports.  There will be increased emphasis on the development of indigenous industry, with support being directed at encouraging Irish-owned companies to build on their competitive capability at firm level and encouraging the development of capability and expansion of capacity at industry level.  There will be special initiatives in key sectors with identified job creation capacity, such as wood <Col N="1298" /> processing, the film industry, software and electronics services, aerospace and automobile components.</P>
    <P>While developing indigenous industry is a priority, inward investment is also essential to job creation.  Resources will continue to be targeted at bringing new industries to this country in the sectors and market niches where we have the greatest competitive advantage and also to the further development and expansion of foreign owned firms already located in Ireland.  The benefits of inward investment must be maximised by the development of linkages between Irish owned and foreign owned firms.  There will be additional funding for company led R and D and for marketing measures.</P>
    <P>The food industry is one of the most important sectors of Irish industry, accounting for 22 per cent of total exports and about 20 per cent of all manufacturing jobs.  Because of its potential to create national wealth and employment, the development of a strong indigenous food industry is a key Government objective. There will be a new special sub-programme for the food industry to deliver an integrated and coherent development package, embracing capital investment, marketing, research and development and human resources measures.</P>
    <P>Total expenditure, including associated private sector expenditure, in the areas of agriculture, rural development and forestry will be over £1,450 million. When investment in food, which I have already mentioned, and human resources is added, the total package in this area will come to £2.2 billion.</P>
    <P>The fishing sector has shown growth in recent years but remains underdeveloped. It offers potential for further development as a contributor to economic development in coastal areas and to output and exports nationally.  Development measures will include fleet renewal through vessel construction and modernisation, aquaculture development involving both new installations and modernising existing areas, improved fish processing facilities, developments at <Col N="1299" /> fishery centres and fishery harbours and a programme of marine research.</P>
    <P>The present operational programme for tourism has been very successful in terms of both increased foreign tourism revenue and job creation.  The new programme will build on that success and has the aim of achieving an increase of £1 billion, or 50 per cent in real terms, in foreign tourism revenue by the end of 1999.  It will also aim at getting a much wider spread of tourist income throughout the year.  Total investment, between the State, the EC and the private sector will be over £580 million to 1999.</P>
    <P>There will be increased investment in marketing and training, investments in product for specialist tourists, such as activity holidays and language learning and a programme of investment to upgrade and improve tourist angling waters.  Ireland will be established in the top league of international conference venues with a major new conference centre planned for Dublin.  There will be accelerated investment in arts, culture and heritage projects.</P>
    <P>Investment of over £2.6 billion is planned in transport infrastructure.  The primary objectives of transport investment in the period will be to improve internal and access transport infrastructure and facilities on an integrated basis and to improve the reliability of the transport system.  We will continue to invest heavily in improving the national primary and secondary road network concentrating on four key corridors: north to south; south-west; east to west and the western corridor linking Sligo, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Rosslare.  There will also be an increased investment effort in regional and local roads of importance to local economic development.</P>
    <P>Under the plan there will be an increased role for public transport.  There will be major investment in upgrading the mainline rail links.  The Dublin Transportation Initiative will be substantially advanced, including a light rail system, completion of the Dublin Ring Road, an efficient access route to Dublin port, quality bus corridors, upgrading existing <Col N="1300" /> suburban rail services and improved traffic management.  Investment will also take place in the strategic ports of Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Waterford, Cork, Rosslare and the Shannon estuary and in the State airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork.</P>
    <P>Environmental infrastructure is important from the point of view of both contributing to the development of industry and tourism and protecting and enhancing our quality of life.  There will be substantial direct investment of £655 million in environmental services.  Projects will include major coastal sewage treatment schemes in Cork, Dublin, Dundalk, Greystones, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Westport and major water schemes in Dublin, Limerick and Tuam.</P>
    <P>Total expenditure in the energy sector will be over £2.1 billion and will focus on improving the contribution of energy costs to competitiveness.  Structural Funds aid will be directed at key strategic projects including a peat fired generating station, an energy efficiency scheme, pilot projects in the development of cutaway bogs, rural energy networks and the extension of the natural gas supply to the Shannon area.</P>
    <P>There will be an investment of over £850 million in telecommunications over the period.  The investment proposed will facilitate the completion of digitalisation, the expansion of the fibre optical network, significant improvements in international access and further developments in mobile services.  The investment of £60 million in the postal services will include measures for the extension of the post office computer system in rural areas and the construction of modern mail centres located in the regions.</P>
    <P>The Government has included a major health investment project, Tallaght Hospital, in this plan.  It was mentioned during the Order of Business that the contract is to be signed this afternoon. This new acute general teaching hospital will fill a major gap in the development needs of what is now the third largest urban centre in the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> The development of our human resources is essential to future growth and employment creation.  Some £3.1 billion is to be invested in human resources over the period of the plan.  The main objectives in this area will be to ensure the competitiveness of Irish industry and services through the supply of highly qualified and skilled personnel; to equip enterprise and workers with the skills necessary to cope with occupational, structural and technological change; to improve the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for new enterprise by having a highly educated, skilled, adaptable and versatile workforce; to promote equality in access to jobs and training and to help overcome disadvantage; and to maintain and enhance participation rates in education and training for the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan places a major emphasis on local development, building on the experience already gained from the Pilot Area Programme in Integrated Rural Development, 1988-90, the current Leader programme, the area based initiatives under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the third EC poverty programme and the EC global grant for local development.  All indicate that there is considerable potential to be tapped at local level to tackle long-term unemployment and to generate local development.  Inherent in the programme is the targeting of areas and communities characterised by long term unemployment and social exclusion.</P>
    <P>Some £1.143 million will be available to the local development programme over the period of the plan.  The programme will have four elements.  First, a countrywide local enterprise sub-programme to be administered through the county enterprise boards.  The boards will provide support for local enterprise initiatives and will fill a gap which has been identified in the current support services for local enterprise initiatives. Some £114 million will be available from the Exchequer alone for this programme over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1302" /> Secondly, there will be an area based local development programme for areas characterised by a high concentration of long term unemployment, social exclusion and environmental deprivation. This measure extends the pilot initiative of area partnership companies introduced under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which have yielded significant results in terms of enterprise and employment, community development and improved services for the long term unemployed.  Some £100 million will be available for this programme over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, a substantially expanded community employment development programme will replace the countrywide social employment scheme.  The CEDP contains a combination of training inputs and community work specifically targeted at the long term unemployed.  The total available under this measure is £813 million.</P>
    <P>An urban renewal programme will improve the fabric of the local environment with emphasis on architectural conservation and streetscapes.  A second part of this sub-programme is the completion of the range of cultural facilities in the Temple Bar area of Dublin.  The urban renewal programme involves expenditure of £116 million over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>The Government was determined to ensure that the development strategy adopted for the plan should promote balanced regional development.  To this end it has taken fully into account the work of the seven sub-regional review committees which were established under the current Community support framework.</P>
    <P>The Government has responded to the recommendations of the sub regional review committees to the extent to which they are consistent with the overall national objective of maximising sustainable employment and growth and having regard to the limits on EC and national resources available.  Full account has been taken of the recommendations of the review committees in drawing up the development strategy which underpins this plan and in allocating resources <Col N="1303" /> to various sectoral programmes through which the plan will be implemented.</P>
    <P>The detailed recommendations and proposals contained in the submissions from the sub-regional review committees also constitute a very valuable input to the drafting of the detailed operational programmes which will be submitted to the EC Commission for approval in conjunction with the plan.</P>
    <P>As part of the arrangements for implementing the plan, the Government intends to develop the sub-regional dimension of the monitoring arrangements, building on the experience gained under the current Community support framework.  The Government has decided that the regional authorities will have responsibility for the functions currently discharged by the sub-regional review committees.  For the purpose of discharging these functions, the committees which will assist the regional authorities in this regard will include representatives of local authorities, other public authorities, Government Departments, the social partner organisations currently represented on the sub-regional review committees, the EC Commission and the voluntary and community sectors. Therefore, there is wide representation and involvement on the part of the various bodies with the regional authorities overseeing the various activities.</P>
    <P>Resources under the plan are allocated to national sectoral programmes, not on a sub-regional basis.  However, the plan includes an estimate of the likely breakdown of the expenditure by sub-region. Maintaining an appropriate regional balance was an important consideration for the Government in preparing the plan. Statements of proposed integrated developments in each sub-region are being prepared and will be made available publicly.</P>
    <P>The importance of North/South crossBorder co-operation in tackling a range of economic and social issues is recognised not only in this National Development Plan but also in Northern Ireland's Regional Development Plan.  Both plans <Col N="1304" /> include a common agreed chapter setting out the extent of existing co-operation and the prospects for further such co-operation.</P>
    <P>There is already a great deal of economic co-operation between North and South and steady progress in promoting cross-Border partnership has been made over the past decade.  In the context of the last round of the Structural Funds, for example, substantial support has been given to schemes designed to upgrade transport links between the two parts of the island, such as the improvement of cross-Border roads and the commencement of work on a major upgrading of the Belfast to Dublin rail link. The joint Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG programme has provided a particularly valuable focus for supporting cross-Border projects in many sectors. Other EC initiatives such as STRIDE and STAR have successfully promoted scientific and technical collaboration in the academic community and industry, a specific example being the optic fibre link between Belfast and Dublin assisted under the STAR programme.</P>
    <P>In preparing the development plans for the 1994-99 period both the British and Irish Governments have paid close attention to the opportunities for expanding economic collaboration in the context of the next round of assistance from the Structural Funds.  In the implementation of both plans the closest liaison will be maintained in all relevant areas to ensure this eventuality.</P>
    <P>While reactions to the plan following its publication have generally been supportive, there has been some criticism that the plan does not contain in detail all the economic and social policies which contribute to employment creation and tackling Ireland's unemployment problems. I have made it clear that this plan is one element, albeit an important one, in the Government's economic and social strategy for Ireland's development.  The plan sets out the programmes and measures in the structural areas covered by EC Structural and Cohesion Funds. Given the size of the proposed investments and the range of sectors covered, <Col N="1305" /> as you will appreciate from my brief description of the development measures proposed, the plan will play a vital but not exclusive role in the employment creation we so badly need.</P>
    <P>It has been said the the job creation targets in the plan are too optimistic; other comments suggest that our targets are not optimistic enough faced with the magnitude of the task confronting us.  It is essential that we are ambitious but realistic about the problems confronting us and the targets which can be achieved. I was very anxious, during the preparation of the plan, to set targets that were both feasible and sustainable.</P>
    <P>In view of the budget strategy and incomes and fiscal policy, if we can do more it will be all the better.  In previous years plans were prepared and, after a short period of their operation, their growth figures and underlying policies could not be maintained.  The growth and output figures and employment targets in this plan are ones we can realistically attain based on present performance and an improvement in the European economic position.  Many of the indicators show a start in the upward movement in 1994.  I believe that it could be 1995 before we get a turn around of significance. Certainly the underlying trends are in the right direction.</P>
    <P>In recent years our economy has outpaced that of our EC partners but our needs are also greater than theirs.  Most importantly, unemployment here remains higher as a proportion of the labour force than in any other EC country except Spain.  Our natural rate of labour force increase is well above the EC average. Although there has been some catching up in recent years, income per head in Ireland is still well below the EC average.  Reducing unemployment and narrowing this gap in living standards are two of our foremost economic challenges.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the response to both these challenges &mdash; the need to create many more jobs and to bring living standards closer to the EC average &mdash; will have to come through efforts to accelerate the growth of market led output; we have <Col N="1306" /> learned from experience that the scope for direct job creation by the State in our circumstances is severely limited.  That is why we have tended to be cautious.</P>
    <P>In setting out growth and employment targets in the plan we recognised that policies and developments outside the ambit of the plan would have a major influence on these targets; they always do.  Accordingly the plan sets out both the targets that we are confident can be achieved by the plan investments and the targets that could be achieved if competitiveness improved or if developments in the world economy are more favourable.</P>
    <P>The development measures in the plan should, across the various sectors, produce about 200,000 jobs.  Some of these are long term; some are short term arising from project construction.  Without the plan investments we would not have these jobs.  This does not mean that the numbers of those at work will increase by 200,000 over the period of the plan.  Many of the short term jobs will replace current short term jobs and experience shows that some of the new long term jobs will be offset by job losses elsewhere.  Our best estimate is that there will be net non-agricultural job growth of between 70,000 and 100,000 over the period of the plan depending on the level of wage competitiveness achieved and the strength of growth in the world economy. While this may sound low relative to our job creation needs it must be looked at in the context of the employment situation internationally.</P>
    <P>Over the last few years the Irish economy has clearly shown its potential for rapid, non-inflationary, market led, economic growth.  Turning to the future, it has to be said bluntly that the international economic background against which decisions must be made over the next couple of years is not a promising one.</P>
    <P>We can heartily wish that it was otherwise. We will do all we can, in consultation with our EC partners, in international fora and elsewhere, to try to bring about a better outturn.  The Government has made a constructive <Col N="1307" /> contribution to the formulation of a more growth orientated EC policy in the context of our submission to the EC White Paper on employment and competitiveness which will be discussed in December.  However, there is no use closing our eyes to reality.  Over the next couple of years at least strong international growth is most unlikely.  At a recent ECOFIN meeting we looked in great detail at the position and, with the exception of Germany which has its own difficulties, prospects for the other countries in the second half of 1994 and 1995 are better.  Vice-President Christophersen is certainly optimistic and we, too, should try to be positive.  However, the next six months will continue to be difficult.</P>
    <P>This year Ireland and the United Kingdom are likely to be the only EC countries to show much by way of growth.  According to EC Commission forecasts, Ireland will be the only EC country, apart from Luxembourg, to show any employment growth this year.</P>
    <P>While I have good reason to be optimistic about the prospects for employment growth even in unfavourable economic circumstances, I must issue a warning: we cannot expect employment growth or even employment stability if wage increases are uncompetitive.  We must make solid gains in competitiveness if we are serious about reducing unemployment, and to make these gains there is no substitute for pay moderation.  It is estimated that a sustained annual improvement of 1 per cent in wage competitiveness could add as many as 4,000 jobs to employment growth.  That was one of the important statistics produced from the national model in the preparation of the various inputs of expenditure and taxation on incomes data during the preparation of the plan in the past six months.</P>
    <P>In negotiating a new national programme with the social partners we must make employment the cornerstone in a way we have not done up to now.  The new programme if it is to work must include, first, a pattern of pay developments <Col N="1308" /> in the economy that will secure a progressive and sustained improvement in our competitiveness from 1994 onwards.  Second, we have to have a fiscal policy set in the framework of the Maastricht convergence guidelines.  We are committed to that now.  Even if there was no European Monetary Union or Single European Act these are the criteria that would be proper for the economy to follow.  Regardless of the pace at which we are moving to stage three of European Monetary Union we have to follow that fiscal policy.  To do otherwise would be a grave mistake.  Third is the disciplined management of the public finances consistent with exchange rate stability and moderate interest rates.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the positive suggestions and contributions of the upper House.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald and I in working on the national plan will take full account of the views expressed.  The process for us now, along with ensuring our clear understanding of the agreement of 20 July is fulfilled, involves a huge workload.  The plan moves itself into operational programmes. The document in front of Senators today is the National Plan and will be negotiated with the Commission over a number of months.</P>
    <P>In its conclusion it will become the Community support framework which is effectively the Commission's response to our input, our national plan.  The 12 or so operational programmes that will come from that are the ones we will have to negotiate in detail.  Naturally all comments and points made here and in the debate which took place here prior to the summer will be taken into account and we would like to have those discussions wrapped up early in 1994.  Based on what happened in 1989 it will probably take three or four months.  Over that period the Commission will be examining the plan and the operational programmes will be discussed side by side.  In due course we will have an opportunity of talking about them again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the circumstances that have arisen over the last 24 hours in connection with the National Development Plan.  For the benefit of Members who were so emphatic about certain things said at different times over past months, I remind the House that at the end of the Edinburgh summit the Taoiseach informed us that £8 billion would be available under the Structural Funds for Ireland from 1993 to 1997. Following the Government's mishandling of the monetary crisis, which cost the State huge sums of money individuals are still paying for, and the devaluation of 10 per cent, that figure was upped to £8.8 billion.  Then when the famous July meeting took place which the Tánaiste and a number of his officials attended with senior Commission officials the figure was £7.84 billion.  The Tánaiste said today:</P>
      <P>We understood, as did the Commission, that ultimately the Commission would meet formally to agree indicative figures that would be allocated as targets for each of the countries affected by the next round.  In all likelihood those indicative figures would be expressed in ranges &mdash; or what the Commission call <i>fourchettes</i>&mdash; that is to say, a minimum and a maximum that could be achieved, depending on the quality of the plan put forward and on the efficiency of member states in implementing their plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At almost the same time the President of the Commission, was saying that the Irish Government were liars.  Members opposite may shake their heads but I listened to what the Commissioner said. It is sad that this situation developed.  If the boot was on the other foot and the Tánaiste was in Opposition this morning, no doubt he would have cited Standing Orders and would have been telling the <Col N="1310" /> Ceann Comhairle how to raise this most important issue and that the people have been misled over past months.</P>
    <P>There is an old saying used by an elegant Member of the Lower House &mdash;&ldquo;Once you take the shilling you must follow the drums.&rdquo;  That line has been followed by the Labour Party since they went into Government.  It is a sad reflection on people who we all thought would do better on behalf of the State.</P>

      <P>There are a number of other issues I would like to deal with in connection with the plan.  The Taoiseach said in the lower House that all members should be united in their efforts to secure whatever funds possible from the Commission for our plan and I have no problem with that.  We asked that the Members of both Houses and the Oireachtas Joint Committees would be given the opportunity to discuss the plan and to improve it by the input of Members before the plan was sent to Brussels.  If that consultation had taken place we might not have had today's débâcle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is the last person who should attempt to criticise the Opposition for pointing out the projects where large amounts of money will be wasted.  Although he was elected on foot of a famous plan in 1977, he said he did not read it and it turned out to be a disaster.  I wonder if he read beyond the first page of this plan before it went to Brussels.  If he did he might have remembered the figure of £7.3 billion and not £7.8 billion or whatever the final figure will be.</P>
      <P>Last week a Senator told one of my colleagues that this week he would have an opportunity to speak on the national lottery.  He meant to say the national plan but he must have presumed from the word within his ranks this money would be used in the same manner as lottery money, with EC cash in place of lottery funds.  That does not give much hope to those who are unemployed, on low incomes or still at school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This plan will shatter the hopes of those who wanted real jobs to be created.  The Minister said 200,000 jobs would be created but many would be short term or would replace existing short term jobs. The final figure will be between 80,000 and 90,000.  Last week the Taoiseach said 52,000.  Every figure the Taoiseach has mentioned since the plan was announced has changed.  The amount of money was initially £8.8 billion, it is now £7.3 billion and who knows what it will be when the plan has finished?  The figure of 52,000 <Col N="1312" /> will probably reduce as rapidly as the figure for the finance.</P>
    <P>Where do the findings of the Culliton report appear in this plan?  The report said firms who did not receive grants in the 1980s created more jobs than those which received a total of £1.6 billion. The new plan proposes to allocate £3.688 billion.  The Government appears not to have learned much from the Culliton report, if one reads this plan.</P>
    <P>The use of EC money has always been an obsession with Fianna Fáil when in office.  It has sought to spend it across the country without creating the jobs it said it would.  Sadly, after this plan the number of jobs will not have increased dramatically but the number of unemployed will, up to perhaps 400,000.</P>
    <P>It is also worrying that the Government has decided there will be little or no privatisation. State companies which will receive huge funds under the plan will not have to answer for the use of the money or produce programmes saying whether the money will be invested wisely, giving better service and cheaper cost to the consumer as a result.</P>
    <P>The plan, when it had been finalised by Government, should have been scrutinised by both Houses of the Oireachtas. Many constructive amendments could have been made, as happens to legislation.</P>
    <P>The following five matters have not been seriously dealt with in the plan. First, the kernel of our problems and the reason employers do not wish to take on more people is the penal effect the income tax and PRSI systems have in increasing the cost of employing people and the consequent reduction in the number of jobs on offer.  Many small business people say when they do their accounts, that their ambition by the end of the following year is to employ one less person, because of the overall cost.</P>
    <P>The second issue is the imprisonment of people in poverty traps caused by the maze of means tests, entitlement cut-offs and the discriminatory treatment of children in the tax and social welfare codes. People have refused, are refusing and will refuse to take low paid jobs because <Col N="1313" /> of what they receive on social welfare. We often compare ourselves with our nearest neighbour.  People in Britain pay 16 per cent less tax at the lower rate than we do.  It is no wonder it does not pay people to take lower paid jobs.</P>
    <P>The third problem is the absence of an effective competition policy, backed by an adequately staffed competition authority with power to initiate inquiries into overcharging and other extra costs.</P>
    <P>The fourth item missing is a comprehensive plan to stop children leaving school too early and becoming long term unemployed.  Early assessments, home visits, parental education and timely remedial help should be introduced.</P>
    <P>The fifth matter is the failure to put job security at the top of the industrial relations agenda.  Retraining and work sharing should be given a higher priority than short term profits, short term wage increases, tax subsidies and redundancies.</P>
    <P>Had all these items been dealt with through legislation, more employers would want to take on staff.  Many people have ideas but do not want to take a risk because the first ten callers on them will be from different tax and social welfare offices.  These are the issues this Government urged the EC to deal with in its submission on employment to the Commission, yet it has not dealt with them in its national plan.  It is hard to understand. The Minister mentioned the presentation the Government made.</P>
    <P>The 1989-1993 plan set out to create 175,000 jobs.  It created only 80,000. Some 70,000 jobs were lost over that period, giving a net increase of 10,000. Meanwhile a further 98,000 people emigrated and 63,000 more joined the dole queues.  Will this plan be any different? On the basis of the figures given by the Taoiseach, I would be worried.  I hope I am wrong but since the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance accept many of the jobs to be created will be part-time or replace existing part-time jobs, the eventual figure will be much less than 100,000.  That does not represent value for the money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1314" /> Our objective must be to increase Ireland's percentage of world trade and have output equal to the EC average. There is little evidence this plan has any integrated focus to improve our competitiveness. The key to competitiveness is cost structures.  These include preliminary labour costs as well as transport, communications, energy and postal costs.  The plan does not set out an improvement in the cost of these services in return for investments made.  Will the investments be cost-effective?  The relevant semi-State companies should have been obliged to bring forward a detailed plan to improve in efficiency and reduce charges.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note how EC funds have been spent over the past decade. In 1982 current Government expenditure stood at £4.53 billion.  By 1992 this had risen to £7.06 billion.  Capital expenditure over the same period rose from £625 million to £776 million.  This shows that despite an EC transfer of 3 to 4 per cent of GNP, current spending rose twice as fast as capital spending.  What has happened to all our EC billions?  We have not adhered to the principle of additionality and instead have substituted EC finance for Exchequer commitments. Day to day spending without long term return has been given priority. In many ways the Government has treated EC funds like receipts from the national lottery.  It has used them for short-term budgetary considerations as opposed to adhering to the objective of raising our national income per person to the European average.</P>
    <P>The Government has been less than honest in its hyped presentation of this plan.  It has made assumptions about private sector investments to maximise the figures.  It has included the 1993 expenditure to raise the figure from an actual planning investment of £17.4 billion to £20 billion.  This plan must be integrated with other financial policies in order to increase income and jobs.  The Government has not set either an income or a tax policy.  Subsidised jobs will only last as long as the subsidy.  That is a fact of life and nobody knows that better than <Col N="1315" /> a former Minister of many portfolios.  If one subsidises a job it will last until the subsidy disappears and then the job is gone.</P>
    <P>All the indications are that after the year 2000 we will have to share these Structural Funds with an enlarged EC. New areas in central and eastern Europe will qualify under the present criteria for funding.  This is therefore in effect our last chance to rectify the structural defects in the Irish economy.  In terms of rate of return, the yardstick against which any project must be measured is that of world interest rates on lending.  For example, if we had been allowed to use the money to reduce the national debt, this would be equivalent to getting a rate of return on the money that we are currently paying as interest on servicing the debt.</P>
    <P>Many people would disagree but in real terms if we had £20 billion or £15 billion or £12 billion in total and reduced our national debt by half, reduced the costs of employing people and reduced income tax at the lower end of the scale, I have no doubt that we would have more people working than we will have at the end of the proposed investments.  It is sad but that would be the case.</P>
    <P>The ESRI and a group of consultants have been the only parties to study the effectiveness of the past plans.  Many of their recommendations seem to have been wilfully ignored.  One of the recommendations was to establish a reserve fund of 20 per cent of the total funds.  If that line of advice had been followed and 20 per cent of the total funds put in reserve, the hiccup in Brussels today, would not matter.  That advice was freely given by a group of consultants who studied the effectiveness of the last plans and it was wilfully ignored by the Government. I wonder why.</P>
    <P>By any standard six years is a long time and priorities may change.  Since Monday of last week priorities have changed dramatically.  I am sure there are Ministers wondering today what they will have to do in connection with what they agreed only six to eight days ago.  Consultants <Col N="1316" /> gave good advice that 20 per cent of funds should be held in reserve and if that had been done we might not be in this dilemma.</P>
    <P>New information may become available about certain projects.  The Government, in its rush to hype this plan, has opted for political expediency over procedure. If it had withheld a substantial reserve of the fund, it could select the best investments midway through the plan in the light of experience.  Similarly there is no provision for tendering or competition for the drawing down of funds between different operational programmes or between subheads of overall programmes.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has seen its share of funds diminish from 18 per cent to 13 per cent. While we must acknowledge that a ceiling has been put on output, the needs of rural Ireland were never greater.  Income maintenance through headage schemes is vital to sustain many smaller family farms.  There is no provision for any increase in this vital aspect of their income, nor has any reference been made to the necessity for the introduction of a new third category of extremely disadvantaged area.  I heard today in one of the reports from our EC correspondent that the first major cut &mdash; if there is any reduction on the figure announced in July &mdash; will be 10-15 per cent from agriculture. That would be disastrous for many farmers who are surviving on the subsidy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people, including the Government, think that all of the new enterprises that have been set up will solve the problem. We spoke about it during the last <Col N="1317" /> session when changes were made in the IDA.  The following agencies are at work: the IDA, the county enterprise partnership boards, BTT and SFADCo.  The Culliton report recommended the rationalisation of these agencies, especially for indigenous industries.  It goes without saying that heretofore indigenous industries were not served well by the number of agencies.  Instead we have a whole new generation of job creation toys &mdash; enterprise boards, FÁS, community initiatives, global grants, development companies, Leader projects and <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> companies.  Given past experience, I thought Culliton would have been listened to and that a more efficient system, reducing the number of people providing a service to those who wish to employ people, would have been introduced. There is now a bewildering array of organisations, all with a similar brief of employment creation.  This has added confusion and red tape to small enterprises. The Government should streamline these quangos in an efficient manner to ensure that the people who want to employ people and invest do not have to deal with red tape.  An amount of money from this plan, a fixed portion of 5-10 per cent, should have been set aside to deal with all the ideas and one agency should have been set up.</P>
    <P>If this National Development Plan was genuinely a vehicle for economic progress it would have set out a clear exchange rate policy and competition policy for the period of the plan.  The absence of these ingredients shows that the Government are acting like lotto millionaires, without any meaningful, indepth economic analysis.</P>
    <P>These proposals are a mishmash of ideas from a Government which, since elected, has treated the electorate with contempt in many ways.  It was recently disclosed that one Minister, the Minister for Health, has so far this year spent approximately £29,000 on trips out of the country.  I do not believe the people elected us to have this type of expenditure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1318" /> Regarding the main proposals in the plan, such as the construction of bypasses, there are many problems in the areas for which there are proposals. There is one major aspect which those of us from rural Ireland will have to consider seriously.  If there is a reduction in the amount of money decided on, investment in local and regional roads should not be reduced.  There is a problem in this regard and Members of the Oireachtas know this because they travelled these roads last year.  There is a need for investment and a decision to ensure money promised will be beneficial.</P>
    <P>It is sad that there is a divergence of views between the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the President of the Commission. This matter must be rectified because the country will be the loser.  I hope, on the basis of what has been said, these words are amended.  If change is required or there is a reduction in the amount, a certain proportion should be set aside so we can see where we will be in three years' time and if we can get better value for money.  Committing it all on the first day is not a good idea.  It is a pity the advice of the consultants who reviewed the previous plans, where a substantial sum of money was spent, was not taken on board in this regard.</P>

      <P>As a former member of the Council and of the Commission, I have some experience negotiating in this area.  I was involved on behalf of the Government in negotiating the European support framework with the present Taoiseach and Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern.  We reached agreement with the Commission with regard to that framework in 1987.  It is important that the foundation on which the European framework was launched over the past four years and the National Development Plan be clarified.  The National Development Plan is based on funding from three sources, the EC, the Exchequer and the private sector and the Commission is aware of that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was encouraged to hear statements from the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste this morning because they are crucial to the <Col N="1319" /> development of the National Development Plan.  The Taoiseach stated the Government's resolve to implement the National Development Plan in full.  That is a clear and unambiguous statement. Although it does not need to be confirmed, such confirmation strengthens the fact.  The Tánaiste stated that he was happy to avail of the opportunity to reassure the House and the people that the National Development Plan submitted to the European Commission last week and published by the Government will be implemented in full.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in their respective constitutional roles have given an unqualified assertion that the plan will be fully implemented.  I welcome that.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste pointed out that they must have the full support of the House regarding its implementation, which I presume is forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Discussions are conducted on the basis of the full implementation of the plan before us.  It is important to note that the elements the plan embrace are the three sections to which I referred.  I refer to the one of the opening paragraphs of the plan so that we may clarify what we are addressing, how we intend to solve problems and to realise the potential of this country.  It states: &ldquo;It is estimated that total expenditure in current prices over the period 1993 to 1999 will be of the order of £22.3 billion (27.6 billion ECU) which will include EC aid of £8.8 billion (10.9 billion ECU).&rdquo;  Our approach to this plan has those key components and I insist that they stay in place.</P>
    <P>The Commission is a collegiate body and when a commitment is given by an individual or the President of the Commission, it must be a collegiate binding commitment.  It can only be given with the authority and sanction of the Commission <i>qua</i> Commission and anyone who needs confirmation of that need only look at the Treaty of Rome which sets out the functions of the Commission and individual Commissioners.  The President of the Commission is aware of what agreements with member states represent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> Today the Tánaiste referred to a solemn agreement.  In reply to Deputies' questions in regard to the agreement he said that it can be summed up with the assertion that an agreement solemnly made between the President of the European Commission and the Minister for Foreign Affairs is worthless.  This agreement is not worthless.  A solemn agreement cannot and must not be allowed to be worthless.  We seek and insist on assurance from the Commission in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are procedures for agreements with and in the Commission and they are employed each time negotiations take place on behalf ten or 12 member states, whether at European Council level or between Foreign, Agriculture and Finance Ministers.  Those procedures are based on the fact that bilateral negotiations take place.  We have all been involved in such negotiations in corridors late at night or early in the morning as Finance, Foreign and especially Agriculture Ministers.  Negotiations are conducted by a Commissioner with each individual Minister.  In my experience, when an understanding is reached with a Minister or delegation, whether it is in the delegation room, the coffee room or the refreshment bar at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m., nobody should imply that because the discussions were conducted informally in the early hours of the morning they lack the basis of discussion, and a non-paper is introduced.  I do not believe this has changed.</P>
    <P>A non-paper represents what has not been formally and finally adopted by the Commission or the Council of Ministers. The Commissioner responsible at the time would have sufficient authority to present this to the Minister in question. During my 20 years' experience in various Councils and as Commissioner that has always been the basis on which it was done.  There would be a record in the Commission of the understanding that was reached between the individual Commissioner, particularly the President of the Commission, and the individual member state.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> We are not dealing with casual understandings here.  We are dealing with an agreement that will be binding and put into a treaty framework, with a representative of a collective body bound individually and collectively by everything that is agreed between the parties. For that reason, I presume that was the procedure followed on this occasion.  The farmers and Senator Farrelly will not thank me for this, but as an illustration, I have had experience of this when negotiating matters as relatively unimportant as calf and ewe premia: during long nights we had these discussions and then, if we were to have bilateral understandings, we received a non-paper, which we had translated.  I presume we are talking in the same terms here.</P>
    <P>In 1978-79 when we launched the European monetary system in Bremen, which subsequently became part of the European Commitment that gave us a system &mdash; I doubt if anyone in this House remembers it &mdash; of loans and grants from the European Investment Bank to enable us to join the European monetary system, we had an understanding which was translated into a non-paper which subsequently became part of a legal framework.  I presume we are dealing with the same here.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion we negotiated with a Commissioner &mdash; the Taoiseach must be aware of this &mdash; Bruce Millan then as now had this responsibility, and he, the Minister for Finance and I went through these procedures, but we ensured that we had not only this understanding, this non-paper.  I hope and assume from what has been said so far that there will be clear evidence of that confirmation, otherwise the basis on which this debate is being conducted is, to say the least, faulty.  I assume that the elements of funding will bind all parties without any argument on interpretation.</P>
    <P>We do not need to attack the credibility of one or the other.  Who needs to attack the credibility of the Head of Government, the Deputy Head of Government, the Commissioner or the President of the Commission?  Who needs that when we are engaged in matters as important as <Col N="1322" /> this?  It is for that reason that these long established procedures should and must always be followed &mdash; to avoid any risk of creating a disagreement or misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt the Tánaiste when he said that this agreement was solemnly made with the President of the Commission who has shown his commitment to this country.  I have known President Delors for 15 years.  I like to think that, in our time, we were part of building up that special relationship with him.  Over the years I have personally conducted him on tours around the farms of Ireland. I saw his response to the developments we were planning in Ireland and I do not doubt his commitment but I want to ensure that that commitment that has been made is put in place through the procedures that have always been followed.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance said here today, we are now looking to the position we are taking on the adoption of the framework regulation.  This has the sanction of officials who are familiar with this area.  The adoption of the framework regulation is the legal basis for disbursement of the new tranche of funds. There must be a legal framework.  We are not looking at something that can be disbursed more efficiently by the Commission than it can by the Government. We are looking at a legal framework.  I hope there will be no doubt about the basis of that legal framework, otherwise the whole structure and procedure of negotiation and the whole structure of European legally binding framework and regulations will be totally undermined, and that would be unthinkable.</P>
    <P>These procedures have been adopted consistently over the years.  The Commission and the individual Commissioners, not least the President of the Commission, must be fully aware of that and if one Commissioner was not there at the time in question I assume that what was done was on behalf of all the Commission by the Commissioner present, namely, the President.</P>
    <P>The issues at stake here are much greater than Bremen when we introduced <Col N="1323" /> the first EMS supports and subsidies.  I have to say this in tribute to the Government, they are bigger than the issues we negotiated four or five years ago when we had the European support framework in place &mdash; and we did that after many bilateral negotiations but we always had the safety and security of the procedures to guarantee it.  It is essential that we have those same procedures to rely on at this stage where the issues are very important.</P>
    <P>In time, all these negotiated issues become formal legal contracts.  We all know that if contracts in the private or international sector are in writing, which they will always be, they cannot be changed by word of mouth.  They must be confined to the formal textual elements incorporated in the contract.  If there is to be a variation it can and will only be amended by a further legal and written contract, which obviously has not happened in this case.</P>
    <P>The construction and foundation of this plan is of such vital importance &mdash; perhaps even more important than the one in which I was centrally involved as a Minister some years ago &mdash; that there can be no doubt as to its solid foundation. I look forward to the reassurances which will be forthcoming from the Commission in view of the strong positions taken by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste today that that is the basis on which we are proceeding.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the plan.  I have been happy to hear some representatives of the Government point out that this plan is not about throwing money at investment or development.  I take the view that the promotion of an investment climate, the development of an enterprise capacity and the application of added value through education are much more important than organising schemes, developing a plethora of agencies, having a system of State involvement, of intervention, supported if necessary even by European Community funds.  I am a self-confessed supporter of the promotion of the enterprise spirit, of reducing tax penalties and of reducing PRSI levels.  I am <Col N="1324" /> convinced that they are components in job creation.  I have grave reservations about the long term effect of these agencies, and I have to acknowledge that Senator Farrelly is quite right; if one depends on subsidies for job creation, the jobs will last as long as the subsidies last and when the subsidies end there will be no jobs.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on a number of points in the plan.  I am happy to see that a considerable amount is devoted to human resources.  It will not surprise the Minister of State or the House to know that if I have a criticism it is that I do not see what I and many of my party colleagues would like, which is evidence of a clear priority to education &mdash; but then there are always accommodations to be reached in Government.</P>
    <P>The major commitment to resource development is of the order of £3.1 billion, including £1.8 billion in EC aid. While I welcome that as a major component of the plan, I would like to see it broken down.  I would also like to see it directed towards the application of knowledge and the creation of an enterprise spirit from primary school through second level to third level.</P>
    <P>In the presence of the Minister of State, may I say that when we launched the National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick &mdash; and I can say &ldquo;we&rdquo; because I was a junior Minister in the early 1970s &mdash; we resisted the notion of a university of the conventional type that some of the people in Limerick wanted &mdash; to give the city status because Cork and Galway had universities and they did not.  We looked first to see what it was that would give service, direction and purpose to Ireland Inc. from now on as members of the European Community and came up with the concept that is now such a success; investment in knowledge. Is it not clear from all the developments that have taken place in that sector, as well as the impact and success it has had, that that approach was vindicated in the 1970s and 1980s?  If it was vindicated then, it is more likely to be vindicated further in the highly competitive environment of the 1990s.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1325" /> I will give one further example to illustrate the point.  Some would say that the pharmaceutical/paramedical sector is one of the most successful in Ireland at the moment.  It is significant to note that in the case of the Elan Corporation in Athlone, there is almost a reverse takeover of the parent body in the United States by what was the branch office in Ireland.  The level of investment in postgraduate knowledge and management in that plant is a guarantee, that Elan and the Elans of the world &mdash; and we have some in my town as well &mdash; are absolutely secure in their marketing and research and development programmes because they have given priority to the application of knowledge.</P>
    <P>I regret that there is not harder evidence of a commitment to third level education in the plan.  Though it is not clear, as far as I can see, the allocation for third level capital programmes over the period of the plan is, to say the least, sparse.  I will be happy to be corrected, but I am told it is of the order of £120 million in total &mdash; and that is probably the maximum.  That is far too low having regard to the level of investment we want in the knowledge base that is unique to this country.</P>
    <P>I also want to ensure that the level of employment penalties is reduced.  I acknowledge that I was part of a Government which ensured that these penalties remained in place, though we did reduce them but we could only do it on one basis.  If I never spent another year in Government I would have to say I was proud, despite our delays and shortcomings over the years, of what we did from 1987 to 1989 when we decided, at last, that there was only one way to act. We could not be throwing money at things and pretending that it was coming from Europe or anywhere else.  We made a very firm, determined decision that we were going to reduce public expenditure, which is never popular.  What Government does not like spending money?  The good Government is one that will reduce spending and the penalties on tax, and PRSI that will follow.  I would like to see much more of that in this plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I was proud of that period, and I was proud of the nationally minded reaction of the Fine Gael Party at the time.  I have no hesitation in saying that.  I think it was a great period in Irish economic management. I hope we can see the same degree of consensus whenever we face issues of this kind now, but not on the basis of money we are going to spend unless there is discipline.  I would like to see greater priority given to the reduction of employment penalties like tax and PRSI.  Those who are involved in enterprise &mdash; and there is one distinguished Senator now in the House who is &mdash; can tell us more about the impact of these penalties than I can.  I always took the view that people in Government do not have to be business people; their role is to create the climate in which those who are will achieve so that there will be scope for employment.  That is the role that I have always seen for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the allocation for the agriculture sector, but not for that sector alone.  I would like to see a much greater emphasis on the food element in our indigenous industry for two reasons.  We are looking at a world economy that, to say the least, is volatile.  To a considerable extent, we are dependent on multinationals that have investment outlets in various parts of the world. However, when problems occur, as they do in the markets for a variety of reasons, that gives them the choice where they scale down, how they scale down and to where they move.  Within the last week we have seen that happen in a major multinational in this country which scaled down 150 jobs and we will see more of that.  They are not here in our interests, although I am not saying they are against our interests but they are here to avail of the best profit making climate for their shareholders.  As long as we fit that bill we will have the benefit of their investment. For that reason we must maintain the strict fiscal aggregates in relation to <Col N="1327" /> low inflation, low interest rates and low or moderate wage rates.  If we depart from that, they will have left our shores before we even know they are on the way out.</P>
    <P>However, there is one element that cannot depart because it is part of what we are, and that is our indigenous food sector.  I would like to see a more vigorous marketing plan focused on this uniquely important sector in our economy, the food sector.  Whether the resources are in fisheries or the agricultural base, let us face the fact that our marketing in this area is deplorably inadequate.  No matter what you would do at any one time it is still inadequate.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the quality of our environment, of our soil, of our product and the perception of Ireland and its produce, we should have a vigorous marketing programme in every part of the world that cannot produce the quality natural food that we can.  That means a greater degree of concentration on research, food packaging, presentation, consumer satisfaction and quality, which is of paramount importance.  I would like to see much greater targeting of this.</P>
    <P>I take it that what the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have said is factual.  The second stage is to prioritise the bases for our economic development in the next decade.  Enterprise promotion should be encouraged through a reduction of penal tax and PRSI levels.  There should be a focus on the application of knowledge at primary, second and third level so that investors will know that we have the skill and knowledge to deal with their investment. Finally, there should be a focus on indigenous resources because in the final analysis home investment is the most secure investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to use my time in as valuable a way as I can.  I have five concrete suggestions to make.  I make them on the assumption that while the broad thrust of the plan is unlikely to change, I assume there is flexibility in terms of the balance between different spending areas and the exact focus given <Col N="1328" /> to particular initiatives.  I understand from the Minister for Finance, and was pleased to hear him confirm this point, and that there is an opportunity to adjust the plan.</P>
      <P>Before developing the five concrete suggestions I have to make, let me speak on matters of a more general kind.  I believe that the overall balance of this plan is just about right.  The three big spending areas are infrastructure, which refers mainly to transport, human resources, which is mainly concerned with education and training, and industry support.  The priorities established by these spending areas are broadly correct. Within these three broad headings, however, I believe that there is a need to move what I may term a few chairs around.  Senator Farrelly questioned whether all this complied with the recommendations of the Culliton report.  I believe that it does.  It was interesting that Senator O'Kennedy referred to the solid foundation of this plan and suggested that it is probably more important than the last plan, in which he was involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the increased social thrust that this plan contains in comparison to its predecessor.  There is a temptation, and I personally have been guilty of this in the past, to put social problems on the back burner, to concentrate on getting the economy right first and then to address social problems.  However, to take that approach is to forget, I suggest, the kind of social disadvantage that has increased so much in the past 20 years and that is now such a serious part of our economic problem, namely unemployment. It is an enormous inhibiting force in our economy, running at a rate of approximately 20 per cent nationally. Even worse is the fact that in some areas, and I know them in the Dublin area quite well, there are much higher levels of unemployment; in places unemployment is the norm, not the exception.  This creates a culture that we must break out of and we cannot delay that task any longer.  We must concentrate at once on these unemployment black spots and <Col N="1329" /> immediately implement remedies with a precise local focus.</P>
    <P>The problem of unemployment has been a feature for so long that there are some families where unemployment is running into the second generation.  We must recognise that young people from these families enter the education system with a serious disadvantage and that equality in education is insufficient for these children to get a fair crack of the whip.  They need extra care and extra provision if they are not to emerge from the education system even further behind than they are at present.</P>
    <P>Apart from the human side of this, there is an economic side.  These people are valuable natural resources and this country must ensure that they be given the chance to develop to the full.  Therefore I welcome the emphasis on tackling this disadvantage, which is an obvious feature of this plan.</P>
    <P>Turning to my five suggestions, the first is that we should consider front ending the spending on the roads and ports problem. What do I mean by this?  I believe we are correct to continue spending money on roads and ports.  It is crucial to our ability to deliver our goods into our international markets.  However, instead of spreading the spending over five years we should consider spending most of this money up front in the first two years.  The roads programme should be accelerated. The benefits from this would be substantial. Once the road and port improvements are in place they will start delivering real value to the economy immediately.  Improved roads and ports are an essential way for us to compete in a better manner.  These improvements are the way in which we compensate for our peripheral situation in Europe.  There is no reason for prolonging the programme; I suggest we should turbo charge it immediately.  This would also mean that we would create temporary jobs faster and get that boost into the economy while waiting for the world economy to recover.  Spending on construction translates quickly into jobs and the resulting wages hurtle through the economy.  This is one of the few ways <Col N="1330" /> that we can increase economic activity without depending on outside market forces.  Let us take that opportunity now by accelerating the programme for roads and ports, putting it into the first two years rather than spreading it over the full five years.</P>
    <P>My second suggestion is that we should provide more external investment in the telecommunications programme.  Under the existing proposal only a tiny proportion of the £850 million investment in telecommunications will derive from the Structural Funds.  That is all wrong. Keeping abreast of changes in telecommunications is critical to our future. Telecommunications at the end of the century will be radically different from what we see now.  We are on the brink of another wave of technological innovation. We need to be in the forefront of this because superior telecommunications are the best way of overcoming our geographic disadvantage.  Change in this field takes place at a rapid pace.  I was chairman of An Post in the mid-1980s when we were considering developments such as electronic mail.  Suddenly, within 12 months, the fax machine appeared and within a further 12 months all of us were using them.  This illustrates the speed at which developments take place.  Within 12 months there will be further changes. I refer to the multi-media link up that is appearing in the USA and which will affect the way we all operate within a couple of years.</P>
    <P>To expect the bulk of the investment that is necessary for such developments to be funded internally is not, I suggest, the way to proceed.  This puts the burden on the very customers who use the system.  Keeping prices high will slow down our transition to a telecommunications society that we need to reach quickly.  This is exactly where we should be investing European and State money, investing in a fundamental resource that will continue to provide a return over a whole generation.  Telecom Éireann does not have many friends at the moment because of what I call the horse's collar they made of the rebalancing <Col N="1331" /> of their charges.  This should not blind us to the fact that it is foolish in the extreme to expect the public to pay for this investment over the next five years. It is precisely the kind of investment for which the Structural Funds exist.</P>
    <P>The third point, which the Minister will like, is that we need to face up to the east-west regional problem that is now emerging.  There is a great deal of talk about regional development in the plan but I do not detect any real awareness of the seriousness of the divide now opening up between the east and west of the country. The writing is on the wall for us all to see.  We have no excuse for not taking action now.  The truth is that even after we have improved the road system the west is going to become less and less attractive as an industrial location, particularly to overseas investors.  We can already see that the balance has shifted to the eastern seaboard.</P>
    <P>Four or five weeks ago I was in Dundalk at the opening of the new Heinz factory.  It is a marvellous factory and investment.  It is in Dundalk because it is close to Larne.  Dr. Tony O'Reilly said this at the opening.  The dependence on Larne is a scandal in itself.  The logic of industrial location is tipping all the time and will continue to tip towards the east and those east coast ports from Larne to Rosslare.  The east has other facilities which add to its attractiveness to industry. It has a higher density of third-level educational establishments.</P>
    <P>If we are realistic and clear sighted we should acknowledge that an east-west divide is already emerging and ask what we can do about it.  We must continue trying to industrialise the west.  I do not suggest by any means that because the odds are against it we should weaken our resolve in that direction.  We must continue to develop its transport infrastructure. We must also consciously and very deliberately give precedence to the west in those areas of the economy in which it is not disadvantaged.  Those areas are, essentially, tourism and services. We should invest heavily to attract <Col N="1332" /> tourism to the west.  Too much of our tourism business centres on Dublin.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan proposes a £50 million investment in a conference centre in Dublin.  This should be situated in the west.  I believe it should be located in the Limerick-Shannon area, even if the back up facilities to make it viable cost £100 million.  We have been successful in attracting conferences to Ireland.  The part of Ireland which Europeans, in particular, want to visit is not the east coast but the west.  We should invest heavily in attracting conferences. This area already has an infrastructure which can be developed.</P>
    <P>We should also make the west the nation's centre for industrial services such as remote data processing and telemarketing. Big developments are taking place in such services.  These are businesses which can be located anywhere, particularly where there is a good telecommunications system.  Such businesses are being located all around the country. As a matter of deliberate national policy we should say that if such services are to receive State help they should be located west of the Shannon.  I would like to see Shannon become the national focus for more sophisticated international services, with other service industries spread out all over the west.  We need positive discrimination in recognition of the fact that increasingly that part of the country is losing out as an industrial location.</P>
    <P>Let us use the opportunity that exists for decentralising some Government Departments and agencies.  We have never taken decentralisation seriously.  It has just been a political play thing.  Let us rediscover a more dynamic version of it as a central part of a strategy to address the east-west divide.  The first Department I can think of which should be decentralised to the west is the Meteorological Service because, as far as I can see, the west has the best weather.</P>
    <P>I will remind the House of my first three suggestions.  The first was to frontend the spending, the second related to telecommunications and the third related to the east-west balance.  My fourth suggestion is to sharpen the focus so that <Col N="1333" /> we are educating for change.  There is provision in this plan for a vast amount of spending on education and training and I welcome this.  This emphasis has also been greeted with a certain amount of cynicism.  Someone even pointed out that we are planning to train more people than are at present in our workforce, I do not know how accurate this is.  We need to sharpen the focus in this area. We should not be shovelling money at education just because education is a good thing or because we want to make our workforce more skilled in vague or in general terms.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about our need, which is very precise, to educate and train people for a world in which we will be challenged by change on a totally unprecedented scale.  I was interested to hear Senator O'Kennedy talk in similar terms. We need to become more adaptable and flexible and to strike a mortal blow at the traditions and culture that have made us, as a nation, averse to change and risk.</P>
    <P>At the end of a battle in, I think, 1888 during the war in the Sudan between the British and the Dervishes, 11,000 Dervishes had been killed.  Deaths on the British side amounted to 20.  The reason was that the British had obtained a new fangled gun, called a machine gun, so that they could wipe out the thousands of attacking troops who had to stop each time to reload.  In that year the world of warfare changed.  Anybody who thought they had everything planned right up to that year had to adjust to that change or they had no opportunity in the future.</P>
    <P>I talked earlier about fax machines. Look at what is happening now in marketing, telemarketing, retailing and in so many areas.  Change is occurring dramatically.  We are seeing that sea change occur at this moment and it gives us opportunities we must be willing to take.  We need to equip, particularly but not exclusively, our young people to survive and thrive in the new world we are about to experience.  We should be investing in flexibility and adaptability and not get carried away with the need for particular skills which may be out of date even before we get to the end of <Col N="1334" /> this five year programme.  If we lose the central urgency of that focus on change we will lose this opportunity and will, I suggest, fail our people.</P>
    <P>My fifth and final suggestion is that in supporting industry we should target our investment where it can make a real difference instead of spreading it too thinly across a range of areas.  In the industrial part of this plan, in particular, I detect a tendency to support too many things at too low a level of support to make a real, decisive difference.  Nothing that is being supported is unworthy of support, but that is not the issue.  The issue is that there is a bigger danger we will not make any major breakthrough because we have not thought big enough.  We need to use a rifle &mdash; which brings us back to the Dervishes &mdash; rather than a shotgun or a blunderbuss which we are probably using here.  I can understand why this is so.  We are investing our resources all over the place.  What really counts?  Where would a massive investment produce a massive pay out?  I see a policy of spreading our eggs around too many baskets and I want to risk putting in for a much smaller number of baskets.</P>
    <P>If we go to the heart of what will create jobs, and just as important, what will preserve jobs, we should arrive quickly at the realisation that here the issue, as with the last one, is change.  Companies fail because they do not adapt to changes. They go on producing products on which the tide has already gone out because cost structures or technology have changed or something has made a new leap which changes the very name of the game.  It is happening all the time in business.</P>
    <P>If we want to create and sustain large numbers of jobs we must dramatically increase the capability of Irish industry to respond effectively to the changes taking place in the world.  How do we go about doing that?  The key is what we invest in research and development.  R and D is the way to cope with change.  The more one invests in research and development, the better equipped one's company is and the better equipped the economy is to ride the wave of change instead of being wiped out by it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1335" /> This plan aims by 1999 to have increased the total national spend, including that from business, by £100 million a year.  Frankly, I am not impressed by that.  It is an improvement but it is not enough to make a dramatic difference.  We still have not got the message that we are way behind on R and D spending.  We are still way behind what other small countries spend and that kind of investment will still leave us playing catch-up at the end of those five years. We should be planning to increase the R and D spend by a much greater amount and to bring it up to speed much faster than we have planned.</P>
    <P>We should select a small number of areas such as R and D and invest massively this £3 billion provided for industry. That is the way we will make a real impact over a short time scale.  If we do not take that selective approach we will get to the end of this plan just as we got to the end of the last one and we will have no answer when somebody asks if it really made a decisive difference.  We will not be too sure.</P>
    <P>Let us use this money to make one big difference, not many little ones.  Let us be bold and courageous with this plan. We have an historic opportunity now to change the direction of our future.  I hope we can take it.</P>

      <P>This plan is not about how we intend to use EC money to bridge the gap which exists between our standard of living and that of the rest of the EC.  It is primarily a blueprint for the way we want this country to develop and change.  It is about how we see ourselves, not only in five or six years' time but in 15, 25 or 26 years' time.  This is our opportunity to set our country on a path of progress. I welcome Senator Quinn's constructive comments and I am particularly interested in his suggestion that the major conference centre should be located in the midwest area.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, will join us in promoting this at every opportunity because we in the midwest would be well <Col N="1336" /> able to rise to the opportunity if it came about.</P>
      <P>The opportunities are there for us but we must have the courage to take on the challenge.  We have to take this opportunity to maximise the results.  There is a great tendency among all of us to sit back and criticise and say we should have done this, it should have been £8.8 billion or £10.2 billion.  It is easy to make such criticisms without suggesting alternative programmes.  Senator Farrelly is not here to defend himself but his contribution was entirely negative.  He constantly criticised and made no attempt to suggest any alternative to the proposals contained in the National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind Senators that the National Development Plan is only one part of a national strategy, as the Minister emphasised.  We have much to do ourselves internally.  There are changes which we must make ourselves and which we do not need any assistance from Brussels to undertake.  Essentially, we are setting out in this plan the programmes which we require assistance from the EC to implement.  That is why there is, for example, no mention in the plan of the great changes taking place in education.  The Minister for Education has realised that there is no point in throwing money at education &mdash; it must be targeted.  That is why money is being spent on helping schools in disadvantaged areas to overcome their problems.  There is no mention of that in this plan but that does not mean that it is not an aim of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This plan highlights the proper development of skills as the key to our success.  Ireland's future prosperity will rest on a highly educated and skilled workforce, which must also be highly adaptable and versatile.  The future prosperity of firms, communities and entire regions is determined by the skills and motivation of our workforce.  It is important that we stress that motivation is as important as skills.  We must develop a culture which encourages people to grasp the opportunities which are there.  We have one of the youngest workforces in the European Community.  That is one <Col N="1337" /> of our greatest assets and if we do not turn it to our benefit we will pay the price for generations to come.</P>
    <P>This plan recognises the need for skilled personnel but there is also, perhaps for the first time, the recognition that the Government must intervene to ensure that the marginalised and disadvantaged are also given opportunities to attain skills.  It was pointed out that unemployment in some areas is into the second generation.  I would say that in some areas there is a third and fourth generation of unemployed people.  For whole communities, our present educational structures &mdash; the leaving certificate, for example &mdash; do not mean very much.  That is why we welcome the innovative vocational leaving certificate which ensures that from now on children can be examined in a range of practical as well as written subjects.  There will be an opportunity for people in disadvantaged areas to become part of our education system.  We have 67,000 school leavers annually.  We must ensure that each school leaver is fully equipped to enter the workforce when work becomes available.</P>
    <P>A 1991 Labour Court survey showed that 75 per cent of those who were unemployed did not have the leaving certificate. Forty per cent of those who are currently unemployed do not have second level education.  Therefore, I welcome the commitment in this plan to make educational facilities available to people in areas where this is prevalent.</P>
    <P>The IRDAC report has underlined that in the future there will be a demand for more skilled workers and that our present unskilled or under-skilled workers will be unemployed.  We must ensure that our present under-skilled workforce are given an opportunity to update their skills through in-service training.  As Senator Quinn stated, technological changes are taking place and we need to be ahead of the posse instead of ten years behind.  We should identify changes and adapt our workforce by providing necessary training so that they can keep abreast of technological changes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1338" /> The same report identified that future needs will not be for workers who are not skilled in one particular area but for multi-skilled workers and that the emphasis will change from manufacturing to service industries.  Our workforce must be equipped to deal with the change from blue collar to white collar jobs.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report identifies the differences in skills between firms in Ireland and our competitors abroad.  We should emphasise the need for research and development not in a particular industry, although this is necessary, but in relation to developments abroad.  We must be aware of the changes which are taking place in companies abroad and what they require.  For example, in most companies quality assurance is done when the goods come through the factory gates.  Many companies, particularly large German companies, are now adopting a system where, instead of waiting for the product to come into their factory, they send personnel to the suppliers to test the product and see how it is produced.  If one wanted to supply a product to Mr. Robert Bosch, a German manufacturer of automobile parts, Mr. Bosch would send someone to scrutinise the company's standards and, if one is not aware of the standards required by the large companies, the product will not be considered.  One does not get a chance to tender for a product if it does not meet the required standard. It is important to be aware of the standards required by large firms abroad.</P>
    <P>This will create difficulties for small indigenous firms because few will have the resources to employ people who are sufficiently skilled to study the required standards abroad.  In this context I would like Forbairt to play a major role, in conjunction with Eolas, in providing scientific and technological backup to small indigenous manufacturing firms. This is necessary if we are to study the technological advances and the standards required abroad.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn was correct when he said there is no point training personnel in one particular skill because by the time the person is trained, the skill will not <Col N="1339" /> be required.  FÁS has a specific skills training programme which identifies the skills required by industry.  This is done by monitoring and liaising with companies. In this way industry's training needs are identified and relevant courses are supplied.  Some 70 per cent of those who availed of these courses have been placed in local industries and this indicates the success of the programme.  This is an area which should be encouraged and developed.  Training has been provided as a result of co-operation between companies and FÁS.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the commitment in this plan to use CERT to train approximately 2,000 people each year so that they may take their place in the tourist industry. This plan relies on the development of our tourist industry and there is no point providing heritage centres and facilities if people are not available to work in them.  Continentals appreciate information written in their own language and meeting people who speak their language. I welcome the commitment in this plan to advance training for people in the tourist industry and, in particular, in the marketing and language areas.</P>
    <P>One advantage of our link with Europe is that a number of our young people will be free to accept employment abroad. Greater emphasis should be placed on training our young people to converse and do business in the language of the country to which they are going. However, there is one part of this plan which should have been reversed.  A number of young people are already working in continental countries, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran.  Most of these people, are between the ages of 25 and 35 and have developed skills and abilities abroad which could be used at home.  It is to our shame that we have no record of how many young people have emigrated, what they are doing and how best we could use that resource which we, as taxpayers, have funded but have been unable to use at home.  Greater effort should be made to find out who these young people are, where they are, what they have learned abroad, and how best <Col N="1340" /> we could use those skills.  If and when there is an improvement in our economy, many of those young people will be anxious to return home.  They may have married and settled down abroad but the yearning for home is still felt by most of our emigrants, and it is a resource we are not tapping into sufficiently.  We do not use our emigrants as a marketing force abroad.  We do not keep sufficient contact to encourage them to buy Irish products, and that is one gap in the plan which I would like to have seen addressed.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the emphasis on local and community development, particularly the community enterprise boards. This is a step in the right direction when trying to harness local development. However, some areas have been so drained of talent that the initiative is no longer there.  If too many young, bright, innovative people are taken out of an area, it is robbed of its life's blood and the area cannot be expected to rejuvenate itself.  We need to identify the areas where initiative is weak and special help will be needed to encourage people to get up and go.</P>
    <P>One would be surprised at the areas that applied for and were successful in getting funding under the Leader programme. They were often not the areas that needed it most but the areas that were best equipped to capitalise on the funds.  The better equipped the area was, the more it made use of the resources. However, there are areas where that initiative is missing and will continue to be missing unless the areas are identified, given resources and helped to develop and put them on a par with areas that are capable of doing things for themselves.</P>
    <P>This plan is building on the success of the last round of Structural Funds which raised our GDP <i>per capita</i> from 62 per cent of the EC average in 1988 to an estimated 73 per cent in 1993.  We were so successful that we nearly talked ourselves out of this current round of funds by being almost outside the limit.  This plan builds on the strengths already there.  I welcome the approach in this plan to help the disadvantaged by identifying the need <Col N="1341" /> for greater emphasis on training and education.</P>
    <P>Much more needs to be done.  We need to broaden our tax base so that the burden on the PAYE sector can be reduced.  However, broadening the base means that somebody else will have to pay, and if that happens, there will be grousing and cribbing.  The statistics speak for themselves.  The PAYE sector is carrying far too much of the burden already.</P>
    <P>This is something we can tackle ourselves; we do not need help from the EC to implement that kind of project.  It will not be easy because people will not be happy if they are asked to pay more. Those working and with good jobs should not begrudge help to those who are not working and are disadvantaged.  We have to share and share alike.  This plan is not just for the wealthy but has to be shared among rich and poor to raise everybody's living standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the national plan.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fitzgerald, came here before the drafting of this plan and we had the opportunity to say what we would like to see included in this plan.  At that time I highlighted the needs in the county roads structure.  As I said on that occasion, county roads, potholes and so on have become a national joke; potholes were always the butt of media jokes.  It is now recognised, even in this plan, that the county road system is an important link for industry, agriculture, tourism and the natural development of any rural area.  Where countries are being developed, one of the first things done is to create a road system and, in many cases, a rail system.  In latter years we were drawing up plans, spending money, talking about creating jobs in tourism <Col N="1342" /> and so on, but nothing was done for the county road systems and the railways.</P>
      <P>It is not surprising to hear that it now takes about six or six and a half hours to travel from Sligo to Dublin by train &mdash; that happened no later than Sunday night, yet 50 years ago on the same journey, one would have reached Dublin at least two hours earlier.  That is an example of how we have handled our resources and funding.</P>
      <P>The plan's strategy is good provided there is a genuine approach and it is not seen to place demands on the ongoing resources, expenses and expenditure of the national Government.  If that is the case let the Government say so or if it is a new approach or a transformation, which is the in word at present.  It certainly was a transformation in the history of this State when the President of the European Commission used a particular word today.  It is not as yet clear what he was trying to say but it is not a word one likes to hear in relation to any country or any politicians.  Perhaps we will know before the end of the week who, if anybody, was actually telling the big &ldquo;L&rdquo;. That is as far as I will go, I do not want to get involved in this discussion.</P>
      <P>I hope we will get our fair share of the funds.  That is all we will get; it is all we ever got.  Many people in this country believe we got little funding from Europe, although so far we have received about £15 million.  Most people would not believe that and would ask where did it go because they did not see it.  They may see the odd sign that a certain bypass or water scheme was funded by the EC, but generally people would not believe that £15 million has come into this country. Now we are arguing about £8 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who started that argument were members of this and the last Government.  They set the headlines. They set themselves up as supermen implying that but for them this country would not get the money.  I accept that there was a general election involving the formation of a government and that people play politics but, if they are caught out, the Opposition is blamed.  The term &ldquo;trying to undermine the Government&rdquo;<Col N="1343" /> is used, yet if they go out and undermine the system and our image abroad by taking figures out of the sky &mdash; perhaps to suit the political moment or their survival as politicians &mdash; that is not undermining anything, that is in the national interest.</P>
    <P>If a problem arises the Opposition comments as it should.  We hear criticism daily that the Opposition is not functioning properly yet as soon as it starts to function it is told it is undermining the Government and the nation.  This is, I hope, a lesson to politicians at national level when they go abroad and represent this country to seek what they are due as members of the EC.  That is all we will get when all is said and done.  If there is trouble with the present round of Structural Funding and the national plan, it has nothing to do with the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the Dublin-Sligo railway line earlier.  In the plan funding will be available for that line.  That funding should be forthcoming immediately because the line is currently carrying 30 year old engines and cannot carry extra coaches.  The line travels across the midlands into the west servicing areas such as Roscommon, Sligo and Donegal.  It is a huge area and if we are serious about getting tourists into these areas and maintaining the normal structures there, it is important that the money allocated is spent immediately.  Senator Quinn said how important it was to immediately spend the allocated funding on roads; the same should hold true with regard to the railways.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the county enterprise boards.  I had experience in this area when I was a member of the regional development organisation.  There were many good ideas and proposals put forward at that time but funding was not available and eventually the rural organisations were disbanded.  That created a vacuum in the regions for development at that level.  It has always been a source of complaint and friction that people were obliged to visit Dublin and the various Departments to discuss development. This structure with funding at <Col N="1344" /> county level gives people an opportunity to initiate development at that level.  I hope the county enterprise boards will encourage local groups and industries. However, I have one reservation.  I am a member of one of those boards and, to a certain extent, there is confusion with the old county development boards.  I foresee initial problems but with good will and effort they can be sorted out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my gratitude to Senator Belton for giving me the opportunity to say a few words this evening because I will not be able to contribute tomorrow as I will be in Belfast.</P>
      <P>May I say in passing that there is so much agony about £500 million that I wonder in what context this places the substance of the Hume-Adams talks and the possibility that we may face a referendum to create a unified Ireland.  I understand the minimum cost of that to the Irish Exchequer would be £3 billion per annum.  If this referendum goes through, I will found a movement called the &ldquo;Troops In Movement&rdquo; so that British troops can be employed to defend the Borders.  I do not believe the Irish taxpayer will be happy, at least in the present economic climate, to maintain the people north of the Border in the luxury to which the British taxpayers have unwisely accustomed them.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment briefly on the comments made by Mr. Delors.  I believe he was misunderstood when he used the word &ldquo;liar&rdquo;.  I understand his Gallic temperament and I think he is a friend of Ireland.  He intervened when Bruce Millan was taking a strict accounting point of view with regard to the Structural Funds.  The difficulty is a political one in that the Government clearly and specifically nailed their colours to the figure of £8 billion.  To people like myself and to the vast majority of Irish people, anything over a couple of hundred pounds is an abstract notion.  However, the figure of £8 billion is imprinted so that expectations have been raised.  If people are disappointed a difficult political situation will ensue due to this clawback.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1345" /> I wholeheartedly support the Government and I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste on the work they did in apparently achieving that figure.  Unaccustomedly I must also say I was struck with admiration for the footwork of our Commissioner, Mr. Flynn, listening to the wireless a few minutes ago.  He has managed to use an obscure regulation of the Community, Regulation 4, to postpone the decision until tomorrow, so there is still room for manoeuvre.  It is possible, taking into account the way in which these figures are arrived at and the notion of a range of figures with a low, intermediate and a high range that we may &mdash; if we are lucky and use the skills of our effective people in Brussels - come out with a figure of £8 billion.  I hope we get as much as possible.  I do not mind the notion of the begging bowl and if we can get anything put into our begging bowl, particularly with our unemployment problems, we should use it as much as possible.</P>
    <P>The problem is what we do with the money.  I notice from the reaction in the press there is a lot of scepticism about the capacity to create jobs.  This is one of the fundamental problems we are attacking with this plan.  Looking at the Government's targets, they have four points.  One is direct investment in key sectors with long term job potential, investment in infrastructure.  Some American friends recently, when driving around the country, saw the signs indicating various road or bridge projects funded by EC money.  Then there is investment in education which I fully welcome in order to raise productivity and growth capacity particularly when it is targeted at third level &mdash; I would talk for half an hour on that if I had the time. Finally, there are the special area developments with programmes for unemployment black spots.</P>
    <P>The problem with this is highlighted in an article by Dr. Dan McLaughlin in the <i>Irish Press</i> of Tuesday, 12 October, 1993 where he talks about the plan as &ldquo;an agenda for despair.&rdquo;  That may be an extreme view of it but every article, including the leading articles, questions <Col N="1346" /> how significant the impact on employment will be.  Dr. McLaughlin asks the question: &ldquo;How does this total capital expenditure affect the economy?&rdquo;  He answers in two ways:</P>
    <P>The nature of such expenditure is designed to increase the supply potential of the economy ... spending on education, training and infrastructure should allow the economy more readily to produce additional output if demand increases ... the additional spending directly increases demand anyway. The plan ... tentatively assumes net job growth outside agriculture of 12,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>This scales down to 10,000 per year. When one looks at the increase in the potentially employable people and works out the figures one realises how critical the situation is.  We have 25,000 people coming onto the job market per annum and the figures are astonishing if they are projected into 1999, the end of the plan. There would be 90,000 more people unemployed even by the Governments own figures by 1999.  That would make a total of 390,000 people unemployed.  We must look at the basis of this and see how it can be addressed not just by pouring money in but by looking at the entrepreneurial skills in areas such as tourism or horticulture.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I did not have more time but I am grateful for the time I got.  I wish the Government well and at least they have until tomorrow.  I hope their skilful negotiators will manage to pull off the result we all require.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this important development and I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This is an opportunity that no Member should be careless about.  We all have a contribution to make and we should have an opportunity to express our views on the National Development Plan.  I hope my few words will be positive although I have my concerns about the implementation of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> There is a lot of concern in the county I represent, enough to merit the headline of the <i>Derry Journal</i> of 24 August, 1993 which read &ldquo;Donegal Projects Overlooked&rdquo;. In the article a former member of the other House, Mr. Hugh Conaghan, made this point.  Perhaps more seriously, a Member of this House is cited in the <i>Donegal People's Press</i> of 17 October, 1993 under the headline &ldquo;North-East Donegal Neglected In National Plan Claims Labour Senator.&rdquo;  I hope to be constructive and I welcome the plan and that a lot of money will be provided by the State, the taxpayer and by the EC.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that more emphasis is not placed on the Border regions.  Our difficulties there merit discussion.  Many people are concerned about the Border and think that if we could get rid of the difficulties there this country would be fantastic.  They encourage the paramilitaries to cease their operations and get together to develop the economy.  We are not demonstrating that, even now when we have funds available.</P>
    <P>I do not have to run to the newspaper because when the <i>Donegal People's Press</i> contacted me I welcomed the plan, as did the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Gallagher and Deputy Coughlan. We were and still are positive about our attitude to the National Development Plan.  If there is no plan or funding then we have no chance.  The implementation of this plan is vital for County Donegal.  We do not need to emphasise how peripheral we are.  We stand on the edge of Europe.</P>
    <P>Around £1.2 billion was spent in developing natural gas and that puts the whole of the west of Ireland at a disadvantage for generations to come.  No industrialist coming to the country could consider anywhere in the west against an area where there is a stable and cheap source of energy.  Any foreign industrialist looking to see where he could set up could not consider anywhere in the west.  This was borne out recently when there were serious problems in the Shannon and Limerick areas and there was <Col N="1348" /> concern about the Shannon stopover. <i>The Irish Times</i> of Saturday, 24 July 1993 stated:</P>
    <P>The Government has decided on a major expansion of the natural gas grid to the Shannon Industrial Estate, one of the largest concentrations of factories in the State.  Bord Gáis yesterday confirmed to the Irish Times that it proposed to extend the network to include &ldquo;this major industrial centre&rdquo;. Work on the £5 million project will begin in 1994.</P>
    <P>If we had any doubt as to the value of developing the natural gas grid that is proof beyond doubt.  The whole of the west is put at an all time disadvantage.  I will give all this information to the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is right and proper to express our concern about the implementation of the plan.  We look first at the expenditure of £1.2 billion in developing natural gas and secondly at where the major funding is going under this National Plan.  The Dublin-Dundalk-Belfast road and rail systems will take roughly £1 billion. Dublin transport, necessary as it is, will take another £1 billion for rail or other developments.  There is port and harbour development from which the west will not benefit.  There is no counterbalance of funding going to the west.</P>
    <P>I welcome Senator Quinn's contribution. He mentioned high unemployment in the Dublin area.  The reason is that the youth of the nation has been forced out of the west to live in this city in the hope of getting jobs.  If we do not address these problems during the period of this plan we will not have another opportunity within the lifetime of these young people.</P>

    <Title>Oireachtas Research Facilities: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann deplores the lack of research facilities necessary to enable the Oireachtas discharge its responsibilities effectively; and calls on the Government to make a specific budgetary allocation for the resources required to permit the Oireachtas play its proper role in policy making.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  This motion may appear academic but it concerns one of the most important issues Government has to confront, although it may lack electoral appeal.  The quality of our decision making is one of the key factors determining the performance of Ireland and the mechanisms in the Oireachtas concerning the contributions of backbenchers leave much to be desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down the motion because many people have asked me what use the Seanad has in policy making.  I have said it is virtually no use.  I qualified that by saying the Dáil also is of virtually no use in that respect.  I say that with regret but it is difficult to think of any major changes <Col N="1350" /> in legislation or policy that have arisen as a result of contributions from the Dáil or Seanad in recent times.  This is particularly true in social and economic policy, which is the subject of much legislation. Individual Members exert influence through party channels, representations, etc. but the Dáil and Seanad as Houses of the Oireachtas make singularly little difference to policy formulation.</P>
    <P>There is a view among political scientists that Deputies and Senators are little more than glorified messenger boys whose function is as mediators between the public and real decision makers in Government.  There is some truth in that. I do not decry that role, it is an important one and historically it has been played effectively.  It is the human face of legislation in many ways and that is important for the legitimacy of parliamentary institutions. A cynic might scoff that it is much the safest activity for ordinary Members of the Oireachtas and if they were able to turn their minds to policy making the results might not be an unmixed blessing.  That would be an unduly cynical approach to take at present, whatever about the past.  The present Oireachtas is by far the best educated we have ever had and we are going further in that direction.</P>
    <P>If Members want to contribute to policy making, what resources are at their disposal to enable them to contribute effectively?  The resources available within the Oireachtas are grossly inadequate. Members can only contribute effectively if they can process the flow of information available on policy making issues.</P>
    <P>The relative positions of Members of the Oireachtas and other contributors to the policy formulation process within society have changed dramatically to the great disadvantage of the Oireachtas in the last generation, perhaps the last decade.  Twenty years ago there was nothing like the number of outside bodies, whether consultants, statutory bodies, or pressure groups of employers, trade unions, farmers and others, with relatively well-resourced research support. The supply of information coming <Col N="1351" /> to Oireachtas members is almost entirely from outside.  We are passive recipients of information generated elsewhere in accordance with the agendas of those bodies.  We are in no position to process the information in a consistent, systematic or sustained way.  That is widely recognised and is not an exaggeration.</P>
    <P>This point struck me forcefully during the debate on the Statistics Bill in this House on 16 June.  It was a perfectly sensible Bill which contained reference to the regular contact between the director of the Central Statistics Office and users of statistics such as Government Departments, the EC and research bodies.  Those were mentioned, among others.  One would have hoped Members of the Oireachtas would have been thought of as potential users of CSO material but they were unmentioned.  It occurred neither to the drafters of the legislation nor anyone else that the Oireachtas might be a significant user of that information.  It was a revealing and realistic oversight because the Oireachtas is not in a position to be an informed user of the body of statistics on which so much policy has to be based.</P>
    <P>We are inundated with documentation, reports and statistics.  Those statistics come predominantly in the form of supporting data for arguments advanced by reports, whether from commissions, Government Departments, public or private vested interests.  Virtually no &ldquo;uncontaminated&rdquo; data comes to these Houses; it all comes as partisan evidence in support of an argument.  The arguments may be good or bad but the information we receive has been packaged for various purposes and little of it has been designed to enable us &mdash; there is no reason why it should &mdash; to influence policy effectively.</P>
    <P>This has been compounded by EC membership which has exposed us to another flood of information we are cannot effectively process.  There are any number of OECD reports.  We are asked to look not only at Irish statistics but to put them in comparative perspective. Whatever chance we have of understanding <Col N="1352" /> something about our country, trying to assess how that data is used comparatively is understandably beyond the time, capacity and resources of nearly every Member of the Oireachtas.  We are more and more at the mercy of the interpretations put on the data by whoever the policy makers of the moment may be.</P>
    <P>That is also the case with the media.  If we look at the role of the media 20-25 years ago compared to today, it was nowhere as influential in terms of processing material and delivering opinions which are picked up by Members of the Oireachtas and then, in a sense, domesticated into their own opinions where these suffice.  In other words, the sources of information have expanded greatly outside.  The research resources at the disposal of a whole range of bodies seeking to influence policy have expanded greatly while the resources at the disposal of the Oireachtas, as far as I can see, have remained static for the last 20 years. There is perhaps an extra body here or there, such as an analyst or a consultant, in the committees but it falls far short of what is required for the effective discharge of the role of policy makers or even of having a marginal influence on policy.  I am not deluding myself that the Oireachtas will ever become the chief policy maker, but it could have a significant role to play in policy making which it does not have at present.</P>
    <P>I will give a couple of examples of what I have in mind about assumptions pervading reports which then tend to become conventional wisdom.  I will take examples that are well known and, I hope, uncontroversial.  The Culliton report has been cited not infrequently in the last couple of years in this Chamber and elsewhere.  One of its sections is cited <i>ad nauseam</i> in the media and frequently by politicans and educationalists. Between 1971 and 1986, the number of accountants more than trebled and the number of auctioneers and lawyers doubled but the number of engineers increased by less than 50 per cent.  This is partly a question of attitudes which needs to be addressed through a new <Col N="1353" /> approach to the system of education and training, especially by raising the status and quality of technical education.</P>
    <P>That is a very well known quotation and is advanced as decisive evidence in favour of the general Culliton thrust that we need to change our education system to make it more orientated towards enterprise and particularly engineering. I am a strong supporter of having the highest quality of technical and technological education possible.  I am, however, highly sceptical of the approach adopted towards the best way of achieving that by most of those talking about it.</P>
    <P>Allow me to examine that quotation. It is meant to imply that the education system, and particularly higher education, is not producing sufficient numbers of engineers compared to the relatively parasitic auctioneers and lawyers. Is that true?  There is nothing in the report about actual output; it is about numbers increasing in Ireland.  It does take the slightest account, therefore, of differential emigration rates which could be considerable between engineers and accountants.  It does not distinguish between different types of engineers &mdash; civil, electrical and mechanical.  Once one begins to decompose this it may not mean what it purports to mean.</P>
    <P>I rang the Higher Education Authority to see if it could provide simple data which could be read in a less obfuscatory form.  Somebody there went to the trouble of digging out and providing me with figures which seemed to say the exact opposite to what Culliton said.  The same qualification would apply to that as would apply to the Culliton report; they were global figures.  It may be that in breaking them down one would find that there was some justification for the line of approach adopted here.  At face value this is simply an assumption masquerading as evidence.</P>
    <P>I would very much like to have in the resources of the Oireachtas research assistants whom one could ask to dig out the correct data.  This would allow one to formulate a response and identify whether the argument is valid or invalid <Col N="1354" /> in that particular context.  No individual will have the time to do that and it ought not to be the function of other bodies around the country to be bothered about providing data for Oireachtas discussions. The sort of research assistant I have in mind would be able to contribute significantly for all Members of the Oireachtas who have questions or suspicions about the use of evidence in these documents.  I am not suggesting that the use of evidence is deliberately misleading. There can also be misuse of evidence by people who do not understand what they are saying, that is a different matter, but in terms of following up use of evidence as conveyed in these reports, simple reports, I am not talking about esoteric peripheral matters; I am talking about reports which influence the agenda of public discussion and which determine the framework within which Members have their assumptions significantly influenced.</P>
    <P>Let me look at the National Development Plan; again I will confine myself to education, and this refers to Culliton in a way.  In talking about the vocational, preparation and training measure, the National Development Plan refers to &ldquo;the need to address the strong criticism of academic bias in educational provision for the 16-19 year age group in the Culliton report and in the OECD 1991 report, reviews of national policy for education. These reports highlight the need for a more balanced education with a strengthened technical vocational dimension within the second level education system.&rdquo;  On the face of it, that seems a very reasonable proposition.  What one would not deduce from that is that the Culliton report on that particular issue has been very seriously challenged by John Sheehan of UCD, among others, in the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> concerned with basic use of data.  It is not a question of ideology or education policy; it is a question of whether the data on which the conclusions are based is valid.</P>
    <P>There are other examples of the way reports, presumed to be evidence, and which we must accept at face value as evidence, are in many cases simply selecting <Col N="1355" /> the type of data, quite arbitrarily, which appear to sustain the pre-existing assumptions of those who present these reports.  The Oireachtas must have some way of submitting questionable data at the behest of individual Members who know something about that subject, and subjecting them to independent scrutiny. This scrutiny would considerably raise the game of those submitting reports to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The range of assumptions which dominates policy-making consensus is very narrow.  Many of them may be right, they may be intelligent, but their conventional wisdom in socio-economic policy is very narrow indeed.  One of the areas from which we should draw ideas is the so-called third strand which has representation on the national, economic and social forum, but which is, itself, grossly under-resourced in terms of research compared with representatives of the other social partners.  If the Oireachtas is anxious to broaden the range of opinion it is getting and which it can try to evaluate, then the Government could do a lot worse than provide research facilities for these grossly under-resourced voluntary community groupings which are now part of the third strand but do not have the resources of the other better-endowed social partners.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Library performs a valiant task in hopeless circumstances.  Its resources have remained static for several years.  The Oireachtas has not kept in step with private organisations and it is now singularly less competent to evaluate policy and participate in policy making than it was ten to 20 years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to second the motion.  It is not surprising that the proposer and seconder are representatives of the university system and both practising academics because, as such, we understand the significance of research in presenting material intelligently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I differ from Senator Lee in describing the Oireachtas as useless.  I do not think the Oireachtas is useless.  I am perhaps less enthusiastic about the Lower House, <Col N="1356" /> but I see a value in this House, a value which is not shared by the Department of Finance because, apart from anything else, I believe our wages are ludicrous. The majority of politicians are too gutless to say we are grossly under-paid for the work we do, especially those who do work and most politicians do.</P>
    <P>I will give a couple of examples because, in a way, I was challenged by Senator Lee to do so.  During my term &mdash; although this is egomaniacal because I can remember my contributions and this is probably true of all Members of Parliament &mdash; I got three and a half pages into a budget in regard to tax incentives for the inner city courtesy of the present Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds.  I was pleased it happened because it had some impact.</P>
    <P>Legislation to change in the law on homosexuality, an important social matter, originated in the Dáil, but there is no doubt that the impetus came from a series of challenging and informed debates which took place in this House. In regard to the Childcare Act, a former Senator, Brendan Ryan, and I got a new section included after it had been passed in the Dáil.  Arguments made in this House resulted in the inclusion of that section.  Children's lives will be saved by that section, yet this was not reported in any newspaper.  Perhaps, if we had a spat on the Order of Business, something like &ldquo;Cathaoirleach chastises Norris&rdquo; would have been reported.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Again.  Luckily I am not a political masochist.  The Seanad played a crucial role in all of these areas.  All Members could list similar examples, it is not a prerogative of the Independent Senators, although we are particularly good.  All sides make valuable and important contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case I lose the run of myself and develop what Professor Mahaffy called verbal diarrhoea, which was occasionally associated with mental constipation, I would like to place on the record details of our conditions of work where we are <Col N="1357" /> supposed to do research.  We are asked to make bricks without straw.  Working conditions are intolerable and so far as the University Senators are concerned, they break the Factory Acts.  We pass legislation relating to the workplace, yet we work in conditions which would not be tolerated on the factory floor.  Although there has been a slight improvement and the Cathaoirleach has been helpful in this regard, I quote from a report by SIPTU about our offices.</P>
    <P>While the office measures approximately 250 square feet, the effective working area is reduced to approximately half this level.  This equates to approximately 60 square feet per person.  Current suggested good practice dictates that this is insufficient. Given the workspace requirements of the office I would be unhappy with less than 100 square feet per person. Basically we have an overcrowding situation.</P>
    <P>The building is a sealed building, with fresh air and heating being provided be means of an air conditioning system.  There appears to be no mechanism for local regulation or control, and on the day of my visit the air quality was very poor.  A floor mounted fan has been introduced some time ago in an attempt to provide air movement. This is totally unsatisfactory, even before the safety implications of such a fixture are considered.</P>
    <P>Although located on the ground floor of the building, there are very low levels of natural light in the office.  The proximity of the windows to street traffic and what would appear to be infrequent cleaning, taken together with the orientation of the building, conspire to ensure a dark location. Vertical blinds are located on the windows, but are inaccessible because of workstation layout.</P>
    <P>Lighting in the office is provided by 12 fluorescent tubes, but it is clear that little thought has been given to either matching or optimizing these fixtures. [As a result of American research there is one which can artificially produce <Col N="1358" /> natural daylight.  We should have this as it would be good for our wellbeing.] The outcome is an oppressive lighting system.</P>
    <P>The floor is covered with carpet strips with nails protruding, and causing a trip hazard, at traffic routes.  The saddle boards are not sloped and also constitute a trip hazard at doorways. Connection wires for phones and fax trail across the floor, again causing a hazard.  In general the approach to wiring is very untidy.  The fan, mentioned earlier, also has a trailing flex.</P>
    <P>Within the small office area there are nine separate phones and unguarded dot matrix printers.  Noise levels can therefore be excessive for office location.  Access/egress is reduced, because of layout, two feet at one point &mdash; again a sign of the overcrowding which exists.</P>
    <P>Significant amounts of paper are kept in the office and inadequate storage facilities appear to exist.  Given the potential resulting fire hazard, it is surprising that no fire extinguisher is available or that no training in dealing with such a situation has taken place.</P>
    <P>To summarise we have a situation of overcrowding, inadequate ventilation, inadequate lighting, excessive noise and a multitude of potential hazards. It is clear that little regard has been paid to the fact that there is a requirement for people to work in those surroundings.</P>
    <P>While on my celebrated trip to Australia, I did some research into their facilities in this regard.  The equivalent of a backbench Senator has not only one office for him or herself, but also has a suite of offices complete with a kitchen, sleeping accommodation, if there are overnight sessions, two secretaries and a computer system where one may pull out information about one's own constituency, other constituencies, voting systems, etc., in other words, information technology is available at one's fingertips.  Research assistants are also available.  What have we got?  We have <Col N="1359" /> none of these things.  We have appalling office conditions.</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator Lee mentioned the Library.  It is an outrage.  It is a nineteenth century mess operated by decent people of extraordinary goodwill and intelligence. I do not know how they manage to extract the kind of information they do from this pile.  They provide a good service but their lives are not made easy by this system.</P>
    <P>As Members of the Oireachtas we are not trained to read legislation.  I believe a crash course for people who are elected for the first time is essential.  Although I do not begrudge Senator Lee or those elected on the NUI panel, I bewail the defeat of Mr. Brendan Ryan because he took this House seriously.  He read legislation in detail and had, over many years, acquired the capacity to understand the specialised language of legislation. Having heard his clear speeches, Members such as myself could parachute into the House and put down intelligent amendments without having read everything in detail or, perhaps, without understanding it.  We get no training or assistance in drafting legislation.  Perhaps there is a money saving element involved because the Government never allows legislation emerge, no matter how sensible, from the Opposition or Independent benches.</P>
    <P>We do not have a proper computer information base.  We should be able to link into and pull out national statistics from our offices and we should have training in this regard.  Perhaps this is available, I know it is available to secretaries, but I do not know it is available for us.  That is the scale of priorities. Secretaries are given training in this regard, but we are either too intelligent or too stupid to be able to use a computer. Unpaid American research assistants are available on a part-time basis.  What they think of the Irish parliamentary system defeats my imagination.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee has put his finger on an important issue.  We are under-resourced, under-serviced and underpaid. In terms of physical access, if one <Col N="1360" /> wants to do research, how does one get in?  I love this place and I come in to my office each day because there is always something to do.  We get an enormous amount of mail each day.  Perhaps it would be a good idea if we had some sort of recycling system because most of this mail is garbage and we could save a few trees.  From 9 p.m. on Friday night to 9 a.m. on Monday one cannot get into one's office.  I have been trusted with a key to my office in Trinity College and I frequently call in at weekends when I have to correct a paper or prepare to travel abroad, yet I am considered untrustworthy with a key to my office here.  That is scandalous.  We should have 24 hour, seven days a week access to our offices.  In other words, things should be made easy.  Investment in such resources would assist us in making the kind of contribution so many others have made in this House over the years without assistance.  I would be happy to defend such expenditure.  I would not be abashed to say we should get more money and resources and that we would do a better job if we were only given the facilities and the capacity.  As an Independent, I can say that without the danger of a public revolt of voters and in any case I do not care.  My voters voted me in because they know I will say precisely what is on my mind.  If they do not like it that is a problem which I am not capable of resolving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;welcomes the commitment of the Government set out, in the &lsquo;broadening our democracy&rsquo; section of the Programme for a Partnership Government to enhancing the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas in the formulation and oversight of public policy; and commends the steps already taken to improve the facilities available to members to enable them to perform their functions more effectively.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> A Chathaoirligh, i dtús báire, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an t-Aire don Teach.  It gives me great pleasure to propose this amendment.  When I came here first in 1982 there were eight of us in one room with one telephone line between us.  Today each Member has a telephone line and an office, or at most two share an office.  In 1982 we had a number of secretaries in one room and none of us knew who our secretary was because we had a typing pool system which was grossly inadequate.  Today everybody has their own secretary, or a secretary works for two Senators.  Marvellous improvements have been made in providing services over the few years I have been in this House.  I have no doubt that in the years ahead and in the life of this Government facilities will be improved.  The Programme for a Partnership Government spells out that facilities will be improved and they are improving at a very fast rate.</P>
    <P>It always amuses me that professors and people of that nature never seem to agree among themselves.  Even on the motion the proposer and seconder could not agree.  It is one of the weaknesses of academics that they always contradict one another whether the discussion is on health boards or engineers.  Whatever the subject, the same applies, even on this simple motion.  The proposer and seconder do not agree among themselves on exactly what they want.  At times Senator Norris could have been speaking to the amendment rather than to the motion.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to hear the Senator talk about training.  Those who came in through local authorities know there is a seminar for new local authority members in almost every county.  Any county that does not run that seminar could do so if it chose because it is available.  It is very valuable.  Some speakers are councillors with 20 or 25 years experience and there are also some professional speakers. It is hard to beat practical experience coming from people who are in there doing the digging.  They know what the field is like to till.</P>
    <P>I do not entirely agree when Senator Norris says that he should have the key to his office 24 hours a day seven days a <Col N="1362" /> week.  This is our national Parliament and it is a high security area.  It would cost a large amount of money to maintain security if people were allowed to come and go.  Members might bring in somebody to help them and this would be a security risk.  Anyone who works here all day from the time the office opens in the morning until the House closes at night has a pretty long day and can do a lot of work.</P>
    <P>I find the Library very efficient.  The staff are very courteous and helpful.  If I do not know exactly what I am looking for but I have a general idea they can dig through the files and come up with exactly what I want.  I find the Library staff very helpful.</P>
    <P>Research is a very broad term.  Our job here is to use our own practical experience. Experience is very important.  We are doing research every day because we are talking to the people on the ground. We are getting their views, we know where the shoe is pinching and we know whom we are representing.</P>
    <P>This country is damned with statistics and figures.  Senator Norris said that much that comes into our office is rubbish. It is all formulated by somebody and it represents time wasted because I do not know any Senator who reads all he receives.  I have no doubt that the simplest document takes hours of preparation. Much time and energy is spent producing that piece of information and it is like a lighthouse in a bog, well presented but useless.  It has no meaning in the context of the work we are doing. Any information needed by a Senator can be found by ringing Eolas, FÁS, or the relevant agency.  If information is needed on the EC Senators have only to make contact with the EC office on Molesworth Street, and all the information needed, down to the finest detail, can be found.  I only do research applicable to what will be debated in the Seanad or a topic on which I want to make my views known, or to speak with a Minister or information applicable to a matter which will be discussed at a parliamentary party meeting.  Senators can go to the relevant agencies and will get the information <Col N="1363" /> if they know exactly what they want and ask for it in a quiet and precise manner.  As far as research of that kind is concerned, we have lots of it.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee talked about engineers.  I agree with Senator Norris that engineers are losing out.  They are no longer involved in planning, and that is a great mistake.  Someone with a degree in world affairs can do a diploma in planning and become a planning officer, while an engineer who has done all the work needed for planning is no longer a planner. The engineers have let that slip through their fingers.  They were the planners and I always found it easy to deal with engineers because they are practical people, many of them.  All of them at some time or other went out and worked on buildings and did practical work.  They were down to earth and one could talk sense to them.  It was a mistake that they lost the planning function.  They are slipping up, they should keep their eye on the ball and not let other academics step into the jobs they should be doing.  Professor Lee might think on that point.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Government on the good job they are doing.  The service we have in this House has improved greatly in the few years since I came here in 1982, and it is improving all the time.  At the end of this Government's term of office our services will be much better.  The committee system has created more openness and a better opportunity for people to debate their case more fully than they might in the Dáil or Seanad.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the work she is doing.  I believe that when we come to the end of this term we will have proceeded far along the road to better services. Of course services cost money, and we should remember that only 1.2 million people are working and 2.4 million people are being paid by that 1.2 million. We talk about more service, more research and more money but we must think of who pays the bill.  It is frightening to think that 2.4 million people are living off 1.2 million who are working.  We must keep our advancements and improvements in proportion to what we can <Col N="1364" /> afford.  In that way we will get value for money.  Things have improved considerably and will continue to improve.  I hope that the amendment will be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and compliment the proposer and seconder on the thorough arguments in support of it.  Having listened to Senator Farrell, I agree with his description of the deplorable facilities that existed here in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Conditions have improved somewhat but the reality is that in today's circumstances they are quite inadequate.  The motion reads:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Eireann deplores the lack of research facilities necessary to enable the Oireachtas discharge its responsibilities effectively; and calls on the Government to make a specific budgetary allocation for the resources required to permit the Oireachtas play its proper role in policy making.</P>
      <P>I support that and I am disappointed that there is a Government amendment rejecting it and stating that the Government has a policy of &ldquo;enhancing the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas in the formulation and oversight of public policy;...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That suggestion is a sham if this motion is rejected.  I find the motion reasonable and positive.  It is a simple request for facilities that are necessary for the Oireachtas to properly discharge its functions. It is a recognition that without adequate research facilities we, as legislators, are handicapped in discharging our duties in this Assembly.  The level of research facilities available to us compared to other parliaments is deplorable. Senator Norris referred to facilities in Australia but one does not have to go as far as Australia, or very far from home, to realise how inadequate the facilities available to us are in comparison to neighbouring parliaments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the improvements to which Senator Farrell referred, we still work in overcrowded conditions and are supplied with minimum secretarial service.  Part of the problem is that over the years we <Col N="1365" /> willingly short-changed our position and our standing where work facilities were concerned.  We were content to accept inadequate standards and there was a tendency, that has certain reverberations here this evening, to accept that what we had was adequate.  I deplore that.</P>
    <P>We are often ill-equipped because of a lack of research facilities to fully debate legislation and other issues.  The legal process is inadequate, poorer and less effective because of the absence of these facilities.  There is a growing cynicism among the public about the capacity of politicians to fulfil their role and that in itself is dangerous for democracy.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee mentioned that the reality is that we, on this side of the House, are far too dependent on briefings supplied to us by interested parties to legislation that comes before the House and that a good deal of that information can be partisan.  We do not have the facilities to test the balance of the information supplied to us.</P>
    <P>I want to give an example how the lack of facilities affect a matter I raised on the Order of Business today.  It concerns papers being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  On the Order Paper of 12 October 1993 a total of 175 documents were laid before the House; 104 were statutory instruments, 48 were non-statutory and 23 came from the European Parliament.  Among them was a document containing a total of 81 pages that will, in its present form, have far-reaching implications for the livestock industry. I happened by chance to notice that document on the list of papers laid before the House and went to the Library to find a copy.  I was astonished by what I saw in it.  There are a total of 174 other documents there that in various ways will affect people's lives adversely or beneficially. Since I do not have the time to study the detail of each document I am not effectively representing the people I should.  If I had the necessary facilities it would be possible to examine these documents.</P>
    <P>There is a provision that 21 sitting days must elapse before such regulations come into effect.  Many of the regulations that <Col N="1366" /> have come into effect, often because notice has not been taken of them, lead to endless problems for many people. Regularly in this House we give power to Ministers to introduce legislation over a period by regulation and order.  These ministerial orders are rarely examined when enacted, however, because of the absence of facilities that this motion seeks to provide.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the amendment. It represents a rejection of a reasonable and necessary request.  More than that, it represents one of the worst aspects of the political system, which is a denial by the Government that inefficiency exists when it is plain to everybody that it does.  One might suspect some sort of vested interest by the Government in restricting the well of knowledge that should be available to Senators.  The amendment proposes that the Seanad should welcome the Government's refusal to provide necessary facilities. In my view, the Seanad should do no such thing but should, as the motion requests, deplore in the strongest possible manner the denial of facilities that are freely available to members of other parliaments.</P>
    <P>For any parliamentarian to suggest that this reasonable motion should be rejected, is an act of irresponsibility.  I will be supporting the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I will be supporting the amendment, not because I find everything Senator Lee, Senator Norris and Senator Howard have said is rubbish but because we must be realistic and acknowledge that with 300,000 people unemployed the public would not tolerate any proposal by us to improve our conditions.  The public already regard us as rather pampered individuals. Although I risk being termed a gutless politician by Senator Norris, I believe greater research facilities, better conditions of pay, nicer offices, en suite facilities and so on would be the ideal, but we must realise that there are greater priorities and we must therefore wait our turn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1367" /> I must agree that many of us enter this Chamber unprepared for the task that lies ahead of us.  Whether we should regard this as the fault of the Government or our own fault is debatable.  Before an individual goes in front of the people as a candidate for election he or she should engage in soul searching and ask whether he or she is fully equipped for the job being sought.</P>
    <P>The number of Senators and Deputies with any form of legal training of any kind is minimal.  It is not a standard that others can impose on Senators and Deputies but it is a standard that we as public representatives should impose upon ourselves.  We should equip ourselves better for the role we undertake. We should not expect others to do that for us.  If we want better research facilities, we should endeavour to become better researchers ourselves.  It is not beyond the intelligence and capability of any Member of this House to help themselves a little more in finding and collating information.  I have done all the research for my contributions to this House.  In the process I am learning.  Not having to rely on others to research information on my behalf makes me question and verify the information presented to me.</P>
    <P>It is difficult, with the vast array of subjects and topics that come before us, to be fully informed on all matters.  As other Senators have pointed out, a vast amount of reports and documents are sent to us every second day.  Some are well worth reading.  In travelling from west Limerick I engage in a large amount of reading and it is quite easy to spot whether a document submitted for consideration is partisan.  I would not like to see any reduction in the amount of information submitted to us.  The booklet <i>Poverty Today</i> produced by the Combat Poverty Agency and many other documents produced by that agency are excellent and well researched, most of the articles being written by reputable academics who, I am sure, would be recognised by Senator Lee and Senator Norris.  We can rely on those with academic qualifications to have <Col N="1368" /> researched their topic.  As academics we can rely on their integrity to present the facts as they perceive them and not to falsify them.</P>
    <P>We live in an age where the politician is not viewed favourably by the public. In many ways we are seen as parasites on society.  This worries me, especially when attending public meetings and finding that politicians are criticised and that such criticisms are directed at oneself.  In my case I am aware that such criticisms would not have been made three years ago when I was not an elected politician. When I express an interest in attending a meeting, at which I might have been welcome three years ago, I find that I am now no longer welcome.  In one case I was told that unless I was representing a specific group I could not attend.  I find that kind of attitude developing more and more.  It is something we must be worried about.  It is not helped by sections in the media highlighting our weaknesses.  As human beings we have weaknesses.  For example, we are inclined on occasion to help those who help us, which is a natural inclination, but it is not something a politician will do all the time.  However, the portrayal of the politician as someone who is lazy, giving out backhanders and helping their cronies is becoming increasingly prevalent.  Very often it is completely contrary to the role played by politicians.  We have at heart the best interests of our communities, our regions, our towns and our villages, yet that is not recognised.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that this is the time for us to ask for more money, nicer offices and better research facilities.  I would agree that in many ways it would be nice to have someone do the leg work, for example, to tell someone to phone around to confirm facts.  However, I believe that many of us are poor enough to be our own servants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment and I have made a great effort to attend this debate.  We must accept that these are changing times.  Procedures, documentation and legislation is changing. The position is not as simple as <Col N="1369" /> portrayed by Senators on the Government side of the House.  It is important to keep to the forefront the significance of Seanad Éireann and we must continue to strive for the facilities requested in the motion.  If we seek to improve facilities, it is for the purpose of providing a better public service.</P>
      <P>When elected to this House I said that I had been a public representative at local level since 1967 and for a short time at national level and that I had quite a lot to learn.  Indeed, I am learning in this House but I notice that there are such restrictions and limitations that there is need for improvement.  That is the importance of the motion.  The motion states that Seanad Éireann deplores the lack of research facilities necessary to enable the Oireachtas discharge its responsibilities effectively.  Who could object to and oppose that?  If the Seanad is part of the Oireachtas who could say, in all fairness, say that it is not right that there should be resources for research facilities?  A specific budgetary allocation is the only way by which these facilities can be provided.  Such an allocation is logical and reasonable and is being requested in this motion which I support wholeheartedly.  I cannot understand why anybody would oppose that.</P>
      <P>The Seanad has been the subject of much criticism over the last few years. Much of it has been misdirected but this does not mean that there is not an urgent need for this House and the Oireachtas generally to update its procedures, to facilitate Members who want to make constructive contributions to the work of the House and to enable it to respond rapidly to important political issues as they arise.  This would show the people that the Oireachtas can be relevant to their lives.  That is what we are seeking to do in supporting this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment to the motion welcomes the commitment of the Government set out in the &ldquo;Broadening our democracy&rdquo; section of the Programme for a Partnership Government.  I do not think that programme specifically contains provisions for the Seanad to be <Col N="1370" /> updated.  If it does, I would like the Minister to clarify them.  There was a two day debate in the Dáil on the reform of that House.  I hope there will also be a debate in this House for the purpose of reforming and updating the Seanad and the provision of facilities.</P>
    <P>The relevance of the Seanad is determined largely by the extent of the real role allowed it by the Government, who may use it merely as a rubber stamp for legislation already processed in the Dáil. The Seanad will be seen to have little relevance unless it is given a more meaningful legislative role.  More legislation should be initiated in the Seanad, as is permitted by the Constitution.  It should be allowed to examine legislation seriously and Ministers should be prepared to listen to what is said.  I hope the Seanad will undertake at the earliest opportunity a similar reform programme to that undertaken in the Dáil.  The introduction of a form of Question Time and the ability to raise matters on the Adjournment have been talked about and would be valuable.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this motion.  The unique nature of the Seanad electoral system enables debates to take place on a more rational basis than in the politically confrontational atmosphere of the Dáil.  The Seanad is especially suited to dealing with legislation that is complex and detailed and requires close examination.  For that reason this motion is valid and relevant and I support it.</P>

      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with the sentiments behind the substantive motion put forward by Senator Lee and Senator Norris. It reflects a desire on the part of this House to contribute more effectively to the formation of public policy.  I have some quarrel with the tone of the motion but it is very healthy and good that we are having this debate and the standard of the contributions on all sides has been high.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues because reforming the institutions of Government is central to <Col N="1371" /> the Programme for a Partnership Government.  I was very pleased to be assigned, with the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Dempsey, responsibility for the section of this programme entitled-&ldquo;Broadening our democracy.&rdquo;  I will discuss this in more detail in my contribution.</P>
      <P>Many practical points were raised in the course of the contributions.  Some of these can be addressed but we must recognise that there are budgetary constraints and there are not limitless resources to devote to our own affairs. However, many practical points were raised and there is room for improvement. We can move together on that. The Government has put a great deal of effort into Oireachtas reform and has, intrinsically, concentrated in the first phase on reform of the Dáil.  There has been a radical reform of that institution. It is timely that we look again at reform of procedures in the Seanad.  The issues raised by Senator Sherlock of Question Time and Adjournment matters are important.</P>
      <P>A question was raised about training in relation to legislation and its drafting. This could be undertaken without sending people from this House to do law degrees.  An introduction to legal procedures and language would be helpful and can be explored.  There are technical problems in relation to providing a data base for people in that the computers are stand alone rather than networked. There are technical and cost implications of putting a data base on a network system but, in principle, it can be explored.  Many of these issues should be raised with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and further explored. Members will find an openness, subject to prudence on cost, to look at the issues they have raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the sentiments behind the motion.  Indeed, Senator Lee's <i>magnum opus</i> speaks with passion of the need to improve the quality of public decision making.  That is very much the reason that the Government is very committed to broadening our democracy and we <Col N="1372" /> should do it together through this kind of discussion which, I hope, will not be adversarial but one in which we will listen to each other and discuss the practical issues that arise in pursuing these problems.</P>
    <P>Members of the Oireachtas have a lawmaking responsibility.  They also have a responsibility to review Government policy and executive actions.  Sometimes people may concentrate too much on their role as legislators without seeing that there are whole areas of public policy which are not covered by legislation.  For example, until now there has been little legislation in relation to education.  This does not mean that a huge amount of policy making does not take place in that area.  The role of Members of the Oireachtas involves investigating the Government's policies, proposing alternative courses of action and an ongoing critique of the Government's performance. The Oireachtas brings important issues to the attention of the public and provides a valuable feedback to the Government.  The role of both Government and Opposition is important in a healthy democracy.</P>
    <P>Public representatives also act as a bridge between the general public and the institutions of Government.  They can bring to light how policies work in practice. They can highlight anomalies and help ensure the system delivers for the public it is intended to serve.  This role is valuable.  Both these approaches have a part to play in the democratic process. There has been criticism that too often the latter role of being a bridge between the public and institutions has dominated to the extent that the former role of scrutinising policy and legislation has been underplayed.  It is important that the Members of the Seanad are willing and interested in being more involved in this area.</P>
    <P>The imbalance in our democratic system carries with it two serious implications. First, we have been underutilising the extensive talents and experience of Members of the Oireachtas.  The point was well made by Senator Farrell that experience, as well as <Col N="1373" /> formal qualifications, is very important. We have been wasting a valuable public resource and this is no longer acceptable. We need to bring the minds of everybody elected to both Houses to bear on the making of public policy.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out, the complexity of public administration has intensified at a remarkable rate.  This raises issues of reforming the way the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Government are run and reforming the public service. This is a cornerstone of the Programme for a Partnership Government in the section &ldquo;Broadening our democracy&rdquo;. Significant progress has already been made but is only the start of a process.</P>
    <P>I have great respect for the democratic process.  As somebody who stood for election five times before getting here, I have great respect for the will of the people.  Those elected by the people, or indirectly as many in this House are by the people's representatives, must be given a real voice in the shaping and scrutiny of policy and not be seen just as lobby fodder.  The new committee system offers scope for detailed scrutiny of policy issues, Estimates and legislation in a calmer atmosphere and with more time than the often set piece debates which often add more heat than light.  I particularly welcome my opportunities to come to this House and the more reflective and less adversarial atmosphere it offers for public debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The demands on Ministers and Ministers of State have grown.  In the past, Ministers were a group of full-time politicians serviced by their civil servants.  They were expected to be absolute repositories of all knowledge and wisdom in the areas covered by their briefs, with the doctrine of corporation sole making Ministers legally answerable for the acts of every civil servant in their Department, from the lowest to the highest.  Ministers can no longer carry this burden on their own and we must be humble enough to acknowledge <Col N="1374" /> this.  We need to share the load with other non-office holding Members of the Oireachtas.  They have much to contribute and we who are office holders must be prepared to seek and accept their assistance.</P>
      <P>A further major implication of the democratic imbalance has been that we have been selling the average citizen short to the extent that public representatives have been overly concentrating on local and particular issues, often to the detriment of the broader policy considerations which, paradoxically, could often have much greater relevance for their constituents in the longer run.  I have always had a philosophy that when dealing with individual cases and constituency work, it is essential to look behind the point the individual raises to see the policy issue, and if one runs up against a brick wall to see if we can change the underlying policy.</P>
      <P>From my experience &mdash; and I have worked as a civil servant, briefly as a ministerial economic adviser in 1982 and now as a Minister &mdash; I believe that the temporary importation of outside expertise by Ministers to assist them in their departmental and Cabinet work is an important and necessary addition to Irish administrative structures.  Within Departments, an outside expert can bring new insights and often a breath of fresh air and encourage new thinking within the Civil Service system.  In terms of Ministers' collective responsibility at Cabinet, there is rarely available within the traditional structures the kind of advice a Minister needs to deal with the complexities of other Minister's briefs on top of their own.  It is intended to give statutory effect to the long-standing practice that appointments of outside experts to help with this complex work will terminate at the end of the term of office of the Minister who appoints them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The single most important reform which we have implemented to date is the establishment of the new committee system, which represents a sea change in our system of public representation.  The committees draw upon the talents of a large number of Deputies &mdash; and in the <Col N="1375" /> case of joint committees, of Members of both Houses &mdash; who are being given an opportunity to discuss in detail legislation relating to groups of Government Departments, as well as the Estimates for those Departments.  I see these committees promoting progress towards deepening our democracy in a number of ways.</P>
    <P>First, they are removing many issues from the sterile point-scoring and headline-grabbing which is often a substitution for genuine discourse and teasing out of legislation.  They are operating in a forum where there is a real sense of co-operation and pooling of resources and cross-party team spirit is already beginning to emerge.  Senator Norris gave examples earlier of amendments which had come through this House.  We have seen Opposition amendments coming through the committee system and being heard on the Government side. That gives people on both sides of the House a real input into what is happening.</P>
    <P>Second, the committees are making space for meaningful participation from a wider range of Deputies than was ever possible under previous arrangements, where traditionally only the spokes-person from each party dealt with the Committee Stage of Bills.  There is now a much wider input from a greater number of Deputies.  Deputies are briefing themselves more thoroughly and making more effective contributions than was either necessary or feasible when these matters were considered at full sittings of the Dáil.  The assignment of the Dáil Committee Stage work on Bills to the appropriate committees gives Deputies an increased incentive to develop an in-depth expertise on particular areas of public administration and policy making.  It also gives more time to go through legislation.</P>
    <P>I can sympathise with those who feel that the traditional balance between the Executive and backbenchers of all parties has resulted in provisions finding their way onto the Statute Book without being adequately teased out.  It can also be <Col N="1376" /> argued that particularly where abstruse technical details affected the fortune of the privileged &mdash; and this would be particularly true of Finance Bills &mdash; the privileged could purchase organised professional expertise which could have an influence greater than Members of the Oireachtas.  That is fundamentally antidemocratic. I think the point was well made in the discussion that the briefing which Members of both Houses get is often from specialist interest groups with an axe to grind and, therefore, it may not be the full picture.  I agree with the point Senator Lee made about the need to subject thinking to independent scrutiny and to challenge the assumptions behind traditional policies, which was my motivation for entering politics.</P>
    <P>The Government has embarked on a most ambitious programme of reform. We have only just started and I think we need to move further, particularly in relation to the Seanad.  Our concern is to ensure that the programme delivers the promised benefits.  In bringing specific reform measures before the Oireachtas we will not claim that the fine detail of what we propose is incapable of improvement. It is important to have a vibrant contribution from all sides of the House if optimum progress is to be made and I see the new arrangements for discussing legislation as facilitating this process.  It is important that the process of Oireachtas reform is carried out in as consultative a manner as possible.</P>
    <P>I have often remarked in the past how the Estimates went through on the nod with limited scrutiny &mdash; huge sums of public money, often much more important than actual legislation.  It is a positive move that these are now scrutinised by the committees.  Such scrutiny of the Estimates is a development of the utmost significance for parliamentary power. Another area where I think parliamentary accountability and involvement has been improved is a Bill which I brought through this and the other House &mdash; the Comptroller and Auditor General Bill.  It puts an emphasis on value for money audit and beefs up the role of the Committee of Public Accounts, which <Col N="1377" /> strengthens the role of the democratic process in overseeing the actions of the Executive.</P>
    <P>A priority item on the Government's agenda is the issue of privilege and compellability of witnesses appearing before Oireachtas committees and of documents sought by committees.  The Government is anxious to ensure that the potential of all Oireachtas committees is fully realised.  Some committees have expressed the view that they have been hampered in the effective discharge of their responsibilities because witnesses did not enjoy absolute privilege for statements which they might make and for documents which they might furnish and because there is even a question mark over the qualified privilege which witnesses enjoy if the media are present. Equally, the view has been expressed by a number of committees that they should have legal support to reinforce their right to call for the attendance of witnesses and the provision of papers.</P>
    <P>The issues thrown up by these subjects are complex and involve striking a fine balance between on the one hand the necessity to strengthen the committee system and on the other the necessity to protect the confidentiality of certain categories of sensitive data, including confidential personal information, from public disclosure.  The process of consideration is nearing completion and it is our intention to have proposals in this area before the Oireachtas as a matter of urgency.  The Government is quite clear in the principle and we are ironing our the legal details.  I am examining proposals for a freedom of information Bill in the light of best practice and experience of such legislation in other jurisdictions. I would welcome any views this House has to offer at this preparatory stage before we crystallise finally the shape of the proposals.</P>
    <P>Our democracy is only as strong as the confidence which our citizens place in its institutions.  The Ethics in Public Office Bill, which should be published before Christmas and which I hope will receive careful scrutiny in this House, will help strengthen public confidence in our <Col N="1378" /> democratic institutions.  Based on the principles of transparency and accountability, it will offer public accountability in areas where private business interests could be seen as likely to overlap with public functions.  I feel that many of our citizens have on occasion withheld placing their full confidence in democratic institutions because they saw them as somewhat irrelevant to their needs and less than effective in carrying out the tasks assigned to them.  We have a responsibility to ensure that we adapt and change our structures and procedures to make them relevant, meaningful and effective.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Members may be impatient for change and improvement. So am I.  Those of us who are recent entrants to these Houses, particularly those of us who took a long time to get here, share that impatience but we think it is vital to ensure that what we do is done right and that it should stand the test of time.</P>
    <P>We do not rush into something halfcocked. Our intentions are clear and we are on our way to fulfilling them.  Translating those which require legislation into statute is time consuming and painstaking. I have discovered that myself while preparing legislation.  It takes a lot of time and one must cover all the angles. It is easy to produce a Private Members' Bill in Opposition, but it is more difficult to produce something which will be put into legislation because it must be correct in all its details and stand the test of time.  On the issue of Private Members' legislation, there is a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government, and we will bring forward proposals in the near future to allow for the introduction of Private Members' legislation in the case of non-contentious issues.  The specific proposals in that regard are almost complete.</P>
    <P>It is easy to call on the Government to provide additional resources on the grounds that additional funding, additional staffing, or improved access to consultants can enhance the capacity of Members to contribute to the public wellbeing. This feeling has been evident <Col N="1379" /> throughout the debate.  Members will realise that this Government had a short run into this year's budget and we will look again at the issues in the context of next year's budget.  The process of settling Estimates for the Public Services, including the Houses of the Oireachtas, is already in train and such views as are expressed here tonight will have a bearing on the outcome.  They will be examined and taken seriously.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming electoral Bill will deal with the resourcing of political parties and the case being made by the Independent Senators for backup funding and research can be examined in that context. At the moment there is a system of funding Opposition parties to provide backup research facilities.  This will be incorporated in a wider scheme of political funding in the electoral Bill.  The points being made in terms of research expertise, particularly for groups not represented in the mainstream political parties, should be considered in that context.</P>
    <P>I would also like to draw the attention of the House to the resource offered by the Library and its trained staff in helping Members research contributions, and the further development of this resource could be usefully pursued.  The National Library is also in this complex and it is a resource we need to use.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that but there are areas where we can explore the joint development of the two facilities. Deputy J. Bruton has raised the issue of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges examining the Library and research services.  It is in this type of atmosphere that practical proposals can be brought forward in that area.  I recognise the need to strengthen the use of that resource.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must strike a note of caution about one point.  I understand and sympathise with the demand for professional backup and research facilities for Members. <Col N="1380" /> However, should research facilities be provided through a formal office structure involving permanent Civil Service staff or should they be obtained by Members and their parties through the electoral Bill mechanism for funding?  A corps of professional researchers, whether salaried or drawn from the consultancy professions, may bring additional insights to bear on the problems of making or overseeing public policy.  However, is there a danger that Members might draw on a restricted pool of ideas through such consultants?  Most of us are conscious, particularly those who read the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, that research is not value free.  One may get different answers depending on who one asks to research a particular topic.</P>
    <P>Our politico-administrative system may not be the best participatory democracy, but it has one fundamental strength in the ready accessibility of its elected Members to the public.  This interplay between the public and their representatives furnishes our politicians with a rich reservoir of ideas and experience which cannot be matched by any bought in expertise.  We are close to the people. The diverse vocational backgrounds in this House was the idea of the author of the Seanad and there should be that kind of broad experience in this House.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee referred to the third strand, the voluntary sector.  I am pleased to say it is incorporated in the new National Economic and Social Forum which is part of the process of broadening our democracy.  For the first time, representatives of the unemployed, the disabled, women's groups and disadvantaged communities as well as Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas are involved in scrutinising and debating public policy in a central forum.  When setting up the forum, I was anxious to ensure representation from all sides, including the Independent Senators and all parties represented in both Houses.  Although the numbers are great, it enriches participation in this area.</P>
    <P>The question was raised about resourcing the third strand to participate.  We need to be careful because we do not <Col N="1381" /> want to resource a poverty or consultancy profession instead of individuals and groups.  That would be counter-productive. People need to speak to us from their personal experience and that voice must always be mediated through the voices of professionals.  We lose something important and immediate about the contribution people make if others speak for them.  I sound this note of caution in relation to resourcing a third strand to make their contribution: the independent secretariat of the National Economic and Social Forum is open to all, including members of the third strand and the first strand, which is the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>A former and distinguished Member of this House, Mr. W.B. Yeats, in what was his only piece published under the auspices of the Department of Finance, headed his report of an advisory committee's activities with, &ldquo;What We Did And What We Tried To Do&rdquo;.  A lot of what I have mentioned at this stage of the Government's life falls into the category of &ldquo;what we are doing&rdquo;, but I can still point with some degree of pride to important items in the &ldquo;what we did&rdquo; category of reforms in broadening our democracy.</P>
    <P>I hope we can make progress through consultation on the issues before the House.  Broadening our democracy and improving the quality of public decision making and the input of the elected Members of both Houses into the public policy making process is a central part of the Government's programme.  Many important and useful points were made in the debate.  Senator Lee, Senator Roche and I are former officials of the Department of Finance and we know the useful caveat, &ldquo;subject to the availability of the public finances&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Lee and the Independent Members for tabling this motion.  It is one which is of interest to Members on all sides.  I cannot understand why the Government side thought it was necessary to table an amendment.  They have, perhaps unwittingly, made this debate slightly divisive, <Col N="1382" /> but it should not be as we all have the same interests in this issue.  I compliment the Minister of State on her discursive speech which moved at times into the parliamentary stratosphere, but touched too infrequently on the real needs of the Seanad.  It was an interesting speech, but perhaps more relevant to the other House and I will explain why in a moment.  Nevertheless, I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by her.</P>
      <P>The research needs of any House of Parliament or Member will vary greatly and they are difficult to quantify.  Since we do not have any research facilities in this House, therefore it is not a question of quantifying what they are.  If we compare ourselves with what is available in other parliaments, the resources are shamefully inadequate.  I agree with the Minister that there are different types of research and values.  Perhaps professional Civil Service research is not what we need; perhaps research should come from outside and this would create a different perspective.  We should be able to organise this ourselves.  It is strange that this is difficult to achieve at a time when there are many highly qualified post-graduates who would love an opportunity to do research in a parliamentary setting.  There is no structure available where the resources provided by these skilled people can be used to benefit us and at the same time give them a training which would make it easier for them to get jobs afterwards.  We could talk forever about structures but unless the resources are put in place, we will be a long time waiting for something to happen.</P>
      <P>The Minister spent much time talking about committees.  I agree that the new committee system looks like being successful but I have two reservations.  I think it is perhaps over diminishing the adversarial nature of politics.  We are becoming too consensus oriented.  One can go to the Minister's forum or the education forum, there are committees everywhere and, to a certain extent, some of the necessary cut and thrust of politics is disappearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main complaint about committees <Col N="1383" /> is that this House is excluded from three of the four committees.  That is not the Minister's responsibility but Members of this House feel very strongly that there is no committee structure within which they can operate.  For that reason much of what the Minister said this evening about committees was not particularly relevant to this House.</P>
    <P>I must take strong exception to the Minister's reference to the Library. Although the Minister quoted my own party leader when saying that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has responsibility for the Library, it is not the responsibility of Committee on Procedure and Privileges; it is the responsibility of the Joint Services Committee. The Minister, in one short paragraph, skated over that issue.</P>
    <P>The position in the Oireachtas Library is nothing short of scandalous.  The quality of the service provided is dependent on the staff and financial resources available. The staff numbers are lower now than they were ten years ago in spite of the ever increasing demand for a greater service.  The requirements on the staff have become more sophisticated and the staff, hard working people who are dedicated to the Library, are simply not in a position to provide that service.</P>
    <P>The parliamentary libraries which offer research services are generally structured to provide for two separate units: a library unit staffed by professional librarians and a research unit staffed by graduates with specialisation in various disciplines with back up support usually provided by lower grades.  This is not the case in our Library.  The same staff are responsible for the Library service which involves such tasks as cataloguing, indexing and circulation control as well as the operation of the research service.</P>
    <P>None of the staff here are professional librarians.  The day to day needs of getting information and running the Library takes precedence over any sort of research services.  While an essential requirement for the grade of assistant librarian is an honours degree with subject <Col N="1384" /> specialisation, a qualification in librarianship is not necessary for employment in the Library here.  The process of cataloguing, indexing and maintaining a library collection, which requires professional skills, has not been maintained here.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many Members have visited the underground part of this building.  In 1922, the chief secretary's library, or large parts of it, were transferred from Dublin Castle to this building. Most of that collection lies under this building at present and most of it has not been catalogued because the professional staff was never there to do it.  Many of the books are deteriorating; they are covered in dust and will be lost if something is not done soon.</P>
    <P>These books should not be here.  The Oireachtas Library is not the place for a collection of books which may be of great scholarly interest.  The sooner something is done about having them catalogued and put where they can be used by <i>bona fide</i> scholars, the better.  That is one part of a valuable resource that simply has not been catalogued.  The lack of proper professionalism or numbers means that the necessary skills for a library are not available and because staff resources are so inadequate, a large proportion of the material in the Library has never been catalogued.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming automation of the Library holding also underlines the need for professional skills.  Computerisation is a complex task which needs expertise within the unit.  That expertise sadly is not there at present.</P>
    <P>The function of the research service was established in 1976.  The service has now become increasingly limited in most areas and it is impossible to find time for staff to draw up comprehensive memoranda to carry out in-depth research. The quality of the research undertaken is hampered by the poor quality of retrieval tools, catalogues and indexes and by the fact that there is not a bank of current information to draw on as was the case in the early years of the service when newspapers and periodicals were scanned and indexed on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1385" /> The Library's budget for 1993 is £40,000 and that is to cover expenditure on books, periodicals, newspapers and so on.  That budget figure has not changed over the past three years; the budget increase for the Library in recent years has been totally unrealistic.  It increased from £35,000 in 1986 to £40,000 last year whereas in the years 1981 to 1986 it increased from £12,000 to £35,000, a threefold increase.  No account is taken in this budget of the constantly increasing cost of publications, newspapers and so on.</P>
    <P>If we are to start where Senator Lee wants, in providing a research service, we should look in our Library.  Without going into all sorts of discussion about the many worthwhile things about which the Minister spoke this evening, if that one paragraph on the Library had been amplified, we could make a real beginning in providing research services.</P>
    <P>I should have declared an interest at the beginning of this discussion which would be in line with the Minister's new Ethics Bill as we will now all be obliged to declare our particular interests.  I am chairman of a subcommittee of the Joint Services Committee which has responsibility for the Library.  In the coming weeks and months we will be talking extensively to Members asking them what sort of service they require.  We will be seeking to put the Library on a fully professional footing but we cannot do that unless this becomes a priority.  A realistic budget must be presented to facilitate the recruitment of staff and allow the Library to bring in people, whether on a training scheme or from the various archive departments, to catalogue the collections underneath this building.</P>
    <P>In talking about research and reform of this area, I make a plea from the heart for understanding from the Minister and from the Government of the needs of the Library.  It is in the Library that reform will start and that the needs of Members can begin to be adequately addressed.  It is a scandal that the Library has been ignored for so long.  There has been nobody to speak on behalf of the Library; <Col N="1386" /> people from various parties have not come together to make the case.  The people there have worked very hard in bad conditions.  They want to have a proper professional parliamentary library and so do we, but we are the people who can put the pressure on the Minister and the Minister is the person who can deliver.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a very worthwhile debate and I commend the movers of the motion because it has given us an opportunity to focus on important aspects of the life of this House and the other House and the way the two Houses operate.  I commend the Minister on an extremely provocative speech, as indeed many of the other speeches were.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Manning, I believe that the reform should start in the Library.  It is a resource which is much under utilised. The Library is the proper focus for the research facility.  I would not agree with the idea that there should be a fund with which we would hire researchers because it could be subject to abuse.</P>
      <P>There are many things wrong with both Houses of the Oireachtas and we should admit it.  This debate is excellent in that it provides us with a facility to say that. Lack of research is just one of the many things wrong with both Houses.  We all accept, understand and admit that there are serious constraints in the way both Houses perform their constitutional task.</P>
      <P>There is poor funding for both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is bizarre and extraordinary that the Houses have to go to the Department of Finance to seek a budget.  After all, the Houses of the Oireachtas are supposed to be in charge. Constitutionally, the Dáil is charged with the task of guardianship of the public purse, yet when either the Dáil or the Seanad want a shilling to do anything in the interests of the public and the public good, they have to go to the Department of Finance.  It is even more bizarre that the two Houses accept when the Department refuses.  Could anything be more the inverse of how it should be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, correctly, looked at what is being done in the committee system. <Col N="1387" /> However, I do not believe our committee system can work or produce anything worthwhile.  It will collapse in the same way as the one introduced by a previous Coalition Government some years ago because the ultimate focus of Members of both Houses is being re-elected.</P>
    <P>Our electoral system is not conducive to politicians operating as legislators.  It produces a system where we operate by the law of the jungle which, in turn, produces a type of well equipped gombeenmanism. Research facilities will not change that.  Changing the electoral system will release Members of both Houses from those shackles and provide them with the capacity to fulfil their constitutional responsibilities.  The Minister and other Members know that I have written extensively on the issue of clientelism and how we serve constituents. It is a very valuable role but when one finds through research, as I did in the early 1980s, that 83 to 85 per cent of Members' time is spent servicing constituency work, one must ask if anything would change if we had phalanxes of research officers or if we had a library equivalent to the Library of Congress. The truthful answer is no, it would not. If we are to reform how things are done in either or both Houses, it must be a root and branch reform.</P>
    <P>I agree there is need for additional research facilities.  I also agree with the comments made by Senator Manning.  I have been to the basement and what I saw is a national scandal.  There we have an extraordinary resource which dates from God knows how many years back and it is not available to Members, researchers or academics.  It is a scandalous system.  We could also look at how we could better do our job.  We should look at the hours we work and at the fact that over the last two weeks we have not exactly been overburdened with legislative work.  Even those truncated hours are produced by an electoral system which results in our politicians being relatively well paid gombeen men.  We cannot fulfil our responsibility nor can we <Col N="1388" /> expect others in either House to fulfil that responsibility.</P>
    <P>This was brought to my attention when I was chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State Sponsored Bodies, a very prestigious committee and I regarded it a great honour to be not only a member of that committee but also its chairman.  However, I remember Tuesdays when I and the clerk of that committee wandered both Houses like lost souls trying to beat in a quorum, and the quorum was only four.  We must ask ourselves honestly will these reforms achieve a great deal.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to find recently that the Oireachtas joint committee is looking at one aspect of State sponsored bodies. The Committee on Employment and Enterprise &mdash; which seems to be without a task &mdash; is fulfilling a role which clearly belongs to the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies by looking at the lottery and now the Public Accounts Committee is getting in on the same act.  There is a clear need for us to decide the kind of committee system we should have.  I believe we should have committees which focus on individual sectors of public administration: a committee on State enterprise, a committee on agriculture; sectoral committees to look at everything from the Estimates to the legislative proposals to the way the Minister and his or her Department operates.</P>
    <P>We must also, and the Minister mentioned this, look at this myth of ministerial responsibility, although that is a job for another day.  That a Minister could, should or does have knowledge of every action in his or her Department is clearly a nonsense and it is time to reform that.  In 1969 the Devlin report made proposals to get rid of this.  We have had honest attempts to reform both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I believe we will never succeed until we have proper electoral reform.</P>
    <P>Although this debate has been confined to relatively short contributions, it has been worthwhile because, if nothing else, it makes us look at ourselves and that is not a bad thing.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's speech.  There are few people who value research more than she does having used it throughout her professional life.  While I agree that we must remember budgetary restraints when seeking better facilities for research, I wonder if we are not also wasting a lot of money as a result of the lack of independent advice available to this House.</P>
      <P>I try to confine my remarks to subjects about which I am knowledgeable and one subject is health and the finance we spend on health.  It is extremely worrying that in this area, as in all others, we are heavily subject to pressures from interest groups. The main interest group in the health area is the consumer, our patients. However, we also have tremendous pressures at the other end from the interests of, for example, the pharmaceutical companies.  These have more money than our consumer groups are ever likely to have, no matter how well we fund them.</P>
      <P>An effort is being made in Europe to remove the secrecy surrounding the information released by pharmaceutical companies.  Our Department of Health and National Drugs Advisory Board are both heavily dependent on information from the pharmaceutical companies and they, of course, apply commercial constraints to an enormous area of their information.  In that context I am delighted to hear the Minister say that a freedom of information Act is to be introduced because it may remove some of the secrecy in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider this issue to be serious because their advice may be costing us a lot of money.  I will give one example of this.  Anti-depressants are one of the main drugs prescribed under the GMS in this country.  At the moment a new grouping of anti-depressant drugs is being promoted to replace the tricyclic group which has been in vogue for a long time.  Their main advantage appears to be that it is more difficult to commit suicide with them.  Of course, no one wants people committing suicide but they are 30 times as expensive as the old drugs. If the GMS prescribe them on a large <Col N="1390" /> scale, what will the cost be to the Department? No independent group has advised the Department or the National Drugs Advisory Board on what we should do.</P>
    <P>I was also shocked to discover how hard it is to get in the Library independent reports published in this country. I am glad Members have complimented the Library staff because their ingenuity is incredible.  I am not sure if they are borrowing books in bookshops in Dawson Street but they have come back to me with books they did not have when I requested them.</P>
    <P>In this regard Trinity College Library has been incredibly good.  However, a very important report, &ldquo;Food Futures&rdquo;, was published earlier this year.  It is a report on food consumption trends and prospects in Ireland and it is published by an independent campus company called Nutriscan in Trinity College.  The research was carried out by our only futures research company, the Henley Centre.  The report tells us about the change that has taken place in eating habits and in the foods that are bought in Ireland in the last ten years.  In a food producing nation this must be important because apparently &ldquo;meat and two veg.&rdquo; has gone out of fashion and take-away meals and ethnic foods are more important. In a few years we will all be eating lentils and yoghurt.  We need this information.</P>
    <P>I have been asking for the report for six months.  I discovered that I had to wait because its price would have been an eightieth of the Library budget for the entire year.  I know that is dear but one has to pay for expertise and in a country where agriculture and food industries are important we have to find out what we must produce for the consumer.  There is no good in producing mountains of potatoes if apparently cauliflowers are in demand.  We should have some guidance and the Department of Agriculture which receives strong lobbying from the farming interests should know what the consumer wants.  We can, of course, rely on Senator Quinn to tell us but it would be nice if we had independent research such as this available to us.  I did not realise that I <Col N="1391" /> was asking for an eightieth of the budget when I asked for the report.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee and the Minister of State mentioned the research done by voluntary bodies.  This is vital but are we depending too much on the voluntary bodies for our research?  This morning I was on the social committee of the National Economic and Social Forum. We were discussing what we would describe as areas of deprivation.  Given that the census is now seven years old and there has been a fair amount of demographic change and development since then, we had to give up in the end and bemoan the fact that we did not have the Combat Poverty report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great interest to what has been an instructive discussion both from a positive and from a negative point of view.  There was virtually nothing, apart from the Library situation, that I would wish to disagree with in the Minister of State's speech.  It was a positive, challenging and stimulating contribution.  It left me all the more puzzled as to why there was an amendment put down in the first place which obliges me to push matters further than I would have otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the Library, what Senator Manning and Senator Roche said was absolutely right.  The resources are minimal and they have not been improved for practical purposes since 1976 in terms of library staff.  There may be one person less there now than in 1976.  In terms of resourcing public bodies it must have the worst record of improvement over 16 or 17 years.  The nub of the matter is that the Library is the part of <Col N="1392" /> the Minister of State's speech most relevant to my motion because it is specifically about research facilities.  I am not at present concerned about office facilities or salaries or other matters which engaged my colleague, Senator Norris, to such an eloquent display of irrelevance.  I am concerned with research facilities as such.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is a public perception of politicians which the political class ought certainly to be thinking about. I put down this motion after a meeting in Dublin last Wednesday evening where public resentment against the perceived ineffectuality of the Oireachtas came through emphatically from a group of responsible citizens, not a group of natural protesters.  I do not accept that the public would be agitated about the idea of spending, in the first instance, a small amount of money on research support.</P>
    <P>I am not asking for the moon.  I am not asking for research assistants for every individual.  I am asking for some research assistants for the Houses of the Oireachtas and I have left it open as to how they could be most effectively supplied.  This is a moderate demand on the grounds that 300,000 people are unemployed.  It would create some work for some of the people Senator Manning was talking about.  We have part-time American interns and we have no provision for Irish sources of support whether at that stage or later.  I would argue strongly that we have 300,000 people unemployed at least partly because of misguided policies which might have been improved if the quality of Oireachtas thinking could have been improved in earlier years by the employment of people who could have been instrumental in supplying thinking which might have improved the quality of policy making.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that professional politicians should be deprived of the pleasures of the political chase.  I do not see why people should not derive quiet satisfaction from the pleasures of the stroke quietly pulled.  That seems to be an integral part of our political culture and I would not wish seriously to change <Col N="1393" /> it.  Members play an indispensable role in legitimising the activity of Government, but that activity could be significantly improved by some development in the direction I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I keep returning to the evaluation of the ideas that come in here.  Virtually every idea in the Oireachtas comes in some way.  As Members of the Oireachtas we are not generators of independent ideas, though we may be on the basis of experience we bring in from outside.  I do not for a moment undervalue experience. I have listened with great interest and admiration to many contributions in this House from experienced Members. However, I have noticed that where the contribution from experience is most telling is in illuminating detail within the accepted general framework.  It rarely questions the general framework of legislation. It brings knowledge of local circumstances to bear and often does so tellingly and interestingly, but it does not oblige Ministers fundamentally to rethink what they are proposing or the assumptions underlying their own policy proposals.  Experience is, therefore, not a substitute for what I am talking about. For these reasons, the amendment does not adequately address the issues I have tried to raise.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister of State's reference to the third strand, which I <Col N="1394" /> welcome, significant progress has been made there and I do not wish to decry that.  I welcome it and I admire the contribution the Minister of State herself has made.  One has to look carefully at the individual components of a third strand. The voice of those at the receiving end has to be heard and it should not always be mediated by professional mediators. The same would apply to the representatives of other social partners and where the interests of the third strand are being effectively represented by committed professional mediators one ought to look at whether ways can be found of enabling them to discharge that responsibility more effectively.</P>
    <P>At present they are seriously handicapped and in many cases, although not in all, the degree of financial support for various components of the third strand varies greatly within the voluntary sector. It ought to be examined to see whether they can be assisted to make a more effective contribution in the context of the forum the Minister of State mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Kilmacanogue is a small village in County Wicklow which has all the characteristics of village life in Ireland.  It has approximately 311 homesteads, of which 296 are on the west side of the road and 15 at the east side of the road.  It has a school, a church, a garage and a petrol station.  It embodies the sort of village community which exists all over this country.  The people of the village of Kilmacanogue have been very disturbed for a very long time about the prospects of either a dual carriageway dividing the village or an eastern by-pass of the village. They are very concerned because they have had to wait a very long time for a decision on this matter.</P>
      <P>Kilmacanogue has a serious traffic problem which Wicklow County Council and others have recognised.  Very high speed traffic travels through the village which is on the main Dublin-Wexford road.  Various studies, options and proposals have been made dealing with this traffic problem.  There are 1,600 cars per hour travelling through that area at rush hour and it is projected this will probably double over 25 years.  Speed limits tend to be completely ignored in that area.  As a result there have been many accidents, not only traffic accidents but accidents to pedestrians who live in the village, many of them elderly and many of them children.</P>
      <P>One of the problems Kilmacanogue has is houses very close to the road and many people who live there do not have cars.  They have to walk up and down this very busy road on narrow footpaths or in some places without any footpaths at all.  There is, in fact, one housing estate adjoining the road.  The N11, the road in question, turns off to Roundwood and Glendalough at Kilmacanogue village. This is a very dangerous point where there has been a large number of accidents because of the speed of the traffic and the lack of any regulation for this turn-off.  There are no traffic lights or roundabout there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem was recognised over five years ago and proposals were put forward at county council and other levels to deal with this.  Exhaustive studies were made which suggested numerous alternatives including roundabouts, traffic lights, very minimal type alternatives and then progressively more dramatic alternatives.  In the end the options were whittled down to two; a dual carriageway through the village, with an over bridge, or what is now known as the eastern by-pass in that area. The eastern by-pass, as the Minister will know &mdash; he has been lobbied very comprehensively on this issue &mdash; is certainly the preferred option of the residents of Kilmacanogue mainly because it will not really affect the village at all.  The eastern by-pass would go on a route which runs <Col N="1397" /> behind the Holfeld factory on the main road and would pass by the lower areas of the little Sugar Loaf.  It would obviously cause much less disturbance to those who live there and therefore be less complicated and less offensive and would cause little disruption to village life.</P>
    <P>It should be acknowledged that the eastern by-pass would certainly be a great deal more expensive and estimates up to £5 million have been given by various authoritative consultants.  That makes it obviously a less attractive proposition for the Minister but obviously a more attractive one for the people who live in the village.  I do not wish to make a case at this stage for one alternative or another, although I have a preference.  I ask the Minister if he could possibly make an early decision on this matter.  Meetings are being held on a regular basis in Kilmacanogue village because they are very disturbed that this decision has been delayed for so long.</P>
    <P>The Minister will acknowledge that any minor solution like traffic lights, roundabouts or road signs is now a nonrunner and the only decision he has to make is between these two major structural alternatives.  My understanding is that the last hurdle to this particular decision is an EIS which was commissioned by the county council.  It is a fairly hefty document of 100 pages with detailed maps.  I know some difficult decisions have to be made by experts in this area as a result of this report.  All that we and Wicklow County Council are waiting for is a certificate of environmental clearance from the Minister if he accepts the EIS and a decision from him on which option is preferable.  It has been on the Minister's desk for nearly two years.  It would be helpful if we knew when to expect a decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in the Seanad and to up date Members on the position in regard to the Kilmacanogue/Glen of the Downs motor <Col N="1398" /> scheme.  As Senator Ross said, it is a busy route serving Rosslare, Dublin, Belfast and the sea ports along the route.  It is essential that we continue the improvement scheme which has developed north and south of that area.</P>
      <P>It is also important to understand the area this road is traversing.  Although residents must be considered, there are other considerations.  This area is a nature reserve, it is a beautiful area and requires sensitive treatment.  When Wicklow County Council made their first proposal in regard to this scheme, the then Minister for the Environment asked the council to provide an environmental impact statement.  Although it was not mandatory, he considered that the essential characteristic of the roadway required this step.</P>
      <P>Once an environmental impact statement is put in motion, it is not possible to proceed with any developments until a decision is taken on the environmental impact of the development or, alternatively, until measures to reduce or eliminate detrimental environmental impacts are employed.  When the environmental statement was prepared and submitted to me, I asked for additional submissions which I received and published.  Local groups, residents, the local authority, the Office of Public Works, An Taisce, etc., were then given the opportunity to make submissions. These have been submitted and the matter is reaching the final stages of consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfair of Senator Ross, in what was otherwise a sensible contribution, to infer that this proposal has been on the Minister's desk for two years.  The Senator must have known that a variety of aspects were being catered for at that time, not least of which was consultative measures required under environmental impact statements.  As I said, this is nearing the final stages of consideration and I hope to make a final decision soon.  I look forward to a successful resolution to any outstanding problems in regard to <Col N="1399" /> the type of scheme which will be developed.  As a result of the careful consideration I gave to the submissions made I was in a position to come to the House this evening without any prepared notes, although I have many of these schemes on hand.</P>
