      <P>I have notice from Senator Daly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to outline the impact on farmers' incomes and on agricultural employment arising from the Common Agricultural Policy reforms now taking place and the main effects which the reforms will have on the agricultural industry in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that the community college at Rathkeale, County Limerick, is constructed in 1993.</P>
      <P>I have received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to honour the commitment to provide adequate funding for the Adelaide Hospital and to ensure that the ethos of the Adelaide Hospital is maintained in the proposed new hospital at Tallaght.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> The need for the Minister for the Environment to establish an inquiry as requested by Dublin City Council into the circumstances surrounding the demolition of a listed 18th century building in Capel Street, Dublin 1.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Daly, Neville and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Daly and Senator Neville's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Ross may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have had to rule that the matter raised by Senator Norris is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of Ministerial responsibility.  It is a matter for the local authority, Dublin Corporation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Items Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9.  I propose that, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, Items Nos. 1, 2 and 3 will be decided without debate.  The proceedings on the Second and remaining Stages of Item 4, if not previously concluded, will be brought to a conclusion at 6 p.m. by putting one question from the Chair, which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Government.  Item No. 9 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.  I do not think that Item No. 4 will need a timeframe but to enable us to keep to the Order of Business I have done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Leader of the House mentioned the need for a guillotine.  It will not be necessary and, as a matter of principle, we should not begin this session by having allocation of <Col N="287" /> time motions like that.  I know that at least one member of my group would like to say a few words on Item No. 3.  The order for winter time is more than just a casual matter and I ask that a few minutes be set aside for a brief discussion on Item No. 3.</P>
      <P>I raised the possibility of a major debate on Northern Ireland last week.  I understand the Tánaiste is to make a major statement on Friday on this subject. However, major discussions of such matters should take place in the Houses of the Oireachtas when they are in session. If the Tánaiste cannot be present in the House this week, we should have a full debate on Northern Ireland, at the earliest opportunity, as there is a clear demand for such a debate from both sides of the House.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to make time available for a discussion on the issues and the ramifications of the Greencore question.  It raises very serious questions which are of concern to Members. We are prepared to sit after 8 p.m. for a hour or two for such a debate, or to have it taken earlier if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point made by Senator Manning.  There is no agreement between the Whips that Item No. 3 be taken without debate.  I am not suggesting there should be a long debate, but certainly one Member of our group has indicated a wish to speak on the matter.  If Senators want to make a brief comment on it they should be allowed to do so.  That has been the tradition previously.  This item comes up every year and checking the Official Record will show that it has been discussed.</P>
      <P>Last week, I asked the Leader of the House that Members be informed as soon as possible of the items of legislation to be initiated in this House.  I regret that has not been done.  It is important that we have some movement on that.  It does not need to be a complete and comprehensive list, but we need to have some information on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader of the House what is the status of those Bills which were lost <Col N="288" /> in the interregnum, with the fall of the last Dáil.  A number of items of legislation had been partially dealt with in the Dáil at that time.  Normally, under Standing Orders they can be brought back to either House at Second, Third or Fourth Stages. One of the courts Bills made provision to allow the State to appeal against light sentences.  I do not want to make political capital out of the appalling case we have all read about, but I ask that that legislation be reintroduced to allow the State to appeal against such light sentences.  I also request that the problems regarding legislation on women's rights and domestic violence be a subject for debate. Again, I do not want to make political capital out of a very sensitive issue which has upset everybody on all sides of the House but time should be made available for a debate on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House when, rather than if, it is proposed to have a debate on the disposal of 30.4 per cent of Greencore.  Will the Leader clarify in this House, rather than on the airwaves or in the newspapers, that the quota which is a national quota&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is still a question.  I ask the Leader to establish that the quota will be secure and that the so-called &ldquo;golden share&rdquo; will also be secure, because it is a matter of significant national importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House if we will have an opportunity to reflect the nation's views on the Kilkenny rape case, notwithstanding that I have it down as a matter of concern for this evening.  The House should have an opportunity to reflect the concerned reaction of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also ask the Leader of the House if he would give time either tomorrow or next week to debate Item No. 10 on the Order of Business, the Report of the Sixth Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies on Bord na <Col N="289" /> gCon.  This was promised before the break up of the last House.  I had the support of Senator Lanigan for that debate and I am sure I will have the support of Senator Roche.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Neville and O'Toole have already mentioned the Kilkenny rape and incest victim.  In view of the state of the law, which protects the the offender rather than the victim, I would welcome a debate on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise the same issue and I endorse the point made by Senator O'Toole.  This is not an issue for political capital but one that has raised concern across the community.  It is imperative that legislation allowing for the renew of sentences is introduced at the earliest possible stage.  I ask the Leader of the House to ensure that it is brought forward.  I would also ask that this House have the opportunity to discuss why in Irish law, incest seems to be treated as a less serious crime than rape.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to my horror at the Kilkenny case, I would like to express my personal horror at the judgment given yesterday and reported in today's papers.  I think we should have the opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I make the point, Senator Roche, that the Judiciary is independent of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the independence of the Judiciary but when judges act like asses I cannot understand why we cannot comment on it.  The suggestion that people from a nomadic or particular group in the community should be treated differently in the case of sentencing for rape appals me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a ruling, Senator Roche, and you have breached it somewhat.  I made the point very clearly that the Judiciary is totally independent <Col N="290" /> of this House.  Judgments of a jury constituted court cannot be the subject of review or discussion in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the point that the issue of sentencing should be brought forward at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The sale of the State's share in Greencore has caused great public concern.  I support the request for a debate on the matter.  A debate is being allowed in the Dáil at 4 p.m. and in view of the fact that we want to show people that the Seanad discussion is relevant when such matters arise, I appeal for a debate on the issue tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the call for a debate on the Greencore issue.  Last week and the week before the Leader of the House was asked when time would be made available for a debate on the economy.  We do no see any listings on the Order Paper today for such a debate. I would appreciate if the Leader would inform us when he intends to make adequate time available for that debate. Decisions, such as the Greencore decision, are being made which affect all the issues that we would like to address in a debate on the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted with your ruling on the matter I tried to raise regarding the demolition of the house in Capel Street.  You said you could not take it due to a lack of Ministerial responsibility. I could not have put it better myself; that is precisely what it is, a total lack of Ministerial responsibility.  I thank you for the happy phrase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume you are not questioning my decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all, I am saying what a wonderful gift for language you have.  You expressed my own thoughts perfectly by talking of the lack of Ministerial responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the tragic case in Kilkenny I would like to add my voice to <Col N="291" /> those who looked for a debate.  I do not entirely agree that it is merely a question of sentencing policy because that, to a certain extent, is barring the door after the horse has bolted.  We must look at the social welfare agencies and how this situation was allowed to drag on for so long with people not wishing to get involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are having a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all I have to say on that matter.</P>
      <P>One of the papers laid before the House is a Report of the Special Committee on the Child Care Bill, 1988.  The Child Care Bill, 1991 was passed by this House last July, yet I understand that the major provisions of that legislation are still not enacted due to what are called budgetary restraints.  I am coming under pressure from constituents working in the area of child care who are concerned at this flouting of the democratic wish of Parliament.  I wonder if the Leader of the House can get us an update on the progress in implementation of the Child Care Bill, 1991.</P>
      <P>Can I ask the Leader of the House to give us an update on the question of the foreign affairs committee, to reassure the House that this will be a joint committee and if possible to give us some kind of time scale.</P>
      <P>Finally, although it was not announced in this House, I welcome the fact that the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn has indicated that she will bring the country into compliance with the judgment in the case I took in the European Court.  May I ask the Leader to suggest respectfully to the Government that since much of the pressure came from all sides of this House, this would be an appropriate House in which to introduce any such proposed Government legislation.  Can the Leader give us a view on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in seeking time from the Leader <Col N="292" /> of the House for a debate, either tomorrow or today, on the Kilkenny rape and incest case.  It is important that this House debate the issues arising from it, particularly in relation to social services, the circumstances surrounding the case and sentencing policies.  Rather than castigate the Judiciary here, it is up to us to provide the guidelines and legislation by which they can act.  It is important that this House debate those matters urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request for a debate on the Greencore issue on the grounds that the newspapers can speculate on who is selling what to who. This House should have an open discussion because there are innuendos and statements being made that are totally incorrect.  It would be a useful exercise to have a discussion in the House on a very important matter such as the sale of shares in a State company.  It would be appropriate for that discussion to take place in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with those who are asking for a debate on the sentencing policy of judges in general and on the options open to judges in cases such as this.</P>
      <P>This case is referred to as the Kilkenny case and it might appear to some people that Kilkenny is a place where people do not have contact with those in trouble. In 1985, the person involved in this case was brought before the Health Board by the social welfare officer and received help from the Health Board but it could not act until a specific complaint was made.  When a specific complaint was made to the Gardai it was acted upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking for a general debate on the matter.  Once a complaint was made to the Garda in Kilkenny both the superintendent and the ban-garda involved treated the case with great sympathy.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>First, on Item No. 3, some time will be made available on that issue. With regard to Senator Manning's views on the Tánaiste's proposed speech later in the week, I am not aware of what is to be said.  Since the first day of this session I have written to the Tánaiste's Office asking him to take on board the wish of this House to have an opportunity to discuss the situation in Northern Ireland. I await his reply.</P>
      <P>In regard to Greencore which was mentioned by several Senators, and Senator Dardis in particular, I will try to arrange with the agreement of the Whips, that we will find time to have a debate on Greencore.  I am confident that both issues raised &mdash; the golden share and the quota &mdash; are enshrined in law and will be safeguarded but hope we will have that debate tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned legislation and the recent court case has also been raised by many Senators.  On the list I circulated, the first piece of legislation to be restored is the Criminal Justice Bill, 1992.  I will convey the views of the House to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice.  I hope that legislation will be back here as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The initial response to my request for legislation to be initiated in this House has been positive and while I am not able to give the House a full list today, I am confident that we will be extremely busy with new legislation in the coming weeks. I hope in the next couple of weeks to be able to give you a extensive list and a very positive response from the Ministers on the type of legislation they would like to initiate in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Neville asked about Item <Col N="294" /> No. 10 on the Order Paper.  That is a matter for the Whips to decide.  Senator Norris asked about the child care legislation and the foreign affairs committee; I will get an update on the Child Care Bill, 1991 and I am confident I will have news about the foreign affairs committee soon.  This will be an Oireachtas joint committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will time be provided either today or tomorrow to discuss the Kilkenny case?  I agree there is an element of the Criminal Justice Bill involved here but I believe, there is a very specific matter that needs to be dealt with in the House immediately, that is the terms of reference of the inquiry to be set up by the Minister for Health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, thank you for the opportunity to speak briefly on this matter.  This Order is in effect EC Directive 92/20 and by complying with it we are actually extending winter time by a week.  Rather than extending winter time we should extend summer time. People working in factories or offices who are involved in sport and sportsmen and women, people who go training, gardeners, etc., would benefit from this additional hour of daylight.  I know many people involved in sport who do not start training until the middle of May or June. We should use our influence in Europe to get unanimity on this measure within the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The order raised some important elements that should be brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice.  The first is that while winter time ends in a synchronised manner in the rest of Europe, it does not begin in a synchronised manner.  We have a crazy <Col N="296" /> situation every year for three or four weeks when winter begins in September in mainland Europe whereas in Ireland and the UK it starts a few weeks later and it is almost impossible to synchronise our situation with main land Europe during those three weeks.  My second point is a wider issue.  I believe the time has come for us to join central European time instead of being out of step with the rest of Europe.  The fact that we are an hour out of step makes it much more difficult for us to sell to Europe.  It means our offices lose time on telephones contacting them because we cannot contact them at the beginning or end of each day and it makes it more difficult for business people to travel from Ireland to Europe. In short, being an hour behind adds to our peripheral position which is already a disadvantage; not only does it not help us but it adds to our disadvantage in that area.  Changing the time would bring us other benefit as well.  As Senator Enright said there would be longer evenings throughout the year, savings on energy costs and a reduction in road accidents. These benefits were all demonstrated in the experiment that took place in the 1960s, but unfortunately the figures were misunderstood in Britain and we fell into line behind her.  Twenty years later we are much more a part of Europe.  We are much more ready to take a step out of the nursery and away from nanny for a change.  I suggest that we take the lead in bringing our clocks into line with mainland Europe and I am sure if we do so the British will follow us on this occasion.  I hope the Minister for Justice will take that into account in urging us to link with mainland Europe in future rather than automatically following our neighbour.</P>

      <P>I support the general thrust of what Senators Enright and Quinn have said and I remind the House that the origin of this anachronism is historic in that we were linked to Britain.  I am not so sure that what Senator Quinn said in relation to the UK following us if we were to change to central European time is true, mainly because there is a very powerful farming lobby mainly centred <Col N="297" /> in the northern part of the UK where they say there would be disparities and it would not be helpful in the agricultural sector.  However, I felt that the occasion should not be allowed to pass without supporting the general thrust of the argument put forward by my colleagues on the other side of the House.  This area should be addressed as a matter of urgency in the context of this Order and any future order coming before the House.  We should conform to central European time because the benefits as outlined by Senator Enright in particular are very obvious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators will be aware from the explanatory memorandum already circulated the purpose of this Bill is to increase the authorised share capital of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta by £22.5 million, that is from £77.5 million to £100 million, to authorise the Minister for Finance to subscribe for shares up to the new level of £100 million and to increase the Company's facility to borrow under ministerial guarantee by £20 million, from the existing limit of £180 million to £200 million.  The text of the Bill is in standard format and I hope will not give rise to any major difficulty.</P>
      <P>Over the past 30 years the company and its financial difficulties has been the subject of much attention and debate within the Oireachtas and elsewhere.  I will now briefly outline the background which has given rise to the necessity for this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>NET was established in 1961 as a State <Col N="298" /> sponsored body to manufacture nitrogenous fertilisers at Arklow. The company started in a relatively modest way but expanded to the stage where after the completion of the Marino Point plant in 1979 it was one of our largest manufacturing companies and a major chemical undertaking employing over 1,500 persons.  While the Arklow plant operated profitably up to the early 1970s the growth of import competition pushed it into a loss making situation from 1974.  By early 1973 NET was already considering a new facility at Marino Point to manufacture ammonia from oil but following the discovery of gas off Kinsale, the Government decided that an allocation of gas for ammonia manufacture should be made to NET.</P>
    <P>To put matters in perspective, it should be recalled that at that time Irish gas consumption, including LPG, was around 200,000 tonnes of oil equivalent or approximately 80 million therms annually. Therefore new major customers had to be found for the 450 million therm potential annual gas flow &mdash; which was almost six times the national consumption &mdash; to enable the commercial development of the field.  After negotiations between NET (and ESB) with Marathon, pricing terms were agreed for the 20 year take or pay contracts as they are called.  These terms largely reflected the capital costs of developing the field and were then incorporated in the 20 year legal agreements with Bord Gáis Éireann Teoranta.</P>
    <P>The construction of the Marino Point plant to produce ammonia from natural gas and the cost overruns which pushed the final cost of this project up to £137 million, has been the subject of much examination and controversy in the past including an Oireachtas report in April 1981.  The effect of this expenditure, which was largely funded by borrowings, was to leave NET with a burden of debt from which they have never freed themselves despite extensive support from State funds.</P>
    <P>The State support afforded has been of enormous proportions.  Initially the <Col N="299" /> Arklow plant was funded by borrowings. The Nítrigin Eireann Teoranta Act, 1963, had set the issued share capital at only £100 but provided for State advances of up to £6 million and a facility to borrow £1 million with a ministerial guarantee. In 1970 the company was put on a more commercial basis when the share capital was increased to £7.5 million, including £3.5 million in the capitalisation of State advances, and the limit for loan guarantees increased to £2 million.</P>
    <P>As the construction of the Marino Point plant advanced the share capital was increased in 1977 to £27.5 million and the limit for State guarantees increased to £30 million.  By 1981 it was necessary, because of the company's dire financial situation to come back to the Oireachtas to provide another £100 million for NET, £50 million by way of additional equity and a further £50 million in State guarantees for its borrowings.  In 1987 with the setting up of the joint venture with ICI, the old core debt of over £160 million was left with NET and, as senators will recall, legislation was introduced to increase the limit for ministerial guarantees on NET's borrowings from £150 million to £180 million to enable the issue of a State guarantee for the full debt.</P>
    <P>By the early 1980s it was clearly recognised that because of the cost overruns and operating losses in the early years of the Marino Point plant a substantial part of the NET debt was a sunk cost which could not be expected to be recovered. The overall size of the debt and the costs of servicing it were such as to keep the future of NET's fertilizer business and that of its employees in constant jeopardy.</P>
    <P>However, the future of the business was safeguarded with the formation of the joint venture with Imperial Chemical Industries in 1987 whereby NET's fertilizer businesses at Cork and Arklow and ICI's Richardsons Fertilizers at Belfast were transferred to the new joint venture company, Irish Fertilizer Industries Ltd. NET's old core capital debt, most of which was guaranteed by the State as you will recall, was left with NET.  As a result <Col N="300" /> of these arrangements Irish Fertilizer Industries and the future of its workforce is no longer under any threat by reason of the debt which has been left with NET. This is an important point to put forward.</P>
    <P>Under the joint venture arrangements NET took a 51 per cent shareholding in the new company with ICI taking the remaining 49 per cent.  In addition NET entered into a long term agreement with IFI for the supply of its gas allocation at an arm's length price to IFI.  The old accumulated NET debt, which was £164.6 million on 30 September 1987, remained with NET with the intention that NET would service the borrowings involved from its income from profits on the sale of gas to Irish Fertilizer Industries Limited and dividends from that company.  Since 1987 therefore NET's primary activity has been the management of its debt portfolio as well as managing a gas contract and monitoring IFI.  It is basically now a financial holding company.</P>
    <P>While the new joint venture company, Irish Fertilizer Industries Limited, has operated quite profitably since it commenced trading on 1 October 1987, the combined income accruing to NET from its profits on the sale of gas and from dividends from IFI has been insufficient to fully cover the interest payable on NET's borrowings.  The shortfall in interest has had to be converted into new State guaranteed borrowings with the result that overall borrowings have continued to grow and have now reached £180 million.  This is the maximum that may be guaranteed by the State under the provisions of the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Acts.</P>
    <P>The following figures I think illustrate the situation &mdash; at the setting up of the joint venture in 1987, the debt remaining with NET, after working capital adjustments, was £164.6 million.  Over the ensuing five years ending on the 30 September 1992, on a cash flow basis NET received a net income of £70.9 million from IFI but the interest payments on its massive debt over those five years amounted to £85.2 million &mdash; a shortfall of £14.3 million.  The addition to this <Col N="301" /> shortfall of operating expenses left NET with a closing debt of £179.9 million on 30 September 1992.</P>
    <P>The principal reason for the shortfall in NET's income and the consequential build up in its debt, has been the comparative weakness over recent years of oil prices in Irish pound terms.  It is on oil prices that the basic price that Irish Fertilizer Industries pays NET for its supply of natural gas is based.  While the economy at large has benefited considerably from the reduction in international prices, in Irish pound terms, for oil, the reverse has been the case for NET.  NET's financial flow has been dependent on four very volatile elements.  These are fertiliser profits, interest rates, the dollar/pound exchange rates and international oil prices.  The behaviour of the three latter elements over the past five years has proved less favourable to NET than earlier expected. Senators will be aware of how volatile these indicators can be.</P>
    <P>There was, in fact, a slight improvement in NET's financial situation during 1991, with oil prices high because of the Gulf War and more buoyant prices for fertilisers.  However, the position severely deteriorated from the beginning of 1992 with oil prices dropping to their lowest in Irish pound terms since 1987. Therefore, the basic gas price payable by Irish Fertilizer Industries was consequently the lowest in five years.  With only a marginal reduction in the purchase price payable by NET to Bord Gáis Éireann for gas, NET's profit margin on sales to Irish Fertilizer Industries Limited was severely reduced.  At the end of 1991, reflecting the buoyant conditions of 1991, NET's net debt situation on a cash flow basis, i.e., borrowings less cash reserves, had come down to £171 million. However, by the end of September 1992 this had risen to £179.9 million.</P>
    <P>Since September 1992 the already difficult position of NET has worsened considerably because of the devaluation of sterling and the currency crisis.  NET was affected in two ways: first, because over 55 per cent of its borrowings are at floating rates, the rise in interest rates greatly <Col N="302" /> increased its interest costs and, secondly, because a substantial proportion of IFI's income is dependent on returns from the UK, both by way of sales in Britain and in the returns of its Northern Ireland subsidiary, the devaluation of sterling impacted on the profits of Irish Fertilizer Industries for 1991-92 and, consequently, NET's income from that company.</P>
    <P>Because of this worsening situation, NET's borrowing requirements reached £181.6 million by the end of November 1992 and, as the excess over £180 million could not be rolled over into further bank borrowings because of the £180 million legislative limit on guaranteed borrowings, £1.96 million was issued to the company by way of repayable Exchequer advances.  This was the maximum that could be provided under the Exchequer advances provision of the NET Acts, but was sufficient only to maintain the solvency of NET to near the end of December, when further major payments became due.  In order to enable NET to meet these payments, a grant of £6 million had to be voted for the company in December 1992 to give it sufficient funds to meet interest payments due up to March 1993.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that over these five years, NET's borrowings were covered by a ministerial guarantee as to payment of both principal and interest and if NET were to default on payment of interest on any particular loans as they fell due, the State, as guarantor, would have become immediately liable to pay.  A default in any payment by NET would have immediate consequences on its future ability to trade and its solvency with direct responsibility for all its borrowings then falling on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>NET's financial difficulties can be traced directly back in time to the cost overruns, funded largely by borrowings in the late 1970s, on the construction of the £137 million Marino Point plant, which manufactures ammonia and urea from natural gas.  In retrospect, while as a result of this investment we have a strong competitive fertiliser industry employing 700 people on this island, it has been at a very high cost to the taxpayer. <Col N="303" /> The current situation is that NET has debts in excess of £180 million with the realisable value of its assets probably now worth much less than that.  These assets are its favourable gas contract with Bord Gáis Éireann and its 51 per cent shareholding in IFI.  Therefore, it must be recognised that a substantial proportion of its £180 million debt is, as it is known, a sunk cost, which will not be recovered within NET's future income by way of gas price and dividends from IFI.  With NET's income over the past five years inadequate to even cover the interest on its borrowings, the rolling over of each year's shortfall in interest payments, into new guaranteed borrowings, only further increases the debt which will ultimately have to be met by the State.</P>
    <P>An option that has been considered over the past year has been the sale of NET's shares in Irish Fertilizer Industries Limited.  Freed from the old core debt that remained with NET, Irish Fertilizer Industries has been trading very profitably. The Government is interested in discussing with potential purchasers a sale of shares in this highly profitable company, but only at the right price. A number of parties have expressed an interest in that company, particularly since the time that the minority shareholder, ICI, indicated its intention to reduce substantially its fertiliser interests in the UK.</P>
    <P>A sale of its shares in IFI on satisfactory terms could substantially improve NET's liquidity situation in the short to medium-term, but this would also necessitate the negotiation of a new gas agreement.  It would also remove any conflict that might arise between NET's need to maximise receipts from IFI to meet its short-term debt servicing requirements and IFI's needs to retain earnings to fund future growth.  While NET has had discussions with interested parties, no definitive offer was made to them.  If such an offer was made, it would be a matter first for the board of NET to consider but ultimately a matter for Government decision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> In the meantime, provision has to be made to enable NET to continue to meet its debts.  I must stress that unless this action is taken NET will be insolvent by the end of March, leading to the prospect of responsibility for its £180 million in borrowings and the interest accruing, falling directly on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Several amendments to this Bill were moved by the Opposition during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil, the effect of which were to provide for an authorised share capital much lower than the £100 million proposed and a limit on guarantee levels much lower than the £200 million proposed.  However, the purpose of the Bill is to provide not only for NET's immediate solvency crisis but also, by providing the enabling mechanisms, to put the Government in the position to protect NET's solvency over the next few years.  For this reason, the Seanad will note I have not accepted these amendments.</P>
    <P>During the Dáil debate, a common issue raised related to the supply of gas to NET and IFI and the question of greater transparency in gas prices.  This is a complex question but I feel it should be answered.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the favourable gas contract negotiated by NET in the early 1970s, and covered by legal contracts, is regarded as an asset of NET. There would be no financial gain to the State in setting aside this contract and transferring the benefit from it to another body, as the profit on gas sales is needed to service NET's borrowings which would otherwise have to be serviced from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>As regards Irish Fertilizer Industries, the position is that the company, under agreements executed in 1987, has contractual rights to a supply of gas from NET under a set pricing formula largely based on international oil prices.  This gas is put to productive use in that it is used to produce 500,000 tonnes of ammonia at Marino Point.  Some 40 per cent of the ammonia is consumed at Marino Point in the manufacture of over 300,000 tonnes of urea and 16,000 tonnes of liquid CO2. Another 200,000 tonnes is used at <Col N="305" /> Arklow which, combined with Irish sourced limestone and dolomite, produces over 500,000 tonnes of calcium ammonium nitrate.  A further 100,000 tonnes of ammonia is sent to Belfast. Assuming the value of gas on the basis of the price of heavy fuel oil, the value added by IFI in producing product which would otherwise be imported would be four to five times the value of the gas used or the value of the oil supplanted, if the gas was substituted elsewhere in the economy for oil.</P>
    <P>As regards the price paid by IFI for its gas supply, this must remain confidential for commercial reasons.  IFI operate in a highly competitive market, both at home and abroad, in an industry dominated by major multinational companies using their muscle to increase market share. The gas price is the main cost factor in IFI's production process.  Knowledge formally of a competitor's cost base is the essential information needed to attack that competitor's market, as it enables one to know how far down in price one must go to put a competitor out of business. IFI would have no confirmed knowledge of their competitors' cost bases and should not be put in a commercially damaging position by having their major cost base published formally.  In any event, gas prices paid by other industrial consumers in Ireland are not published and accurate comparisons on a one-to-one basis are, therefore, not possible.</P>
    <P>Another complicating factor in energy pricing is the excise duty on oil.  Prior to the recent budget, heavy fuel oil used by the ESB was subject to an excise duty of almost £16 per tonne, the equivalent of nearly 4p per therm.  Gas oil attracted a higher rate of around £44 per tonne or the equivalent of 11p per therm.  However, European practice, which has now been enshrined in an EC directive, did not apply excise to oil used as a feedstock or raw material and, consequently, this element was not reflected in European prices for gas used as a feedstock, such as the Dutch F benchmark.  If this excise element was excluded, I am confident that we would find that there was very little difference between the price paid <Col N="306" /> over the past five years by ESB to Bord Gáis Éireann and that paid by IFI to NET.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the NET Bill will commend itself to the Seanad and I commend the Bill to the House for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to this House and, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I wish him every success in his brief.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill and we will not be voting against it.  While we have reservations about it, the seriousness of the situation obliges us to support the general principle of this Bill.  If this Bill is not passed by the end of this month, NET will be unable to meet its debts and the company will be insolvent.  Therefore, we feel obliged, in the interests of the company, the workers and the country to support an extension of borrowing.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 700 people involved in this industry and all of those are located in Ireland where we have a duty to maintain employment at this particular time.  The creation of jobs is important but the maintenance of existing employment is also of immense importance.  That is not to say that we should maintain jobs simply for the sake of it; jobs should be productive and cost effective.  In this instance I hope the Minister will see how employment might be improved and ensure that the overall level of efficiency is examined.</P>
      <P>One of the items contributing to the worsening financial situation of the company is the fact that devaluation did not occur at an earlier stage.  Fifty five per cent of the company's borrowings are at floating rates and the rise in interest rates increased the interest repayble.  It is easy to be wise after the event but during September many people thought it too early to devalue; there was always a hope that some of our European partners might assist us in our currency crisis.  We might have devalued our currency in September or October but in January, when devaluation finally occurred, it exacerbated an already difficult situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" /> There is also the question of the availability of the gas being supplied from Kinsale and it is important to examine this situation.  The Government is faced with the question of whether to import oil to manufacture these fertilisers or to avail of our own natural gas supply.  I favour using our own available natural gas supply.  I do not object to our natural resources being utilised even at a subsidised price to avoid importing oil.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined in his speech the number of fertilisers produced in Ireland and it is important to bear that in mind. Most if not all of these items would have to be imported otherwise and while we have an existing manufacturing industry we should continue to avail of it.  If the agricultural community became totally dependant on imported fertilisers, increased costs would ensue and we do not know what price mechanisms would be used.  We would be pitted against huge multinationals and while we have a fertiliser manufacturing industry we should do what we can to retain it.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the question of the sale of shares in IFI.  I am not certain how that is going, whether it is being actively examined at present and whether IFI shares will be sold.  All I can say is that if the sale of IFI shares is being considered I hope lessons will be learned from mistakes made during the last few days over the sale of shares in Greencore. I say that in everybody's interest.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to score political points but when the Government is selling or considering selling shares, it is important in Parliament and nationally, that we do not become involved in internal wrangles and debates detrimental to the country. People who might consider investing here may be deterred by the internal wrangling taking place in relation to Greencore.</P>
    <P>The Government is in its early stages, but it behoves each of us to present ourselves as a nation first and foremost.  We have a duty when representing Ireland abroad to do so in a unified manner rather than in the manner of the past few days.</P>
    <P>In regard to this the overall level of <Col N="308" /> borrowings has vastly increased from £7.5 million in 1970.  This cannot continue. I support on this occasion this enabling measure to increase the company's borrowings but borrowings cannot continue to rise indefinitely.  The situation must be examined to see how this debt can be curtailed because otherwise it will sink Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta.</P>
    <P>We have a number of short amendments to this Bill but overall we are not opposing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House on his first visit to the new Seanad and wish him well.</P>
      <P>The Bill is hardly the most cheerful to come before the House but it is necessary for all that.  NET as a company has a long, contentious and troubled financial history.  The Minister has referred to some of the factors that have contributed to that, not least the severe competition in the fertiliser industry together with the major over-runs in the construction of the plant at Marino Point in the 1970s. This has been very expensive for the taxpayer in turn.  That is the negative side of it.</P>
      <P>Following the establishment of this company we now have a strong, competitive, indigenous fertiliser industry providing 700 valuable jobs at a time of severe unemployment.  Some 500 of these jobs are spread between the Arkow and Marino Point plants and the remainder in Northern Ireland in the new joint venture between NET and Imperial Chemicals, namely Irish Fertiliser Industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of Marino Point &mdash; I was a member of the Oireachtas Committee that analysed its over-run &mdash; was £137 million.  Construction was bedevilled by a number of problems, not least unofficial strikes, and it is heartening to note that now and for several years past we have had a much more stable, orderly and acceptable industrial relations environment. Unofficial strikes have greatly diminished in number compared to the 1960s and 1970s.  We went through a recession and encountered severe competition during the 1980s which brought <Col N="309" /> a new realism to bear on both employer and trade union behaviour in industrial relations.  Prior to 1987 &mdash; before the joint venture between NET and Imperial Chemicals &mdash; the future of the industry and the jobs it provided were under threat.  Therefore, the joint venture &mdash; 51 per cent to NET and 49 per cent to Imperial Chemicals &mdash; was particularly welcome.  An important beneficial effect of the joint venture was to safeguard the industry and the jobs.  A major outstanding problem was the old debt which, as the Minister pointed out, was in excess of £160 million and is now £180 million. Since 1987 NET's financial holding company has three functions; first, to manage the debts guaranteed by the State, and hence the relevance of the Bill today, second, to manage the contract with Bord Gáis to supply gas at a profit to Irish Fertilizer Industries and, third, to monitor its own interest of 51 per cent in Irish Fertilizers.</P>
    <P>It is good to hear that Irish Fertilizer Industries is trading profitably and is a very healthy company.  However, NET's present income derives solely from dividends from Irish Fertilizer Industries, and at the best of times the fertiliser industry is cyclical, thus, profits will go up and down; on the one hand, dividends provide an income and, on the other, there are the profits from the gas contract. I can see why the Minister does not wish to disclose for confidentiality and competitive reasons the price paid to NET for the gas by Irish Fertilizer Industries. My guess is that Irish Fertilizer Industries probably pays the going rate for energy supply in European fertiliser plants.  However, I accept the Minister's reasons for not divulging the cost of the gas from NET to Irish Fertilizers.</P>
    <P>The income from dividends and the profit on the gas contract have not been sufficient over the past five years to pay the interest on the debt, not to mention any capital repayments.  Therefore, this Bill is both timely and very necessary because the financial support it provides will be required by the end of this month. The Bill provides for an increase of £22.5 million in the authorised share capital, <Col N="310" /> bringing it to a limit of £100 million, and the borrowing limit is being increased by £20 million to a total of £200 million guaranteed by the Minister.  Without doubt the debt is large and I agree with the previous speaker on that.  To add to the difficulty, as the Minister underlined, NET operates in a volatile and turbulent environment, which is subject to cyclical movements.  The interest rates on the debt have been very high for some time. It is in the interests of both NET and the economy generally that we do what we can domestically to reduce interest rates and, hopefully, in the international markets things will improve on that front.</P>
    <P>The dollar-pound exchange rate is adverse from the company's viewpoint but the present low oil prices also affect NET.  Low oil prices are very welcome for the economy as a whole but we are concerned with their specific impact on NET.  The price of oil is linked to the price of gas; low oil prices dampen the price of gas and, therefore, the profit gained by NET from selling on to IFI.  In addition, since September the devaluation of sterling and the currency crisis have added to the company's difficulties. A range of pressures combined to necessitate in December 1992 a £6 million grant being voted to cover interest payments to the end of March and thus to keep NET solvent.</P>
    <P>With regard to the sale of the company I am sure that the Minister and his Department are monitoring possibilities. The 51 per cent shareholding in IFI is valuable but there is no point selling unless the right price can be achieved.  In terms of the national interest as well as the interests of NET, the Minister and his Department will take all relevant factors into account should a suitable purchaser come on the scene to buy that 51 per cent.  It would involve a renegotiation of the gas contract and that is an intricate matter.</P>
    <P>The bottom line for this Bill is that it is essential to keep NET solvent.  If there is no action from this point forward the company will become insolvent and liability for the debt will eventually fall on the Exchequer and the taxpayer.  Therefore, <Col N="311" /> it makes for logic and common sense to pass this legislation as speedily as possible and thus keep NET solvent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senators Hillery and Enright in welcoming the Minister to the House.  On one occasion after taking note of my height, the Minister said he liked to speak after me because he did not have to lower the microphone.</P>
      <P>What we are discussing is a gamble that has not paid off and we are now being asked to pick up the bill for errors of judgment made in the past.  The intention was that the fertiliser business would be floated off to a new company, unencumbered by debt, and would trade in the real world.  The original NET company operate on the basis of one asset and one liability &mdash; the liability of the debt and the asset of the gas contract with the fertiliser company.</P>
      <P>The gamble we took in 1987 was that the profit from selling the gas to IFI combined with the profits from the joint venture company together, would be enough to cover all the interest on the debts NET had incurred over those years.  That has not worked due to misfortune, misadventure or, dare I say it, even mismanagement. We are being asked to pick up the debts because this gamble has not paid off.</P>
      <P>Since 1987, neither income from the gas contract nor dividends from IFI was sufficient to cover NET's debt.  On the one hand, the profit from selling the gas was less than expected because of low world energy prices and on the other hand, profits from the fertiliser trading company were much lower than expected.  These factors have caused this problem.</P>
      <P>The gamble has failed and what I am quarrelling about today is our response to that failure.  Instead of facing up to the fact that this arrangement is clearly not going to balance the books nor is it ever likely to do so, we are proposing to continue that arrangement by injecting, as is proposed in this Bill, another shot of State money and telling NET to try again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been rushed in at the last <Col N="312" /> moment, understandably, to prevent the almost imminent insolvency of NET. However, it puts a gun to the head of the Oireachtas.  When the Bill is passed all the urgency and energy will disappear and with it will go any desire to finally resolve the problem.  We should not be passing this Bill; rather we should be facing up to the fact that the last creative solution of 1987, if I might call it that, has not worked.  This Bill does not regularise the situation.  It does not tidy up the matter and it does not even put the trading company back on to an even keel. We should and could do all these things and let me explain how I propose we could do them.</P>
    <P>First, we should abolish NET.  There is no reason for its continued existence. The Minister in his speech said: &ldquo;Since 1987, therefore, NET's primary activity has been the management of its debt portfolio as well as managing a gas contract and monitoring IFI.&rdquo;  I suggest that is its only function.  Therefore, we could abolish NET and transfer its share in the join venture in IFI to the State.  I am not talking about abolishing IFI.  I am talking about abolishing NET and transferring its share to the State.  I am not sure which Department should deal with this transfer, but the investment could then be controlled directly by the relevant Department instead of what is proposed at present.  The dividends from the company can flow directly into the State coffers rather than into a holding company like NET, and they would then appear in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>Secondly, NET's other asset, the gas contract, should be transferred to Bord Gáis Éireann.  They should sell the gas directly to the trading company, to IFI. They should pick up the profit directly on behalf of the State and then remunerate the State accordingly by means of a dividend.</P>
    <P>Finally, NET's debts should then be transferred to the State and accepted as the liability it clearly is, a debt we are not going to recoup.  The debt, as I think the Minister has in mind, could be managed directly by the National Treasury Agency <Col N="313" /> instead of on a secondhand basis as is proposed.</P>
    <P>Essentially, the only justification for having a holding company is if it is viable and can actually cover its debt.  Since NET cannot cover its debt the justification for its existence disappears.  My proposal would mean a clean slate all round, something we hoped for on the last occasion but did not get.</P>
    <P>With that clean slate the trading company, IFI, whether the State keeps its share in it or, as has been suggested, sells it on, would finally emerge from the shadow of this large mountain of debt. The company would then be able to trade on its own merits.  The people who work in IFI would then be able to concentrate on the future of their own company and they would not be thrown off course by debates such we are having here today about a holding company that has now become almost totally irrelevant.  If the trading company is viable in the long term, and I believe it is, then its viability will be clear to all.</P>
    <P>There are many things we cannot do at this stage.  We cannot, for instance, rewrite the policy that has poured a quarter of our natural gas resources into the production of fertiliser at a price only a fraction of the open market price.  We cannot get back the State's huge investment in NET.  We cannot, now or in the future, realistically expect that the trading company will produce enough profits to pay off the interest on the huge mountain of debt that exists.  What we can do is to put things straight.  Once and for all we could stop sweeping the problem under the carpet.  By not dealing comprehensively with the matter now it means the problem must come before the Oireachtas each time there is an emergency. Then we use the big stick and say if certain things are not done jobs will go.  Those are the words we are hearing today.  The truth is there is no reason for the jobs in IFI to be entangled with the financial morass that has happened here. Our task today should be to clear away that morass and not to further entangle the State.  I believe we can do that if we adopt the proposals I have made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach seo.  I also congratulate him on this Bill. It is never a pleasant job for a Minister to have to introduce a Bill to raise money to safeguard companies but the fertiliser industry is important to this country and it is important to retain jobs.  If this company was allowed to collapse and 700 people lost their jobs we would have had cries from all quarters asking why the Government did not step in and do something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn spoke about the Government taking a gamble.  At the time the Government probably thought they were making a good deal and that profits would repay the debt and the interest.  Unfortunately that has not happened. It is easy to be wise with hindsight. I look at the matter in a practical way. namely, if 700 people were to lose their jobs the cost of importing fertiliser, and the cost of redundancy would far outweigh what is now proposed.  While it may be regarded as a stop-gap measure we are keeping the company afloat until better times.  I have always said the Government should try to keep companies afloat and perhaps it should attempt this more often.  Closing down a company is like the county council putting tenants out on the street if they cannot pay the rent or mortgage.  It is very foolish because they will have to rehouse them.  If the Government closes down an industry the taxpayers have to pay the workers their social welfare entitlements.  Only last week there was so much ado about jobs being lost in Galway, which is very sad.  The only good news during the week was the announcement of a number of new jobs in the computer industry.  The same week in my own little village we opened a new factory which created 37 new jobs, the only factory of its kind in Ireland, and with the most modern machinery in Europe.  I was very disappointed that RTE did not consider it worth its while to send a crew to cover this good news but it sent three crews to Galway and another crew around the country publicising bad news. That is a pity because with the exception <Col N="315" /> of Gay Byrne, Joe Duffy and Pat Kenny, RTE seems hell-bent on promoting the worst possible news to demoralise society.  That is sad because a little factory in Grange creating 37 jobs in a village that already had over 200 people employed was big news.  Such is the way the media operate.</P>
    <P>I see from the Minister's speech that the new joint venture company, Irish Fertilizer Industries Limited, has operated profitably since it commenced trading on 1 October 1987 and that the combined income accruing to NET from its profits on the sale of gas and from dividends from IFI has been insufficient to fully cover the interest payable on NET's borrowings. Maybe in the transfer NET should not have had to carry the full debt. They took over a clean slate and, while it is easy to see with hindsight, perhaps at that time it was the best deal possible.</P>
    <P>This Bill should have been brought in two or three months ago when it might have been possible for the Minister to appoint a task force to examine the situation. Now our back is to the wall and the Minister's move is timely as we cannot afford any more bad national publicity or to let an industry close.</P>
    <P>Where huge tax bills force private companies to close, the Minister should enable the companies concerned to pay the tax bill over a longer period or to put it on hold.  I have seen banks putting accounts on hold and stopping any further interest because half a loaf is better than no bread.  In many facets of Irish industrial life we should ask the Government to be more vigilant and helpful because we cannot afford to lose any more jobs.  We must ensure that every job we have now is retained and that more are created.  We are all in the one boat.  We must preserve our good image and prevent further liquidations.</P>
    <P>We have received too much adverse publicity over the last 12 months that has damaged industry and has destroyed the morale of many good businessmen.  We must not allow this to happen; we cannot allow anything to close down.  I thank the <Col N="316" /> Minister for bringing in this Bill and I support it fully.  We must safeguard jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his attendance here today.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us is not a pleasant one.  We have to ask ourselves certain fundamental questions.  &ldquo;Are we going to follow a series of bad decisions with one more?&rdquo;  Easy decisions may not be the best decisions even if they are expensive. I concede that in this case we are faced with some tough decisions given the employment content of what we are discussing.  The Minister mentioned the need to protect solvency and said that if we get to a point of £180 million plus interest, the company will be insolvent by the end of March.  The question is whether it is a State function to protect insolvency rather than to create solvency?</P>
      <P>What is the Government's broader policy with regard to the future of NET and will the legislation before us today allow the implementation of such a policy?  The answer to that question is probably that we do not have a sense of a broader policy in relation to this and other matters.  It is appalling that over the past two weeks legislation coming before the House has in one instance asked us to give more money to the National Stud and this week we are being asked to give more money to Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta.  I do not say it is wrong to give money to either of those worthy bodies but it is symptomatic of a broader economic disease that we come into this House regularly seeking more money for this, that and the other.  Is that the right thing to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past we had to take B &amp; I's losses on board so that we could dispose of the company and that was the right decision.  However, is the State going to be asked to absorb growing amounts of debt and, at the end of the day, be forced to dispose of the company at a knock down price to somebody with no interest in the Irish economy, in Irish agriculture or in Irish jobs?  It is in that context that we need to discuss this Bill.  The Minister must pursue a clear legislative approach <Col N="317" /> which gives expression to the implementation of policies rather than continue with recent measures which are not in the interests of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I take the point that 700 jobs are at risk in Marino Point.  If we created confidence within the economy we might be able, using our own resources, and without having to find this type of money, to sustain those 700 jobs and to create extra jobs.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Farrell's remarks about the bad news aspect of life which we seem to have with us all the time.  We could do with an injection of confidence which would lead to the creation of extra jobs and a greater degree of self reliance. Does this type of legislative measure generate the confidence we want and the self reliance we need?</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the Bill is designed as a short term measure allowing the State to put more money into a company which has the capacity to absorb huge amounts of scarce resources while at the same time providing little return for the taxpayer's investment.</P>
    <P>The crisis in NET cannot be dealt with in the way we are dealing with it today. Income accruing to NET from its profits on the sale of gas and from dividends from IFI has been insufficient to fully cover the interest payable on NET's borrowings. Is that symptomatic of good financial management by the State and its agencies?  The Minister said that over the five years from 1987 to 30 September 1992, on a cash flow basis, NET received a net income of £70.9 million from IFI but the interest payments on its massive debt over those five years amounted to £85.2 million, a shortfall of £14.3 million. Is that good business or good financial management?  How can we allow these situations to develop where the State must take losses on board?</P>
    <P>I accept the point that NET is a debt management company.  Nevertheless, to use our gas in the production of 500,000 tonnes of ammonia, without a return, is bad business.  The Government needs to take a more long term view of this.</P>
    <P>I do not think the company will ever <Col N="318" /> be able to repay the £180 million owed and this will lead to the State investing more than £0.25 billion in the company. That is an enormous investment.  Will it be £0.25 billion for NET, £0.25 billion for Aer Lingus, £0.25 billion for the B&amp;I and so on?  Where will the money come from?  How do we fund it?  As Irish taxpayers are being asked to pay these bills they are entitled to expect these companies to be well managed with the maximum commercial return for the benefit of the employees, the country and themselves.  There is little evidence that we are prepared to make some difficult and necessary decisions about these matters. It is a questionable area of State activity and one where continuing State involvement gives rise to serious concern.</P>
    <P>At one time we might have regarded it as important to have an indigenous State fertiliser industry and one could have argued that we were securing supplies for the agricultural industry and for farmers and that we were giving them value in what they were applying to their land as fertiliser.  Perhaps there was a degree of thinking that it would have been appropriate to subsidise it to some extent so as to generate extra output, extra production and more jobs.</P>
    <P>According to my information, nitrogen requirement in 1970 was 80,000 tonnes of nutrients; by 1986 this requirement had peaked at 375,000 tonnes.  However, if we study the Common Agricultural Policy reform, the environmental movement and the way agricultural practices are changing to more environmentally friendly systems of production, it is unquestionable that the amount of nutrient being applied to Irish and European land is going to fall.  In Holland the application of nutrients is regulated by law to protect water courses and the environment. I am prepared to concede that this does not apply in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As European and worldwide industry are able to produce nutrients more cheaply for the farming consumer, it is questionable whether the production of fertiliser at the Marino Point plant has a viable future.  This is something we must address.  There has been major restructuring <Col N="319" /> of the fertiliser industry.  I believe there is over-capacity worldwide and that plants in some parts of the world are not in operation.  The future looks bleak for this industry.</P>
    <P>The ammonia and urea plants at Marino Point were originally budgeted to cost £63.5 million.  However, after long delays it cost £137.3 million, double the amount.  This brings us back to the old question: does the State get value for the money invested on behalf of the taxpayer? This type of overrun is a disaster on a grand scale and it would be virtually impossible in those circumstances for Nítrigin Éireann to become a viable commercial company.</P>
    <P>The millstone of debt around the neck of NET was already of crisis proportions and it led to a further State investment of £50 million in share capital.  Unfortunately, that had little effect in turning the company around.  Will we be back here in a few years time looking for money and defending it on spurious grounds?  Who are the beneficiaries?  One could argue that in the past Irish agriculture was a beneficiary.  Unquestionably, the 700 employees are beneficiaries.  I can understand the philosophy which says that those jobs must be protected and defended. However, the net benefit to society at this stage is questionable.</P>
    <P>NET's main functions are to manage the debt, purchase gas from BGE and sell it at a profit to IFI.  The cost of this deal to BGE is staggering.  It is an incredible form of subsidisation of NET. Is this a proper use for the gas?  A search was undertaken to find a partner for NET in the fertiliser industry.  IFI is a joint venture company owned by NET and ICI.  IFI is one of three leading suppliers of fertilisers to the Irish market. However, with a total production of 2.5 million tonnes, it is also a key supplier of ammonium nitrate to other Irish fertiliser blenders.  On the surface, this seemed a straightforward deal which would benefit NET.  However, the truth may be different. According to Culliton, the price NET paid for the gas was one-third the <Col N="320" /> price paid by the ESB and only one-fifth of the price paid by the industrial and residential consumers of natural gas.  If we consider transfer pricing between one agency and another it could lead to a discussion about money disappearing down a drain.  We keep coming back to the point of monitoring and who exercises control on behalf of the taxpayer. Is it possible to estimate the cost to the taxpayer of every bag of fertiliser produced in the country?  That figure could be high and I imagine it is.</P>
    <P>There is little point repeating some of the arguments made in the Dáil. However, one thing which has changed since that debate is Greencore and what is to happen to it.  Certain things which could be said about this.  What was done originally with Greencore was very prudent and good financial management by the State.  It set the company on a sound financial footing.  Now, however, it urgently requires an injection of capital. If it is proposed to sell all or part of the Government's investment in it, that is to be welcomed provided that safeguards for large growers and the golden share are in place.  This type of activity serves as a useful model and could possibly be taken on board for NET.  Who would buy Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta?  Would anyone?  Many people have looked at it, but with a fertiliser market which is likely to contract as a result of over-capacity within the industry, can we expect someone to take over the company, lock, stock and barrel?  The answer to that may not be encouraging.</P>
    <P>There is one final point I wish to raise with the Minister.  I understand the lease of the Marino Point plant to IFI is at a nominal figure.  I also understand that in the accounts there is depreciation of about £12 million to £14 million.  That is what it is costing NET and it is entered as cost of sales.  Is NET responsible for all the debts and all the depreciation, while other people are benefiting from this plant and NET's debt keeps increasing to the point where we have to continually come back to this House and the other House to fund it?</P>
    <P>There are fundamental questions we <Col N="321" /> must ask ourselves about our policy on agencies like this and the way the State manages those agencies to the benefit of the taxpayer.  We should ask whether we should seek these sums of money at all and we should question the amounts we are seeking.  Perhaps we should be looking for smaller amounts and then try to arrest the ongoing haemorrhage in this company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>With other Senators who have spoken today I welcome the Minister to the House.  I wish him well in both jobs he has been selected to do.</P>
      <P>To me this Bill is about jobs.  As others have said today, in the present climate we must strive to protect what we have. Following losses of almost £20 million in 1986 and accumulated debts of £140 million, in 1987 the Government decided to seek a partner so the remaining jobs in NET would not be lost.  Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta as a State-owned company was unfortunate to be hit by a massive downturn in the world market for its products in the 1980s.  This saw a reduction of capacity with plant closures in the chemical industry throughout the world.</P>
      <P>The fact that NET was State-owned was incidental to the problems faced by the company in attempting to generate sufficient profits merely to prevent its debt rising.  Fortunately, ICI at the time were interested in expanding operations in Ireland.  Otherwise the Government would have been faced with the choice of continual equity support for the company in order to prevent its closure with no prospect of long term viability without access to new markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Fertilizer Industries, in which NET has a major shareholding but which in effect is run by ICI, is now a holding company for the debt incurred by NET. Dividends from Irish Fertilizer Industries service this debt.  ICI made consistent losses in its fertiliser division even though Irish Fertilizer Industries continue to report gross operating profits from 1988 onwards.  Fertiliser prices improved in 1990 because of additional demand in eastern Europe which reduced the over-capacity that hitherto depressed prices <Col N="322" /> in Europe.  Nevertheless, the company made a profit of only £6 million on a turnover of £133 million, including the Richardsons business in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>ICI decided in 1991 to withdraw from Irish Fertilizer Industries because of the lack of profitability not only in fertilisers but in chemicals generally.  It decided to concentrate on pharmaceuticals which posed a threat to the 700 jobs in IFI.  In fact, ICI wanted to dispose of their stake in its UK fertiliser interests since 1990 but ran into difficulties with the UK Monopolies Commission.  Originally it had hoped to sell its UK business to the largest operator in Europe, the Finnish Company Kemira.  Had this been accepted, ICI would have offered its stake in IFI to Kemira.</P>
    <P>There is an option in the IFI shareholders' agreement that NET would have to be given first option on the disposal of the 49 per cent stake.  However, the operating profits of IFI have not been sufficient to allow its total debt to be reduced.  The prospect for fertilisers in terms of stronger price growth in the 1990s means a partner can be found without surrendering a State shareholding in the Irish fertiliser industry.  The key attraction for any buyer taking up the ICI shareholding is undoubtedly the favourable gas price of 6p per therm it has with Bord Gáis Éireann, which sells this onto IFI with a mark-up of 115 per cent.  This is well below the price the ESB must pay and is a key to profitability, particularly for the operations in Cork and Arklow.</P>
    <P>By and large, the experience with ICI has been a positive one, but the clauses inserted in the shareholders' agreement, which give the Irish Government a veto on the disposal of the ICI stake, carry important lessons.  The Government can delay the sale of the ICI stake until a suitable partner is found.  I suggest suitable means a partner of sufficient scale, with enough marketing and distribution outlets to avail of the new opportunities in the Single Market and in Eastern Europe.  Given that the Irish Government has incurred heavy expenditure and losses when the fertiliser industry was in <Col N="323" /> the doldrums, it is prudent to allow for an increase in guaranteed borrowing and in the authorised share capital so that no premature sale takes place.  NET has successfully developed a number of products which can enjoy increased sales once we get out of the current recession afflicting the whole of Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>It would be extremely shortsighted if we took the approach suggested in the Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael amendments, which artificially restrict the level of borrowing without reference to the current poor trading conditions in the market-place.  The failure of NET to service its debt would jeopardise the ongoing negotiations about ICI's 49 per cent stake in IFI.  Unfortunately, this is a pavlovian response with which the Labour Party is all to familiar.  When Allied Irish Banks needed the support of the State in the Insurance Corporation of Ireland debacle, the Labour Party did not sit on its hands out of ideological pique.  Instead, we backed proposals to ensure the viability of the bank, put forward by the then Minister for Finance and current Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy John Bruton.  In fairness to Deputy Bruton, he was the architect of the financial package which allowed NET to survive and he accepted the Labour Party's view that the State would have to protect the investment in the national interest and the remaining employees of NET in Arklow and Cork.</P>
    <P>I am genuinely at a loss why this modest Bill, designed to protect the investment made on behalf of the Irish people and to secure employment, should be opposed.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few brief remarks to make.  I regret to say they will be largely negative.  I share the concern some people have expressed about the use of our natural resources, including <Col N="324" /> gas, in that they are apparently to be applied in a manner that requires State subsidy and does not yield anything whatever to the State in revenue.  It may yield something in jobs but I understand the labour content of this operation has been steadily dwindling.</P>
      <P>I question the degree to which this is a good investment, either in money by the State, or of our natural resources for this function in the chemical industry.  I draw the attention of the Minister to the experience of the United Kingdom Government which has similarly dissipated that country's natural resources from the North Sea.  That is my first difficulty with this proposal.  I am not convinced of its efficiency, either in the financial sense or in terms of jobs.</P>
      <P>I also question the extent to which nitrogenous fertilisers will continue to be important.  They carry certain environmental risks and are not environmentally friendly.  In a number of countries throughout the world they have been seriously over-used and there is a move in the direction of returning towards more environmentally and ecologically friendly methods of farming.  They are a quick solution and I do not know that it is necessarily what one would want to encourage on a wholesale basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition I express a more serious reservation regarding the general ecological and environmental situation as far as this company is concerned.  I want to ask the Minister a couple of questions on this matter.  For example, considering that there is an apparent intention on the part of the State to subscribe to some of this new share capital, in other words to invest in it, in addition to giving the company greater flexibility to attract further funds of its own, is the Minister satisfied that this factory in Arklow meets European Community standards in terms of the emission of noxious gases and other elements?  I understand that until quite recently this was not the case and that there was a serious pollution problem particularly noticeable in the area around Shelton Abbey which is a historic seat and a beauty spot.  Can the Minister reassure the House that a condition for <Col N="325" /> the granting of these facilities will be that the impact upon the environment of the continued processing of chemicals in this factory will be monitored?  I also seek an assurance that the appropriate European standards will be applied because I understand that in the past these standards were not applied.</P>
    <P>The modification of smoke stacks and processors will require a considerable amount of capital investment and this would be a better application for State funds rather than providing additional capital for redevelopment of a company in ways that are not particularly environmentally friendly.  I recall a provision called BATNEEC &mdash; the best available technology not exceeding excessive costs &mdash; in the Environmental Protection Agency Bill which seemed a rather dangerous philosophy.  What constitutes a tolerable level of pollution from factories such as this?  One has to be sensitive, particularly in these days when there has been a number of employment calamities involving companies and when people are faced in a very human way with the tragic prospect of losing employment. In a comparatively small town like Arklow a major industry like this is an important employer.  At the same time I am concerned that this factory does not meet the appropriate standards and can the Minister give a reassurance regarding this?  I am prepared to be corrected if standards have been met but if the Minister is not able to reassure the House that. the factory does at the moment meet these standards, will he give an assurance that, as a condition for the granting of this financial facility, the factory will be required to move further in the direction of being environmentally friendly?</P>
    <P>I notice as a consumer of transport that I am frequently stopped at most awkward times by these ghastly ammonia trains that I presume are heading towards Arklow.  The rolling stock appears to have come out of the Ark.  Is the Minister satisfied that this highly dangerous chemical is being transported safely and there is no danger of an accident during transportation?</P>
    <P>I said I would be brief and uncharacteristically <Col N="326" /> I am going to live up to my promise and sit down, having also uncharacteristically ended on a positive flourish.  I question some of the provisions of this Bill and I hope the Minister will be able to give me satisfactory answers.  My experience of the Minister in the House is that he can usually do so. The positive and beneficial atmosphere of co-operation between ICI in the North of Ireland and in the south is to be welcomed. If there were more of this co-operation at the fundamental, basic, practical level of business, of job creation and promotion, we would move towards a much more harmonious island at a satisfactory speed.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill.  I am pleased that Nítrigin Éireann is playing a major role.  We would fully appreciate its role if we were totally dependent on outsiders for the basic materials that Nítrigin Éireann are providing.  I am happy when Ireland invests money in an Irish based industry for the Irish people.  Is is easy to criticise anybody, at the farm end or at the business end and complain about what money was spent and what was lost.  That is a major international company and it has undertaken an important role in Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis said he questioned who would benefit.  The basic material needed by the Irish farming sector is secure thanks to Nítrigin Éireann and I am glad the Minister recognises its need to raise guaranteed finance.  From my knowledge of a small farm, the Irish farming community has suffered for years because it was unable to buy sufficient fertilisers. The price of fertiliser today is still a factor because it is nearly £200 per tonne.  How many people in this House have hands-on knowledge of the cost and the value of a tonne of fertiliser?  It is important to recognise the value and the security of maintaining Nírigin Éireann as a strong company.  It is a native industry, which provides jobs and is a vital component in the agriculture sector, a fundamental <Col N="327" /> industry that we need to encourage and support.</P>
    <P>All too often Irish people have not believed in themselves sufficiently; we subscribed to the mentality that a thing has to be imported or it would not be right.  This generation want to believe in themselves and want to create jobs.  They want Ireland to develop and there are many opportunities for this but knockers, whether in the media or among ourselves, for cheap political advantage discourage those with the guts, determination and willpower necessary to stay in Ireland and provide jobs.</P>
    <P>It behoves us all to recognise NET as a national company prepared to stay in Ireland and to help agriculture, our basis industry.  Fertilisers are a fundamental ingredient in every aspect of agriculture and we cannot produce beef or grass without them.  Even afforestation requires fertilisers.  The Bill is welcome and I compliment the Minister on it.  I encourage him to keep in touch with Nítrigin Éireann and to ask it to be mindful of its end product and of the pressures upon those who purchase its produce.  It should be mindful of competitiveness and of the ever increasing and escalating cost to those who use fertilisers.  It is an expensive cash input of those working on the ground and I ask the Minister to ensure that Nítrigin Éireann sells fertilisers on a competitive basis with the rest of the European farming community. This is an important Bill and I welcome its introduction here.</P>

    <P>In its first 20 years, therefore, NET was a remarkable success.  By 1980 employment in the company in the <Col N="328" /> Arklow area alone peaked at 1,150 people.  At the end of that year the decision to scale the company down was taken by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley. The rationalisation programme in NET had a devastating impact.  I am going through NET's history because I want to take up some points made by Senator Dardis when he was asking in a rhetorical way what should now be done with NET. We should learn from the mistakes of history how to put this company back on a firm foundation.</P>
    <P>The rationalisation programme in NET had a devastating impact on the area of Arklow.  Employment in the company's plant at Shelton Abbey was slashed from 1,150 to just 500 people between 1981 and 1983.  The company payroll in Arklow was further reduced over the next nine years to 200 people and there are approximately 210 people on the payroll in Arklow at present.  Just over 250 people are employed in the Cork plant and with the plant in Belfast the total employment in IFI the new company is approximately 700 people.  This company cannot be described as one which has not tried to rectify past mistakes; it is certainly not as Senator Dardis described it.</P>
    <P>Between 1980 and the early 1990s Arklow saw the direct devastation of NET's fertiliser plant and NET's withdrawal from a number of other industries in the area.  The industrial base of South Wicklow was completely decimated by rationalisation decisions which could not then be avoided.  To comprehend the impact of those decisions on Arklow the House would have to imagine a scenario where Digital and two other companies of similar size withdrew from the city of Galway at the same time.  Nobody would accept that a Government should allow that to happen and I am surprised, therefore, at the import of some of the points made by Senator Dardis.  In Arklow this was a cruel fate indeed.</P>
    <P>The Arklow factory cost NET some £6 million to build in 1961.  Its expansion over the next 20 years was achieved, largely, on the basis of the company's <Col N="329" /> own performance.  In its fundamentals it was a good company; but other decisions had a dire impact upon it.  The major problem for NET, Arklow and Ireland was the Marino Point plant.  The debacle which occurred in the building of the Marino Point plant is now history and is on the record of one of the Oireachtas joint committees.  In comparison with the initial set-up cost in Arklow of £6 million the total cost in Marino Point was £137 million, including roll-ups of interest to the time that plant started operations. If Members of the Oireachtas wish to identify where the problems of NET started or how we got to this stage &mdash; I do not think that continuously looking at history is helpful &mdash; they should look at the decisions and at the political and administrative blundering of that time.</P>
    <P>The second major problem that NET as a company has had to face is our extraordinary tradition in this country of exhorting State enterprises to expand and then failing to capitalise them.  They are expected to fund all of their activities by borrowing.  Consequently, a number of companies, including this one are so ridiculously geared that it is never possible for them to make a profit or break even.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis queried whether it was right for a Minister to come to this House, on occasion looking for more money.  The answer must be &ldquo;yes&rdquo;; it is self-evident. It is an entirely good and proper thing that Ministers should be brought before both Houses, by whatever device, to deal with the financial affairs of commercial State enterprises and in particular, the financial affairs of a State enterprise with as stormy a history as this one.  Senator Dardis and his party suggested that the company will never be able to repay the entire £187 million debt that has built up.  That is probably true but Senator Dardis's speech illustrates an extraordinary lack of understanding of the nature of the problems of NET and the origins of its debt.  The debt is a roll up of what happened over the years, not least during the course of the Marino Point debâcle which taught us a costly lesson in the way the public sector manages major investments.  The logic of <Col N="330" /> Senator Dardis's point is that the existing company and its work force must be made to pay the cost of past political and administrative problems.  That is not reasonable, fair or rational.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis also raised a query regarding the use of gas.  The Minister outlined the circumstances which surrounded the use of the gas feedstock by NET.  If Senator Dardis wished to find out more about this decision that many people have criticised he could have a word in the shell-like ear of his party leader who as Minister sponsored this policy thrust and was Minister during much of the overspending on Marino Point.  Therefore, if Senator Dardis and his party wish to dwell on the past and to score by making self-evident points he should have a word with the political maestro of that time.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer specifically to a point made by a number of speakers about the use of gas.  IFI makes ammonia in Cork using the gas feedstock.  That ammonia is the feedstock in turn for three plants &mdash; Marino Point, Arklow and Belfast.  These three plants produce 65 per cent of the entire requirements of this island for nitrogenous fertilisers.  The IFI venture is, we should not forget, a rational example of cross-Border co-operation.  In other for a Senator Dardis and his party would extol the benefits of cross-Border co-operation.  Why, therefore, should he snipe at a Bill which aims at helping a company which is the epitome of what can be achieved as Senator Norris said, in terms of cross-Border co-operation?</P>
    <P>IFI is now performing well against a background of declining world demand for its product and against a declining cost background.  It is worth reminding ourselves that in real terms, the price the company's products are achieving is similar to the prices received in 1985. Against this background, the Bill must be seen by any reasonable person as a welcome measure.  It will help to ensure the survival of a company which provides viable employment in a number of areas, not least in my area.  It is an Irish venture which gives employment to about 700 people and is involved in the production <Col N="331" /> of a very important element of our agricultural input.</P>
    <P>Would Senator Dardis, who should know something about this area, prefer if we were vulnerable to international price fluctuations arising from cartels outside this country controlling agricultural input?  We can go back to the early days of NET and consider why the company was set up.  One of the reasons was to break a cartel which had a stranglehold on fertiliser costs and inputs into Irish agriculture.  Surely somebody with Senator Dardis's background in agriculture would not tolerate a decision that would effectively put us back in that situation.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not bring back money which was invested in this company but it will put the company on a sounder footing to face the future.  It is a small piece of legislation which achieves something important to agriculture and employment &mdash; not least in my county and future constituency of Wicklow. Contributions, from all sides, here and in the Dáil, have welcomed this Bill and seen it for what it is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to this debate on the NET Bill and the request for guarantees and equity.  I listened very carefully and learned a lot from what they had to say. Rather than repeat the long explanation I gave introducing the Bill I will try to deal with a number of points which emerged during the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1987 an agreement was reached in what was commercial war-time.  There was a difficult situation with NET at the time.  The losses had mounted dramatically and an agreement was reached with a partner, ICI, which was <Col N="332" /> the best deal available at the time.  I have to confess that if it had been commercial peace time, it is not a deal I would sign today but, in the context of the trauma and turbulence in that market and the financial surroundings of NET at that time, it was the best deal available.  In retrospect, one can always negotiate a different deal at a different time, but we were not in the best position then to negotiate a tougher deal with ICI because they held all the cards, we needed a partner, the company was in financial difficulties, losses had mounted dramatically and we were very pleased to be able to put a deal together at that time.  It is important to mention that because the shareholders' agreement concluded in 1987 is the shareholders' agreement in place today.  This shareholders' agreement which will last until 1999 deals with the manner in which gas prices are decided, other shareholder rights, such as are found in any shareholders' agreement, etc.  It was not necessarily the perfect deal but it was the best which could be done at the time and the legal aspects of that deal are still in operation.</P>
    <P>One must understand the difference between NET and IFI and it is important that the workers at IFI fully understand this.  IFI is a separate company owned by ICI and NET, 49 per cent and 51 per cent, respectively; the State owns slightly more than half the company.  It is profitable, it is doing well, it is well managed and is meeting its commercial objectives. It is important that the workers in IFI know that there is no threat to IFI, its workforce or management by virtue of what we are doing here with NET.</P>
    <P>NET is a separate company; it is a holding company that is not trading.  It conducts a number of transactions on behalf of the State but it is not trading in fertilisers in the traditional sense.  This legislation deals with the financial arrangements of the NET holding company which, I stress, do not affect the company, Irish Fertilizer Industries, which is a separate company and is doing well.  A number of speakers mentioned jobs and this money being needed for <Col N="333" /> jobs, but this is a separate arrangement and is not directly related to IFI.  There are indirect connections but I hope I have made it clear that IFI is a separate company, is doing well, is not under threat and is not directly involved with this legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn explained this very clearly.  NET is a holding company with two incomes and two expenditures.  It has an income in dividends from IFI which it receives as a shareholder and they are under pressure for various reasons; the expected growth is not there.  The second income is from selling gas to IFI.  It has two heavy expenditures &mdash; paying the interest on IFI's enormous debt, which is approximately £180 million, and buying gas from Bord Gáis Éireann.  It is a company which deals basically in those four transactions &mdash; buying gas and selling it on, making a profit in the middle, receiving the dividends from IFI and paying the interest on the debt.</P>
    <P>I have already told the Dáil that I am asking the National Treasury Management Agency to look at that hard core debt and satisfy my Department that this debt is being managed in the best way possible and to assess whether it should be amalgamated with the national debt.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to Senator Quinn's contribution. I welcome the Senator to Seanad Éireann.  It is the first time I have been here since the Senator was elected; Senator Maloney is the other new Senator who spoke in this debate.  Other Senators have been re-elected but they are the two Senators who have come to the national stage for the first time.  I thank the Senators for contributing to this debate.</P>
    <P>I am taken with the Senator's proposals and I will examine them.  I find them interesting and close to my thinking on the matter.  It is not as simple as he suggests because of the legal agreements in place and it is questionable whether it is more transparent to leave matters as they are.  The choice is to leave NET as a holding company with four transactions clearly visible on the balance sheet or to close down NET and put those four problems into different Departments.  It <Col N="334" /> is arguable as to which is preferable.  In the end it does not matter that much because whether we have NET or do not have NET we are still stuck with the accumulated debt and we still have to supply a gas feed to IFI, which is our contractual agreement going back to 1987.  We have to supply the gas because we are contractually committed and we have to pay the interest because there are Ministerial guarantees.</P>
    <P>I will examine the structures the Senator proposed?  It may be better to do it that way.  I put it to the Senator that it may not make that much difference. What, I have to do is bring in the National Treasury Management Agency to see whether amalgamating the debt might be better and to continue to examine the gas arrangement to see whether there are any openings for us in that area.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Dardis for his comments. He asked me about a broader policy.  I am developing a broader approach to this NET situation.  A strategy is needed as to where we go from here.  This Bill before us is not a permanent strategy.  It is a natural consequence of decisions taken many years ago.  In developing that strategy we would include the role of the National Treasury Management Agency and we will look at the future gas strategy and future gas policy, including the ESB and other energy-related matters.  I want to reassure all the Senators that NET-related strategy is one I have to develop urgently once we get this legislation in place.</P>
    <P>I thank the other Senators who contributed to the debate.  Senator Norris asked me about the environmental situation; he is not present at the moment but I will respond to his query.  In the past the plant at Arklow could not be said to be fully up to date in terms of meeting rigorous EC requirements.  They have now installed three new nitric acid plants which will be open around May and I am assured that these new plants should meet the exacting EC environment standards and my Department will monitor the situation to make <Col N="335" /> sure they do.  That is the best I can do in response to the query of Senator Norris.</P>
    <P>Senators Hillery and Enright gave their support to the Bill and I thank them for so doing.  Senator Maloney spoke about the employment situation and the future of the company.  I listened carefully to the points he made and I understand his concerns.  I thank Senator Roche for his very detailed analysis.  The Senator has a deep knowledge of the plant and the industry.  It obviously affects his political base also.  I thank Senator McGowan who also contributed to the debate.  Those were the main points which were raised in the debate.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that this is not putting extra money into NET or IFI.  It is enabling NET to pay interest on the debt.  If I did not bring in this Bill, the State would ultimately have to pay this because there are Ministerial guarantees backing up all of this.  This simply keeps it in the NET box.  The House is not agreeing to additional funds; it is agreeing to have the additional funds provided through the company instead of through the State directly.  That is important for the moment because we have a partner in this exercise with ICI.</P>
    <P>I do not want to harp on the past.  We have to be clear what happened here.  In January 1975 the Government of the day received a cost estimate of £62.5 million for the Marino plant.  When the plant opened in October 1979 the cost was £137.3 million.  The figures tell their own story.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In January 1975 the original cost estimate was £42 million.  By April 1975 a new cost of £62.5 million had been agreed by Government.  This involved two Governments and different Ministers.  Nevertheless the point remains the cost rose from £62 million to £137 million.  Throughout the years before finally restructuring the plant in 1987 losses were incurred.  In 1980 the loss was £55 million, in 1981 it was £37 <Col N="336" /> million, and up to 1987, the last years in which NET operated as a trading company, the figure was £15 million.  It does not take an economist to figure out how we arrived at a debt of £180 million.  It is basically the overruns and losses before restructuring.  Restructuring has been successful in that a good fertiliser company is now operating.  It has been successful to that extent and we can get a focus on the debt locked into the NET situation.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis asked about the depreciation at Marino Point.  That depreciation is charged in the NET accounts and not in the IFI accounts.  The plant there is leased by IFI effectively at a peppercorn rent.  The depreciation is still there in NET.  This was challenged by Members of the other House, particularly by the Progressive Democrats.  The depreciation is charged in that way to enable a higher dividend to come from IFI into NET.  I acknowledge that it also gives a higher dividend to ICI.  That is what partnership is all about.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions to the debate.  I hope I have responded to the main points.  I ask for the support of the House for Second Stage.</P>

      <Col N="337" /> In regard to those amendments I believe we should examine the situation again before we commit ourselves to the full limits the Minister has in mind.  It is important that we have a policy statement from the Minister at the earliest possible date regarding the strategy to be adopted by Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta and his Department.  I question the wisdom of the Minister's proposal to bring in the National Treasury Management Agency. I believe the Minister, his Department and the Government should be the people who examine the situation.  They have sufficient advisers and reports furnished to them.  As a nation and as a Government we are tying ourselves up with agencies and committees.  In the past many of the elected representatives were not nearly as well educated as the present Members of this House; yet, they managed to do their work without sending it off to committees and agencies.  We are the people responsible, we are appointed to do our job and we should be able to do it ourselves.  In regard to the money the Minister is proposing in this Bill for NET, I believe the amounts I have set out in my amendment should be sufficient.</P>

      <P>I have considerable sympathy with the thinking behind them and on a different day I would support this argument.  I am not one who throws money at State companies.  It was mentioned earlier that B &amp; I was disposed of; as Minister for Transport I disposed of it in a commercial way.  We managed to maintain the jobs there and we resisted very strong demands for extra funding for the company. Finally, we arrived at a formula helpful to the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My normal inclination would be to give less money than is necessary, but I have to stress we are not giving money here. <Col N="338" /> We are simply paying the interest on a debt that began in 1975.  We are still repaying it and also the accumulated losses between NET's commencement in 1975 and its restructuring in 1987.  The figures I put forward allow for an additional £22 million.  While the figure put forward in the amendments would limit that to £12 million.  All advice, calculations and submissions from the company indicate that if I am not to come here regularly on this matter these are the correct amounts to seek.  It is a choice between adopting them now or my returning here in one month's time to repeat this exercise.  I regret I cannot accept the amendments for those practical and technical reasons.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann expresses its support for the many dedicated Irish men and women serving with aid agencies in developing countries; extends its condolences to the family and colleagues of Varerie Place, recently killed in Somalia and to the families of other aid workers who have died in Somalia and elsewhere; voices its concern for the safety and welfare of aid workers in Somalia; and calls on the United Task Force and the United Nations to examine, as a matter of urgency, ways and means to provide the maximum degree of security and protection for aid workers in Somalia.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister in his capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and thank him for the prompt action taken in the aftermath of the death of Valerie Place in Somalia. He went to the UN Headquarters and discussed the safety and well-being of Irish aid workers and aid workers from other countries.</P>
      <P>The death of Valerie Place was a traumatic experience for her immediate family.  The death of any young person is traumatic but in this case the trauma is shared by the nation because she died while serving with an aid group in Somalia.  The work she was doing was of tremendous importance.  We sympathise with the family and her co-workers.  They need our sympathy because they work in extremely difficult situations.  I hope the deaths of Valerie Place and the other two aid workers in Somalia will not deter others from going out to work in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk about the work done by aid workers, we must ask why they have to be in Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone or Bosnia.  In many instances, they are there because of famine.  It is horrific <Col N="340" /> to think of the number of areas where aid workers have to go to help the starving and the poor.</P>
    <P>The crisis in Somalia is man-made.  It is an exploitation of the Somalian people by warlords who do not care what happens to them.  The West must shoulder some of the blame for what is happening in the Third World.  For centuries we were the exploiters and if it was not for this, there might not be the present degree of suffering and deprivation. Europe must play a major part in reestablishing normality in these areas because many of the problems were the result of exploitation by Europeans of the land and people of Africa &mdash; they raped the people and they raped the land; they razed the crops and they razed the trees, and they killed the land and the animals.  They killed the traditional methods of farming that sustained the land.  If the land is not sustained you cannot sustain the people.</P>
    <P>No attempt has been made by the West to bring political stability to this area. Political stability must go hand-in-hand with the re-establishment of law and order.  We can keep pouring aid into areas where relief is needed, but unless we address the political question, there is no way normality will return.  When we talk of relief, we are referring to food and clothing.  The supply of food and clothing in areas of deprivation have become weapons of war instead of being used to help people in need.  Over the years particularly in Somalia, but also in the Sudan and Ethiopia, the warlords have taken over.  In quite a number of cases they have taken over the relief goods that have been sent in.  They have unscrupulously confiscated the goods and used them to buy weapons and to get control of cities and parts of the countryside. They have purchased arms by selling food that was brought in for humanitarian purposes.</P>
    <P>It is utterly ridiculous that up to very recently in these countries the warlords' mercenary soldiers had to be employed to help to get food to places which needed relief.  The warlords were selling the services of their soldiers to relief agencies to <Col N="341" /> get food to places where the warlords would not allow the food in.  These warlords are deaf to world opinion and to the suffering of their own people.  As long as they control a piece of territory they do not care what happens to their own people, never mind what the outside world thinks of them.  In their quest for dominion over their people and over land, they kill, maim and cause suffering. Not alone have they caused suffering for the people of Ireland by their killing of Valerie Place, they have caused suffering for the people of their own country by killing, looting and shooting in order to gain control.</P>
    <P>We cannot separate humanitarian aid from the political circumstances in the areas involved.  On a global level, whether it be through the United Nations or an other international body, we have not attempted to look at the political solutions to the problems.  It is only through political solutions that we can establish law and order back in those areas.</P>
    <P>The motion before us calls for the United Nations or, some other international body, to go in and help the humanitarian workers to enable them to do their work in as peaceful a manner as is possible and without threat from warlords and mercenaries.  This is a difficult thing to do because many of these countries are quite large in area and it is virtually impossible to monitor what is happening in small villages and towns or rural areas, not to mention the larger centres of population.</P>
    <P>The United Nations must go into the areas and do a better job than that done by the United States when they went into Somalia first with Operation Restore Hope.  This operation had plenty of advance publicity and got major coverage on the world media.  They did not confiscate weapons but left them in the hands of the warlords.  While they may have done a good PR job in the beginning, they did not do much to alleviate the suffering of the people or to help the aid workers in getting food and relief supplies to the areas where they were needed most.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="342" /> It has been suggested that the relief should be flown in and dropped.  In the past during the conflict in Biafra relief was flown in but it was dropped in the wrong places to the to the wrong people and was used for the wrong purposes afterwards.  I am not sure what has happened in Bosnia.</P>
    <P>We could speak for a long time on the political elements that must be brought into force to bring about a resolution of the causes of famine and the causes of maltreatment of a population by their own people or by others from outside. We ask the Minister to go to the United Nations and to press for a United Nations peacekeeping group to be sent to Somalia and other places where aid workers are working.  If non-governmental organisations are being used to monitor or to help the United Nations we ask that they be properly trained, that they know exactly what they are about and are as professional in their work as the aid workers, who go on a voluntary basis.</P>

I hope the House will forgive me if I mention in particular Senator Brendan Daly who served as my predecessor in the Department. I have been in the Department only for a short period but I am very conscious of his commitment and the contribution he made in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate that I speak briefly and report on the updated position and <Col N="343" /> then, if possible, to respond at the end of the debate.  I would like to hear the Senators' views on this very important matter.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Lanigan, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Government, I would like to express to the family of Valerie Place, to her colleagues in Concern and the other non-governmental agencies, our most sincere condolences at her tragic killing last week.</P>
    <P>We all know our aid workers work in difficult and sometimes very dangerous situations and those who have gone to Somalia have done so in the knowledge of the risks involved.  In this context we must remember that there are Irish volunteers working throughout the world, many of whom are also in dangerous situations.  Nonetheless it goes without saying that the death of Valerie Place came as a shock to all of us.  I join with Senator Lanigan in expressing gratitude and respect to the many aid workers, people of the calibre of Valerie Place.</P>
    <P>Apart from Valerie Place, our thoughts should turn also at this time to Sean Devereux a UNICEF worker of Irish origin, and to Kurt Lustenburger of the International Committee of the Red Cross, both of whom lost their lives at the hands of gunmen in January.  Our sympathy and condolences go also to their families and colleagues.</P>
    <P>All relief, rehabilitation and development operations depend on the existence of an adequate level of security.  In the months preceding the deployment of the Unified Task Force (UNITAF) at the beginning of December 1992, the work of the more than 60 Irish relief workers and of other relief workers, both Somali and foreign, was hampered by the prevailing insecurity and lawlessness.  It was not possible to transport food from the ports and airports to the feeding centres where the food was so badly needed by hundreds of thousands of starving Somali women and children.  Even warehouses were frequently plundered.  This scandal was rightly highlighted last year by my colleague, the then Foreign Minister, <Col N="344" /> Deputy Andrews, and by the President, Mrs. Robinson.</P>
    <P>Since the arrival of the UNITAF in December, the situation has dramatically changed.  Food is now getting through to those in need.  Irish and other humanitarian workers are better able to get on with their job of helping people in need. Indeed, a start is now being made on rehabilitation and reconstruction and, importantly for the future, on the reopening of schools.</P>
    <P>Ireland has fully supported the decisions of the United Nations Security Council in relation to the situation in Somalia: the appointment of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, the establishment of UN Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) and the authorisation of the Unified Task Force (UNITAF), under United States command.</P>
    <P>In welcoming the authorisation of UNITAF, we hoped that the dispatch of the 30,000 strong force would stabilise the security situation in Somalia.  Unfortunately, while UNITAF's deployment has resulted in a distinct improvement in the supply of food, the gunmen, who used to attack the aid supplies, are now targeting other, softer targets and, in particular, the vehicles, homes and resources of the aid workers.</P>
    <P>The Unified Task Force is confronted with a number of small but heavily armed private armies.  Ultimately, they will have to be disarmed if peace and stability are to return to Somalia.  However, disarming them will not be easy and will take time.</P>
    <P>In addition, however, to the private armies of the warlords, there is a more immediate threat posed by undisciplined gunmen, mostly young persons, who are no more than thugs and bandits.  It is they who pose the immediate threat to the aid workers.  It is essential that they be brought under control and disarmed as quickly as possible.  We fully appreciate the difficulties involved, but as long as gunmen can menace aid workers, the relief effort will remain under threat.</P>
    <P>The Seanad will be aware that, following the killing of Valerie Place, I went to Washington and to New York last <Col N="345" /> week to discuss the situation in Somalia and, in particular, the security of aid workers with the American Government and with the United Nations.</P>
    <P>In Washington, where I met the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, Mr. Houdek, I thanked the United States for the medical assistance provided to Ms. Place and for their assistance in the removal of her remains to Ireland.  I emphasised the need to disarm the gunmen and urged that UNITAF continue to pursue this goal and pointed out that as long as gunmen can menace aid workers, the whole relief effort will remain under serious threat.</P>
    <P>Since there is no national authority in Somalia, I also asked that UNITAF investigate the circumstances surrounding the killing of Valerie Place.  We believe that this would be useful and may provide information which will help avoid or prevent further such killings.</P>
    <P>I put forward some practical proposals which, having consulted the main Irish aid agencies, would make a positive contribution towards the protection and security of aid workers, including improved UNITAF protection for convoys of aid personnel and of their compounds, improved liaison with NGOs and the making available of aircraft for essential journeys within Somalia.  These ideas are under active consideration.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to thank the US authorities for their helpfulness on this matter.  I must say that there has been an improvement in liaison with NGOs on the ground because since my return I have consulted almost on a daily basis with the aid agencies involved in the area.  I hope that, in consultation with the NGOs in Somalia, it will be possible for UNITAF to devise improved security arrangements which will allow the aid agencies to fulfil their humanitarian vocation.</P>
    <P>The Secretary-General is expected to present a report on the situation in Somalia to the Security Council later this week.  This report should address a number of major issues, including the mandate for UNOSOM II, proposals for dealing with the continuing humanitarian <Col N="346" /> problem and his plans for promoting national reconciliation in Somalia.  We look forward to the publication of this report and to the Security Council's decision on future UN action in Somalia.</P>
    <P>Ireland continues to support the endeavours of the United Nations and others to bring peace and stability to Somalia.  We endorse, in particular, the international efforts to reinforce the traditional role of the elders, referred to by Senator Lanigan.  We believe that the traditional rulers represent the best hope for long term peace and the basis for the restoration of national authority.</P>
    <P>The deaths of Valerie Place, Sean Devereux and Kurt Lustenburger have highlighted the dangerous situation in Somalia.  We must not forget those members of UNITAF who have been injured or killed in Somalia.  We must continue to help the people of Somalia and to strive to bring peace and stability back to a people who have suffered so much from war and famine.</P>
    <P>I know that the Seanad will fully share our commitment to continue our efforts on behalf of the Somali people and to achieve adequate security for all the relief workers, Irish and others, who are helping them.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I support the motion before the House. It is opportune that it should be tabled at this time.  I join with Senator Lanigan and the Minister in expressing heartfelt sympathy to the parents, family and colleagues of Valeria Place who was tragically killed while giving great service to the war-torn, starving Somali people. Valeria, by her courage and generosity, made the ultimate sacrifice by giving her life for that very deserving cause.  As the Minister said, she is one among many volunteers killed, particularly in recent times and it is unfortunate that this situation has occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 30,000 US troops are currently <Col N="347" /> stationed in Somalia providing constant armed escorts for convoys of food from the ships to the feeding stations but they are not providing security or protection for the aid workers.  This is totally unacceptable and I am pleased to hear the Minister outline the suggestions he made to the American Government in relation to providing protection for aid personnel, liaising with the NGOs and, very importantly, making aircraft available for long distance travel within Somalia.  The Minister is to be commended for presenting the cause to the United States promptly.</P>
    <P>There is a role here for the European Community and the Irish Government should use the EC to put further pressure on the UN and on the United States to provide formal armed escorts for aid workers.  If such assurances are not forthcoming from those authorities, the Irish Government and Irish aid agencies should seriously consider the withdrawal of Irish aid workers from Somalia.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the Irish Government use its position at European and international level to ensure that a political solution is sought.  While a military presence is necessary to provide protection, what is needed ultimately, as Senator Lanigan pointed out, is a political solution and for such a solution to be found dialogue must be entered into at an early date.  It is vital that all members especially leaders and elders of the Somali community be involved in these discussions because history shows that a political solution cannot be imposed on any community.  We in Fine Gael believe that the European Community should use its influence to bring about such dialogue.</P>
    <P>The position of aid workers when they return to Ireland needs to be examined. We are great at expressing support, appreciation and pride in their work. However, on their return home they find it extremely difficult to re-enter the work-force. If we are sincere about supporting them we should demonstrate this constructively by ensuring an easy re-entry for them to the work they were engaged <Col N="348" /> in before going to Somalia or elsewhere. The Minister should consider this issue.</P>

      <P>This is a most timely motion that we will support wholeheartedly. We extend our sincere sympathy to the families of Valerie Place and Seán Devereux.  Their tremendous work will never be forgotten.  I thank the Minister for the efforts he has made in the days since the tragedy.  I hope he will continue with those efforts on an ongoing basis and not only in the event of a tragedy.</P>
      <P>It is in all our interests that those who are doing tremendous work overseas should continue this aid work, whether they are a member of Concern or Goal &mdash; where John O'Shea plays such an important role.  It is most important that protection be given to these workers.  It is vital that aid should get through.  I am sure the Minister will continue to keep this matter under constant review because there is no doubt that in the past things happened too slowly at United Nations level.  It is important that we all concentrate on the protection of the workers and ensuring their safety.  Certainly none of us would like to see the workers having to return home because that means that more and more people will die.  We fully support the terms of this motion but I ask the Minister and his officials to push the case as we cannot allow it to be forgotten.  It is important that the Minister should continue his efforts in this regard in the months ahead.</P>

      <P>I feel very honoured this evening to speak in this House in praise of the life and work of Valerie Place.  The Christian ethos understands the corporal works of mercy as clothing the naked and feeding the hungry.  By her missionary work in a voluntary capacity, Valerie Place dedicated part of her very young life to fulfilling the corporal work of <Col N="349" /> mercy of feeding the hungry.  Unfortunately, in carrying out this work she had to pay the sacrifice of her life.  The change in the health of young children in Somalia who she started to feed some three or four months ago has been dramatic and is a great tribute to her. Valerie Place changed misery to happiness and I hope she is sharing in that happiness today.</P>
      <P>We have had examples of man's inhumanity to man down through the centuries and it continues to this day.  It is sad to realise that food is available for the starving people of Somalia but evil men prevent its distribution.  I hope that is coming to an end.  I hope the work of Valerie Place and her death will not be in vain and that there will be free distribution of food to the hungry.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I would like to join with the other Members of the House in conveying our deepest sympathy to the family of Valerie Place, to her co-workers in Somalia and in the other strife-torn parts of the world where there are Irish people and people from all nations trying to help those who are suffering.</P>
      <P>On behalf of our party I welcome the motion.  It is timely and is appropriately worded.  I also congratulate the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs in going to the UN and in meeting representatives of the US Government to make a strong case for security and protection for aid workers in Somalia.  They need absolute protection in so far as it can be given for the selfless work they are doing on behalf of Concern, Goal and various other agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The points made by the Minister are all of importance.  Listening to the views of those on the ground, to the NGOs, and taking account of their first-hand experience of the situation is most important.  They know what are the problems and I am glad that point has been taken on board.  I was glad to hear the Minister say they are getting to the stage of rehabilitation and re-opening of schools because I know that agencies like Concern really want to go in as development <Col N="350" /> workers rather than crisis workers.  Very often they have to spend much time and energy dealing with crises but what they are really about is helping people to help themselves, helping them to develop and to set up their own institutions to improve the situation in their countries.</P>
    <P>I also support the statements by Senator Lanigan and Senator Taylor-Quinn regarding a political solution and working in whatever way we can as a country to help towards that end.  In the long term it is the only way the problem will be resolved.</P>
    <P>Another area I would like to concentrate on is disarming the gangs of gunmen in Somalia.  This is not only a problem in Somalia; it is a problem in Bosnia, Lebanon and other areas of strife throughout the world where there appears to be an abundant availability of weapons.  This must be addressed by the EC if possible, but particularly by the United Nations.  Arms get into the hands of groups who believe they have deadly enemies and that they have right on their side.  Until we deal with that innocent people will continue to suffer and die in areas of unrest.</P>
    <P>I believe Ireland is particularly well positioned to take a lead in this area because of our record of humanitarian assistance in many parts of the world.  I feel we should take a stand on the matter in the United Nations to see what can be done at that level to control the supply and availability of arms in various parts of the world.</P>
    <P>I join with the other speakers in supporting the motion before us.  I ask the Minister to concentrate in particular on the area of disarmament.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am delighted he is regarding this matter with such concern because it is extremely serious.  I support the motion <Col N="351" /> and I wish to join in the expression of condolences to the Place family.  I knew one of her sisters and know the tremendous distress this death has caused them.</P>
      <P>I wish to address the latter part of the motion regarding concern for the safety and welfare of aid workers in Somalia. Workers in Somalia are in real danger. When our President visited that country she was in that same danger and it was very courageous of her and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to go.  I am a member of the Overseas Committee of the Irish Red Cross and the man in charge of the International Red Cross effort in Somalia at the moment is Mr. Geoff Loane.  He is an Irishman, so we get first-hand reports of the ongoing situation.  It is extremely serious.</P>
      <P>When I was chair of the Overseas Committee of the Red Cross and we were interviewing workers to go abroad, I stressed to them to look after their own safety first and foremost.  Often very altruistic and idealistic people go out forgetting the enormous danger to their own lives, not just from bullets.  People were shot in my time, mercifully not fatally. People were electrocuted, people got very serious diseases.  All of this must be carefully pointed out to them and to those who are running the agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a civil war in Somalia.  It is a member of the UN and, even though it has no Government at the moment, resolutions of the UN are binding on it.  Paragraph 3 of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 794, under which troops went in there in December at the beginning of Operation Restore Hope &ldquo;demands that all parties, movements and factions in Somalia take all mesures necessary to ensure the safety of United Nations and all other personnel engaged in the delivery of humanitarian assistance, including the military forces&rdquo;&mdash; a group very often forgotten &mdash;&ldquo;to be established pursuant to the authorization given in paragraph 10 below.&rdquo;.  Paragraph 5 of the same resolution &ldquo;strongly condemns all violations of international humanitarian law occurring in Somalia, <Col N="352" /> including in particular the deliberate impeding of the delivery of food and medical supplies essential for the survival of the civilian population, and affirms that those who commit or order the commission of such acts will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some individual was responsible for this act and, while I know law and order has broken down there at the moment, I hope the best is being done to ensure that whoever perpetrated the murder of this girl is brought to book.  This is a very dangerous situation and we have very altruistic people going out on these missions. I hope they are taking a very tough line to see how safe some of their ventures are.  At the time of the shooting the Red Cross had withdrawn to barracks, and all their white personnel were within barracks.  I gather that locally there was a great deal of talk about the danger to white workers in particular.  The Red Cross is in a fortunate situation because they have Somalian Red Crescent personnel whom they can send out to the feeding stations but I hope any other aid workers would not go out except to do the most urgent tasks in times of severe stress.</P>
    <P>How do they assess their danger?  I presume they get advice from the UN, who I have found to be incredibly helpful in these situations.  I was very worried to hear the Deputy Director of Goal say on the wireless he felt the aid workers were in more danger now than when the UN were not there.  Soldiers realise the danger of going into certain areas far better than politicians, not because they are cowardly but because they realise that the arrival of arms can make a situation more serious.</P>
    <P>While Mogadishu has been cleared of gunnmen, many of these gunmen are in the countryside.  They are extremely angry young men because many of them were getting $100 per day protecting relief workers and they are now without finance.  They feel they have a vested interest in trying to be re-employed as protectors.  I know the Government cannot tell the aid agencies what they <Col N="353" /> must do, but I hope the Minister will ask them to be very careful and not let their personnel get into areas of danger because a dead aid worker can do nothing for the people he or she has gone to assist.</P>
    <P>I have had help from the UN.  I went once to see how our relief supplies were getting through to the Kurds and without the aid of the UN to get to the Iran-Iraq border I would not have managed to carry out that task.  I was not questioned.  They let me make my decisions and we have to realise that they are doing this, quite rightly, with the aid workers.  Therefore, I would be very glad if the Minister would take up with the agencies the situation regarding their personnel.  They are in danger and if there is one group which realises that, it is the insurance companies, because we have to pay very heavy premiums to insure our workers who go abroad.  The safety of our workers should be at the forefront of the Minister's deliberations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to my colleague, Senator Henry, for giving me this opportunity to speak on the motion which I support.  There is unanimous support around the House for it.  We are impressed and gratified by the remarkable work so many young Irish people have traditionally engaged in in largely voluntary operations, with groups like APSO, VSI, Concern, Goal, etc.  It is clear that they are in danger, and in this appalling situation in Somalia, one has to remember that food is not only necessary for the inhabitants but is also a weapon of war.  Starvation is an instrument for advancing policy and is recognised as such by the warlords.  The control of food is a military objective.  There is a very disorganised situation with, for example, gangs of technicals extraordinarily heavily armed, and here many European countries and the two previously existing super power blocs bear a very heavy responsibility because it was they who armed these people, gave them the weapons and allowed them to commit these appalling outrages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Senator Henry's hope that the people responsible for the worst of these <Col N="354" /> outrages may be brought to book at the bar of international opinion but unfortunately I doubt if they will be.  In Kampuchia Pol Pot, who has been responsible for the death of two million people, is getting back into power with the assistance of the West.  In East Timor, where one-third of the population has been butchered, again with the connivance of the West, similarly there is no call for an international war crimes tribunal.  We have it, however, for political reasons, in Bosnia-Hercegovina, but I wonder if there is an appropriate international standard of morality to back up the remarkable work of these young volunteers.  I am afraid that there is not.</P>
    <P>Pehaps the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, will work for an independent foreign policy which will urge the claims of international morality in a way that will be recognised by the international community and may itself, by throwing a moral shield around these people, help to protect them.  The work of the Irish contingent is greatly honoured and I would like to place on record my personal salute to the previous Minister, Deputy Andrews, for his remarkable initiative. He was almost the first major politician from Europe to take the initiative in visiting Somalia, and was then followed by the President who made a further remarkable intervention.  The visual impact of the visit of those two distinguished Irish states people had an impact on the situation.</P>
    <P>There are a number of Irish people over there at the moment.  I have just been reading an article in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of 3 March 1993, about aid workers and the difficulties they face. The writer, Eamon Timmins, says:</P>
    <P>Life in Somalia is shaped by security precautions.  All ex-patriate workers live in compounds behind plate steel gates and under 24-hour armed guard. The same armed guards accompany them when they travel in vehicles.</P>
    <P>One of the problems, as Senator Henry indicated, is that they are not receiving appropriate protection from United Nations agencies or the American military. <Col N="355" /> They seem to be still relying very heavily on locally recruited gunmen who are volatile and capricious, and if the high standards to which Irish people adhere are imposed on them, they frequently turn nasty, become difficult and utter death threats.  In this article, again and again, it is made clear that food is distrained by these people.  If an attempt is made to regularise the situation, those trying to regularise it become victims of death threats.  With the rest of the Members of this House I salute Valerie Place and her colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his very kind remarks and to wish him well in the office he now holds.  He will find, there, as I did, a professional and highly dedicated staff.  He will not find in any Department people with such commitment and dedication, which is recognised not only nationally but internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister of State I had occasion to visit some of the countries where Irish aid is being provided.  The depth of gratitude from the local communities and the acknowledgment of the efforts Ireland was making, were brought to my attention by various leaders.  Prime Ministers, politicians and community leaders in the various townships have acknowledged the efforts Ireland has made in Somalia. In supporting this motion this evening we can be proud of the dedication and skill of the many volunteers and experts prepared to work in difficult and dangerous conditions so as to improve the circumstances of the most marginalised societies in developing countries.  I pay tribute to all the Irish aid workers overseas, to the large number of volunteers, many of whom are young, currently working in the feeding kitchens in Somalia and who previously worked in Ethiopia and elsewhere.  I also pay tribute to nurses working in the field hospitals with inadequate medical supplies and equipment and to the engineers endeavouring to restore basic water supplies and sanitation to villages, many of which have been abandoned and destroyed as a result <Col N="356" /> of war and famine.  All of these people deserve our respect and gratitude.</P>
    <P>I express our deepest sympathy to the family and relatives of the late Valerie Place.  Her untimely and tragic death has brought home to us the dangers for overseas aid workers in countries like Somalia.  I trust, however, that her death has not been in vain and that all of us sharing the grief and sadness at her passing will resolve to make our own special efforts at finding solutions for the problems of Somalia and, indeed, of the developing world.</P>
    <P>I have had opportunities to visit many of the dedicated personnel working in Government and non-governmental agencies throughout the developing world.  No words of mine could adequately express the depth of gratitude we owe to those caring and unselfish people.  In every country I visited the authorities demonstrated their deep familiarity with and appreciation of the work being done by Irish personnel, especially, for the disabled, the handicapped, the sick and for women who number among the deprived in many developing countries.  Ireland's efforts were not only recognised in Government circles and by political leaders, but also by people in the communities and townships. It was also understood that because of the size of Ireland and our economic circumstances our ability to donate significant amounts of aid is limited.  Some of our European partners whose aid levels are higher than ours have per capita incomes almost double the size of ours.  Indeed private support in Ireland for non-governmental organisations involved in overseas development aid has steadily grown.  As a result, Ireland today has the highest rate of private development assistance as a proportion of GNP of any country in the world.</P>
    <P>There is universal respect for Irish personnel working overseas.  Despite our limited financial resources we must, without hesitation, continue to lead international opinion and pressurise the economic power blocks to make a more positive intervention, especially in the African crisis.  Recent OECD figures <Col N="357" /> show that Africa is totally dependent on financial aid from industrial donor countries for its survival.</P>
    <P>Measures other than aid are urgently required.  However, time does not permit a detailed discussion of the Somalia situation.  Suffice to say that the United Nations and the European Community need to provide back-up for the aid and relief programmes.  The type of action necessary was sadly lacking at a critical time.  Serious problems arose in Somalia regarding the distribution of aid, and United Nations troops were not deployed in the early stages when matters were totally out of control.  These limitations together with failure to disarm and round up the gunmen and bandits who held the country to ransom clearly indicate the shortcomings in the international response and the necessity for a co-ordinated international effort to avoid further tragedies in future.</P>
    <P>Many African countries including Somalia are in crisis at present.  When I visited Tanzania which is probably one of the poorest countries in Africa, I witnessed extreme poverty; the extent of deprivation there is beyond the imagination of anyone who has not seen the conditions at first hand.  Television and media reports can never portray its widespread devastation, human misery and extreme poverty that appears to be worsening.  Tanzania has severe shortages of skilled labour and consequently, the economic development of the country is seriously hampered.  Even basic maintenance of existing facilities cannot be carried out at present.</P>
    <P>African countries are in crisis for a number of reasons.  Drought and severe weather conditions have affected all Africa, especially southern Africa. Environmental difficulties, soil erosion desertification and over-grazing, together with the Third World debt crisis, economic and political mismanagement in many countries and the world recession all take their toll.  An alarming situation is deteriorating rapidly.  An international co-ordinated response is urgently required.  Ireland cannot address the problem alone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> I also visited Zambia.  In one township there, Kamanga compound, a settlement on the outskirts of Lusaka and formerly an illegal compound, 6,000 people live in a space approximately the size of St. Stephen's Green.  There are no basic water supplies, schools, health services, footpaths or anything of that nature.  Irish aid workers there at present are endeavouring to restore water supplies, sanitation and refuse disposal facilities and to provide basic school and health facilities.  This is being done with the aid of Irish funds.  We need to record the valiant efforts being made in difficult circumstances in the target countries where Ireland has rightly concentrated its aid over the past number of years &mdash; Tanzania, Lesotho, the Sudan and Zambia.  The results of aid can be seen in those areas.</P>
    <P>The prospect facing Africa today is tragic, threatening and dangerous but there are signs of hope.  Governments there now seem more willing to find ways of dealing with problems and they value and appreciate the efforts being made by countries such as Ireland to help them in their endeavours.  The international community will stand indicted if it fails to answer the call of Africa and allows the deepening crisis there to turn into a disaster, the dimensions of which will be too horrible to contemplate.</P>
    <P>Twenty years of war in the Horn of Africa have caused more damage than the African drought and have given Africa the highest level of displaced persons in the world today.  These issues must be tackled.  The establishment of democracy in Africa and the development of new economic structures there need urgent financial and technical support from the international community which could respond more positively than it has to date.  It is neither worth while nor useful to look back on what happened in the past.  Let us learn from mistakes and through the medium of international fora, highlight these problems, as President Robinson and our former Minister for Foreign Affairs have done.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and to <Col N="359" /> his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to continue to use international fora to highlight shortcomings in the international response to the threatening crisis in the developing world and the necessity for urgent and immediate action to avoid further Somalias in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. It is tragic that Valerie Place, who had shown such commitment and dedication to the people of the developing world, should be killed.  Her murder illustrates the dangers faced each day by Irish aid workers in trouble spots like Somalia and the immense courage they have shown in the most difficult circumstances.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, must now initiate urgent discussion with the United Nations and the aid organisations to see that appropriate steps are taken to ensure the safety of other Irish aid workers in Somalia.</P>
      <P>The harrowing photographs and graphic television film we have seen in recent weeks of the plight of the Somali people have brought home to us the ugly reality of human existence in much of the Third World where permanent hunger is a fact of life and death is often a welcome release.  The poignant scenes of starving people &mdash; men, women and children &mdash; which so moved President Robinson, put our own economic and social problems in a different perspective.  What we have seen on our television screens in the comfort of our homes must remind us that by the standards of the unfortunate people of Somalia we are very well off and, therefore, we have a moral and political responsibility to respond to their plight and to offer what assistance we can.  Our eyes have been opened to what President Robinson described as the greatest tragedy facing the world today.  We must now respond by opening our hearts and our pockets to those who are suffering in Somalia and in other parts of the developing world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> At this juncture I would like to refer to Ireland's aid to the Third World.  While I welcome the increase in the amount of aid this year, the timetable for the achievement of the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP is too long.  I am disappointed it does not deal in particular with the urgent need for emergency measures to deal with the Somalia tragedy.  I believe there would be widespread public support for a proposal that the Government should respond to the urgency of that situation by matching, pound for pound, the money raised by voluntary organisations.  The people of this country are rightly proud of the courage of President Robinson in going to Somalia and of the agencies and the courageous young people who work in Somalia and other Third World countries.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision on the ODA is and must be regarded as dismal. Despite the fact that there has been an increase in the past year, we must demand a larger increase.  The Minister should do this by bringing all the parties together.  He would receive wholehearted support.  We are quick to demand assistance from the wealthier countries in the EC.  It is unacceptable for the Irish Government to demand that wealthier EC states provide such assistance for poorer regions of the Community while at the same time we so restrict the aid we provide to the poorest countries in the world.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to speak tonight, at this appropriate time, on how we can best protect our aid workers in the developing world.  I extend my sympathy to the family of Valerie Place; it is a tragic time for them.  She was a lovely girl who went out to the developing world to make her contribution as a young nurse.  It was very noble of her and when she was gunned down in the course of her work, it made the world conscious of the dedication of our young voluntary workers.  Every year a large percentage of our voluntary workers go to the undeveloped world <Col N="361" /> to work there.  They want to make a contribution and they are to be complimented.</P>
    <P>I also read in my research that there is ster for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, who, with President Robinson, highlighted the tragedy of Somalia.  It was then that we realised tire tragic situation of these people and wondered how could we help them.  If I did not have a full time job I would have made it my business to contact the voluntary organisations and make my way out there to help.</P>
    <P>We are here tonight to discuss how best we can protect the voluntary workers.  It is very difficult because there seems to be lack of security on the ground.  While the UNITAF force looks after them in the towns, it is when they move outside that the problem arises.  That was the problem for Valerie Place; she was on her way to a rehabilation centre, a school for young children, when the gunman shot her.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to have absolute security but I am glad the Minister visited the United States and I hope that his action plan will go a long way towards tightening security and controlling the gunmen.  Playing the devil's advocate, I would like to question the liaison of the voluntary organisations with the Department. Is it fragmented?  Is there room for tightening up?  One part of the organisation may not know what is happening elsewhere.  Since there are gangs and thugs out there, the operation should be tight.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ensure that there is no looseness in the security plan because that is where it can fail, through nobody's fault.  I compliment the voluntary organisations on their good work but my reading and research indicate there may have been some slippage. Perhaps the aid workers are getting bolder as they become familiar with the area and with what is to be done; perhaps they take risks, and took one too many in this incident.  That is why I think voluntary workers need to be well disciplined and tutored as to the risks and responsibilities involved, and there is a responsibility on the Department of Foreign <Col N="362" /> Affairs to implement a security programme to protect them.</P>
    <P>I also read in my research that there is another plan whereby the United Nations will take over from the force that currently implements the security programme. In any transition there is a looseness and the gunmen will be well aware of it; that is the time they will move.  They have moved out from the cities and towns to the highways and byways and they will seize an opportunity at a time when the UN may be weak on the ground.  I would like the Minister to take that into consideration.</P>
    <P>The introduction of aircraft, as already mentioned, would be a good idea.  Aeroplanes must be used to transport our workers from place to place.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House is appropriate. We must look for support in ensuring the safety of our workers and must promote their cause and security.  I would like to be associated with this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I support the motion and endorse the views expressed by many Senators.  I extend my sympathy to the family and friends of Valerie Place on the tragedy of her death.  I express deep concern at the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.  I welcome the Minister's action in going to the United States and taking with the UN with a view to having the matter fully investigated and appropriate action taken.  Valerie Place had bravely given her time to help those caught up in the man-made horror that is Somalia.  I hope her death will not deter others from helping where it is needed.</P>
      <P>I question the adequacy of the UN Unified Task Force.  It is planned that the UN will take over this role and I hope that every effort is made to protect all aid workers in war-torn territory.  Aid agencies deal with the symptoms rather than the cause.  Greater UN intervention is needed to tackle the war in Somalia, to deal with the warlords, the guerrillas, the common thugs and vandals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question which has not been raised this evening but is worthy of consideration is the role of all aid workers in <Col N="363" /> the Third World.  Are they there in the role of the missionaries of days gone by, wanting to stamp our form of so-called civilisation on others, or are they there solely to assist those in plight, helping people plagued by war and famine to help themselves?  I hope their function focuses on the latter rather than the former.  We need to liaise with the community leaders rather than work above them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that pressure is placed on the UN, through the EC and by our own country, with a view to finding a long term solution for Somalia. Then and only then will the death of Valerie Place not be in vain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to express my support for this motion.  I join with all Members in expressing our sympathy to the family of Valerie Place.  We are moved by such a heroic sacrifice at a time when confidence has been lacking.  The response of the people to the heroic sacrifice and contribution of Valerie Place has given them a new spirit of pride and confidence.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that the Minister and the Government become vigorously involved in creating conditions in which people like Valerie Place can work effectively so as to relieve the terrible and crushing problems of the people of Somalia.  There is a limit to what people like her can do.  They are responding and reacting to problems created by other forces.  There is a limit even to what our Government can do.  I welcome the initiatives taken by the Government and the Minister who is present in the House. The Minister recently addressed these issues and the role of the UN directly with the United Nations in New York.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must look for the root of the problems which arise in areas such as Somalia. The family of nations must ask why there is endemic need in certain parts of the world; why is there a constant shortage of food while in other parts of the world, notably our own, there is a surplus?  Why has the family of nations through the United Nations, other world organisations and regional organisations, such <Col N="364" /> as the European Community, allowed this scandal for so long?  How can we have a surplus of food and prevent food being produced while there is a constant scarcity of food in other countries?  That is an issue the family of nations must address as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Scarcity of food is usually caused by human intervention of a negative and vicious nature and not by natural disasters. We must question our capacity as a civilised community of nations to deal with such matters.  The United Nations Only have an effective mandate when the Security Council and the member states give their agreement to UN involvement. However, trouble arises where there is no readiness to accept the United Nations.</P>
    <P>We looked at the extraordinary contradiction that existed in Cambodia.  The United Nations, the family of nations of the world, recognised a political force that was a shame on the face of humanity. This is totally inconsistent with the role of the United Nations.  The UN will not intervene where there is an internal authority. Why should that be so?  If that authority is deprived by any right or conduct to exercise authority, why should the United Nations stand back and allow crimes against humanity to be perpetrated? This is an issue which must be addressed by the UN.</P>
    <P>We are looking at a similar situation in Bosnia.  When was the last time that crimes against humanity were brought before the bar of world sanction?  This only happened after World War II when Germany and Japan were defeated.  Do events in Bosnia not warrant trials for crimes against humanity?  What happened in Kampuchea?  What is happening here?  Does that not warrant trials for crimes against humanity?  Is that acceptable at this stage of our political experience? I do not think so.</P>
    <P>When a tragedy of this kind happens it arouses us, but we must not think that we can deal with these matters simply on the day.  We should try to eradicate the cause so as to ensure a greater degree of security for the people who live there. Although it is sad, there is a certain heroic sacrifice associated with the deaths <Col N="365" /> of Valerie Place, Kurt Lustenburger and Sean Devereux.  What about those who are living in these countries and who are subjected to horrific oppression, brutality and starvation?  What is the family of nations doing to intervene?  I support the Minister's efforts to ensure that these warlords &mdash; a euphemism for scandalous, scurrilous criminals &mdash; will be put down. We should be very careful in our talks with those people.  Because they have the power of terror, the power of oppression, the power of murder, I would be reluctant to give them sanction or recognition. This a real test of the capacity of the United Nations, which was intended to be the United Nations of the world.  Only when we get complete agreement will we be guaranteed that the circumstances that brought about the death of people like Valerie Place will not recur.</P>
    <P>Some of the examples I have quoted have been the result of my experience as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I could not, and I still cannot, reconcile the attitude of the United Nations to Cambodia and Pol Pot with the high minded statements and principles that motivated that organisation, but I can enthusiastically endorse the terms of this motion and the efforts that our Government and the Minister in particular are making to deal with the terrible circumstances that led to the death of Valerie Place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State for the steps he took when Valerie Place was killed and on his endeavours to ensure proper security measures are in place to prevent other aid workers being killed.  I wish to express my gratitude to the President, Mrs. Robinson and to the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, for highlighting what is happening in Somalia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to my nomination I helplessly watched on television the suffering of these people and wondered at the inactivity of world authorities because, in my view, there is a simple solution to famine &mdash; provide food.  Every day we saw food being stolen by these warlords at the Port of Mogadishu.  As Senator O'Kennedy <Col N="366" /> said, thugs and vandals would be more appropriate names for them.</P>
    <P>Good comes from tragedy and I hope good will come from the death of Valerie Place.  We have seen suffering and tragedy on a massive scale on the African continent for too long.</P>
    <P>Somalia is not a country in the sense that it does not have a Government and law and order.  I cannot see why so much time was spent debating whether the world should distribute food to the people of Somalia.  It appears politics is about everything but providing human beings with the basic requirements of food and shelter.  In the event of similar tragedies we must act quickly and responsibly. Wherever people are starving we must provide aid to ease their suffering.</P>
    <P>There have been famines in Ethiopia and Somalia.  Volunteer aid agencies have been telling us that there is about to be a famine on a massive scale and it is a sad irony that in Europe we have massive food mountains and the ability to transport them.  I was in San Francisco a couple of years ago and I saw grain being loaded into the hull of a massive ship.  I asked workers on the ship where it was going and they told me it was going to the Pacific Ocean.  I asked &ldquo;to where&rdquo; and they said &ldquo;to the ocean&rdquo;.  There they open the hulls and let the grain fall into the sea to support the price of maize and corn in America.  We do likewise in Europe.  It is a sick sad situation and we call ourselves civilized.  I extend my personal sympathies to the Place family and to all the other aid workers who have given their lives to serve humanity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a wide ranging debate on a very important issue. A number of questions were posed.  One of the important questions was what the world arbiters should do when a tragedy occurs.  There are numerous United Nations declarations as to what should be done, but very little is done.  There are hundreds of United Nations resolutions on Somalia, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, Palestine etc., but they are not being implemented.  Unless we give the United Nations power, I am afraid they <Col N="367" /> will not be implemented.  The United Nations must become a proper unit for deciding what should happen on the world stage.</P>
      <P>With regard to Somalia and the death of Valerie Place, what influence the Geneva Convention on the Protection of Civilians in Wartime?  If there is a war going on in Somalia the Convention on the Protection of Civilians in Wartime should be implemented.  How can that convention be implemented?  Who is going to implement it?  There are sanctions laid down for those who do not adhere to the convention, but I have not seen any country tried by any forum for failing to do so.  The point Senator O'Kennedy made is correct.</P>
      <P>There has been a call for faster action. We should no longer have <i>ad hoc</i> reactions, at United Nations level, to events in various parts of the world.  A United Nations fast reaction task force should be set up, on a permanent basis, so that the UN will no longer have to react in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner.  There appears to be an infinite combination of letters that can be placed after &ldquo;UN&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, too often aid has become an end.  Too much food aid is sent to places where there is famine every few years and this discourages farmers from producing cash crops.  Even when the rains come, there is no point in farmers sowing seed to grow crops which they cannot sell because at that stage there still remains an enormous amount of food aid.</P>
      <P>The question of arms availability has to be addressed by the world community. The world is awash with arms manufactured in Europe and the United States and the remnant of arms that were available in the USSR to the massive armies of the USSR.  They are available to whoever has the money to buy them and, unfortunately, it is the warlords all over the world who are buying them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy raised questions about recognising the warlords and said <Col N="368" /> we should be careful about getting involved with them.  There is to be a meeting, shortly, in Addis Ababa of the leaders of the 15 major factions in control in Somalia.  They are not sure if General Mohammad Adid, the leader of the major group based in southern Mogadishu, will attend.  If he does not go, there is no point in the other 15 leaders meeting.</P>
    <P>There has been a shift in the population, with refugees being scattered all over Africa.  In Yemen some time ago I saw a refugee camp with 10,500 Somalians living in tents in very bad conditions with a few Irish aid workers and a major input from <i>Medicins sans frontieres</i> from Paris.  These people will never go back to Somalia.  The Government of Somalia is in exile in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  What government they are, who they represent or whether they will ever represent anybody is a moot point but they are sitting in Riyadh and they are supposed to be the government in exile. I am not too sure if they will ever become a government <i>de facto</i>, but they are there; who elected or selected them is not of great importance.</P>
    <P>The Christian ethos was mentioned. Christianity has not helped Africa.  Other religions have helped Africa more than the Christian religion.  When we talk about a Christian ethos we must look at ourselves and ask if the <i>modus operandi</i> of Christianity in Africa is any better than the <i>modus operandi</i> of any other religion.</P>
    <P>The Minister has much to think about from this debate.  I am sure it will help him in his efforts to get support for our aid workers and every other aid worker attempting to do their job.  The United Nations should look at what is happening on the ground in countries like Sierra Leone.  Every aid organisation and NGO in the world is represented in Sierra Leone which is one of the poorest countries in the world even though it has the capacity to be one of the richest.  They are concentrating too much on aid for its own sake and not on solving the political <Col N="369" /> problems there which make aid necessary. I thank the Minister for coming to the House and I thank the Seanad for unanimously supporting the motion.</P>

      <P>This is my first visit to this Chamber as Minister with responsibility for development aid.  I was here during the last Administration in relation to EC and other matters.  This has been an excellent debate.  I listened to contributions from someone who served as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator O'Kennedy and Senator Daly who served as Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid.  I heard from colleagues who have a lot of experience in this Chamber and from new Members.</P>
      <P>The contributions across party lines reflect the strong feelings of the public in relation to overseas development aid and the development of areas such as Somalia and other places, I welcome the fact that the debate covered broader issues.  The new Programme for Government reflects these strong feelings.  By increasing the percentage of GNP which goes to development aid to 0.2 per cent, which is still quite a modest increase, we are simply reflecting the views of the Irish people, the tremendous reputation of our aid workers abroad and the strong humanitarian role we play on the international stage.  I will reflect these views on serving as Minister with responsibility for this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the emphasis Senator Lanigan put on the man-made nature of Somalia's problems.  Somalia is a glaring example of man's inhumanity to man and the solution cannot be found in aid alone. He is right in saying that.  It needs a political solution based on peaceful negotiation and reconciliation between the elders of the different tribes.  Although there have been attempts to bring the Somali people together, the warlords have disrupted the ceasefire.  I agree with the way Senators described those people. <Col N="370" /> I support the ceasefire agreed in January between the different Somali factions.</P>
    <P>Finding a political solution will not be easy; efforts are being made by the Secretary-General's special representative and by the US Government.  We support these efforts and at the UN conference on Somalia next week we shall do what we can to advance a solution.  In the short term, we support the efforts to reestablish a Somali police force, a first step in restoring national authority.  Our attitude and that of the UN is to build up a police force from the ground.  Many people have said we should impose solutions.  We cannot have that attitude. One must work with the structures that are there and the need is to build up a security system.  It could be called a police force because it will be built on the existing system.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan rightly emphasised the need for proper training for Irish aid workers.  I can assure him that both APSO, the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, and the agencies concerned, GOAL, Trócaire and the Red Cross are fully conscious of this requirement and make every effort to ensure that volunteers get adequate and appropriate training.  I appreciate the points raised about reintegrating returned aid workers.  That point was made by Senator Taylor-Quinn and others and is a very serious issue and I discussed it yesterday with APSO for the second time.  We need to look at it because part of the programme is to increase the number of volunteers from 400 to 2,000 by 1997 and that is a considerable undertaking.  There will be many people going abroad and returning home and we cannot ask them or encourage them to do this work without looking after their needs on their return.  Since becoming Minister with responsibility for this area, I have requested APSO to initiate a study which will cover this aspect.  That work has begun and I expect to have a report next month.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly spoke of the failure of <Col N="371" /> the UN system in Somalia.  This charge is fully justified and we must learn from the experience.  Senator O'Kennedy broadened the debate, stating that we should look fundamentally at the whole UN structure, as did Senator Lanigan in his concluding comments.  Ireland will continue to press for reform of the UN to enable the system to meet future demands made of it by the international community when a situation like that in Somalia arises again, and inevitably it will arise.  It is already the subject of discussions in the European Community.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn also referred to the European dimension.  Some of our EC partners are providing troops to UNITAF and they, like other troop contingents, are protecting Irish aid workers. The protection of our aid workers is our major priority.  We are also continuing to press with our European partners to ensure that Somalia and the safety of aid workers are kept at the top of the political agenda.  We shall continue to press for disarming the armed gangs.  Everyone accepts this needs to be done but we should not delude ourselves that it will be an easy task.  It will require some consideration.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock who is not here at the moment proposed private subscriptions with Government funding pound for pound, and I remind the Senator that at present ODA is about double NGO and other private aid.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde referred to the need for daily liaison in Somalia.  I assure the Senator that daily liaison between the UN, the US and the aid agencies in Mogadishu is taking place.  As Minister I have ensured that this important liaison takes place.  In Dublin, too, there is daily contact and exchange of information between the main Irish NGOs and the officials of my office.  Following my appointment I had a meeting with all of the NGOs immediately followed by bilateral meetings with the larger organisations. Senator Ormonde rightly <Col N="372" /> referred to the need for vigilance during the critical period of transition from UNITAF to UNOSOM.  I have referred already to the issue of aid workers coming home.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris stated and I quote &ldquo;Food is a weapon of war&rdquo; and referred also to human rights violations in other countries.  He mentioned East Timor and Cambodia, and I share his view on the need to include reference to other countries in this debate: Senator O'Kennedy, drawing on his experience, referred to his frustration with the inability of the UN to deal with problems in many areas. As the Senator knows, Cambodia is an area of particular interest to me and needs to be considered closely in this debate on the structure of the UN.</P>
    <P>I welcome Senator O'Kennedy's broadening of the debate.  He asked many fundamental questions about interventions in certain areas.  We need to consider how countries might deal with situations requiring intervention both bilaterally and collectively.  It is crucial that in the years ahead the United Nations should intervene, not just after the event but in time to prevent disaster through the use of its intelligence and structures.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher rightly expressed his frustration with the present situation, reflecting the views of many politicians and members of the public.  Senator Gallagher asked how aid workers deal with problems on the ground.  Do they work within the system of the various countries?  Before my visits to Washington and to New York I was at a conference of EC and Central American Ministers in El Salvador where I met with a young Cork man who is working in a commune of about 2,000 very poor people.  He had married a local woman and they had a child both of whom I met. He was a fitter, and had established a local credit union to address the needs of his commune.  I thought that was a tremendous example of an Irish person responding to local needs in the best possible <Col N="373" /> way.  Irish aid workers have tremendous ability to adopt to local needs and to learn new languages such as lesser known African languages.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry mentioned the need to work within UN resolutions and frameworks which I stressed earlier.  She also mentioned the need to discuss safety with aid workers and since my appointment I have constantly sought and taken their advice which is the best advice available in this matter.</P>
    <P>In those brief comments I have tried to cover most of the important points made, a Chathaoirligh.  Thank you for inviting me to this debate.  I warmly welcomed the opportunity to speak and it is most appropriate that the Seanad should discuss this important issue now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for affording me the opportunity to raise this very important issue and I welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
      <P>The effect of the changes in the Common Agricultural Policy decided last July on farmers' incomes and on the agricultural community generally will far outweigh the effect of any developments in Irish agriculture since the foundation of the State.  The changes will be dramatic and far-reaching and will have a major beneficial impact on farmers and across the whole agri-food business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be a change from the old intervention system to the new direct payment system and it is opportune that we discuss this here because, as has been seen from the huge attendance at many meetings throughout the country, <Col N="374" /> there is widespread confusion about how the major schemes will operate.  There will probably be nine or ten new direct funding schemes which will pay cheques directly to farmers from the Department of Agriculture.  This will amount to £700 million or £800 million in direct cash payments in the next two years.  There is general agreement throughout the agricultural industry of the necessity for more details on how these schemes will operate and how the maximum benefit will be derived.  It is timely that we discuss this issue and we should use the Minister's time here to clarify how the change can be effected smoothly, to the maximum benefit of the farming community.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in small farmers, especially in the disadvantaged and severely handicapped areas of my own constituency and along the west coast.  There is a general fear among small farmers at present that the new system will mean more part-time farming in the future thus diminishing the prospect of a long term sustainable income for many people.</P>
    <P>I am acutely conscious of the milk quota restrictions which have seriously hampered the development of small farmers and reduced their incomes over the past number of years.  I wish to put to the Minister the view that in regions where quotas are being applied, exemptions should be granted to farmers producing up to 30,000 gallons of milk.  It seems ludicrous that a farmer producing 16,000 gallons is having his quota cut although he is not the main cause of the over-supply of dairy products.  He is largely dependent on that income to sustain his family.  I am conscious of the important role small farmers play in the community and the desirability of maintaining and sustaining their incomes as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The budget this year has made provision for an allocation of funds for a new retirement scheme for farmers.  I wish to impress upon the Minister the desirability of having a worth while effective retirement scheme.  We are aware that the European Community will provide in the region of 75 per cent of the funding for <Col N="375" /> the new scheme.  There are lessons to be learned from the previous retirement schemes, and the major lesson is that they were all of an unmitigated disaster. We have now the opportunity to make this an effective scheme which will have the desired result.  The scheme should allow people to retire with dignity and should make land available for further development, especially for younger farmers anxious to develop their businesses.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to one minor matter which is causing considerable irritation throughout the agricultural community. Trivial mistakes in the completion of application forms for headage grants and otherwise are depriving farmers not only of their headage income for the year in question but also for further years.  I would be the first to object to any attempts to defraud the system. However, when trivial mistakes and innocent errors deprive people of the main part of their livelihood, not only for one year but successive years, immediate action must be taken.  I would like the Minister to raise this matter with his counterparts in the European Community and in the Commission to ensure that where farmers make innocent mistakes and trivial errors in their application forms they will not be deprived of this income.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have an opportunity for further debate on this matter.  I thank the Minister for coming here and I would be very glad to hear how farmers can get the maximum benefit from the changes in the Common Agricultural Policy.  Since this will directly affect their incomes and livelihood, we should get the best advice and assistance from the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Daly's motion is timely because we are beginning to implement the Common Agricultural Policy reform this year.  It has important implications not alone for farmers but for rural Ireland in general.  I congratulate <Col N="376" /> all those elected to the Seanad, and particularly my colleague, Senator Calnan.</P>
      <P>CAP has been in existence since the foundation of the EC.  It was found necessary to reform the Common Agricultural Policy last year because it could not continue in its old form.  It was doing nothing for farmers' incomes, which were declining and it was costing the taxpayer a considerable amount of money.  Products of various kinds were building up in storerooms all over Europe, to be sold off for half nothing; in some cases, they were half rotten.  This gave the EC a very bad image and the perception was that the EC was funding and supporting the production of food for which there was no use apart from storing it.  At the same time thousands of people were starving and this food could not be made available to them.  Obviously that matter had to be addressed, and it was last year.</P>
      <P>The new system makes substantial finance and funding available directly to farmers, and not into the pockets of store operators and middlemen.  The amount of money we are talking about is very substantial and Senator Daly mentioned a figure of £700 million; the figure will be £700 million plus by 1995, and this will be in direct payments to farmers.  That should substantially improve the cash flow for farmers and for rural Ireland, particularly the town and villages that badly need support and encouragement.</P>
      <P>However, this has created a difficulty. This is the first year of the implementation of Common Agricultural Policy reform, and there are several schemes &mdash; the special beef premium is available for ten month and 22 month old animals, the extensification premia, the slaughter premia, the ewe premia, the sheep headage and the equine headage.  Virtually all quadrupeds qualify for at least one payment.  The difficulty is that while this money is very welcome for our economy, the rules laid down by the EC are extremely stringent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Europe, farmers are expected to be <Col N="377" /> familiar with filling forms and the documentation required.  In rural Ireland, while farmers can carry out their work excellently, the idea of filling forms and office work is anathema to most of them, resulting in innocent errors being made in a substantial number of cases.  This means that not alone is the farmer denied the grant for the animals in question but he is also denied the grant for the entire application for the first and second years. I have struggled with the EC to get over that particular problem.  They say they are paying the piper and are entitled to call the tune and so far they have not been helpful.  I will continue to seek a resolution to this problem.</P>
    <P>I have asked officials in the Department to go to the rural areas, meet the farmers and advise them in the most helpful way how they can apply for, and get, their payments on time and get the maximum amount.  Usually there is a large attendance of farmers at these information meetings.  Both the farmers and officials learned a lot from the meetings because the farmers stated at first hand that the matter was too complex for them.  I will try to simplify the forms and make them user friendly.  This cannot be done overnight although it has given rise to difficulty in some areas.  To get over this problem I had to take staff from the farm development service to help in the livestock area, and these officials meet the farmers when they call to the offices and give them all the assistance they can. Farmers often complain that, having driven long distances they find the offices closed between 12.50 p.m. and 2.30 p.m. As I said, the officials are extremely helpful and friendly and will give all the assistance possible.</P>
    <P>I have enlisted the assistance of Teagasc in relation to these schemes and Teagasc has now put its entire organisation and staff at the disposal of farmers to help them fill in forms.  If a farmer calls to the local Teagasc office, he will be assisted with whatever application he is making.  This service has been widely <Col N="378" /> advertised and I understand farmers are availing of it.  For smaller farmers, there is no charge for this service; for larger farmers there is a charge of £25.  For the amount of money we are talking about &mdash; this year about £400 million plus rising to £700 million plus by 1995 &mdash; this small charge will help farmers to maximise their income from premia and headage payments and will be worth while.  The payments we are talking about are substantial. By filling out the forms in the correct way farmers can improve their income substantially.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly referred to a number of other schemes, such as the farm retirement scheme.  I agree that previous farm retirement schemes were useless; they just did not work.  I recall unfortunate people who applied for and got the farm retirment pension but within three years, the cost of living had eroded its value. They came to my clinic and asked me to discontinue their farm retirement pension. They said they wanted the old age pension because it paid more, it is increased annually, and ancillary benefits went with it.  I will ensure, as far as possible, that this year the farm retirement scheme will be worthwhile and indexed to the cost of living, so that if a person applies for it in a particular year, five or six years hence, it will keep in tune with the cost of living and inflation.  I hope it would be more attractive than the social welfare pension because if it is not people will not give up their farms.</P>
    <P>There is one difficulty I am trying to ovecome.  The European Community are funding this scheme to the tune of 75 per cent &mdash; it costs the Exchequer only 25 per cent &mdash; and the EC are insisting that if a person gives over a farm to a younger person that person will have to increase the size of the holding.  In my experience in rural Ireland most young couples and young people have enough to do to start off in life without having to buy additional land.  This is something that is causing some difficulty.</P>
    <P>The question of the implementation <Col N="379" /> of the reformed Common Agricultural Policy is causing a great deal of anxiety in rural Ireland.  I will seek to ensure that it is implemented in the most effective and the most straightforward way without having too much bureaucracy and red tape involved.  The reality is that people are leaving rural areas; villages, towns and crossroads are no longer the places they used to be with activity and people around them.  In this generation we want to do everything possible to try to stop this decline of rural areas.</P>
    <P>We have a number of schemes under the Common Agricultural Policy reform, such as the Agri-environment scheme, the Leader programme, the Operational Programme for Rural Development and agri-tourism programmes and we should be in a position to marry those together to ensure there is a package that will help in rural Ireland, the farmers and the people such as shopkeepers who depend on farmers for their livelihood, to get the most from these schemes and programmes.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased that a special allocation was made this year in the budget of £4.4 million to provide up to 300 additional staff.  It is not every day of the week that you can get extra staff in Departments because of the embargo on recruiting additional public servants.  I felt so strongly about implmenting these schemes with a degree of smoothness and a helpfulness that I made a special case to the Department of Finance.  I was glad they did not put my submission in the shredder, that they listened to me and made available that very welcome additional resource.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to respond to this debate.  I am very pleased to call back here for brief encounters in the Seanad at any opportunity I get because it is a worthwhile forum in which to discuss matters of national interest such as this.  I thank Senator Daly for raising the question.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank you a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me to bring this matter before the House.</P>
      <P>This is the fourth time I have brought this issue before the House in three years. It is with a certain sense of frustration, moving towards anger, that we raise the matter again because it has been ongoing for 27 years.  Rathkeale has been promised a proper second level school but we still do not see the problem resolved.  We are asking tonight that the Minister gives a commitment to provide moneys to complete the school to be ready for next September.</P>
      <P>The present conditions of the school are totally unacceptable and previous Ministers have accepted that this is the case.  I should like at this stage to compliment the former Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, who paid a lot of attention to what we said and during her period in office we made considerable progress on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prefab-type classrooms many of which are 26 and 27 years old are totally unsuitable for teaching or for learning. The area we are talking about includes not just Rathkeale but also Croagh, Coolcappagh, and Kilfinny, and schools <Col N="381" /> in Aghalinn, Ballingarry and Granagh. The children are obtaining their education under deprived conditions.  They are disadvantaged educationally by their conditions.  The results they obtain each year are a credit to the school.  They are above the average for schools in the country and I would like to compliment the Sisters of Mercy for the excellent work they have done.</P>
    <P>It is 26 years since the Department and the then Minister suggested that the vocational school and Convent of Mercy should amalgamate to provide second level education.  At that time it was a community school; it is now a community college because of changed circumstances. I will not go into all the details because I have gone into them at least three times previously.</P>
    <P>There is no permanent school structure there.  There is a series of prefab buildings creating many problems especially in bad weather where children and teachers have to cross yards to go to various classrooms or to go to toilets.  They even have to cross a busy roadway to go between classrooms.  The parents, teachers and the children are at their utmost limits and it is in all our interests that commencement of the construction should take place at an early date.  I ask the Minister to recognise the urgency of the situation and request his Department to commence construction during this year.</P>
    <P>In the past various problems have delayed the building of the school.  There was a problem at one time because of demographic changes in the region and new plans had to be drawn up.  These have now been drawn up and at present the County Limerick Vocational Edcuational Committee are amalgamating stages four and five.  These will be completed, I understand, within three weeks and it will be ready for tender stage in three weeks time.  Then the question of funding arises for the Department.  I am asking the Minister to give a commitment tonight for funding to allow building to <Col N="382" /> commence in 1993 and have it completed by the next school year as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I have personal experience of this school as about 12 years ago I was a substitute teacher there.  The conditions then were bad; now they are worse.  As Senator Neville has pointed out, the school consists of prefabricated buildings and they are located on either side of what was once a quiet street.  Since the Rathkeale by-pass has been put in place what was once a quiet street is now a feeder road for the by-pass.</P>
      <P>One day the school authorities counted the number of passing vehicles.  The school buildings are located on both sides of the street.  Between 8.45 a.m. and 9 a.m. 123 vehicles passed at a time when children were on their way to school. Between 11.10 a.m. and 11.20 a.m. and between 12.40 p.m. and 1.20 p.m. 47 and 87 vehicles passed, respectively.  During both these periods children are on breaks.</P>
      <P>The 200 female students have to use the toilet facilities in the girls' primary school.  The boys on the other hand have to cross two school yards and two streets, to reach the toilet facilities in the boys' primary school.  The prefabs are extremely damp, wet and cold in winter and uncomfortably hot in summer.  The school provided me with figures showing that during 1991-92 it cost over £12,500 to heat the prefabs and over £9,000 to carry out maintenance repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school is at a crisis point, because they are obliged to return a room in the adjoining primary school which they have been using for home economics.  This room is needed by the primary school to accommodate itinerant children who were refused admission in September 1991 and in 1992.  Second level students in the area are being disadvantaged and vital space is being taken up which could be used for the education of itinerant children.  Senator Neville will agree that <Col N="383" /> Rathkeale has a very high itinerant population and badly needs to set up a system of education to enable these itinerant children to be integrated into society.  I implore the Minister to treat this matter as urgent.  As Senator Neville pointed out this unsatisfactory situation has prevailed for many years and it is time for action to resolve the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward) Liam Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Neville and Kelly for raising this matter.  I am aware of Senator Neville's interest in this project which he has raised on a number of occasions and I assure the Members of the Department's commitment to the project.  I acknowledge also, the need for progress in this case.</P>
      <P>It will be appreciated that while this project has been in planning for a number of years, changes in circumstances, some of which occurred recently illustrate how the planning of large projects must often be amended even at an advanced stage. In 1983 the Sisters of Mercy informed the Department that they could not proceed with a new secondary school but were willing to participate in a community school and this development, with the agreement of County Limerick Vocational Education Committee, was approved by the then Minister for Education. Following this agreement the project proceeded in accordance with the standard building procedures of the Department.  A site was acquired, a schedule of accommodation was agreed by the school authorities involved, a design team was appointed and architectural planning commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Architectural planning proceeded and had reached the outline sketch scheme stage in early 1990 when, in common with all such building projects, the project was reviewed in the light of current and projected enrolments for the area, and in the light of the annual drop in births for County Limerick of 21 per cent between 1980 and 1988.  Arising from this review <Col N="384" /> it was apparent that the long term trend in pupil numbers indicated a requirement for a 400 pupil school rather than a 500 pupil school as was being planned until then.</P>
    <P>The project is a major financial commitment costing possibly as much as £2 million in total.  In view of this reduction in pupil requirement the schedule of classroom accommodation being planned, and consequently the architectural plans had to be revised in consultation with the school authorities.  I should also refer to another very significant development which occurred towards the end of 1991 when the religious authorities involved decided to withdraw from participation in the proposed community school.  Arising from this the then Minister for Education approved the development of the school as a community college under the aegis of the County Limerick Vocational Education Committee who are now responsible for the project.</P>
    <P>In mid-1991 the vocational education committee were asked to request their design team to redesign the plans in the light of the changed circumstances.  In August 1991 the vocational education committee's design team submitted the revised outline sketch scheme.  This submission was carefully examined in the Department and further correspondence took place with the vocational education committee with regard to some additional amendments.  In March 1992 the vocational education committee were given approval to proceed with the next stage of architectural planning.  In addition in order to assist the vocational education committee in speeding up the planning of the project the Department has allowed the vocational education committee to proceed with the remainder of planning in accordance with an alernative streamlined set of procedures, normally only applied to smaller projects. This will illustrate the Department's commitment to assisting the vocational education committee to plan <Col N="385" /> this project as quickly as possible.  The Department is currently awaiting the submission by County Limerick vocational education committee of the next stage of architectural planning.</P>
    <P>In November 1992 the final sections of the developed sketch scheme was submitted. Following examination of these proposals, the Department indicated to County Limerick Vocational Education Committee that subject to some amendments the project could proceed to the final stage prior to tender, i.e., the combined detail design/contract documents stage.  This submission is now awaited in the Department.</P>
    <P>I must point out, however, that while every effort will be made to assist the vocational education committee to complete the planning as quickly as possible, the project is not yet ready to commence to construction.  Until the planning has been completed and tenders invited, it is not possible to give any indication of when building can start.  However, I would like to assure the Senators that there will be no undue delay in having the planning completed with a view to commencement of construction at the earliest possible opportunity.  As Members may be aware, the projects for 1993 have already been decided upon but the Minister and staff within the Department of Education are currently drawing up priority lists and these will be available soon.  I hope this school will be seriously considered in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the fact that the vocational education committee will submit the plans to the Department within three weeks I urge the Minister to ensure that priority is given to the commencement of construction in 1993 because it is availability of capital and not procedures and stages which will hinder construction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed this morning that my request to have the Seanad debate the Kilkenny rape case, which concluded in the High Court on Monday, was refused.  This case has aroused revulsion and anger and it is a sad reflection on our society that such a case could occur.  This case opens our eyes to what is happening throughout the country, issues we are afraid to confront. How could the father of this unfortunate victim get away with this cruel deed for so long and how many more such cases remain to be uncovered?  The system for dealing with such cases is totally inadequate. Clear procedures must be established to detect cases of child sexual abuse.</P>
      <P>It is clear that several members of the caring profession knew of the case but were powerless to act.  This must change and there must be a thorough investigation of all aspects of the Kilkenny case by all arms of the State, not alone the Minister of Health.  This must be the basis for new procedures which will allow quick and effective exposure of incest and all forms of child abuse.  As I said, it is a duty not alone for the Minister for Health, but for many other arms of the state.</P>
