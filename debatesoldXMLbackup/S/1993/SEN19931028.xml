      <P>I have notice from Senator Quinn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to consider moving Ireland to European Time with effect from October 1994.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Cotter of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide funding for a new school for Killany, Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, to replace the existing school which was built in 1847.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to allocate more funding to Co-operation North.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Quinn's Cotter and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Quinn's and Cotter's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Ross may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is Items 1 and 2.  On Item 1 it is proposed to conclude Second Stage by 1 p.m. today, if that is agreed.  There will be a sos from 1 p.m. until 2 p.m. Item 2 will be taken at 2 p.m.  The provisions of Standing Order 112 will not apply in relation to the Order for the Fifth Stage of Item 2.  If anyone wishes to understand the implications of Standing Order 112, I have notes on it but our able staff will explain its meaning for Senators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for evading explaining the matter in simple language.  On the Order of Business I ask for clarification from the Leader on a matter of legislation.  I do not expect the clarification this morning but I ask him to arrange it.  It arises from the Industrial Development Bill 1993, passed here earlier this year.  My understanding &mdash; and the understanding of most people at that time &mdash; was that Forfás would be the umbrella body and have a major role in co-ordinating the activities of the other two agencies.  It appears from unconfirmed reports in the newspapers this morning that a different and more modest role is now envisaged for Forfás.</P>
      <P>There may be good reasons for this but one would not want to see the implementation of legislation being different from what was outlined by the Minister in this House and from what may be in the legislation. If there is a major change in the implementation we should know what it is and I ask the Leader of the House to come back with clarification on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised with the Leader of the House over the last number of weeks the need to have a list of the legislation with which we will be dealing over the coming months and in particular the Bills we will be initiating in this House. This morning we will be dealing with the Adoptive Leave Bill which is progressive and important legislation.  Apart from that we are not clear about what is to happen and we are entitled to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1631" /> Last night we debated at length the area of the marine in Private Members' Time.  It was an important debate and many matters were discussed in the Chamber, although it was obvious we did not have enough time.  That issue requires a greater period for discussion and both sides of the House agree much can be said on it.  It goes far beyond party considerations and I ask the Leader of the House to give it more time in the near future.</P>
    <P>Prior to the summer I received a commitment from the Leader for a debate on developments in education.  Some fundamental discussions and movements have occurred in education in the last number of months.  There should be a full discussion on those developments with the Minister in the House similar to a debate we had last year when she took questions.  That would be welcomed by the Department of Education and the Minister and it should also be put on the agenda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The business as presented by the Leader is agreeable to me.  He makes me a little uncomfortable when he starts resorting to Standing Orders.  I hope this will not be a permanent departure because he might start doing things we do not like and we might not know what he was doing.  However, we will always refer to the book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary and important to discuss agriculture in the coming weeks because the GATT agreement is due to be completed by mid-December.  Our views on that should be put on the record.  The Minister introduced a new farm retirement scheme and while the scheme is welcome there are aspects of it that could be fruitfully debated here.  There is also the matter of headage payments and the way they are being paid &mdash; or not paid &mdash; as the case may be.  I am aware that we had an opportunity to discuss agriculture when we debated EC developments but it was peripheral to the central part of that debate.  It is important to devote time specially to agriculture but it has to <Col N="1632" /> be done quickly because of the urgency of the GATT negotiations.</P>
    <P>Finally, it would be appropriate for the House to congratulate Roddy Doyle on winning the Booker Prize in the past few days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to provide some time to discuss the county enterprise partnership boards which are now being set up.  The reason I ask for the debate is that there are many different approaches and many of the boards have their own set of rules, regulations and standards.  It is important to have a discussion in this House to try to understand the legislation's intention and to have a uniform approach throughout the country. I would welcome the opportunity to have a debate on the county enterprise partnership boards and how effective they will be.</P>

      <P>I once again ask the Leader of the House to arrange a discussion on Northern Ireland as soon as possible.  From telephone conversations last evening with friends, some of whom are not without influence in Northern Ireland, I know that they were very impressed by the non-divisive statements and by our vote of sympathy and support. They saw what happened in this House and in the Dáil yesterday as being supportive and helpful and that can only be for good.  It is important that this House should again, and very soon, give some time to talk about Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>As a member of a local authority, in view of the time of year and the serious situation that exists for local authorities <i>vis-a-vis</i> funding, I ask the Leader of the House if time will be provided for a debate on the funding of local authorities.  It is a major issue.  As far as I can see the Government plan is making provision for everything except local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wilson's request for a debate at the earliest opportunity on Northern Ireland, the situation with regard to Ireland as a whole <Col N="1633" /> and the problems we face because of the continuing conflict.  The debate in the Dáil and the motion in this House yesterday showed that everybody is most concerned and there is an excellent spirit of co-operation on all sides.</P>
      <P>We should also congratulate John Rocha on winning the British designer of the year award.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make two points. Last evening we had a discussion on fisheries but, sadly, it was very short.  It was a motion put before the House by a party in Government.  We can learn from the National Development Plan and if particular sections of the plan are put before the House by the relevant Ministers we should have more time to debate them. We learned a few things last evening. Indeed the Minister was very helpful but, sadly, many Members did not have enough time because of the structure of a Private Members' motion.  More time should be given, particularly to the National Development Plan because much can be learned from it.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Sherlock's remarks on local government funding.  There are problems within local authorities regarding funding and major problems in urban areas because of compensation claims that cannot be met.  It is relevant and important to ask the Leader of the House for time.  A case should be made to the Minister for the Environment regarding what help can be given to urban areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make contact with the Minister to, I hope, allay any <Col N="1635" /> fears Senator Manning may have in regard to media reports <i>vis-a-vis</i> the IDA Bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to future legislation, as Senator O'Toole correctly said, a Bill will be initiated in this House and I very much welcome that.  I am sorry I do not have the information I promised him last week but I assure him I will get it.  I reiterate, as I did last week, that I am quite confident we will have many Bills initiated in this House between now and the Christmas recess.</P>
      <P>An education debate, will be arranged subject to agreement between the Whips. Regarding the Department of Marine debate, the House will most definitely have another opportunity for discussion. The debate last night was probably one of the best I ever heard, given the amount of expertise in the House.  I was chastised by my family for the fact that I had not taken the opportunity to promote fish last night.  I look forward to the opportunity to debate the future plans of the Department of the Marine.</P>
      <P>We will arrange an agriculture debate, subject to the Whips' agreement, between now and the Christmas recess. Regarding a debate on the county enterprise partnership boards, I would like to see that a little later to give them an opportunity to establish themselves so that we can get a feel for what is happening in each part of the country.</P>
      <P>In respect of Senator Wilson's request, I will make contact with those involved in the Northern Ireland situation with regard to whether we will have a debate. I am sure the leaders will meet about that. I would welcome such an opportunity.</P>
      <P>With regard to funding for local authorities which Senator Sherlock mentioned, the Dublin Authority Bill will be coming before the House soon.  I am sure he can avail of the opportunity then to discuss what he feels is the lack of funding for local authorities.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1636" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, while noting its complexity, I welcomed this legislation. Maybe it is indicative of the complex nature of our society to introduce a measure which we all welcome and regard as a civilised step forward.  It is extraordinary that we have to go to such convoluted lengths to achieve that purpose. Nonetheless, the Bill is welcome.</P>
      <P>It seems, as I said, to codify in law what should be the norm in a civilised society which regards itself as Christian. It recognises that in a marriage, both partners contributed in their different ways co-equally &mdash; the Minister made this point in his speech &mdash; to the building of the assets of the family.  I especially welcome the sentiments expressed by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, in introducing the Bill.  It is not acceptable that the major asset of most families &mdash; the family home &mdash; should be in the name of one partner, invariably the husband.  I endorse the view that women who choose to take on the nurturing and homebuilding role, work for their families and, through their families work for society, should be recognised in law and in fact as opting for a career as meaningful and worthwhile as those who choose careers outside the home which attract monetary remuneration. The Minister made that point in his Second Stage speech and it is worth emphasising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a bitter fact that women who build a family home, having suffered generations of role devaluation by male chauvinists, should, more recently, have suffered a similar devaluation from their sisters in radical feminism.  The Bill is a meaningful and significant advancement in the human rights of women in the home.  It is overdue and a concrete, if <Col N="1637" /> partial, expression of society's recognition of the value of the homemaker and the nurturer.  It is a timely vindication of the role and the importance of a woman who chooses to make the family her career.  The Bill, in the Minister's own words, establishes joint ownership of the matrimonial home as the normal form of home ownership applicable in this society.  All sides of this House rightly recognise its value and commend the Minister for his action.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill, I wonder if we should not be going further &mdash; this is my final point.  The family home is a central asset in the life of the family but it is not the only asset which flows from the marriage.  I have in mind the building up of family businesses, which is invariably a joint development and to which both partners contribute.  Like the family home, all too often the legal ownership is registered under one partner's name, usually that of the husband. Invariably, the role of the woman has no concrete or legal recognition.  The family farm is another example.  We all know the central role played in the family farm ventures by the wife, but she seldom gets any concrete &mdash; and certainly no legal &mdash; recognition for that role.  Indeed, this Bill, for all its virtues, goes to some trouble &mdash; I understand the constitutional nature of the conundrum faced by the Minister and the drafters of the Bill &mdash; to specifically exclude the role of the wife on the family farm in that it specifies what is included and excluded from the legal protection extended to the spouse when the family home coincides with the family farm.</P>
    <P>The matter does not end with family businesses or farms.  The homemaking spouse also contributes to career progress and development and to the accrual of wealth throughout a wage earning career. That contribution, like that to the business and farm, is not recognised in our society and has no legal recognition. Equity and progress demand that we move towards recognising the co-equal contribution towards the accrual of all assets.  The Bill recognises one part of the joint contribution made by the partners; <Col N="1638" /> it is a part made in a significant asset and is welcome in that regard.  However, I wonder if the Minister should now turn his and his Department's attention to the possibility of a wider recognition in law to the role played by both partners in the accrual of all patrimony, wealth and assets through the marriage.  I raise this point, not as a criticism of the Minister, but as an indication of what else we need to do at this stage.  I commend the Bill.  I am pleased to support it and I congratulate the Minister for introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This Bill is long overdue and its consequences cannot be underestimated. It will, I hope, rubber-stamp what most would regard as the most desirable situation but it does not mean that there will be no difficulties in all cases.  Nowadays when a family home is purchased, both names are usually on the deed.  However, other cases need to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heretofore, the consent of either spouse was required before a property could be sold, but many of them were tricked into selling their property.  There have also been cases where both partners signed a bank guarantee and either one or both were misled or not made fully aware of all the facts.  One of the most important aspects of the Bill, as the Minister stated, is that it further recognises the work, commitment and contribution of the housewife.  I do not want to compare different households but for far too long there has not been enough recognition of those who, by their own choice or who can afford to stay at home, opt to work in the house.  Not every household, whether it be the man or the woman, can afford to pay the bills, the mortgage, and educate the children on one salary.  Most people, whether in part-time or full-time employment, require two salaries to provide for an average family and to make the necessary commitment in this regard. This Bill gives recognition without taking anything away from the spouse or both spouses who are at work.  It ensures there is no distinction between the spouse who <Col N="1639" /> goes out to work and the spouse who remains at home.  The property will now be in the joint names of both parties. This Bill recognises that both spouses contribute in different ways.</P>
    <P>Historically, the man went to work while the woman stayed at home to look after the children.  There are many instances where men are dependent on the income of the woman of the house because of job difficulties or a change in circumstances.  It is important to mark the passing of this Bill and recognise that both spouses contribute in various ways, including a commitment to stay at home to ensure the children are looked after. It is important to recognise the contribution of both spouses in this regard.</P>
    <P>I hope difficulties experienced previously will be overcome when this Bill is passed.  However, circumstances will only change regarding properties when an individual goes to the Registry of Deeds or the Land Registry to register it in both names.  Both spouses will now be registered, something which did not happen in the past when many properties were held in the name of the man.  Today most financial institutions ask that a property be held in both names because, in most cases, it takes two people to pay a mortgage and bring up a family.  This Bill must not supersede the right of a court to deal with separations or family breakups. A court must be able to make an order regarding the sale of a house taking into account that one spouse may be living in it while the other has moved out. It is important that this Bill does not affect those in difficulty and who seek separation or annulment.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister propose to introduce regulations to ensure a simple form of transfer at the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds?  Indeed, speaking against our profession, we must ensure costs are kept to a minimum to enable people to avail of this.  I note that no fee will be charged by the Registry of Deeds or the Land Registry.  A simple form must be introduced at the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds so that registration may take effect where necessary.  The <Col N="1640" /> Minister is aware of the time it takes, at the Registry of Deeds, in particular, to get a deed of transfer or an assignment in relation to a memorial and the various stamping provisions.  The Minister mentioned that no fee will be charged.  Does he really mean that?  In this life there are few free lunches, dinners, etc.  I ask the Minister to outline the situation and to introduce regulations in this regard.</P>
    <P>Members on this side of the House may introduce amendments on Committee Stage.  However, we support this Bill which gives an automatic right to the other spouse and joint ownership in the property.  If one party is adjudicated bankrupt, will this prevent the property being disposed of or will there be a stay in relation to proceedings?  Often people fall into arrears regarding mortgages and there has been an escalation in the number of banks and financial institutions looking for judgments and judgment mortgages and seeking to enforce same.  I ask the Minister to address this point in his reply.</P>
    <P>We are satisfied with this Bill, which is long overdue and I congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  It had a long and detailed passage in the other House. I welcome the Minister's assertion that he will take reasonable amendments on board even if they further delay the passage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  In his speech he summed up, in his inimitable fashion, the decades and decades of injustices done to women. I quote:</P>
      <P>In the past, it was commonplace for the family home to be in the sole name of the husband.  His wife, in return for looking after the home and rearing the children, was given a roof over her head and the &ldquo;housekeeping&rdquo; money. If she was lucky, some limited provision was made for her if she became widowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That summed it up.  The money was held by the other partner.  Down through the years women had no direct influence on legislation as few of them were in the <Col N="1641" /> parliament.  It is fitting that a man should redress the decades of injustice inflicted on women.  We all know of situations where houses were sold overnight without consultation, it is not so common now but certainly in the 1950s and 1960s it was a reality.  It is also true that in some cases, the man would never have had a house as he did not have the wit, drive, or enthusiasm to provide it.  It was ironic that she provided the money for the house and that he kept it.  I am delighted that the Minister, Deputy Taylor, is redressing the situation as it should have been done many years ago but it is a great start to a historical new Department of Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to houses and caravans, I wish to bring his attention to a new phenomenon, houseboats.  There are 1,000 houseboats in Essex.  Boats on the Royal Canal, the Grand Canal and the Shannon are the sole residence of couples, some of them married.  Because of developments in our estuaries and waterways this will become an increasing phenomenon because in England you can buy a houseboat on the Thames for £60,000.  You could not buy anything comparable in the heart of London for a couple of hundred thousand pounds.</P>

      <P>The Minister is always ahead of me.  I am glad because, as I said, it is a new phenomenon.</P>
      <P>The one reservation I have is about the courts.  In some cases judgments are very prejudiced and redress is not always simple because it is a very expensive process to try to redress a situation where an injustice has been done.  The Bill does not allow any interference in that area and there is a poverty trap there to which more thought should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that the Bill has been introduced as it redresses generations of injustices.  It has been obvious over the last ten or 12 years that in trying to introduce legislation providing for divorce, the main stumbling block was a lack of <Col N="1642" /> clarity in relation to property and financial rights.  That is where it foundered despite the Government being warned that women do not easily surrender their rights in exchange for an assurance that they will be looked after, which I think was the expression used.  This legislation is also extremely important in allowing further liberalisation of the law in step with modern society.  I congratulate the Minister on the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I also welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his appointment.</P>
      <P>As we know, because property was a major issue in the last referendum it is necessary to bring in this legislation. There are, naturally, queries one would have and I hope that the Minister will make provision for them or bring in amendments.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise a few important points.  Section 4 applies to:</P>
      <P>any interest in a matrimonial home, whether the interest is legal or equitable, or realty or personalty including an interest under tenancy agreements but excluding an interest held as trustee or licensee or the interest of a tenant under a letting made for the period of the tenant's continuance in any office... Where, upon the commencement of this section, either or both of the spouses concerned is or are entitled to an interest to which this section applies in a matrimonial home, thereupon, the interest shall, subject to the provisions of the Act, vest in them as joint tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of people took out joint mortgages to purchase their homes.  It is important to have legislation of this kind but one must seek clarification in regard to the situation where a person has left the family home and could be deemed to be guilty of desertion or adultery, for <Col N="1643" /> example, where a person has been outside the family home for, say, three years and has entered into a relationship as a result of which a child was born.  Does that person have the right to come back when this legislation has been passed, saying that their entitlement is now strengthened and that as a result they want to claim their share?  If the spouse still in the family home cannot provide it, then that spouse could have to move out of the family home and allow the other to move back in.  There are people who, unfortunately, find themselves in that situation.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that the matrimonial home means the dwelling in which a married couple ordinarily resided or reside either immediately before or at any time after the commencement of this section. Will the Minister clarify the interpretation of that section?  I ask the Minister to introduce a system to make it easy for people and to implement procedures whereby people will not need a solicitor. People on a low income probably qualify for free legal aid, but they are at the end of a list as long as your arm with no chance of having their case heard for a long time.  The legal profession do not take much interest in this kind of work as there is not much money in it for them. We are introducing legislation to give spouses rights to the family home in the event of there being a successful divorce referendum and, consequently, a large number of people seeking advice.  The question is whether such people will have to go to the legal profession and find themselves completely frustrated by the type of situation that we have.  Will that be further exacerbated?  I appeal to the Minister to provide for people who require that kind of help and advice without having to resort to the legal profession.</P>
    <P>Are marriage annulments recognised under the Bill where spouses are separated for other reasons?  I scrutinised the contents of the Bill but, when I did that in the past, I often found that my interpretation did not always agree with <Col N="1644" /> the interpretation of those who drafted the legislation.</P>
    <P>This is welcome legislation.  Great progresss has been made in latter years in so far as tenant purchasers of local authority housing are concerned as well as joint ownership by spouses who purchase and mortgage their property.  The importance of this legislation is to make the situation crystal clear because when we talked to people before the last referendum this issue was raised and there really was no answer.  In this Bill, however, the answer is being provided in the event of there being a divorce referendum.  It is important that property and rights to property are dealt with because they are contentious matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation which is long overdue.  For many years, in local authority tenancies a joint tenancy agreement had to be signed which protected both partners.  It also resolved many problems in the past when there was a break-up or where rows had developed in a marriage or partnership. It is time that both partners in a marriage had equal rights, particularly in the ownership of the family home.  It is welcome legislation yet it can be fraught with difficulties.  I can see that over the next few years many court cases will be taken &mdash; it is mentioned in the Bill but not spelt out sufficiently &mdash; where parts of the family home are used for business purposes.  Whether that business is a public house, a grocer's shop or a farmhouse difficulties will have to be overcome although I am not sure how.  I know that parts of business premises are rated for business purposes and that the dwelling part of the premises is treated as part of the family home.  It would be difficult to put a value on a premises if part is used as a business and part as the family home.  I do not see how you can adjudicate on that matter.  If a formula has been worked out I would like to see it because, apart from the implication in this legislation and in this circumstance, there are other circumstances in which it can come into force as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1645" /> What would the situation be in the case of a publican who loses his licence because he did not have a tax clearance certificate?  What would the implications be for the property rights of the spouse living in the family part of that property? I am not too sure whether the taxman could take over the whole property or that part of the property used for business purposes.</P>
    <P>This Bill emphasises the fact that before people get married they will have to realise they are entering into a partnership, not alone on a personal basis but on the basis of joint ownership of property.  I hope this means that people will give the matter careful consideration and not let their heart rule their head.</P>
    <P>Society is changing in Ireland as in most of the western world.  House property has gone up in value and, therefore, this Bill basically deals with middle to upper-class people.  People on lower levels of income in local authority houses, or in houses provided by others, will not be affected by it.  The day is long gone when women were seen as chattels of their husbands.  The Bill is welcome but might not be as necessary now as it might have been before women realised they had equal rights, if not within the law then by virture of the fact that they are part of a family.</P>
    <P>What is the situation in regard to a house on which there is an existing mortgage in the name of one of the spouses, and where there is a break-up?  Under the new law it is determined that there will be equal rights for both spouses, but if one of the spouses does not pay his or her mortgage, what will happen?  How can a mortgage company protect itself in that situation?  If someone has a mortgage and feels they are running into trouble with it, prior to this Bill they could make a legal agreement with their partner to transfer the family home to joint-ownership. That could negate the rights of the mortgage company which could not act against the spouse of the person who had taken out the mortgage.</P>
    <P>Do the rights to the family home take in only the home?  Do they include property surrounding the home?  Rights of <Col N="1646" /> way are mentioned in the Bill but does the legislation take in the land on which the home is built, the garden, the lawns or whatever is attached to the house? The Bill does not refer to farm buildings, glasshouses or garages which may be semi-detached from the house.  What is the position regarding these?  Unless it is clearly stated what constitutes the family home the problems of spouses in conflict will not be eased because one cannot sell a family home in isolation from the surrounding grounds if these are considered part of it.  Is there provision in the Bill for this?</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for bringing the legislation to the House.  There will be difficulties with it but it is welcome and gives couples a better understanding of what is involved in living together as partners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the Minister's speech with some interest.  He did not mention, not deliberately I am sure, that this Bill is a precursor to the proposed divorce referendum next year.  It is honest, when considering this Bill, to say it is part of the legislative programme of the Government which it genuinely believes is necessary if it is to present a package to the people next year in the proposed divorce referendum which will be more attractive than the last one and which will be passed because of the enabling legislation.  I suspect &mdash; but do not know &mdash; that this is based on a false premise.</P>
      <P>The last divorce referendum in 1986 was very interesting and dramatic because, during the campaign, which lasted for a month or so, opinion polls fluctuated wildly and opinion changed dramatically.  At one point 60 per cent favoured divorce and 40 per cent opposed it but this position was later reversed. This was an extraordinary sea change of opinion in a matter of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the political analysts subsequently said the reason for this change was that the population, particularly women, were scared by a very deliberate campaign which was meant to frighten them into believing if divorce was introduced they would lose their rights to <Col N="1647" /> property and the roofs over their heads. This was, to a large extent, untrue but many people feel that it worked.  As the Minister knows, it would have been impossible, even then, for a husband to sell the family home without the consent of his wife.  However, many women are thought to have voted against divorce because they believed what was told to them by those who were antagonistic to divorce during that campaign.  I doubt this.</P>
    <P>There will probably be more to the divorce campaign next year than rights to property, material possessions and pensions.  There is a real problem in getting women to vote for divorce because they are frightened in a very intangible way.  Much of this is due to the present structure of society, as many speakers said.  It is not solely due to material possessions or property but to the fact that men still have the best jobs, salaries and earning power.  If I were a housewife &mdash; this Bill is directed to and meant to protect such persons &mdash; even if I felt I was being given a legal cast iron guarantee of an equitable interest of 50 per cent of the house I would feel nervous about voting for divorce because after those proceedings are taken the person who will earn the money and control the purse strings will still be the man.</P>
    <P>We have a structural problem in our society in getting divorce through.  Even if we enact all the enabling legislation there are certain things which Governments in any country cannot change, such as attitudes and discrimination.  We will have such a structure for many years which will make it very difficult to get women to vote for divorce.  This Bill may reassure them.  Its symbolism is probably more important than the material benefit it provides and this may reassure them. In effect, women will still get a bad deal out of any divorce arrangements because of the structure of society.  Such a structure also exists in other countries but we have special difficulties here because of our traditions, etc.  This structure ensures the man is in control of the family purse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1648" /> What will be the position of a husband and wife who, under this Bill, have a joint equitable interest in the family home, in a negative equity situation as has happened so often in the UK and is increasingly happening here?  If the value of a mortgage on a house becomes greater than the open market value of the house itself, under this Bill will the spouse who is not earning &mdash; usually the wife &mdash; be landed with a massive liability which he or she cannot possibly pay?  My interpretation of the Bill is that if one is entitled to 50 per cent of the equity of the house, which is always assumed to be an asset, one may be faced with a liability. There are many situations of negative equity in Ireland.  Spouses with no earning capacity may be landed with a debt which they cannot possibly pay.  I do not know whether this is being considered by the Minister or whether he feels this is fair.  It is a serious question which leads me to worry about the implications of this Bill for either spouse.</P>
    <P>The Bill seems to recognise very definitely the institution of marriage.  What will be the situation for people who have been living together as partners for many years, who have children, whose relationships have all the characteristics of marriage but who have not gone through either a religious or a State marriage ceremony? Will they be deprived of these rights because they have not gone through such a ceremony?  It is a constant problem for legislators to recognise the differences and similarities between marriage and quasi-marriage and to treat such partnerships in the same way.  The Bill fails to recognise that increasing numbers of people are not marrying for reasons which are totally their own business. We are continuing to insist on legislating for marriage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of them cannot get married because there is no divorce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right but what about the many who do not want to marry? They want to have children, joint ownership of houses and all sorts of security but do not want to get married.  This <Col N="1649" /> Bill does not protect them.  Does the Bill portray the attitudes to marriage we have always had, that it is respectable, recognisable and easy to pigeon hole?  Does it mean that those who take a decision not to be involved in marriage somehow do not deserve or earn the same protection as those who do?  Many of those partnerships have several children and, to all intents and purposes, are married.</P>
      <P>The Bill does us a service in a symbolic way, as the Minister said in his speech, in that it recognises the role of the housewife in society.  Their role perhaps cannot be recognised in a monetary way because it is not tangible or quantifiable, but the Bill recognises that the day of looking at the housewife as doing a duty rather than a job is over.  The day of women apologising for the fact that they do not work outside the home is over.  Many of us, when we are in this House listening to each other for too long &mdash; I especially felt this when I had to listen to Senator Lanigan &mdash; would perhaps prefer to be at home changing a baby's nappy instead of doing a necessary part of one's legislative life, which can be extremely tedious. There are great rewards for those who have to or who decide to stay at home.  It is something which we must recognise, as this Bill does.</P>
      <P>Finally, I reiterate and support something which Senator Sherlock said.  There is a danger in all this matrimonial legislation that we are making a great deal of work for lawyers and making life difficult for vulnerable people in our society. People involved in marital breakups are very vulnerable.  Many of them are extremely poor, lacking in funds and unable to get the advice which they need on complicated legislation such as this to ensure they know their rights.  I do not think that we can justifiably continue to introduce legislation of this sort - which is, of course, politically correct in the modern sense and morally right in many ways &mdash; then put it on the Statute Book and not provide the mechanisms for vulnerable people whom this is meant to protect, to be able to use this legislation for their own benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1650" /> I do not approve of legislators coming into this House and continuously screaming about more funding for this and that without saying from where the money will come.  That is a cop-out, a privilege which Opposition continuously take upon itself and which discredits it because it never says from where the money will come.  However, it is wrong to introduce civil liberties and rights, human rights legislation of this sort, in a vacuum without ensuring that every citizen, however poor they are and however difficult and inaccessible they find lawyers, can avail of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for the broad welcome it has given to this Bill and for the constructive nature of the debate in the House.  Many Senators referred to the context of this Bill as being in the run-up to the divorce referendum which the Government has undertaken to hold in 1994.  This Bill being in position may be an important factor in the determinations of many people when that referendum takes place.  However, I emphasise that the Bill stands on its own merits, regardless of whether divorce is introduced and the referendum carried. This Bill stands in its own right as implementing in the view of the Government &mdash; and the Opposition also, I am pleased to note &mdash; an important and necessary advance in social family legislation in the Ireland of the 1990s, for all the reasons I outlined in my opening speech.</P>
      <P>There has been no disagreement on the principle that there should be equal ownership of the matrimonial home.  Several Senators wish that the principle went further and extended to all matrimonial property.  A number of Senators thought that equal ownership of all the household chattels, while an excellent concept in principle, was not a practical proposition when applied to particular items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Neville referred to the recommendations of the Second Report of the Commission on the Status of Women for a wide extension of joint ownership of matrimonial property, and he asked for <Col N="1651" /> my views on that matter.  I regard these recommendations as deserving of the fullest consideration which, I assure Senators, is what they will get.  Those proposals are radical indeed, but only in relation to our traditional thinking and I intend to approach them in a positive way.  In some European and Scandinavian countries, as I understand it, the concept of universal community property in marriage has existed for many years. We need to look at how that regimen has operated.</P>
    <P>The important task, to which I have asked my Department to give priority, is to get the Government's family law measures, as outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government, on the Statute Book as early as possible and this Bill is the first in that programme.  When this legislation is in operation and up and running, I will be in a position to devote attention to further equality measures in the matrimonial context, including consideration of the various proposals on this subject in the Commission's second report.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher, while welcoming the Bill, also referred to the growing body of opinion that equal ownership should also extend to the whole of the family farm, to which the non-owning spouse would have contributed much, or to the family business.  I fully appreciate this sentiment which, as I said, also reflects the view of the Commission on the Status of Women in its second report.  However, like Senator Gallagher, I regard it as important to get this Bill passed first as a priority measure.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville and a number of other Senators asked where the family home begins and ends in relation to a farm, for example.  As the Senator said, this becomes important when there has to be a sale of the home rather than of the whole farm or perhaps where the spouse who originally owned the whole farm has died and willed the farm portion to somebody other than the surviving spouse. The definition of a dwelling in section 2 makes it clear that the term includes not only the building itself but also any <Col N="1652" /> garden or other land usually occupied with the dwelling.  The land must be subsidiary and ancillary to the dwelling.  It must be required for its amenity or convenience and it must not be used or developed primarily for commercial purposes.</P>
    <P>The definition cannot be so precise, of course, that it could delineate exactly the boundaries of each matrimonial home portion of a farm.  Those positions would vary from farm to farm, from property to property.  However, it does give a sufficient guideline to enable the parties concerned to agree on the boundaries, at any rate in the overwhelming majority of cases.  If agreement cannot be secured the matter will have to be resolved by the courts.  This would arise only in a small number of cases.  It is provided for in section 17 which states that if the valuation of the matrimonial home portion does not exceed £20 the matter can be dealt with in the District Court, where the procedures are quick, cheap and without problems.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell raised the question about whether a spouse would be entitled to a half share of the family home on its establishment.  He said he would prefer a system under which each spouse would only become entitled only to a half share of the increase in value of the house over the period of the marriage.  I can confirm that the joint ownership provisions will apply as soon as the couple reside in the matrimonial home.  This is what public opinion requires and it is the only way to give recognition to the concept of marriage as a genuine partnership.  The norm over the past number of years has been for couples to purchase their homes in joint names.</P>
    <P>Senators Neville and Farrell referred to joint ownership of household chattels and wondered how there could be joint ownership of, for example, a dresser or a sofa.  They thought it was too detailed a matter for this legislation to be concerned with.  Joint ownership of chattels will cause no problem as long as there is no dispute about them.  It is unlikely there will be a dispute while the parties are living in harmony.  If there is a separation, <Col N="1653" /> some agreement will have to be reached as to the disposal or division of the chattels. Usually, the chattels, or most of them, would remain in the home with the person who continues in occupation of it. However, if there is a dispute the court will decide on how they are to be divided under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>If this is a problem, it will arise irrespective of the passing of the Bill.  In regard to marital breakdown, if the matter goes to court on a judicial separation application, the court, as we know, has the power to make property distribution orders and orders distributing or dividing chattels from matrimonial homes or any other property.  This is an area the courts have been dealing with since the 1989 Act was passed.</P>
    <P>Senator Crowley urged that provision be made for proper law reporting processes of cases heard <i>in camera</i> under this Bill.  The same comment would apply to other family law measures where cases are correctly held <i>in camera.</i>  He made the point that this would help minimise divergencies between different judges in disputes between spouses.  The important point raised by the Senator will be brought to the notice of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, who has responsibility for courts administration.</P>
    <P>Most decisions in these cases vary from family to family and case to case.  The majority are factual, rather than legal decisions.  Much depends on the particular circumstances of each family, including the family history, the number of children, the amount of property, the prospects and the earning capacity of the husband and wife etc.  It is difficult to find two cases which are the same.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn covered a wide range of issues in her contribution.  She asked about the consequences for an engaged woman who agreed to opt out of joint ownership of the intended matrimonial home and if that would be permanent. Yes, any opt out will have a permanent effect.  At a later date it will be open to the owning spouse to convey a half share or other share of the home to her.  Her statutory right under this Bill <Col N="1654" /> will no longer exist if she opts out.  Section 7 provides that the engaged person must get independent legal advice before opting out.  This should offer some protection in these situations.  The purported opt out is void if legal advice is not obtained.</P>
    <P>Senators Taylor-Quinn and Kelly also stressed the need to train judges who are hearing family law cases and the fact that there might be a lack of uniformity in approach to marital breakdown cases by the judges who hear them.  I will bring these points to the attention of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright referred to a situation where a wife owns the home but fears that her husband would, by his reckless behaviour, lose the home either during his lifetime or after his wife's death.  He suggested that provision should be made for a tenancy in common, rather than a joint tenancy as we provide for in the Bill. I sympathise with the case the Senator mentioned.</P>
    <P>Careful consideration was given by the Government to the merits of tenancies in common and joint tenancy before the Bill was introduced.  The decision to give equal ownership to spouses by way of joint tenancies was based mainly on the fact that that is the format which entitles the benefiting spouse to the full ownership of the matrimonial home on the death of the spouse who originally owned the home.  I accept there are arguments, such as those mentioned by Senator Enright, which would make a tenancy in common system more attractive in certain circumstances.  As a general rule &mdash; the Bill must provide for generalities &mdash; the system of joint tenancy gives better results and is more acceptable.</P>
    <P>In the case mentioned by Senator Enright the husband would get an equitable half share of the home under the Bill.  If, by his reckless behaviour, he places the family home in danger, there are two possible courses open to the wife. She could proceed under section 5 of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, which gives a remedy in such a situation, or she could invoke section 6 of this Bill and look for an order from the District <Col N="1655" /> Court, if the valuation of the house is £20 or less, disapplying section 4 and revesting the husband's half share in the wife.  If this is just and appropriate, the court has been given powers to do so in section 6.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave asked about the effect of bankruptcy on one or other of the partners in the joint tenancy.  If the spouse who benefits under the Bill is already bankrupt when the Bill comes into operation, joint ownership will not come into effect.  That position is specifically excluded by one of the sections.  If the benefiting spouse becomes bankrupt after the Bill is enacted and the spouse has become entitled to a half share of the home, that half share would be subject to the bankruptcy and will vest in the official assignee.  A similar position would apply in any family home or property which is jointly owned or owned in common if one of the joint owners or owners in common became bankrupt. The normal bankruptcy provisions would apply.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave asked that the forms relating to the vesting of the legal interest in the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds, which I am to prescribe by regulation, be kept as simple as possible and that they be made available as soon as the Bill is passed.  It is my intention to keep those forms as simple as possible and I hope they will be available as soon as the Bill is passed or shortly thereafter. He asked that the costs be kept to a minimum.  That would also be my intention. I can confirm that there will be no stamp duty or registration fees in connection with those transactions.  That is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock asked for an interpretation of the expression, &ldquo;immediately before&rdquo;, in the definition of a matrimonial home.  Senator Sherlock must have been looking at the original definition in the Bill as introduced in the Dáil.  It was changed subsequently in the Dáil.  The present definition makes it clear that a matrimonial home is a dwelling in which a married couple ordinarily <Col N="1656" /> resided or reside on or at any time after 25 June 1993, that being the date on which the Bill was introduced.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock also raised the question of a spouse who had deserted three years before and whether that person would have a right to acquire a half share in the former matrimonial home.  The simple answer to that question is no.  The joint ownership conferred by the Bill is only available where the spouses have ordinarily resided together on or after 25 June 1993.  A spouse who deserted prior to that date and who would otherwise benefit from the joint ownership provisions is excluded from the provisions of the Bill by virtue of the desertion.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan asked how it would be possible to segregate the dwelling portion from the business portion of a mixed business-dwelling premises.  Section 17 makes provision for the court to settle any disputes on this point.  This would be the District Court where the rateable valuation is less than £20.  If it is not possible for the spouses to agree where the boundaries would be, the court will decide the extent of the matrimonial home portion, its parameters and the rights of way and any other easements attaching to either the dwelling or the business portion.</P>
    <P>A common situation might be if a matrimonial home consisted of a flat over a shop.  There could be common access to the shop on the ground floor and the upstairs premises.  Logically, one applies the same provision as would apply if the portions were separately owned to start with as they often are with a common right of way over the common parts.  I would envisage that in the majority of cases the parties would agree but if they do not, the court, in a simple, quick, easy procedure in the District Court in most cases, can fix those parameters.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan suggested that this was a middle class Bill directed at middle class situations.  I would dispute that. Many couples on relatively low incomes have saved to raise the deposit on a home.  In most cases such property would already be in the names of those spouses <Col N="1657" /> but if it was not, the Bill would confer a benefit on the non-owning spouse.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that tenancies of matrimonial homes and not just ownership are included.  I am sure Senators who are members of local authorities will have encountered, as I have many times in constituency work, cases where the tenancy of a local authority house is in the name of one spouse.  The tenancy ends up in the name of the spouse, usually the husband, who happened to go down to the local authority and sign for the house.</P>
    <P>I saw no reason why that situation should not be covered by the Bill.  Tenancy of a local authority dwelling is as much a matrimonial home as the occupation or ownership interest of a house in Foxrock or any middle or upper class area.  When a local authority tenant buys the house from the local authority, as many do, the name on the original tenancy agreement is the name used. Therefore, it is important that the Bill apply to such tenancies as well as to ownership.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan asked if the Bill would cause any problems for mortgage companies and Senator Ross mentioned the question of negative equity.  If after the Bill is passed there is a mortgage, the mortgage remains a mortgage on the entire property.  If the benefiting spouse wishes to benefit from the grant of the half share interest under the Bill, obviously they take that subject to the mortgage.  The position of the mortgage company is not affected.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross made a valid and fair point about the negative equity position. The benefiting spouse must decide whether they want this &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; or not. If they decide that the so-called benefit is, in fact, a disadvantage rather than an advantage, that is, if the mortgage is greater than the value of the house, presumably they would then avail of the simple opt out procedures provided in the Bill.  They could decide that taking on the burden of a house with a mortgage debt which is higher than the value of the <Col N="1658" /> property would not amount to taking any benefit and avail of the opt out procedures.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross said that I did not refer to this Bill in the context of the divorce referendum.  That was quite deliberate. The Bill is designed to confer ownership rights where hitherto no such rights existed.  It is intended to do something tangible about the ownership patterns which should exist within marriage.</P>
    <P>Whether rights should apply in a non marital situation is a bigger question. People who live together and are involved with property can and should make their own arrangements as to purchase procedures.  Different considerations apply in a non marital situation.  The general law will continue to apply in those cases.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most of the points Senators raised.  I will be happy to discuss the detail of the Bill with Senators on Committee Stage and to answer any further queries they may have.  Any amendments put forward will have my careful consideration.  Many amendments from all sides of the House were accepted during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil and any useful additions or improvements that may be put forward from any side of this House will be carefully considered. I thank the Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Senators who participated in the Committee Stage debate of the Bill.  This is important legislation as it brings together all social welfare legislation passed since the first consolidation Bill in 1981 which I had the privilege of introducing in the Dáil and Seanad.  At that time I proposed that there should be a further consolidation Bill within at least ten years.  We are somewhat later than that.</P>
      <P>The Acts passed since 1981 are brought together with the previous Acts.  Therefore, approximately 83 years of social welfare legislation is embodied in this Bill in simplified form so that it is more easily understood.  Social welfare legislation is complicated as the interests and entitlements of so many people in many different circumstances must be covered.  The best we can do to simplify the legislation is to combine it in this consolidation Bill and break it down into the different sectors. It covers the two sides of social welfare: the social insurance fund and the assistance schemes.  It is almost an encyclopaedia of social welfare legislation.</P>
      <P>It is particularly important that the Bill be passed now because further social welfare legislation will be passed in the future which could upset the content of this Bill.  When this Bill is passed any future Acts will stand alone until there is a further consolidation Bill, perhaps in another ten years.  The officials and civil servants involved put a great deal of time into the preparation of this Bill.  It is painstaking work that is not often properly recognised.  It is valuable work to people involved in the social welfare area: Senators, Deputies, social workers and legal practitioners who are involved in all matters relating to a person's social welfare entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is particularly helpful to have the legislation together under simplified headings.  The different chapters have been standardised and simplified and it will be easier than even the last consolidation <Col N="1660" /> Bill to use.  Recognising the complexity of this Bill we are issuing a guide that will be helpful to anyone who wishes to use the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill.  It will describe the provisions in a simple and straightforward way and will be available in a matter of weeks.  A great deal of work has gone into that and I thank the officials who were involved.  I also thank the chairman, Senator Roche, and the Members of the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills who went through this Bill in detail.  It was painstaking work and I am grateful to all those who participated.</P>
    <P>All the insurability provisions relating to employees, the self employed, the voluntary contributors and the PRSI fund are brought together and simplified. There is a common set of administrative and other provisions which now apply to all the social insurance and assistance schemes.  I hope that will be helpful to everybody involved.  It is important legislation which makes the law more accessible and easier to understand.  It will be of great benefit to Members and those involved in social welfare.</P>
    <P>I thank all concerned for the speedy way with which they dealt with this Bill. Without their help it would be overtaken by other legislation in which case we would have to reconsider it.  That would take more time and we might not be able to tidy up everything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>It was my privilege to be chairman of the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bill.  It was a pleasant task because the Minister, and his officials have, as the Minister said, codified 83 years of law into one Bill.  It is legislation which is written as close as possible in non legal phraseology.  It is in laypersons language and is good legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social welfare which by its nature is complex, as every public representative knows, has been put into a framework which is accessible to public representatives, <Col N="1661" /> to professionals and to the general public.  In the past 50 years the State has changed role from that of a night watchman to one where it now intervenes in the lives and livelihoods of every member of the community.  It is important that the law as enacted by the State is fully comprehended and comprehensible. The Minister, Dr. Woods has made this a life's ambition and a lifetime's passion.  As he said, he was involved in the introduction of the 1981 Act, the original consolidation legislation.</P>
    <P>As a lecturer in public administration who for about 20 years has argued for making Government accessible to the people, I consider this to be model legislation. I am pleased the Minister said that a guide in common language and accessible to everybody in the community will be published.  Under Dr. Woods's Ministry, the Department of Social Welfare has made remarkable advances in the past few years.  We all know that it was a deep, dark and impenetrable part of public administration and it is now a shining example to everybody.  Appropriately, it has adopted a logo with an open door and that is the attitude that now exists in that Department.  Not an attitude of withholding, but an attitude of welcoming, of involving people and making them aware of their entitlements. This legislation is most welcome because in addition to codifying and simplifying law it will make people more aware of those rights which both Houses of the Oireachtas have given them.</P>
    <P>It has always struck me as fundamentally wrong and perverse that after we as public representatives enact legislation, people then need to go to political intermediaries or intermediaries of one form or another to find out their entitlements. I realise that I am trying the patience of the Acting Chairman but it is important to mark this work which has been so well done in the Department that there will not be overlong speeches here and it would be inappropriate that there <Col N="1662" /> should be.  It is appropriate to mark what has been completed.  I compliment the Minister as I have done on many occasions before because he brings energy, enthusiasm and enlightenment to his portfolio.  I compliment his staff for being extraordinarily helpful to the joint committee and, more important, fulfilling to the <i>n</i>th degree the role of the public servant, making public administration available to the people.  This is good legislation which has the support of all sides in the House and I hope that the model in it will be looked at by other areas of public administration.  I look forward to other Ministers consolidating legislation in their Departments and making the law accessible to those it is meant to serve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also congratulate the Minister, his staff and the committee under Senator Roche on this Bill.  There have been great improvements in the Department over the past few years and the Minister, Dr. Woods, more than anybody else, deserves credit for that.  I remember being involved in many arguments here about the amounts and forms of benefit that were due to people.  There were 32 different benefits paid in respect of children in the past the and number has been reduced.  I have always seen the logic in everybody getting the same amount.</P>
      <P>Consolidating all the social welfare Acts, particularly when more than £11 million per day is being spent on social welfare benefits, is a big responsibility for the Minister and his officials.  In the three budgets 1987 to 1989 I was baffled how the Minister for Social Welfare was able to get money when no other Minister could.  At that time the Minister for Finance would not give any extra money to any other Minister.  However, the position is far from satisfactory and the Minister is aware of that.  There are, unfortunately, anomalies in the system which cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1663" /> We still receive many complaints from people who are not well off.  We have not solved the problem.  There are people receiving benefits who should not be on welfare while others, unfortunately, need more assistance and cannot get it.</P>
    <P>I do not see the logic in the difference between an invalidity pension of £60.80 and a disability and injury benefit of £55.60.  We must always ensure that everybody is treated equally and receives the same amount.  That can be done. The number of children's benefits was reduced from 32 to 16 and it may be less now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is six.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is good.  We are improving every year.  However, can anybody explain how a person on disability and injury benefit can receive £55.60 and the adult dependant will get £35.50 making a total of £91.10 but a person on long term unemployment assistance receives £59.20 and £35.50 for an adult dependant £35.50 making a total of £94.70?  Why should a person on invalidity benefit get less than somebody who is on long term unemployment benefit?  I do not see the logic in that particularly for the person who is not an invalid, the adult dependant.  I am not saying that they should not get the benefit but there should be equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must continue to question such anomalies.  We are far from right yet.  If the general public knew that £11 million pounds a day &mdash; about £4 billion pounds per year &mdash; is spent on social welfare and there were still people without assistance and benefits they would ask questions.  If we asked ten people from urban areas and five people from rural areas to distribute the money would they do a better job?  Perhaps they would because they would see to it that the right people got it.  We must always question whether there are people who are without the basics.  That is happening at a time when <Col N="1664" /> we spend £11 million pounds per day on social welfare.  Sadly there are situations where people are without the basics, despite our spending £11 million a day on social welfare.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on what he is doing but there is one final issue I must put to him.  This is a matter I raised on the Adjournment but it is relevant to the consolidation of all the Acts, including the equality legislation under which were made all those claims by women who believe they were discriminated against in terms of payments <i>vis-a-vis</i> male claimants and who are waiting for the matter to be redressed.  This is a serious problem and one that will have to be resolved. Unfortunately the vast majority of those making money out of the impasse are those on the legal side, the lawyers who are processing the case on behalf of the claimants.  The whole episode is a sad reflection on us.  We should be addressing the issue so that those concerned can be paid the moneys they are claiming.  We are in breach of EC regulations by not having this matter finalised.  If it is a question that the payments cannot be made within a year, that should be said and the burden spread over two or three years. It is not right that solicitors representing claimants are receiving 10 per cent, 20 per cent or 30 per cent of the total amount paid by the Department of Social Welfare into the claimants' accounts.  If it is the case that claims cannot be met in full even within a three year period, it may be necessary to extend to four years the final date by which the matter is to be finalised but it is imperative that, in any event, we make the applicants aware of what is happening.  Otherwise, they will incur unnecessary expense in consulting their solicitors.</P>
    <P>The booklet issued by the Department of Social Welfare setting out entitlements is excellent.  There is no need for any Member of the Oireachtas to be apprehensive about ensuring that every constituent receives a copy.  While containing much detailed information, the booklet <Col N="1665" /> succeeds in simplifying the social welfare code.  It illustrates though that there is not a fair disbursement of payments.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister and I congratulate him, his staff, the committee and the chairman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and his Department as well as the committee and the chairman on the legislation before the House today, legislation that is badly needed since, unfortunately, many thousands of people depend on the social welfare system.  Such people will benefit greatly from the passing of this legislation.  It will be of much benefit, too, to social welfare officers and to the professionals who need to determine the legislation required in any given set of circumstances.  The Bill consolidates, as the Minister has said, 81 to 83 years of legislation in this Department and gives us the opportunity of trying to improve on what is proposed.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Cregan that this is not the final day for improvements to be made to the social welfare system, that rather the Bill is a yardstick of what improvements might be made.  It also enables Senators and other public representatives to check without difficulty on any particular item in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The Minister is also to be congratulated on the guide he has promised in this House today.  It will be a bonus to what has gone before and will certainly be to the betterment of the unfortunate people who have to claim social welfare assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree again with Senator Cregan that the issue of equality of payments for men and women will not go away.  There are many more claims arising and certainly in any given week at the clinics we hold there is always a woman asking how the matter is going to be dealt with and for details of their claim entitlements.  I ask the Minister to make a statement in this regard because the problem is causing grave concern to many people involved <Col N="1666" /> in social welfare including Senators and Deputies who go from clinic to clinic and try and explain the reasons why payments are not being made and the Department of Social Welfare is not acting upon what would be viewed as a legitimate claim.</P>
    <P>Again, I congratulate the Minister and his Department and the committee upon an improvement in the social welfare system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and his staff and also Senator Roche and the committee on this consolidation Bill. The total change in the attitude among all those in the Department of Social Welfare over the nearly 25 years that I have been dealing with the Department cannot but be welcomed.  Far from people now feeling that their benefits are grudgingly given to them, in general most people feel that they get a good reception from officials and that they are dealt with equitably.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Cregan's remarks on equity as being important, and where only small amounts of money are involved between benefits, I hope the Minister and his staff will keep examining this area because it often creates feelings of injustice for the sake of a few pounds. In the argument over which benefit a person should be receiving, time is wasted, the expense of which could have been used to pay out the benefit to the person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare has improved so much that I continue to be disappointed that it has not taken over the disabled person's maintenance allowance. The Minister will be aware that this is the only benefit that is issued from the Department of Health through the health boards.  Even in the ninth annual report of the Ombudsman, which this House discussed on 17 June, 1993, this is one issue in the area covering all of the benefits where there were many complaints. There are two conferences on disability which will be convening in the next ten days and which I will be attending where <Col N="1667" /> I have promised the people involved in those conferences that I would bring up this issue again.  It is a compliment to the Minister's Department in that people who are on the disabled person's maintenance allowance believe that they will be more equitably dealt with through the Minister's Department.  Therefore, I hope that this allowance will be well in before we have to have the next consolidation Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from this issue, I believe that excellent efforts have been made on this legislation. especially the emphasis by Senator Roche on clarity of language. There appeared to be so many ways of describing a child in the past that a &ldquo;person under 16&rdquo; or some such description is to be welcomed.  All of this is a good step forward and the Department is to be congratulated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on presenting this Bill and I also congratulate Senator Roche and the committee, together with the officials in the Department, for the enormous amount of work done.  I welcome the fact that all the legislation relating to social welfare has now been consolidated and I believe that this will make life easier for recipients of social welfare as well as those who administer the system and for members of the public or Senators who frequently need to refer to the Social Welfare Acts.  I urge the Minister to continue the reforms that he has started.  It is true, as Senator Roche has remarked, that we are fortunate that we have a committed, enthusiastic and enlightened Minister for Social Welfare.  At one point I believed that in order to understand the social welfare system one required a doctorate in social welfare.  I am aware that the Minister has not got his doctorate in that subject but sometimes one feels that he has, as he appears to know the system so well, which I believe is of great consolation to us in this House.  I congratulate the Minister on many of the <Col N="1668" /> reforms he has introduced.  One that comes to mind is allowing single parents to participate in third level education without losing benefits, which is particularly useful to young single mothers. Another reform worthy of compliment is the deductions from social welfare which have been introduced in on a pilot basis. This is useful because women whose husbands are unemployed and are living on social welfare run into problems with debts to the ESB and in rent.  The system the Minister has introduced enables them to manage their small resources.  They must find it difficult but this scheme removes some of the stress from them.</P>
      <P>While the Minister was criticised by many during the summer for introducing the work scheme for students I welcome the idea.  Perhaps some of the criticism was because the scheme seemed to have been introduced rather quickly.  However by next year more thought will have been put into it.  We have to accept that the numbers unemployed here will not be significantly reduced by current policies. When we debated the national plan last week it was said that although we were going to create 200,000 jobs over the next number of years, the number of unemployed would remain the same.  We cannot afford to lose the efforts of 300,000 people on a permanent basis. Some have described this as being a policy of human set aside and we cannot afford that.</P>
      <P>Our response to long-term unemployment needs radical change.  We must offer economic participation.  Up to now we have only offered economic exclusion to many of these people.  Many on the dole want to participate.  Our party published proposals for a national community employment scheme in the last general election campaign.  The recent contribution of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors to this problem is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look closely at this and start building a country where the community offers participation to <Col N="1669" /> those who have had no chance of work. There is despair among these people and we must offer them dignity, hope and a bridge to economic participation.  We must confront this issue urgently and time is not on our side.  The Minister is well aware of these problems and to date he has acted to reform all aspects of social welfare but this one must be examined.</P>
    <P>Only one third of our population is working and the dependency ratio is increasing.  Although the number of births may be declining there has been a huge increase in the number of single parents and, with people living longer, there will be a huge increase in the number of pensioners.  As Senator Cregan said, we pay out a large amount of money every week and we need to spend it wisely.  The people dependent on the State for their income must be looked after in as efficient a manner as possible.  They should be allowed to participate in society.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the allocations to women's groups and I urge the Minister, as Senator Cregan asked, to look after women who have not been given their entitlements under the equality legislation. I also welcome the allocation by the Department to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  As Senator Cregan said, when money is given to local groups they spend it wisely.  The Minister's measures in this regard are enlightening and I compliment him on them and congratulate him on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Senators for their comments on the Bill and the work of the joint committee.  I will deal briefly with some points raised.  Senator Cregan spoke about the amount of money involved.  This Bill concerns the expenditure of £3.7 billion, not spread over a number of years but in one year. Therefore, it is important.  In case Senators are worried, that figure includes pensions to which people have contributed over their lifetimes.  It includes also all payments under the social <Col N="1670" /> insurance and social assistance schemes. The Senator was right in saying it is a substantial amount of money.</P>
      <P>He was also concerned about the difference between long and short term payments. The historical reason for that difference is that those on long-term payments would have their resources depleted and would virtually be receiving a pension.  There are standards we hope to achieve by the next budget.  For instance, we wish to bring everyone up to at least the priority rates suggested by the Commission on Social Welfare.  I expect we will be able to do that.  Reaching the long-term rates is a further objective and some payments have reached that level.</P>
      <P>Senator Cregan also raised the question of equal treatment payments.  This is complex because the court cases go back to 1985.  Those cases were taken to establish the equal treatment provisions and tease out what they would mean in practice.  That process has continued to date.  I assure Senators the legislation passed by the Houses and the regulations arising from that are being implemented in full.</P>
      <P>People will get their full entitlements. Some were paid last year, the bulk paid this year and more will be paid next year. The majority of people know this is how it is being paid and if they do not they can be reassured.  We are trying to pay as many as possible this year and we appreciate the urgency of this.  However, the total cost was so large it was necessary for the Government to spread it over a number of years.</P>
      <P>Other people are making claims separately and we cannot do anything about that.  We can only make clear that my Department's interpretation is that we have met the requirements in the clarifications. That concludes the matter as far as we are concerned.  We will be opposing any further claims that will be made. Some 85,000 people have submitted claims which are all being processed rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1671" /> Senator Wall said we are setting standards for ourselves which, in effect, we are.  We are outlining the current standards and we can work from that base. In a way it suits a Minister to have a confused situation.  Social welfare is very confusing.  We are setting out our baseline and that will be helpful.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry spoke about the disabled person's maintenance allowance. That is one of my priorities and we are working on it urgently.  The Senator will not have to wait until the next consolidation Bill for news on that issue.  I hope we will have that dealt with quickly. There are interdepartmental and industrial relations considerations, among others, but we are tackling the issue as a matter of urgency.  We are also concerned about the supplementary welfare allowance scheme but we are giving priority to the disabled person's maintenance allowance while simultaneously working on the other scheme.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan mentioned the new developments.  The power to make deductions is in the Bill.  The second chance education for single parents is going well and there has been a good response.  We expect to accommodate a substantial number this year.  For budgetary reasons the Government must put some limits on my activity in that area but we will be able to accommodate everyone this year.  Nevertheless, we will be able to accommodate everyone who comes along this year, at least numerically. There can be some regional difficulties because people may want a scheme in an area in which one cannot be provided, but that is a separate question.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan also mentioned the students' summer scheme.  We talked about the fact that it had to be brought in quite hurriedly this year because unemployment assistance, the dole, for the summer was gone.  I could not wait until next year to take action so I had to act immediately or there would have been nothing available this year.  It has <Col N="1672" /> been very successful.  There were 9,000 jobs put forward and we have received many letters from parents, students and sponsors who were delighted with the scheme and who found it very worthwhile and helpful.</P>
    <P>As Senators may know, I mentioned earlier that I had received Government approval for a new school leavers' job scheme.  Many school leavers go on to third level education or to jobs or to training with FÁS but there are up to 6,000 who go straight from school on to the dole.  I do not want that situation and I want to try to break that cycle.  I know all Senators want to see it ended if it can be done, so I got the approval of the Government to go ahead with the scheme.  It will operate somewhat on the lines of the summer jobs scheme because many of the sponsors had jobs going on into the winter in the voluntary and community areas.</P>
    <P>The other aspect is that we had discussions with FÁS regarding its relationship with us in that scheme, because the money will come entirely from the Department of Social Welfare.  In effect it is the money that would have been given out in social welfare.  We have reached the stage with FÁS that there will be a FÁS training component added to that scheme which is excellent.  I am delighted that FÁS has come forward with that component.  The scheme will be starting very shortly and again it arises particularly from the experience of the summer jobs scheme.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan also mentioned the money to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  It reminds me of something that was very much in the media during the week &mdash; the book launches in Tallaght on the developments there and the fact that people are developing local community enterprises.  I wish to make it very clear that that started between the Minister for Social Welfare, who happened to be me at the time, and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  From savings we made I got the Government <Col N="1673" /> to make £500,000 available, which was given to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  It was involved and had groups in different places all over the country.  In fact Tallaght was one of its most successful.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said that the State did nothing and that everybody stands away, but that is nonsense.  We put money into ideas at the very start and got it off the ground.  However, that is one of those things to which one gets used.  Senators know when we discuss these things that we have tried to be innovative, particularly in the development of community resources.  We started the community development projects, of which there are now 41 around the country, developing community enterprise and other facilities. They are grant aided by the Department of Social Welfare and they led to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> special areas which are leading now to the back to work schemes and the other schemes.</P>
    <P>All of that is part of the total effort which comes from the type of discussions we have with Senator Cregan.  He said we almost had rows here, but we must be seeing them in a different way.  I regard them as constructive, healthy, vibrant, informative and useful debates.  While I might not be able to say much at the time, I note what is said and we try to fit those things in later when an opportunity arises.</P>
    <P>Finally, the consolidation of the regulations is coming up shortly.  As Senators know, the legislation is here and all the regulations that flow from the legislation are separate.  If the legislation is complex the regulations can be even more complex when one goes to examine them.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1674" /> I did not want to conclude without making some reference to the points made by the Senators, which are very relevant to the current position.  I thank the Senators, the members and the Chairman of the standing committee for their work and assistance in getting this Bill through.  It will be signed next week and brought into law.  It will be a great relief for us because we can go on then with new Bills.  If we brought in a new Bill now it would upset everything at this stage.  That is why it is so important to have it concluded and fixed so that we can have a base from which to work forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House for the second time this week. I hope that we will be able to make real progress today on an issue that I suggest is both important and, if the Minister will forgive the pun, timely.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to consider moving Ireland to central European time with effect from this time next year &mdash; that is, putting our clocks forward one hour compared to the way we have them now.  We should still retain the difference between summer and winter time, the difference being that we would have shifted forward one hour in both cases. The effect of this would be that the time here in Ireland would be the same as that in our major European markets such as France, Germany and Italy.  This would move us into line with eight of the 11 member states in the European Community and in line with several other European countries also.</P>
      <P>Allow me to outline some of the reasons why this is important.  First, the fact that we are one hour behind mainland Europe makes it much more difficult for us to sell to Europe because it reduces the period of the day when we and they are doing business at the same time.  It makes contact that much more difficult. When they get to their offices in the morning, we are still on our way to work. When we try to contact them in the late morning, they have already left for lunch. When they call us back on their return from lunch, we are in turn gone to lunch. By the time we get back from lunch it is already mid-afternoon in Europe and if we try to contact people around 4 p.m. our time they have already knocked off for the rest of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of this simple one hour time difference, contacting people on mainland Europe and doing business with them can be a long succession of chasing around the mulberry bush.  I am sure the Minister has plenty of experience of this particular frustration in dealing with Brussels.  It is not the only problem which arises because of our time difference.  It <Col N="1676" /> also makes it much more difficult for business people to travel to mainland Europe and get back in the one day.  That increases all of our costs.  If we leave Dublin Airport at 8 a.m., it is already 9 a.m. in mainland Europe and by the time we get to Paris, for instance &mdash; certainly before getting into the centre of the city &mdash; it is almost mid-day.  Because the French enjoy their food, they tend to have longer lunch breaks and as a result, we often do not even meet them in time. That lost hour makes the crucial difference between having some of the morning available for business and losing the whole morning.  If we look only at the business dimension &mdash; the viewpoint of those doing business with our European partners by phone or in person &mdash; this difference in time is a definite and real handicap.  The worst aspect is that it is totally unnecessary.  It is a handicap we can remove it at the stroke of a pen and the pen is the Minister's.</P>
    <P>However, I would not like anyone to think that I want to change the clock solely because of business, important though it is with regard to our exports and our ability to sell.  Changing the time would bring us other benefits.  They include longer evenings throughout the year.  This struck me on Sunday when I realised that it was already getting dark at 5 p.m.  That would improve the quality of all of our lives and have a real economic benefit because it would make the country more attractive as a tourist destination. Our long summer evenings are already an attraction.  We would extend that attraction to a much wider period. Indeed in mid-summer, we would turn Ireland, like Norway, into a land of the midnight sun.  That would especially help the west and I am friendly to that region. On the last occasion the Minister of State was in the House, we made some interesting comments on helping tourism in the west and here is an opportunity to do more for the region because there is an urgent need to boost our tourist attraction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1677" /> Longer evenings throughout the year would also produce savings on energy costs, both at national and domestic level.  That is a real benefit to the household budget.  Even more important, longer evenings would reduce the number of road accidents, would save lives and would avoid some of the personal tragedies resulting from traffic accidents. These benefits are not just pie in the sky.  On the contrary, they were all clearly demonstrated during the late 1960s when we did exactly what I am proposing.  However, we made that experiment only because Britain decided to do so.  When Britain made the mistake of misinterpreting the figures and misunderstanding the results of the experiment and went back to the old time, we followed them.  We meekly fell in step with Britain but out of step with the EC, which we were to join a few years later.</P>
    <P>This issue is timely.  In Britain, they are beginning to see that they made a mistake in reverting to Greenwich Mean Time.  That great British bureaucracy is beginning to lumber slowly into action and it now seems likely that they will join Central European Time within the next five years.  We are faced with the question: do we wait once again for nanny to move and then meekly follow or do we for once take the initiative and decide to make the move ourselves?  It is inevitable that we will move to Central European Time at some stage, so I suggest we should do it now and show clearly, both to ourselves and those outside, that we have decided for ourselves and not because our neighbours have done so.  We should be the first.  We should consider leaving the nursery without nanny.  This may produce a quaint solution for a while until Britain falls into line, but what of that?  There is a short term advantage for us in being an hour ahead of Britain.  We could get on a plane at 8 a.m. in Dublin and arrive in London at 7.50 a.m. and that would be an advantage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1678" /> Moving to Central European Time would create more jobs by making it easier for us to do business in Europe, by making our tourist product even more attractive, would save on energy costs and it should save lives on the road.  We should make this change quickly, and, for once, we should show that we are capable of deciding these matters for ourselves rather than meekly following the coat-tails of our neighbour across the Irish Sea.  I am asking the Minister to consider the matter, I do not expect him to announce a decision today, and I ask him to bring some urgency to that consideration because if we are to make this happen in one year's time, decisions will have to be taken quickly.  We should move immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Senator that in view of the excellent case he has made I will certainly give his suggestion some consideration.  I presume what he has in mind is that Ireland should move from Greenwich Mean Time to Central European Time, thus bringing us into line with our continental European partners.  Certainly there is much to be said for that.  Undoubtedly, such a move would bring many benefits, particularly in the areas of commerce and transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, such a change may not be universally well received.  It would mean that we would have to adopt a system of double summertime between the end of March and October with what I will loosely refer to as single summertime during the winter months.  This latter approach was taken on an experimental basis both here and in Britain for a number of years in the late 1960s but it was abandoned because of widespread public criticism.  I know that this issue is being seriously looked at in the United Kingdom.  A White Paper has been published and there has been wide consultation on the matter.  However, I understand that no final decision has <Col N="1679" /> been made there as to whether a change will take place.</P>
    <P>The Senator will appreciate that, given our geographical location and our trading links with Britain and most important of all, our land border with Northern Ireland, it would create huge difficulties for us if we were to decide unilaterally to move to Central European Time while Britain remained with Greenwich Mean Time.  There would be an all year round difference of one hour between us and Northern Ireland and, of course, the whole of Britain.  This factor could outweigh advantages derived from our adoption of Central European Time.</P>
    <P>As the Senator will know, the commencement and end date for summertime in the EC is governed by Directive.  The present directive &mdash; the Sixth Directive &mdash; provides that the ending of summertime for the continental states is September, whereas for Ireland and the United Kingdom, it is October. I understand that the Seventh EC Directive, which is now being finalised, will provide the end of October as the synchronised date for ending summertime throughout the EC, with effect from 1997.  If the proposals in the Seventh Directive are adopted, it will eliminate the confusion which occurs at present as a result of the continental states ending summertime one month earlier than Ireland and the UK, a matter about which the Senator has previously expressed concern.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice is monitoring developments in the United Kingdom with regard to common interests which we have in this regard and close contact is being maintained with the Home Office on this matter.  Should it be that consideration is to be given to a change in the existing basic time arrangements which have been in place since 1971, the Department of Justice, having direct responsibility for the matter, would initiate a wide ranging consultation process with all the various <Col N="1680" /> interested parties prior to any decision being taken by the Government.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Gallagher.</P>
      <P>I wish to welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Aylward, to the House and I hope he will bring us some good news with regard to the problem I wish to raise.  I am trying to force the Minister for Education, and the Government, to provide funds for the provision of a new school for the parish of Killany, which is presently serviced by Ballymackney NS.  The people of Killany are anxious that the funds be provided, not some time in the future, but in 1994. My call will be supported by Senator Gallagher, who also has an interest in developments in regard to that school.</P>
      <P>Ballymackney NS was built in 1847 &mdash; we would all be aware that that was one of the famine years.  It has withstood 150 years of great change but has not changed significantly itself, apart from the addition of a prefabricated building in the school yard.  That prefab was in good condition 25 years ago but today it is a dilapidated and horrible looking.  The entire school is unsuitable for the purpose for which it is intended.  It is the oldest school in country.  No doubt it was a fine building in 1847 and served its purpose. In 1930 it was probably a fine building, but today it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school is a fire hazard and it is a danger to the pupils who enter it each morning.  If a fire broke out during school hours, pupils might become trapped in the building.  Although a fire broke one and a half years ago, it happened one afternoon when the school was closed. The fire was brought under control and it did not destroy the building.  Indeed, the people of Killany, Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, are disappointed that it did not.  If the fire had destroyed the <Col N="1681" /> building they would have had a better chance of getting a new school.</P>
    <P>At this stage the children's parents are up in arms.  Senator Gallagher and I are aware of that fact.  A public meeting was held in the area a number of weeks ago, which I unfortunately could not attend. However, I got a report of what happened and the parents are angry.  They believe they are not getting a fair crack of the whip.  They are classified as second class citizens and they deserve better.  I want the Minister to make a commitment in regard to the provision of a new school in the parish of Killany to replace the existing school at Ballymackney and that next year's Estimate will include provision for that building.  In other words, next years capital programme must include money for the provision of a new school.  The local community has organised funding and everything is ready in this regard.  Given the pressure placed on local representatives and the fact they have a solid case, the local community expect the project to go ahead next year.</P>
    <P>In recent days people have telephoned me about school funding for next year, particularly in light of questions about the £8.7 billion, £7.2 billion, etc.  Having looked through the figures, an independent analyst informed me that we are talking about £5.8 billion.  That capsizes the Government's plan each year until the end of the century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, you must agree that expenditure on the school in Killany is based on the implementation of the National Development Plan.  The sum obtained from the EC will decide whether there is money for any school.  It is clear to those examining the figures that a lot of funds find their way into current expenditure in various Departments.  Although current expenditure has increased over the years with the help of EC funds, if it is cut it will capsize the proposals.  The <Col N="1682" /> capital programme will be cut in order to maintain existing services.  I do not want the Minister to give me the standard reply that the Department are looking at the project with a view to giving a commitment, only to find that we are in the same boat next year and the year after, like the school in Shercock, County Cavan.  I want a commitment from the Minister that money will be forthcoming next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my appreciation to Senator Cotter for allowing me time to speak on this issue.  The fact we have agreed on this matter shows the concern of the people of Carrickmacross that the Killany school must be included in the 1994 Estimates.  The school is located on the main Carrickmacross to Dundalk road and it is surprising someone has not been killed on that road.  The children have no play area and they must cross the road to go to an open play field.  Children's lives are in danger because of the situation in the school.  The school has three classrooms and one prefabricated building.  Junior infants must go outside in winter to go to the toilets.  Children work in cramped conditions and the teacher has no room to walk between desks in the room.</P>
      <P>This is a vibrant area and children are being refused admission to the school because of lack of space.  The school has a good reputation and parents have been patient while looking for a new school, but they are not prepared to wait any longer.  In fact, they are being punished for being so patient.  Justice should be done and the school should be given priority.  The Minister must ensure that Ballymackney is included in the 1994 Estimates.  It is the oldest school in the country.  A site has be acquired on a byroad in the centre of the parish beside the community centre and the chapel. There the pupils would not face the traffic hazards which exist at present.  Local funds have been raised and we await the go-ahead from the Minister.  I hope the Minister will put this matter on top of her list.  Having waited so long, the people of Killany deserve a new school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Cotter and Gallagher for raising this matter and presenting me with an opportunity to clarify the position in relation to this school.  This is a four teacher school which had an enrolment of 120 pupils in 1992.  Existing accommodation consists of three permanent classrooms and one prefabricated classroom. The Department of Education has approved the provision of a new school to replace the existing unsatisfactory building.  The total estimated grant aid for this project will amount to £165,000. The architectural planning of a new school is at an advanced stage and planning permission has been received from the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Senators will appreciate, every school invariably makes the case that its project is deserving of special consideration. The Department would be more than delighted if, in a world where resources were unlimited, every scheme could proceed at the same time.  As the House will be aware, however, because of the large volume of major building projects on hand and the limitation on <Col N="1684" /> resources it is only possible to allow a certain number of projects to proceed to construction in any one financial year. Unfortunately, it was not possible to include this project in the national schools capital programme for 1993.</P>
    <P>The Department is aware that the conditions in the existing school are far from satisfactory and that exiting permanent accommodation dates from the last century. I am also aware the school authorities have been pressing for a new school for a number of years and that a previous building scheme had to be abandoned in 1987 due to the difficult financial situation.  I assure Senators that the Department accepts that this is a project deserving of the highest priority in the context of projects to be allowed to proceed to construction in 1994.  Having heard the case put forward by Senators Cotter and Gallagher and the fact the school is over 100 years old and that people have waited for so long, I will recommend that this school be included in the 1994 Estimates.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 3.10 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 3 November 1993.</P>
