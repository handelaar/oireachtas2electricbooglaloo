      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Kennedy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to request Telecom Éireann to carry out a social impact study on the effect of its rebalancing programme on handicapped, disabled and immobile people, with a view to limiting the hardship of the new scheme of charges on such citizens.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGennis of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to agree to the requests from St. Philip's national school, Mountview, Clonsilla, Dublin 15, for a remedial teacher and a home-school liaison teacher.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Item 1, the National Monuments <Col N="1058" /> (Amendment) Bill, 1993, Second Stage from now until 2 p.m. and Item 2, Second Stage of the European Parliament Elections Bill, 1993.  It is hoped to conclude the Second Stage of Item 1 before the time allowed and if we do we will take a sos until 2 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed.  Since we are not meeting tomorrow, on behalf of my group I wish the Government well in the series of negotiations.  At a time like this we are all conscious of the high stakes involved and the need to show solidarity with the Government in trying to attain an end we all seek, peace on this island.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House if, circumstances permitting, the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste could report to this House next week on the current situation.  It is also important that if the Government is getting support from all parties it should take both Houses into its confidence.  The point was strongly made yesterday by a number of Senators that the desire is to support the Government in any way possible rather than to make party points. Such a process strengthens the Government's hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning. I was impressed by the words of Senator Wilson about the debate on Northern Ireland last week.  This issue is so important that it is necessary to be open and seen to be open.  We have nothing to hide.  I support the request that either the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste speak to this House and ease some of the worries of Unionists in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the same view as other speakers and would be supportive of whatever moves are made by the two Governments tomorrow.  I said yesterday that last week's debate was restrained and balanced and that was underlined by Senator Wilson.  I suggest we return to the matter next week.  Matters are fluid and they change daily or hourly.  It would be useful to have a debate even if the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste were not available, although it would be desirable if <Col N="1059" /> one or other could be here.  We should resume the debate because we have a contribution to make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I again ask the Leader of the House to either make inquiries to the Minister for Justice or provide time to discuss the activities of illegal furniture dealers, who have been, in a widely advertised publicity campaign, holding auctions and sales in different parts of the country.  They have robbed people of thousands of pounds.  Will time be provided to have a full discussion on this issue which is causing widespread anxiety and concern?  They are, allegedly, United Kingdom-based illegal operators who operate a highly sophisticated racket here and it is time something was done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senators Manning, Quinn and Dardis in regard to having a further debate on the North of Ireland.  I hope the Leader will address that matter and perhaps the debate could be resumed here next week.</P>
      <P>Could the Leader also see his way towards having a proper debate, for a duration of approximately two hours, on the farm retirement scheme?  This matter was raised recently on the Adjournment by Senator Naughten, but the Minister is circulating draft proposals.  There are a certain number of difficult points in the documents which will have to be analysed before they come out as this area is fraught with difficulties.  I hope we will get the opportunity to put on record points which may be of assistance in what I envisage will be an important scheme, which will have many beneficial effects, if properly implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Government side, I put on the record our welcome of the support from all sides of the House for the peace process discussions starting tomorrow and which will continue over the next three weeks.  I will relay the request of the House for the Taoiseach and Tánaiste to report back to it and I will keep it informed.  It is an ongoing <Col N="1060" /> process, but we know there are three working meetings.  It may not be appropriate to report back after the first meeting, but it may be appropriate after the second or third.  I also want to put on record my own wishes for success in the discussions between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister.</P>
      <P>In regard to Senator Daly's question on illegal furniture dealers, I will pass on his fears to the Minister for Justice.  If we get an opportunity, we will have a debate on the farm retirement scheme before Christmas.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <P>The Bill before the House today is one of a number of initiatives which I intend to take in the area of identifying, preserving and exhibiting items of our national heritage.  The Bill gives important statutory expression to the rights of the people of Ireland to the physical representation of our culture and heritage, whether it be archaeological objects found, monuments or sites of archaeological interest.  It should be seen against the background of a Department which for the first time has the overall responsibility under one administrative structure for co-ordinating policy in respect of archaeological matters.  Other legislative proposals which I will be bringing before the House in the coming months will include a Bill to give a statutory footing to the Heritage Council and a Bill to establish autonomous boards for the National Museum and the National Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the modern world, with the stunning advances in telecommunications and other technologies, we are in grave <Col N="1061" /> danger of being swamped by values which are not our own, or indeed of the larger European culture, of which we are a part. Many of the messages with which we are bombarded come not from the people of other countries with their own valuable traditions and outlooks, but from conglomerates who wish to sell us a way of life and a system of values based on the acquisition of their goods and services. To retain control of our own culture and national identity, as an ancient island race with close connections with mainland Europe, we must ensure we have the fullest understanding of how our culture has evolved over the millennia.  We must have a confident base from which to develop and enliven our own system of values.</P>
    <P>For most people, it is perhaps the artefact or monument itself that can have the most immediate impact.  The beauty and artistry of many of our famous treasures has captivated the imagination of generations and delighted foreign audiences when these treasures have been displayed abroad.  To have visited an historic site such as Clonmacnoise of Newgrange leaves one with the knowledge &mdash; and responsibility &mdash; of knowing that we are but the latest inheritors of a long, proud and inspiring past.  How many parents have dragged their children out on a wet winter Sunday afternoon to visit a museum, local or national, and were surprised by the interest which even one small, unassuming artefact can spark?</P>
    <P>However, this is not even half the story.  While the artefacts and monuments, in themselves, are important, in more recent years it is the sites in which these have been discovered, particularly when discovered in an undisturbed site, that have been seen to yield or constitute a reservoir of amazing information about our ancestors and, through them, about ourselves.  When archaeologists have been given the opportunity to properly excavate such sites, they have, using the strict disciplines of their profession and helped by modern forensic technology, been able to begin piecing together the complex jigsaw pieces of the past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> It is a very welcome development that the information thus acquired and assimilated is already being fed into our education system at all levels.  The lifestyle of our ancestors has already been recreated in many imaginative ways at community, regional and national levels. Places such as Ferrycarrig, County Wexford and Craggaunowen, County Clare, have inspired all of us with a sense of wonderment, brought through a shared and informed understanding of how our society and our system of values has developed.  It hardly needs to be said that this type of grounding is an essential tool for all of us to enable us to develop and expand our culture and heritage at a social, political and artistic level and to put the commercial values that bombard us daily, which I have referred to earlier, into perspective.  Access to objects and other manifestations of our heritage encourages and inspires us to make our own contribution for our children to appreciate.  Cultivation of an empathy for one's heritage is a necessary antidote to the potentially corrosive and all too pervasive tendency to accept a bland lifestyle around the most fashionable brand of jeans, underarm deodorants or soft drinks available.</P>
    <P>Chun dearcadh dearfach ar thábhacht ár n-oidhreachta corportha a fhorbairt, ní leor an cúram a fhágáil ar thaighde agus ar oideachas amháin.

Ní miste tagairt ar leith a dhéanamh anseo don méid oibre a rinne Acadamh Ríoga na hÉireann agus Cumann Ríoga Bhaile Átha Claith i rith an 19ú aois chun an oidhreacht luachmhar sin a bhailiú, a thaifeadadh agus a chosaint &mdash; feachtas, ar ndóigh, a raibh mar thoradh air i dtráth cuí gur cuireadh Ard-Mhúsaem na hÉireann ar bun.</P>

      <Col N="1063" /> The 1877 Dublin Science and Art Museum Act which created the museum was a major achievement of co-operative action between the various main bodies involved acting in the public interest.  The results of such co-operation were also exemplified in the action by the Royal Irish Academy in conjunction with the Crown administrative authorities in 1903 which involved a famous court battle in the British High Court to secure the return of the Broighter hoard to the territory of Ireland.  The Broighter hoard, dating from the first century BC, consisting of a magnificently decorated collar in the Celtic La Tene style, two neck rings, a boat made of a single sheet of gold plate complete with 15 oars, bowl and two chains, stand exhibited today in the treasury of the National Museum as one of Ireland's, and the world's, finest collections.</P>
    <P>Such co-operative action has always needed legislative and financial back-up and administrative structures deriving their authority from the State.  There has always been an obligation on the State to underline its role and purpose by providing the necessary legislative tools with which to preserve, protect and foster the heritage of the people.</P>
    <P>The Irish State has an honourable legislative record in its efforts to protect this priceless heritage.  In its time the National Monuments Act, 1930, was a reflection of the fledging Irish State's capacity, and will, to afford adequate protection to and preservation of national monuments and archaeological objects.  However, the characteristics and needs of a society are constantly changing and evolving and what was sufficient in one era may no longer suffice in another. While the Act was updated in 1954 and again in 1987, it is no longer adequate for the task.</P>
    <P>The finding of the Derrynaflan hoard on the afternoon of Sunday, 17 February 1980 by Mr. Michael Webb and his son, Michael, set in train a series of events which has gone down in popular folklore and created legal history.  The event also highlighted the unpreparedness of the <Col N="1064" /> State in trying to deal with the problem in the later part of the 20th century with non-legislative administrative tools crafted in the middle of the 19th century. As we all know, the Webb <i>v</i> Ireland case led ultimately to an invitation to the Oireachtas from Mr. Justice T.J. Finlay, backed by the late Mr. Justice N. McCarthy and Mr. Justice B. Walsh, and outlined in the landmark judgment of 16 December 1987, to provide a statutory basis for the State's claim to ownership of objects of archaeological interest of national importance which are discovered with no known owner.</P>
    <P>The judgment was of great importance, not just for establishing the right of the State to the ownership of a specific remarkable hoard rivalling in importance the great finds of the 19th century.  The importance extended to the judgment's conclusions concerning all important objects of antiquity in the context of the State's overall role and purpose.  In the judgment it was reasoned that the State had a right to the ownership of &ldquo;treasure trove&rdquo;&mdash; described by one leading legal authority as &ldquo;gold or silver in coin, plate, or bullion found concealed in a house or in the earth or other private place, the owner thereof being unknown&rdquo;&mdash; not as a result of any royal prerogative but as an inherent right of the people of Ireland. It is worth reminding ourselves of the words in which Mr. Justice Finlay's judgment are couched:</P>
    <P>...the essential point is that by virtue of the provisions of the Constitution of 1922 what was being created was a brand new sovereign State and that the function, power or position of the king in that sovereign State was such only as was vested in him by that Constitution and by the State created by it.</P>
    <P>The judgment went on to declare that the State's prerogative on behalf of the people of Ireland derived not just from the 1922 Constitution but also from Article 5 of the 1937 Constitution, Bunreacht na hÉireann, which declares that &ldquo;Ireland is a sovereign, independent, democratic State&rdquo;, and from Article 10 which attributed to the State &ldquo;all royalties <Col N="1065" /> and franchises within that jurisdiction&rdquo;. Again the words of Mr. Justice Finlay were infused with insight and clarity of vision when he said:</P>
    <P>...it would appear to me to be inconsistent with the framework of the society sought to be created and sought to be protected by the Constitution that such objects should become the exclusive property of those who by chance may find them.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable of course, and I frankly state this, that so much time has elapsed before the conclusions of this judgment could be moulded into a legislative form. If an excuse is to be offered then it would be that the implications of the judgment were so far reaching that much time and effort has, of necessity, had to be devoted to the task of absorption.  I have been struck the late John Kelly's comments on this judgment, made in the context of a speech given in Trinity college to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Constitution.  In his opening remarks he said:</P>
    <P>The three judgments..., if not a buried treasure, are a sort of open cast mine of material on the Constitution of the Irish Free State, the Constitution of Ireland, the incidents of sovereignty, the fate of the royal prerogative, the extent of rights of land ownership, the mode of conveyance of chattels, the interpretation of statutory words, the admission of non-statutory materials in explanation of a statute's reach, the bearing of the possible commission of an offence on the offender's possible rights at civil law arising in the same transaction.</P>
    <P>This was only the preliminary list of the late John Kelly.  Although Mr. Kelly went on to make an assessment of the judgment, with which there was much to disagree, nonetheless there was no doubting the importance he attached to it and its potential to effect the evolution of the State.  Whatever one's political response, the fact remains that it is the judgment which stands as an integral part of the law of the land, clarifying as it does <Col N="1066" /> the scope of the State's power in this important area.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to meet the court's call to action in relation to the ownership of &ldquo;treasure trove&rdquo; and to take on board the court's suggestions, in the interest of common justice, to expressly provide for the payment of a reward to persons reporting the finding of such objects.  At the same time the Bill takes full cognisance of the State's continuing obligation to protect and preserve the heritage of the people as represented by all the antiquities of importance and not just treasure trove.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the main challenge posed by the judgment has been to ensure, while taking into account the constitutional rights of all, that the State is in the best position possible to preserve and acquire objects and artefacts which are important representations of our heritage, the fundamental requirement being that the people of the State have a right of ownership to archaeological objects which otherwise have no known owner.</P>
    <P>The core provisions of the Bill are designed to ensure that all items found after the enactment of the Bill where there is no known owner must be reported to and are deemed to be the property of the State.  The Bill redefines the term &ldquo;archaeological object&rdquo; to include the concept of treasure trove which was one of the suggestions made by Chief Justice Finlay.  The possession, sale and acquisition of archaeological objects found after the enactment of the Bill is prohibited unless the State has waived its rights to ownership.</P>
    <P>In addition, so that the State will at least be aware of every archaeological object there will be a requirement that all archaeological objects found in the State since 1930 and in private hands must be reported to the Director of the National Museum and that any transaction of such an object must be likewise reported.  At present, by virtue of the National Monuments Act, 1930, there is only an obligation on the finder of an object in the State to report the discovery <Col N="1067" /> of an archaeological object.  There is no parallel obligation on the possessor of such an object to make a report.  The effect of these provisions will allow protection to be extended to all such objects in private hands while not affecting the right of an established owner to sell them. The Bill provides for offences and heavy penalties for breaches of these provisions, consistent with the seriousness of the offence.</P>
    <P>In seeking to legislate for the ownership and improvement of the protection of archaeological objects and monuments it must be borne in mind that, although we known that such objects are beyond price, there will be those who will put a price on such things, those who will seek out such objects, remove them without any concern for the context in which they are found and sell them to the highest bidder, those who will collect such items without regard for or understanding of the right of people to the ownership of their own heritage &mdash; and that heritage is in question &mdash; and to whom individual possession of an object is their only enjoyment.  That such behaviour is a sad feature of the past 20 years, in particular, is to be deplored, but we must face up to it.  The National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987, took some important steps towards regaining control of a difficult situation, particularly regarding the unrestrained use of metal detectors.  This Bill seeks to continue that process by closing the loopholes in the legal controls and by aiding co-operation between the main conservation agencies.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Bill amends certain provisions of the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1987, by extending the protection given to monuments and historic sites under these Acts.  Chiefly the Bill proposes to empower the Commissioners of Public Works to establish a record of national monuments and of sites where they believe national monuments may be located so that every known national monument in the country will be given the cloak of a basic protection and in such a way as to fully respect the rights of landowners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1068" /> I will now deal with the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 expressly establishes the State's right to ownership of all archaeological objects which have no known owner found in the State after the Bill is enacted.  The section also defines the term &ldquo;owner&rdquo; as the person who is entitled to the actual possession of the object.  This is a key section which removes any doubt which might exist regarding the State's right to the ownership of archaeological objects found after the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides the State with a waiver of its rights to ownership of an archaeological object.  It is not necessary to retain possession of every artefact found.  In many cases it will be sufficient simply to know the details and the circumstances of the find.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 provide for restrictions as to the possession, sale, exchange or disposal of an archaeological object found in the State after the enactment of this Bill or objects not properly reported under the National Monuments Act, 1930.  Section 4 in particular is designed to place a complete prohibition on transactions in objects found after the enactment of the Bill, unless the State has waived its rights to ownership.  Section 5 is to ensure that the Director of the National Museum is made aware of the transactions in archaeological objects found at any time between the passing of the National Monuments Act, 1930, when controls on finds of archaeological objects were first introduced, and the enactment of this Bill.  These sections also provide, of necessity, for heavy penalties arising from breach of these restrictions.</P>
    <P>Section 6 permits the Director of the National Museum to designate a person to carry out his functions in relation to the receiving of archaeological objects, and to designate places where such objects may be placed for safekeeping. Section 7 provides for the seizure and forfeiture of unauthorised detection devices and diving equipment found at the site of a national monument or a site protected by an underwater heritage order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> Section 8 provides for inspections and excavations to be carried out by the Director of the National Museum.  As I mentioned earlier, the physical context in which an object is found is often more valuable in terms of the information which can be gleaned than the object itself.  It has been said that the objects are only the index of a great text book while the context in which such objects were deposited represents the text.  It is vital that the Director or a person designated by him or her can respond quickly to reports of finds so the all important site of the find can be investigated and, if necessary, excavated before it is damaged.</P>
    <P>Section 9 relates to the taking possession of, by the Director of the National Museum on behalf of the State, archaeological objects with no known owner found after the enactment of the Bill.  The section also provides that this provision shall not apply to an object which is not, in the opinion of the Director, of sufficient historical or archaeological interest to justify its retention by the State.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the payment of a reward to a person finding an archaeological object, a reward for responsibility. The Director of the National Museum may make payment to any, or any combination of the following: the finder of the object, the owner of the land or the occupier of the land where the objects is retained by the State.  Payments can be made under this section with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  While rewards have been paid in the past, this provision gives a statutory expression to the concept as suggested by Chief Justice Finlay in the Derrynaflan case.  It is designed to ensure there is clear understanding that while rewards may be paid, there is no suggestion that the finder of an archaeological object can have any claim to its ownership conferred on him or her through the payment of a reward.  The provision sets out the criteria which the Director of the National Museum may take into account when evaluating whether a reward should be paid, such as the intrinsic value and <Col N="1070" /> importance of the object, the circumstances of its finding and amounts paid in other comparable cases. Obviously the provision is designed to reward the conscientious finder of an object who reports the find responsibly to the Director of the National Museum rather than a professional treasure hunter who reports the finding of an object simply as a last resort.</P>
    <P>Section 11 updates and extends the scope of the provisions of section 6 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987, which deals with the acquisition either by agreement or compulsorily of national monuments by the Commissioners of Public Works by giving the Commissioners power to purchase rights of ways and other easements and by setting out in detail the mechanism and calculation of compulsory purchase.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the establishment by the Commissioners of Public Works of a list of all monuments and places where they believe monuments are located.  This is a key addition to the protection which can be afforded to our immovable heritage.  Monuments and sites recorded under this provision are immediately put under the protection of the Commissioners of Public Works.  Two months' notice must be given before work of any nature can begin on sites recorded under this provision except in the case of emergencies and then only with the consent of the Commissioners. This provision creates a statutory breathing space which is designed to allow the Commissioners of Public Works time to decide if a recorded site should be afforded the protection of a preservation order or taken into the ownership of the State.  The section also extends the prohibition contained in the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987, on the possession and use of detection devices at a monument or place so recorded.</P>
    <P>Section 13 sets out the penalties for non-compliance with the various offences.  The penalties have been pitched at a level commensurate with the seriousness of the offences.  Section 14 makes a key amendment to the existing definition of &ldquo;archaeological object&rdquo; by <Col N="1071" /> including the concept of treasure trove. Section 15 is a technical amendment requiring that archaeological objects found on or under the sea-bed, near a wreck perhaps, are to be reported to the Director of the National Museum and not to the Commissioners of Public Works, as heretofore.</P>
    <P>Section 17 extends the protection of archaeological objects by providing for a general prohibition on forms of interference which, in the normal course, might not be regarded as &ldquo;injury, defacement or destruction&rdquo; but which can have an equivalent effect.</P>
    <P>Section 18 formalises a process of consultation between the director of the National Museum and the Commissioners of Public Works before excavation licences are issued.</P>
    <P>Section 19 clarifies that where a search warrant has been issued to a member of the Garda Síochána, in relation to a possible offence under the National Monuments (Amendment) Acts, such member may be accompanied by the director of the National Museum or other person so designated.</P>
    <P>Senators will have appreciated by now that the Bill before the House is designed to deal with the fundamental requirements of identifying, acquiring and preserving our national heritage.</P>
    <P>Cuireann an Bille atá ós comhair an Tí struchtúr cosanta ar fáil chun séadchomharthaí agus earraí gaolmhara a chaomhnú &mdash; struchtúr a bheidh láidir go leor, tá súil agam, do riachtanais an lae inniu chomh maith le riachtanais na nglún atá le teacht.

    <P>We will have a clear unequivocal statutory right to our heritage and clear provisions <Col N="1072" /> for action against those who would seek to diminish it in any way. Most important, we will have gone a considerable distance towards fulfilling our duty as custodians of something which is far larger and more important than all of us.  The poet, John Montague, described it as &ldquo;that dark permanence of ancient forms&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to welcome the Minister to the House.  His interest in national monuments, our history and our culture is not newly acquired, they are subjects in which he has had an ongoing and deep interest for years.  I was reading through some previous Seanad debates on national monuments and saw that, on 30 October 1986, he made a lengthy and interesting speech dealing with the National Monuments Bill in this House.  Much of what the Minister said then may have been theoretical but he now has the opportunity to put theory into practice.  I wish him well in his Department.</P>
      <P>This Bill has 100 per cent support from my party in all its important aspects.  We may perhaps have different views on some items but not the major ideas and proposals behind this Bill which is noteworthy and welcome.  Some of its sections are of the utmost importance because it is essential that our historic national monuments and buildings, reflecting our history, are recorded and preserved. Considerable progress has been made by the Office of Public Works.  It has done a splendid job despite coming in for considerable criticism at times.  Its overall approach is welcome and I congratulate it although I have reservations about Luggala, Mullaghmore and other interpretative centres.  I support the principle of such centres but not in the areas in which they are located.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the Office of Public Works is of the utmost importance from an historical context, currently and in the future, particularly for the development of our own culture and art.  At present, however, the Office of Public Works does not have sufficient staff to carry out <Col N="1073" /> important research and documentation of works.  There are still many important areas in which we are not fulfilling our responsibilities.  One such area is Wood Quay which has been spoken of on many occasions in this and the lower House. Christchurch Cathedral is probably one of the finest buildings in the country. Many people fought to preserve Wood Quay but Dublin Corporation built what can only be described as monstrosities on the site, thus cutting off the view of the cathedral.  Another new building is now being added to try to hide the worst aspects of the two existing corporation buildings, it extends across the face of Christchurch further restricting the view from the quays to the cathedral.  I do not think the Office of Public Works could have prevented it but I feel a sense of shame that it is being allowed to happen at this time in our history.  The view of one of the finest buildings here and in Europe is further restricted, that is not good enough.  It should not have been allowed to happen and we should have made sure it did not happen.  Father F.X. Martin put up a fine battle to try to preserve Wood Quay but, unfortunately, his efforts, and those of others, failed.</P>
    <P>There are many Georgian buildings in Dublin, including near here in Merrion Street, but it is worrying to see their state of decay.  Many of these buildings are the subject of preservation orders but we are not serious in trying to preserve them. They are part and parcel of the history and culture of Dublin as we know it so it is essential they are retained.</P>
    <P>Most of the items and monuments the Office of Public Works preserves date back to the fifth and sixth centuries or the Middle Ages.  There are also, however, places of modern historical significance that have been allowed to deteriorate due to the Office of Public Works's lack of finances.  For example, when I visited Geneva Barracks in Waterford, famous in song and story, I could not believe it was being used as a farmyard.  The barracks is, of course, famous for its connection with the 1798 Rebellion and the death of the Croppy Boy but it is now privately owned and an eyesore.  I do not <Col N="1074" /> think this would happen anywhere else in the world where people have an interest in their history and culture.  This building is very important and it is sad to see its decay.  It is in a terrible condition and falling down.  If people saw Geneva barracks, they would be anxious that the Office of Public Works should place a preservation order on it or attempt to preserve parts of it because of its historical significance.  I ask that this be considered.</P>
    <P>There has been progress but the Office of Public Works does not have sufficient staff.  We must spend money carefully although we are now receiving EC Structural Funds.  Development and new buildings are important but it is equally important because of their historical importance to spend money on the restoration, maintenance and improvement of existing buildings which are decaying. Will the Minister use his good offices, influence and powers to ensure the retention of many of these buildings?  On occasions the Office of Public Works is unable to react in time to prevent decay. If it had more staff, many important monuments could be restored at a reasonable cost, if they were in good condition when taken over.  However, many of them become run down and the costs of restoring them are very high.  It is essential to act in time to ensure they are preserved.</P>
    <P>I welcome the severe penalties and rights of forfeiture that sections 7 and 13 impose on people who cause considerable damage to national monuments and carry out digs and searches with metal detectors.  Such penalties are important because there are people filled with greed and avarice who do considerable damage.  The Minister outlined the damage that can be done.  As he pointed out, it is important that items of significance, such as chalices, swords and jewels, be found but the damage caused to them by people who dig after hearing blips on their metal detectors can never be repaired.</P>
    <P>During a proper archaeological dig, work is carried out from the top down and items found are correlated.  On many <Col N="1075" /> occasions information can be given as to the date the items were buried &mdash; to within 50 years &mdash; the type of people who buried them and whether a battle had taken place.</P>
    <P>It is important the Minister imposes the severest penalties on people who disregard our history and heritage by carrying out searches.  It is wrong that they are allowed to do so.  The Minister's approach to the seizure of metal detectors and other such equipment is correct and it is essential such people are summonsed. Unless we take such action, cowboys will continue to use metal detectors near monasteries and old churches, where there may be very important items.  Many people still conduct such searches.  Their only purpose is to make a financial killing and it is essential they pay the penalties.  I welcome any additional powers to the Office of Public Works or the Garda in this area.</P>
    <P>Finders of items should be rewarded. However, it is almost impossible to devise a fair system.  I am against a specific reward of, say, £100 or £200 for each item.  It would be fairer if a percentage of the value of the find was paid as a reward.  If there is a limit to the reward that can be paid for any item, many important objects, which we want to retain, might be lost to this country. Many people have tried to take historical artefacts abroad.  We want to ensure this does not continue and, therefore, some type of reward is welcome.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill dealing with the acquiring of ownership and easements and rights of access to properties are welcome.  However, we should be careful not to overrule the rights of local people.  Local authorities, the Office of Public Works and others in authority fail on occasions to recognise the rights of local people.  We must respect the rights of property owners to gain access to buildings, extend their houses and allow their sons or daughters to build on their land.  They should have the opportunity to live their lives without too much interference.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> One of the better books on our national monuments is <i>Guide to the National Monuments in the Republic of Ireland</i> written by Peter Harbison.  Two editions have been published.  The author outlines the important national monuments of each county.  More than 550 are listed in the book and it is essential reading for anybody interested in such monuments.  The author goes to considerable trouble to trace their histories. He has done considerable research on Clonmacnoise, County Offaly.  He provides information on round towers and high crosses and gives details of the grave slabs in Clonmacnoise.  They used to be laid out for people to inspect but, regrettably, following a robbery some years ago, they had to be put under lock and key.  However, they are still available for public inspection.</P>
    <P>I live in Offaly and I would like to commend the Office of Public Works on its fine work on Clonmacnoise.  The people of Offaly, and of Ireland, are pleased and honoured with the way the Office of Public Works has carried out its duties and responsibilities in Clonmacnoise. The work has been progressing steadily.  The number of visitors flocking to Clonmacnoise each year is ever increasing.  This is a tribute to the diligence and efforts of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Mr. Harbison outlines some of the important monuments in County Offaly. He deals with Seirkieran, Rahan churches and Durrow Abbey where there is a high cross.  He also deals with Lemonaghan, a monastery founded in the sixth century by St. Manachen, and Gallen Priory in Ferbane where there are early Christian grave slabs similar to some of those in Clonmacnoise.  He also refers to Clonony Castle which was associated with the Boleyn family and Castletown and Glinsk in Castle Bernard.  The point I am making is that the Office of Public Works has become actively involved only in Clonmacnoise.</P>
    <P>It has served preservation orders on Castletown, Glinsk and Castle Bernard. However, because of a lack of finance and staff, regrettably the Office of Public <Col N="1077" /> Works has not had an opportunity to carry out detailed work and to document and preserve the histories of the other areas I mentioned.  Because some of those items are not being preserved there is a great danger that they will be stolen. Many of them are exposed to the elements and will decay.  It is important that the Office of Public Works will do all it can to assist in maintaining and preserving monuments for the future.  I am sure everybody here would be able to give similar examples of monuments in their own areas.  The Office of Public Works needs all the assistance and cooperation we can give.</P>
    <P>We have a beautiful countryside which is part and parcel of our history and culture, We now have set-aside and land being left idle.  I saw a magnificent wood recently being cleared away, presumably in an effort to reclaim the land.  It was the natural habitat for wildlife, flora, fauna, birds, insects and so on.  It is part of our history and culture and much of it is being cleared away.</P>
    <P>Travelling by train one can see that the fields are getting bigger.  Nature and wildlife are being interfered with.  I do not know what powers the Minister of State has in this regard or how this problem can be solved but we need to give some thought to preventing the destruction of our wildlife.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and we will co-operate in putting it through this House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to this House and I welcome this Bill.  I have read the Bill in depth because as a county councillor, I have taken a great interest in my area.  I am interested in all aspects of our heritage, nationally and locally.  I am delighted to see this legislation will copperfasten the State's right of ownership of any archaeological object which has no known owner or where ownership cannot be proved.  It will also provide for the further restriction on the use on metal detectors and diving equipment where it is suspected that the equipment is being used illegally in the search for artefacts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> I particularly welcome the substantial increase in penalties for breaches of the law which I believe will be supported by the overwhelming majority of Members who care, as I do, for the preservation of our cultural heritage.  The policing of this legislation is vital and I hope will be monitored closely by both the National Museum and the Office of Public Works. The Minister is to be congratulated on a Bill which deals comprehensively with the difficulties.</P>
    <P>I read the Webb <i>v.</i> Ireland case, 1987, which, to me, is pertinent to the formation of this Bill.  That case stimulated this new interest in the protection of our national heritage.  The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Finlay, in his judgment stated that: &ldquo;One of the most important national assets belonging to the people is their heritage and knowledge of its true origins and the buildings and objects which constitute keys to their ancient history&rdquo;. He said that under our Constitution any objects which constitute antiquities of importance and that have no known owner have to be protected.  I welcome this.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way from that. Our national monuments play an important part in the campaign to attract more tourists and to encourage more Irish people to holiday at home.  Our cultural heritage is one of our greatest assets but we must ensure that it is exploited for the benefit of our economy and job creation in such a way that its cultural value is not compromised.</P>
    <P>This Bill will also preserve that part of our national heritage which is comprised of archaeological objects, including treasure trove.  I had great difficulty when I began to look into the difference between an archaeological object and treasure trove.  The Minister tried to define it and I, too, looked at the legal dictionary and had great difficulty trying to understand the difference.  Treasure trove covers coin, bullion, gold and silver, anything which is embellished into the earth but I wonder if that definition goes far enough.</P>
    <P>The Bill also gives statutory recognition to a reward to the finder of any of these archaeological objects.  Here again, <Col N="1079" /> I had great difficulty with the Bill.  How do we define a reward?  Who decides its value?  Is the director of the National Museum in a position to say that this is A, B, C and D?  Has the finder of an object any recourse in terms of how he puts his case?  I looked carefully at the Bill and I found little in it to cover a definition of reward.  The Bill should go further; perhaps this could be clarified on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Another part of the Bill provides for the recording and preservation of all monuments and increasing the powers of compulsory acquisition of monuments so that the integrity of the site of a monument can be preserved.  As far as national monuments are concerned, the Minister has adopted an integrated approach to preservation by ensuring that land in the vicinity of the monument and any ancillary rights, easements and interests can be acquired.  The concept of a fallow area &mdash; again this is brought out in Webb <i>v.</i> Ireland &mdash; has not been recognised.  It is not sufficient to preserve the monument itself without regard to the importance of its setting.  In some respects the Minister might have taken his philosophy a little further by making provision in the Bill for the co-ordination of the functions of the Commissioners of Public Works with the complementary functions of the planning authority.  I saw nothing in the Bill relating to the planning authority's role in the preservation of amenities.</P>
    <P>The Minister's integrated approach to the preservation of national monuments must also be seen as part of an overall preservation of amenities.  In recent years, many planning authorities have taken a more active role in the preservation of amenities in their areas.  In many cases the preservation of amenities will involve the blending of buildings and other structures worthy of preservation with natural physical features such as trees and flora and fauna.  None of these components of the natural and built environment can be viewed in isolation.</P>
    <P>In administrative terms an integrated approach to the preservation of an amenity requires a co-ordination of planning <Col N="1080" /> functions with those exercised by the commissioners under national monument legislation.  That must be very strongly stressed.  For example, many planning authorities develop linear parkways along the banks of a river leading from a town or village which often take in local buildings of historical or cultural importance. It is appropriate, when the commissioners or the planning authorities are acquiring land for the purpose of carrying out their functions, that there should be a high level of co-ordination to enable the management and control of the amenity and the full realisation of the potential of the area.  There may be problems of access which could be solved by co-operation between the authorities.</P>
    <P>The powers granted to the commissioners to compulsorily acquire land to preserve national monuments would be greatly enhanced by a consultation procedure with the planning authority in whose area the lands being acquired are situated.  To this extent the relationship of the national monuments legislation to planning legislation has not been defined. The opportunity to define that relationship should not be passed up.  There should be a defined relationship between the two bodies but there is provision for this in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The protection of the built environment which forms part of our cultural heritage has not been rationalised by this Bill and to some extent the position has been made more complex.  I had great difficulty going through the Bill as it mentions monuments, national and historic, while the planning legislation mentions listed buildings which are afforded varying degrees of protection under the development plans.  It is difficult to justify these separate designations.  Furthermore, it is confusing for the owners of such monuments and for other members of the public who are genuinely concerned with the preservation of our cultural heritage.</P>
    <P>Owners of the national monuments have a further cause for grievance.  In the procedure for the compulsory acquisition of lands set out in the Schedule under the Act any occupier or owner of land can <Col N="1081" /> object to the acquisition of land by the commissioners.  Although the Minister is given a copy of such an objection, he can only refuse &mdash; and this is very important &mdash; to grant his consent to the compulsory acquisition where the commissioners have failed to go through certain formal requirements.  He can only object to the procedures laid down by the commissioners; he cannot refuse consent because of an objection in any other situation. Substantive objections from the owner or occupier of land which is being acquired for the purpose of the Act will not be considered.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will examine the compulsory acquisition of monuments and how objections are processed.  It does not appear to be compatible with the protection afforded to property rights under the Constitution not to allow people an opportunity to voice their objections.  Objections may be made where a site or monument or the area around them is being compulsorily acquired.  There may be a small piece of land which should be added to it.  Alternatively, a farmer may be left with land which cannot be farmed because the Commissioners of Public Works are dividing it into three or four separate pieces.</P>
    <P>This is not the way forward; we need to co-operate and consult the planning authorities as to how best to develop the area as a whole.  The Minister should make provision which would allow people to object rather than the procedure incorporated into this Bill.</P>
    <P>While the Bill strengthens the protection of archaeological objects, it misses the opportunity to strengthen the enforcement procedure relating to the national monuments themselves.  This is very important and the case of Drogheda Grammar School emphasises the weakness of existing enforcement measures to preserve important buildings.  A model for protection exists under the water pollution legislation where it is possible to obtain an injunction to prevent water pollution where there is a real risk that pollution will be caused.  An injunction can be obtained in anticipation of harm.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> The other advantage of the remedy under the water pollution legislation is that it is available to any person concerned with the protection of the environment and does not depend on the will or the resources of any public body to take enforcement action.  The enforcement procedures are inadequate.  We could provide for a prohibitive injunction where a building is about to demolished. We should be able to move in before it happens and put an injunction on that building.  Drogheda Grammar School, a very old building, was demolished overnight by speculators and we need to copperfasten legislation to protect any sites or monuments which may be threatened.</P>
    <P>I see no reason the remedy used under the pollution legislation cannot be transposed into national monument legislation. Far from taking from the role of the Office of Public Works in the preservation of national monuments it would complement it and perhaps allow the commissioners to make their resources available for other purposes.  We should protect our national monuments before they are demolished.  We should be forewarned and not confine it to the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The existing provisions for enforcement under national monuments legislation are not satisfactory.  Most of the enforcement has been under the planning legislation and in many cases proved ineffective because the authorities got involved when it was a <i>fait accompli</i>.  It was too late; the site or monument was demolished before the authorities came in.  There is a looseness in the Bill and I ask the Minister to have another look at that problem.</P>
    <P>It is important that national monument legislation provide a remedy which is available to individual citizens so we can all be vigilant in the preservation of our built environment.  There is no reason an injunction type procedure could not be provided at Circuit Court &mdash; or even District Court &mdash; level so that urgent action can be taken to preserve national monuments as criminal prosecution has not proved a very successful method of preventing their destruction.  Fines are <Col N="1083" /> too low and there are problems associated with bringing prosecution of indictment. It is time for the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle to be applied to this aspect of our environment.</P>
    <P>The built environment is very vulnerable. Offenders should pay for the cost of repairs carried out by the Commissioners or a local authority necessitated as a result of their wilful acts of destruction.  The Commissioners should be given the power to serve repair notices on the owners or occupiers of national monuments and, in default of compliance with such notices, the owners or occupiers concerned should be compelled to pay for repairs carried out by the Commissioners or the local authority.</P>
    <P>It is possible that the Minister consciously decided not to extend the scope of the Bill to encompass these important and necessary changes but if this is the case, I hope he will take the opportunity at an early date to introduce these important and badly needed measures. There are many loose ends in the Bill which should be tidied up and I hope the Minister will take cognisance of the points I highlighted in this regard.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to praise the excellent work of the Office of Public Works in the conservation and preservation of our national monuments.  The protection and preservation of our heritage is an enormous responsibility.  It is the safeguarding of what we have today for our future generations and I know they are doing it with dedication and sensitivity.  They go about their business in a very professional manner.  About two weeks ago I visited Rathfarnham Castle in my own area which is being refurbished. It is magnificent to see the professionalism of the Office of Public Works in the work they are doing.  I use that example to highlight how important it is that our local authority, Dublin County Council and the Office of Public Works should work together in relation to the development of the area.  It seems that both bodies are now working in isolation and I have brought out very forcibly in my contribution here today that <Col N="1084" /> perhaps in the implementation of this Bill cognisance will be taken of the coordinational role between those two bodies.</P>
    <P>This National Monuments Bill is worthwhile, it will give the State additional clout in the fight to preserve and protect our environment.  The Office of Public Works has been in a vulnerable position in the last couple of weeks in relation to our interpretative centres and I hope their work on these centres and I hope their work on these centres will not detract from their other good work.  I salute the conservation role played by the Office of Public works and I look forward to the future knowing that our heritage is in safe hands.</P>
    <P>When I was doing my research in relation to this area, I had difficulty in so far as we have a couple of Departments now working under the umbrella for the preservation of our national heritage, the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Office of Public Works.  One area devises policy and another deals with its implementation.  There is an overlap and while I realise there are teething problems because it is a whole new concept I hope that perhaps for the person like me trying to get information out to the public we could co-ordinate the functions in a better way.  However, I welcome the Bill, it will give additional clout to our efforts to preserve our national heritage and is well worthwhile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome this legislation.  We are fortunate that we have two Ministers, Deputy Higgins and Deputy Stagg, in positions of power and influence where they can implement this kind of legislation because they both have a passionate commitment to the arts and to the preservation of our heritage, which is vital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember some years ago when we were battling to save the last fragments of the 18th century core of the city of Dublin dealing with some Russian academicians and discussing this matter with them.  I expressed my admiration for what they had done in Russian cities, some of which were devastated during <Col N="1085" /> the war, the great care with which they applied resources from the State to the retention of what was left and the reinstatement of what had been destroyed.  I expressed my surprise that a regime such as the Soviet regime had done this and one of them pointed out that that is the soul of their country.  If they destroyed their past, they told me, they would have no spirit left.  That is a lesson which at that stage we in Ireland had yet to learn.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely surprised that two Labour Ministers are involved in this area.  I do not want to be divisive, far be it from me to split the Coalition, I am sure it is fissile enough under its own steam.  When Mr. Haughey was in office he certainly had a genuine interest in our cultural heritage and I hope this interest will not cease with his departure from the national scene.  I would have to think that Fíanna Fáil would revert to a philistine stance.  I do not believe it will.</P>
    <P>I was very interested to hear what my colleague, Senator Ormonde, said in her very careful and well thought out contribution. Since the subject of interpretative centres has been raised, I have a few words to say about them because they are utter nonsense.  It is futile to produce these little Disney Worlds where people are trotted around plastic replicas and simulations while the real thing is ravaged off the face of Ireland, where no money is really being ploughed into preserving and protecting the original. Eventually all we will have is a few theme parks, the original material will have gone to America or Europe or into private hands, illegally, and the rest will have decayed.</P>
    <P>I do not share the admiration for local authorities that has been expressed in this House as they have been among the worst vandals.  They have collaborated in the destruction of a great deal of our heritage, not only directly but also through their agencies.  In particular in this city I wish to place on the roll-call of infamy the City of Dublin vocational educational committee, which presided over the vandalising, destruction and systematic pillage of a series of historic buildings which <Col N="1086" /> were placed in their possession or under their control as guardians of our heritage. They have allowed them to be destroyed to the great detriment of our cultural inheritance and at considerable expense to the taxpayer.  I am thinking of, for example Nos. 18 and 19 Parnell Square, which were saved by Matt McNulty at the last moment.  They were left in a situation where they were systematically attacked and the vocational education committee knew perfectly well this was going on.  A staircase was removed, ceilings were damaged and fireplaces stolen and if it had not been for the initiative of Matt McNulty none of these items would have been recovered.  The vocational education committee calmly and happily presided over this, did nothing whatever about it, they did not even keep a watchman on the premises.  It is a disgrace.  The City of Dublin vocational educational committee should be investigated for this and I hope that under the provisions of this Bill they could be fined.</P>
    <P>If, for example, local authorities are responsible for this kind of depredation can they be penalised under this legislation? I hope so, because the people responsible for this waste of money and despoliation of our cultural heritage should be made to bear the full brunt of responsibility.  I will return to this a little later.</P>
    <P>It is very exciting that the Minister says the Bill has to be seen against the background of a Department which, for the first time, has overall responsibility under one administrative area with a structure for co-ordinating policy in respect of archaeological matters.  In other words, a new opportunity now exists structurally for us to do something about it.  He also indicates that he proposes to create further Bills, giving statutory footing to the heritage council and a Bill to establish autonomous boards for the National Museum and the National Library.  I wish to come back to what I was saying about the interpretative centres. We are squandering money on these useless interpretative centres which are intellectually negligible when we have the <Col N="1087" /> great resource of our National Museum and Natural History Museum which are disastrously under-funded and are closed half the time.  I was amused to hear the Minister say:</P>
    <P>How many parents have dragged their children out on some wet winter Sunday afternoon to visit a museum &mdash; be it local or national &mdash; and found themselves surprised by the interest which even one small unassuming artefact can spark?</P>
    <P>I have to agree with him.  That was my experience as a child being taken to the museum but I would rewrite that sentence and ask how many parents dragged their children out on some wet winter Sunday or Friday afternoon to visit a museum, be it local or national, and found themselves surprised to discover that it was shut or that a large section of it was closed for lack of staff.  Let us have funding where we have artefacts already.</P>
    <P>I was in St. Patrick's Cathedral a couple of Sundays ago listening to the archivist of the Representative Body of the Church of Ireland talking about the Huguenot community in Ireland.  He gave an interesting lecture on that subject but he was absolutely vitriolic, in a reasonably Christian manner, that we have no concern for archive material. There is no funding for it whatever. There are huge deposits of material that are neglected, are not processed and are not made academically available because we do not apportion money for those purposes.  Instead we are building these theme parks about which, at the very least, there is considerable controversy.</P>
    <P>When the Bills dealing with the National Museum and the National Library are published, I hope they will be as carefully thought out as this Bill, and, most important, that there will be provision for funding contained in them. I was delighted to read in the Minister's speech, where he broke into Irish and, with a fine impish wit, chose to pay tribute in the first national language to the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Dublin Society, which demonstrates my <Col N="1088" /> long held contention that we are monarchists at heart.  It is also an irony when we are talking about monuments and cultural values that the Minister's speech is printed in the English script because we have got rid of one of our real cultural monuments, the Cló Gaeilge, the distinctive Irish alphabet.  That is a great pity but, perhaps, it is not directly relevant to this legislation except that in these small ways we allow our genuine cultural inheritance to evaporate.</P>
    <P>The Minister said bravely that we have an honourable legislative record in this regard but I have my doubts about that, and even if it was 100 per cent true, what about it?  That is academic, and I say that as an academic.  I know the value the word &ldquo;academic&rdquo; has on the streets in Dublin.  When I hear people in the pubs or newsagents say &ldquo;Ah, sure that's only academic&rdquo; they mean it is totally impractical, unrealistic and meaningless to the ordinary person.  Perhaps we have an academic record of legislative progress in this area but what has it done?  What has it protected?  It is merely paper and ink and there is little evidence that it has succeeded in protecting anything.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear Senator Enright talk about the Georgian inheritance. When I watched him making his speech and giving us a wonderful tour of County Offaly &mdash; an interest I share as it is a neighbouring county of my ancestral origins &mdash; I thought for a moment that his research had been so extensive that he had brought an ancient document with him.  However, he was reading from a tattered brown envelope on the back of which he had written his notes.  He made a good and interesting speech and I was delighted that he mentioned the Georgian inheritance.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the Dublin City Vocational Education Committee and I hope this will be taken seriously.  I hope it will be looked at and that it will never be allowed to commit the acts of vandalism in which it systematically engaged without any rebuke or retribution over the past years.  However, this does not only concern bodies like that, and the Minister may have noticed in recent <Col N="1089" /> weeks there have been a number of cases involving property in North Great Georges Street, one of which was in the hands of a speculative property developer who, I am glad to say, was sentenced to jail and a hefty fine imposed.  I was delighted; he richly deserved it.</P>
    <P>In the last week there was another case in which another person was sentenced to a term of imprisonment and a hefty fine imposed.  That case was appealed but the conviction was upheld with the jail term reduced and suspended and the fine imposed.  I speak with passion on that case as it involved a property directly next door to my own.  It is no pleasure to spend a great deal of money and effort on one's property, to be involved in the redevelopment of the entire street, to do battle with Dublin Corporation to wrest buildings from it, to collect and raise money by individual effort and from the European Structural Funds to restore buildings in the street and to co-operate with Dublin Corporation in plans for the development of the street, only to find I am living next door to a shambles, the back wall is coming down and there is a brothel in the basement.  I telephoned the individual's solicitors to complain about this and I was laughed at.  It is no joy. There may well be constitutionally protected rights of property but I would like to hear more about the obligations of property.</P>
    <P>I note that section 11 of the Bill allows for the acquisition of a national monument by the commissioners.  That is paper and ink; I would like to see action on these matters.  If we are serious about this I would like to have seen the house next door to me &mdash; a list 1 building with superb 18th century ceilings and surviving fireplaces, with the roof missing and a crack from top to bottom in the back wall &mdash; taken out of the hands of those who are incapable or unwilling to do anything with it, and returned to active service for the city.</P>
    <P>I have discussed some of these plans with the head of Bord Fáilte and I have certain ideas in the pipeline.  This legislation could be useful in operating a system where the cultural significance of <Col N="1090" /> derelict or imperilled houses in the inner city would be recognised and they could be taken over and returned to active use so that, for example, they could be accessible to the public.  It is not sufficient to leave what may be national monuments exclusively in private ownership whereby the public cannot have access to even a representative sample of them. This kind of exclusivity bred resentment against the Georgian lobby in this city.  I will look for action as well as fine words in this Bill and, in particular &mdash; to be parochial about it &mdash; with regard to North Great Georges Street.</P>
    <P>Returning to the general provisions of the Bill, I notice that the Minister talked about treasure troves.  That is a magical phrase and sets the minds of children ablaze with the idea of finding treasure. However, a great deal of damage can be done with detection equipment &mdash; and I am glad the Minister has included provisions dealing with that because even well meaning people with metal detectors &mdash; although it is great fun &mdash; can unintentionally do enormous damage.  An archaeological artefact has not only intrinsic importance but also in its immediate environment.  The environment has to be noted and the artefact must be removed carefully and professionally so that it is not damaged.  Well meaning people out for an afternoon of pleasure looking for treasure trove can do considerable damage to the artefacts they are lucky enough to discover.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is a highly organised system in this country revolving around at least one gang, and probably considerably more, who are in the business of exploiting our national monuments for commercial gain.  I regard this as a form of national cultural betrayal.  There is no doubt that it is very extensive and this Bill with its provisions for serious financial penalties &mdash; and I am not sure that they are severe enough because of the value of these items and the commercial scale of the operation &mdash; is very welcome.</P>
    <P>Attacks on archaeological sites have been widely and regularly reported in newspapers and on the radio during the last couple of months.  In the <i>Sunday</i><Col N="1091" /><i>Press</i> of 28 November there was a good concise report by John Maas headlined &ldquo;Organised gang loot our historical sites&rdquo;.  It is very worrying to read this report.  The reporter says:</P>
    <P>The authorities believe the gang are stealing to order for wealthy foreign collectors.  The gang have targeted mediaeval sites in Clare, Kerry and Tipperary.  [It is very organised and they are wrenching out decorated lintel stones, headstones, carved objects of various sizes and, apparently, stealing to order.]</P>
    <P>A highly ornate carving of a mitred bishop from the ruined mediaeval church at Kilmacrehy, Co. Clare, is the latest theft, thought to have been taken in late October.  The thieves prised it from above the keystone of an arched recess in the north wall of the church.</P>
    <P>The theft marks the second time the gang has struck at the church in Kilmacrehy. In August, 1992, another stone head was prised from the wall and is still missing.</P>
    <P>The National Museum is asking Interpol and other agencies for help in tracing the missing carvings.</P>
    <P>Before the recently completed Co. Sligo survey, experts had estimated that there were 2,000 sites in the county.  The survey showed there were over 7,000.  [In other words more than three times what people had estimated the density of archaeological sites to be.]  Similar results have been obtained in every other county surveyed.</P>
    <P>Protecting this huge heritage is a massive problem.  An Office of Public Works spokesman estimated that there are between 50,000 and 70,000 sites that have carved stones and are vulnerable to the thieves.</P>
    <P>This means that the number of sites is virtually impossible to police.  I do not know how the Office of Public Works will police them.  It will depend on the neighbourhood watch in these areas.  The growing interest in historical and archaeological remains in local communities is of great significance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> The Minister spoke about the importance of education, and he is 100 per cent right in that regard.  We must go into the schools and educate children about the value of the local heritage.  The children could do projects and the schools could be invaluable in listing these items.  It would be very exciting for young people; they would be given responsibility for the protection of our heritage; they would be doing something of great value and they would have the reward of feeling that, rather than being involved in some dull academic exercise, they were engaged in what would be a vital role in protecting what my Russian friend described as part of the soul of our country.  I ask the Minister to suggest to his colleague in the Department of Education that perhaps schools could be encouraged, as part of the general framework of this legislation, to take on board the systematic recording of these sites.  Young people would find this exciting and stimulating and it would realise history for them.  History would become real and part of their lived experience rather than a simple textbook matter.  That could form part of neighbourhood watch and I hope it can happen.  I am not sure how else it can be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that section 12 provides for the establishment by the Commissioners of Public Works of a list of all monuments and places where they believe monuments are located.  This is a key addition to the protection which can be afforded to our immovable heritage. Unfortunately, as we know it is not all that immovable; in fact it is movable. There is nothing about the funding for this.  Such an aspiration without funding is meaningless.  What is the cost of this? Has it been costed?  Will the money be provided?  How will this list be compiled? It will not come into existence out of thin air.  I would welcome any indication from the Minister that funding will be provided for the creation of this list, a list which will be very important.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of this is that people should organise neighbourhood watch in their local areas.  I know from my experience of living in North Great George's <Col N="1093" /> Street that by establishing neighbourhood watch we have driven the criminals out. They do not bother trying to steal cars or to break into houses because they know the community will immediately alert the gardaí.  The same could be true of our inheritance in terms of national monuments.</P>
    <P>In the newspaper report to which I referred earlier the reporter says:</P>
    <P>Officials believe the gangs are using published books and information on the archaeological sites &mdash; designed to increase local awareness and help in the protection of the sites &mdash; as shopping catalogues for contract thefts for wealthy buyers.</P>
    <P>We have the irony that the existing material which has been carefully culled and put together is used as a shopping catalogue.  They look through this and say a very nice piece of decorated mediaeval stonework here or a sheela-na-gig there and off they go with their hammer and chisel and devastate the site.  In an ironic way it is made easy for them.  The listing alone can be an assistance to these people unless it is supported by active community awareness.  That is why using the schools is not only a cheap and academically useful method of gaining this information but it would also sensitise young people so that they will immediately detect these attacks.</P>
    <P>The report continues:</P>
    <P>In some cases the Office of Public Works has taken drastic action to protect sites.  Following the theft of three fine carved graveslabs from Clonmacnois, Co. Offaly, Ireland's most important monastic site, fears over the future of the rest of the stones on the site led to the Office of Public Works putting over 600 of them into safe storage and the replacement of others with replicas.</P>
    <P>That is a very serious statement.  I doubt that the majority of Irish people are aware that an extraordinary site like Clonmacnois, which we cherish and regard in a hallowed way and which is a name that evokes memories in all of us, <Col N="1094" /> is being pillaged and plundered by these vandals.  I hope they are apprehended and that they are subjected to the rigours of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Finally, the report is inaccurate in one respect.  It says: &ldquo;Legislation due to be enacted next year will increase penalties to £100,000 fines and or five years in jail.&rdquo; Luckily, we will not have to wait until next year unless the Dáil is dilatory.  I hope the Bill passes through all Stages in this House today and that it will get a similar speedy passage through the Dáil so that we will be in a position to enact its excellent provisions before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I look forward to an opportunity to discuss with the Ministers concerned in this area and their Civil Service staff the ways in which this Bill can be satisfactorily implemented in all its aspects, especially with regard to the Georgian architecture of the north inner city of Dublin.  This has not always been possible and I know there were periods when Government was antagonistic to the 18th century inheritance.  I am glad we moved from a stage of active ill will to a stage of passive ill will and that we are now in a stage of passive goodwill.  I hope legislation like this will move us to the final and important stage of active goodwill towards the protection of our cultural heritage.</P>
    <P>Apart from considerations of spiritual values relating to the soul of the country, etc., which may not appeal to every practically minded person who may say it is &ldquo;the usual waffle from people like Norris&rdquo;, there is a practical reason for it in terms of tourism.  As stated many times, tourism is one of our most significant income and employment generators. People do not come here for sunshine holidays or to admire our weather, although today is not bad.  They come for cultural reasons, to look at books, bricks, places such as Clonmacnoise and the beehive oratory at Gallerus, the high crosses and pieces in the National Museum of Ireland, which is pathetically underfunded, and the Georgian core of Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> I am delighted that the few of us who were on the barricades when our inheritance was being systematically pillaged by a collaboration of Dublin gombeen businessmen and hot money from England, and when, as Myles Na Gopaleen said, it was neither popular nor profitable, have been vindicated.  The ethos of the principal political parties has now changed sufficiently to encourage us.</P>
    <P>I am delighted this just legislation is passing through the House.  I congratulate the Government and, in particular, the two Ministers for introducing it.  However, if it remains on the Statute Book as an exercise in demonstrating legislative goodwill, without commitment, action and funding, we are wasting our time today.  This is stage one which will allow us to protect our environment, but it needs action, funding and the continued goodwill of the Government. I join the Minister in commending the Bill to the House and we are doing a good day's work here today.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill to the House.  A County Limerick person, Dr. Pat Wallace, the Director of the National Museum, will be delighted if we pass it as he has had a great interest in this for many years.  This Bill recognises the State's role in preserving our past, claiming ownership of our national monuments and recording and safekeeping them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to look at the Bill and highlight sections worthy of comment.  It is important to copperfasten the State's ownership of our national treasure in this Bill.  It was often believed that because our national treasure did not have a specific owner, everyone was entitled to it.  As Senator Norris said, the value of some of our <Col N="1096" /> national heritage has been recognised by greedy people inside and outside this country.  It is sad that a lot of our treasure has left this country.  Perhaps our State authorities could be criticised for not introducing a Bill to allow the Office of Public Works and the National Museum of Ireland to acquire and protect sites of national interest.</P>
    <P>The definition of an archaeological object in section 14 is:</P>
    <P>any chattel whether in a manufactured or partly manufactured or an unmanufactured state which, by reason of the archaeological interest attaching thereto or of its association with any Irish historical event or person, has a value substantially greater than its intrinsic (including artistic) value, and the said expression includes ancient human, animal or plant remains.</P>
    <P>I hope the definition &ldquo;Irish historical event&rdquo; does not become too narrow. There is a tendency to believe that our history stopped around 1916 and that we did not create any after that date.  While people recognise archaeological sites from the early Christian and medieval periods, they do not consider buildings erected since the 17th century and, indeed, in the 20th century, as having a historical value.</P>
    <P>It is often difficult for people to get money to buy a historical building which is for sale.  An old Carnegie library which was built in the early 20th century was put up for sale in my home town.  We tried to get help to acquire this building, but no capital grants were available.  If we had obtained the money to buy it, there would have been no further problems as many agencies were willing to help us to maintain, preserve and furnish it.  The building was on a commercial site and was adapted for commercial purposes because nobody, including our local authority, had sufficient money to buy it and preserve it for the people of the town.</P>
    <P>The State does not help organisations by providing capital to acquire and preserve buildings.  Senator Norris referred <Col N="1097" /> to a similar situation in Dublin.  Unless the Office of Public Works gives more money to help organisations to acquire buildings, such as the Carnegie library, they will pass from public to private ownership and there will be no guarantee that their intrinsic value will be preserved for the next generation.  In future these buildings may be considered significant in Irish society.  Perhaps we are too close to the construction of these buildings to appreciate their value in the cultural life of communities.</P>
    <P>Section 12 allows the commissioners to compile a list and a map in each county which gives information about the locations of archaeological and national treasure.  I agree with Senator Ormonde's demand for greater co-ordination between the Office of Public Works and local authorities.  Perhaps one way of recording, publicising or listing the national monuments would be to tie it in with the publication of the county development plan.  This would give an opportunity to the Office of Public Works to update their list because there would be a tendency, as in all Departments, to say that the job is done and no further action need be taken.</P>
    <P>However, as time goes on new evidence emerges about the discovery of additional sites and monuments.  For example, when the new gas pipeline was being constructed to Limerick, it unearthed sites which showed that farming was carried on to a large extent in an area west of Lough Gur and much further back in history than had been realised.  In addition, the evidence uncovered showed that it was quite advanced and a well organised system of farming.  This evidence was not available on the surface, but when the pipeline was being constructed it came to light.  Therefore, who is to say that in another major construction, for example a roadway, one may not come across something of great value?</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Bill states:</P>
    <P>When the owner or occupier... of a monument or a place which has been recorded... proposes to carry out, or <Col N="1098" /> to cause or permit the carrying out of any work.. he shall give notice in writing of his proposal to carry out the work... and shall not... commence the work for a period of two months...</P>
    <P>It is important when ancient monuments are listed that each owner occupier is told of the legal obligation on him or her to consult the Office of Public Works if they want to carry out works, because over a period of time people will forget this legal obligation if, for example, the obligation is not in with their papers.  Therefore, it should be officially notified at the time the monuments are listed to each landowner so that he can have no excuse.</P>
    <P>I welcome the idea that a reward should be given to anybody who hands over a national treasure to the State.  It is right in many ways that the discretion should be left to the Director of the National Museum in that it would be difficult for legislators to put a specific value on any object because some objects are valuable in themselves, irrespective of where they are found.  However, more often than not, an object is valuable also in what it tells us about the environment from which it comes.  Its value, therefore, comes from a series of clues found in the surrounding area and not necessarily in itself.  For example, the Derrynaflan Chalice and the Ardagh Chalice are not valuable simply for their gold content but also for what they tell us about the standard and beauty of the workmanship in our Christian past.</P>
    <P>There is much in the Bill to ensure that national artefacts are preserved.  In this respect I do not believe that section 16 (8) goes far enough.  For example, if a person finds an archaeological object, the section does refer to such a person who &ldquo;disturbs unnecessarily or damages the object&rdquo;, but sometimes a person will discover an archaeological object which by leaving it open to the air, will be destroyed.  There should be provision in the Bill which will ensure that archaeological objects are protected against the elements, animals or vandalism.  It is not good enough to report an object to the Office of Public Works and leave it on the <Col N="1099" /> ground, exposed to the elements.  There should be some advice available over the 'phone to a landowner, such as putting a tarpaulin over the object, or, if that is not suitable, some other protection.  If the individual fails to follow the advice of the National Museum he should be equally liable as the person who lifts the artefact out of the ground or damages it in some way.  An object can just as easily be damaged by sheer neglect.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to speak after Senator Norris because he says so much and one must agree with a lot of it.  I agree with his idea that through the schools we should be setting up a form of a neighbourhood cultural watch.  It should be cultivated in children that monuments and objects such as castles belong to a locality, that they do not really belong to the person who owns the land underneath them and that they are part of the history of the locality, county and State.  Therefore it is, in a sense, the children's property for them to look after because there is a tendency for people to say that such monuments and objects do not belong to them.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons perhaps for a feeling among people that historical artefacts do not really belong to them is that they do not have enough contact with historical objects.  A group of French people visited the National Museum earlier this year.  They were accompanied by a man from Ardagh and it was the first time that he had seen the Ardagh Chalice which was found only 100 yards from his house.</P>
    <P>Sometimes the objects are, of necessity, taken out of their environment and brought to Dublin.  One could perhaps count on two hands the number of people from Ardagh who have seen the Ardagh Chalice.  There is a beautiful necklace, or torc, in the National Museum from my home town and I believe that even fewer people have seen it.  Whereas everybody knows that the Ardagh Chalice came from Ardagh, only two or three people know of the existence of this beautiful necklace which was found in a place called Tory Hill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> While there are museums in Limerick City there is no museum in County Limerick and I have been trying to do something about it.  Unless Limerick County Council gets a windfall from somewhere there does not appear to be any opportunity whereby a museum can be established. When our local authorities are allocating money museums will not be one of their priorities when there are daily demands for pothole fillings and so on.  However, more money must be poured into this sector to ensure every county has a museum.  Even if it was only possible to put replicas of the objects found in a particular county in the local museum, the people of the area would be able to look on them with pride, which would lead to preservation of other historical and archaeological artefacts.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ormonde that there should be greater co-ordination between local authorities, the Office of Public Works and the National Museum on a range of issues.  To use an awful word, there should be greater subsidiarity in cultural as well as financial aspects of life.  There should also be a closer link between the provisions of this Bill and planning measures.  The concept of historical or archaeological importance should be expanded to become much wider.</P>
    <P>My final note is one of disappointment that the Bill has not been genderproofed; the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; is used throughout.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the Bill and congratulate him on bringing it forward. I was delighted to hear him say this was only one of a number of initiatives he intends taking to identify, preserve and exhibit items of our national heritage. It is also welcome to hear the Minister intends to put the heritage council on a statutory footing and establish autonomous boards for the National Museum and the National Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said this Bill arises from the case of Webb <i>v.</i> Ireland which related to the Derrynaflan chalice.  We have awaited this legislation for some time but <Col N="1101" /> better late than never.  The Bill will give a statutory basis to the Supreme Court judgement of December 1987 and thereby to the State's claim of ownership of objects of archaeological interest and national importance which were discovered with no known owner.  The judgement reasoned the State had an inherent right to own treasure trove on behalf of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Bill greatly strengthens the State's position because, as many Senators said, there are rogues around.  Most of us would like to see our heritage protected but unfortunately that is not true of all. The rogues may be in the minority but they are doing damage to our heritage. The Minister also said the State had an obligation to protect and preserve the heritage of the people which is a welcome statement.</P>
    <P>My one concern is with the financial backing for the legislative proposals.  I was disturbed to see in the explanatory and financial memorandum that no staffing implications are envisaged for the Department.  That is hard to believe when the current staff of the National Museum are hardly able to cope with their present workload.  One hopes the passage of this Bill will make the public more aware of objects of national importance and perhaps make more objects available to the museum.  I am sure the Minister agrees that it would be unfortunate if the museum did not have the capacity to cope with that.</P>
    <P>The archaeological section is not alone in having low levels of staffing.  The conservation section hardly has the staff to cope with its current work.  When objects of national archaeological importance are discovered, it is important that staff be available to do field work.  However, if the staff are required to do that they must leave aside what they are working on in the museum.  When the new items are brought to the museum, they must be catalogued and made part of the story of our country.  When the Minister replies, perhaps he could address this question.  I realise there are huge demands for funding from all Government Departments but there is no point in introducing legislation <Col N="1102" /> if we are not prepared to match commitments with money.</P>
    <P>The Rock of Dunamase is in my county of Laois.  The Office of Public Works said this monument is one of its priorities and has been promising funding for several years.  Currently a FÁS scheme is making access to the site safe.  This is part of our heritage and we owe it to our children to preserve it.  We may not have the funding to fully restore the site but if we do not fulfil our obligation to preserve such monuments many will be lost forever.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Norris about the importance of education.  The Blackrock Teachers' Centre is interested and involved in cataloguing national monuments on a county by county basis.  I welcome the provision in the Bill empowering the Office of Public Works to do this in future.  It is a crucial part of our children's education and helps counter swamping them with values and cultures which are not our own.  My children constantly watch television and I have to drag them away and try to interest them in places like the Rock of Dunamase or the National Museum.  When they do get to these places they are hugely interested.</P>
    <P>I compliment the staffs in our National Library, National Gallery and National Museum on what they do within their limited resources.  In recent years I revisited these places, I had not been there since a school tour when I was seven or eight.  The teachers of my children and I are encouraged by the way children are fascinated by objects in museums.  It is up to all of us to be aware of these places and to encourage a greater appreciation of our arts and heritage.  The Minister is deeply committed to that and no better person could have responsibility for this area.</P>
    <P>Funding is the key.  In Laois we are fortunate to have an arts officer.  The funding for this post is not huge but it has greatly increased awareness of and appreciation for the arts in the county.  It has made us more aware of our heritage. The Laois Heritage Society is also doing great work but, like all voluntary organisations, it operates on a wing and a prayer.  Such organisations should be <Col N="1103" /> given support because they get great value from their limited resources.  One preaches to the converted in urging the Minister to get as much funding as possible to back up the excellent provisions in the Bill.  As well as access to the arts we must have funding.</P>
    <P>The Minister said we have always needed legislative and financial backup. He is now providing the necessary legislation to protect and foster our heritage. We know the Minister intends to provide further measures in the future, but we would be failing in our duty as Members of this House if we do not point out the futility of bringing in legislation like this unless the provisions are implemented.  I would not like people to believe that all will be once this measure is passed.  We most urgently need financial backup.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús báire, chuirim fáilte roimh an Aire chuig an Teach.  Ba iar-Sheanadóir é agus guím Chomhghairdeas leis i dtaobh a ardú céime agus maidir leis an Bille seo.</P>
      <P>This is a good Bill and it deserves our praise.  Indeed, the first heritage committee set up in this House was initiated by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey. Eddie Filgate, who was in the Visitors Gallery a few minutes ago, was the first chairman of that committee.  Also involved was the late Oliver Flanagan, go ndéarna Dia trócaire ar a anam.  I am sure it was the inspiration he got there which prompted him to preserve some of our heritage by writing the book <i>Poems of Schoolbooks of Yesteryear</i>.  They are beautiful poems.  I must also congratulate the Minister for recently putting together a series of poems that will be a part of our heritage for future generations.  The Minister has ably given an insight into what life is like in our time, which will be interpreted again in later years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to congratulate the local authorities.  In his contribution, Senator Norris was not overly appreciative of them.  I have served on a local authority for 30 years.  In my county 45 years ago, the late librarian, Nora Nyland, established a museum.  She collected <Col N="1104" /> a lot of artefacts and other items, more than we could ever possibly put on display.  If that work had not been done, these artefacts would have gone to ruin and never would have been collected. Many local authorities did the same thing and received no funding for it, apart from a small amount of rates.  Long before the Office of Public Works became involved, the local authorities preserved many of our old monasteries and other buildings with little funding.  We should not neglect their work.  People do not give them enough praise for this.</P>
    <P>Our planning laws, while good in many ways, seem to be ensuring that we will leave no great buildings for future generations. We are in the age of building houses quickly and of a standard type.  I often drive on the N4 from Bundoran and anyone who travels on it can see the beautiful castle built in the 18th century on the top of a high hill at Mullaghmore. That would not be allowed to be built today because it would spoil the view of the landscape.  The round tower at Drumcliffe is at the edge of the road.  We are not giving our engineers and architects an opportunity to display their talents because we are encouraging the construction of bunglows and other standard types of housing.  Historically, the three-roomed thatched cottages were standard.  Some have stood the test of time and are worth preserving.</P>
    <P>There are many fine buildings in our country.  For example, the Killasporone monument in County Sligo dates back to the 5th or 6th century.  It lies off the coast at Strandhill and Sligo County Council is doing its best to preserve it, but it is not been recognised by the Office of Public Works as an important monument.  Some money must be given to preserve this old monastery and burial ground.  We do not know what may be buried there.  There was never an archaeological excavation. It is a pity that many such buildings around the country are not recognised by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>We have had an archaeological excavation at Drumcliffe for the last 15 years. After all that time, less than a rood of land has been excavated.  The trouble is <Col N="1105" /> that it has been done piecemeal.  When we have an area of great historical interest, we should get it thoroughly examined and finished with.  We have a good tourist project for Drumcliffe but unfortunately, it cannot be developed until the archaeologists have finished their work.  The county council cannot afford to put any more money into it. Unless this is done, the funds that were raised two years ago will have to be diverted to other projects in the county. Even if we were given money this morning, we could not do any development until areas like this were cleared.  It is important to preserve those areas but at the same time, we must make them more suitable as tourist attractions.  Money ought to be provided for excavations so that type of work can be completed.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works has been doing an excellent job.  They took over one of the oldest heritage sites at Inish-murray Island, about which there is a lot of folklore.  When tourists visit there, it is easy to keep control because it is seven miles off the mainland and one has to travel to it by boat.  It is not easy for people to do damage to it.  The reason those places stood the test of time was that for generations people treated them as sacred.  They were not to be touched and it was not right or lucky to go near them.  They were a form of shrine where people often went to pray.  Whatever kind of society we have bred over the last 25 years, those monuments are no longer sacred.  One would need security to keep them from being damaged.  Valuable headstones were taken from a site in south County Sligo that are now in the National Museum.</P>

    <Title>European Parliament Elections Bill, 1993: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short technical Bill which deals with the following matters.  First, it extends the right to stand as candidates at European elections to citizens of the Union resident here, in accordance with the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty.  Second, it transfers a seat from the Munster constituency <Col N="1107" /> to the Leinster constituency in accordance with the recommendations of the independent commission set up to revise the European constituencies. Third, it clarifies and recasts the procedure for filling casual vacancies in order to strengthen the role of the individual replacement candidate.</P>
      <P>The fourth direct elections to the European Parliament will be held throughout the member states of the European Union between 9 and 12 June 1994. Assuming the normal practice is followed, the elections in Ireland will take place on Thursday, 9 June 1994.</P>
      <P>In these elections, for the first time, all citizens of the European Union will have the right to vote at European elections in their member state of residence.  This is a major step incorporated in the Maastricht Treaty and one which we have been advocating since we joined the EC.  Our electoral law has permitted nationals of other member states living in Ireland to vote at European elections since the first direct elections held in 1979.  All other member states will now be required to give the same right to citizens of the Union, including Irish citizens resident in their territory, subject, of course, to the one person, one vote principle.</P>
      <P>The Maastricht Treaty also provides that citizens of the Union will be entitled to stand as candidates at European elections in the member state in which they live.  We are happy to extend this right to nationals of other member states living in Ireland.  Section 2 of the Bill provides accordingly.  The Maastricht Treaty envisages that the Council will adopt detailed arrangements for the exercise of these voting and standing rights.  A draft directive setting out proposed detailed arrangements has been considered by the Parliament and is now being discussed by the Council of the European Union.  I understand that a text acceptable to all member states is being finalised and the directive will be made by the end of the year, which is the Maastricht deadline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As citizens of the Union already have voting rights in this country on the same basis as our own citizens, the directive <Col N="1108" /> will not require significant amendments to our existing procedures for European elections.  However, some changes in the nomination procedures may be needed in order to cater for citizens of other member states living here who may wish to contest the elections in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The provision of the Maastricht Treaty which relates the franchise at European Parliament elections to residence rather than nationality is something of a milestone in the development of the European Union.  By emphasising the concept of a common citizenship, shared by all the different nationalities which make up the Union, it represents a significant step on the road to European integration.</P>
    <P>From the practical viewpoint, it means that at next year's elections all Irish citizens will have the right to vote in the member state of residence.  This includes Luxembourg, which, as we know, is in a unique situation because of its very high population of resident foreigners.  Up to now only those Irish citizens living in the UK, Belgium and the Netherlands could vote at European elections in their member state of residence.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the transfer of a seat from the Munster constituency to the Leinster constituency.  This is in line with the recommendation of the commission established earlier this year under the chairmanship of the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Hamilton, to review the European constituencies and the distribution of the 15 Irish seats. This was the first review of the Euro constituencies since 1977.  In its report published in June, the commission recommended the retention of the present formation of constituencies, subject to the transfer of a seat from the Munster to the Leinster constituency. Sections 6 and 9 of the Bill give effect to these recommendations.  There will thus be three four seat constituencies at the 1994 elections &mdash; Dublin, Leinster and Munster, and one three-seater, the constituency of Connacht-Ulster.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to express the Government's appreciation of the work done by Judge Hamilton and the members of the commission.  Revising <Col N="1109" /> constituencies is not an easy or pleasant task and as public representatives we owe a debt of gratitude to the commission and, indeed, to previous commissions.</P>
    <P>The other main provision in the Bill is contained in section 7, which provides for a recasting of the procedure for filling casual vacancies in the European Parliament in the light of experience since the present system was introduced in 1984 and in compliance with the wishes of the Parliament.  The overall arrangement will remain unchanged.  Each vacancy will be filled by the person whose name stands first on the relevant list of replacement candidates presented at the election.</P>
    <P>The changes in the Bill are intended to give a more positive role to the individual replacement candidate and can be summarised as follows.  First, the order of names on a replacement candidates' list must be determined before the list is presented to the returning officer and, subject to death, disqualification, etc, this will be the effective order for filling vacancies.  Second, the Clerk of the Dáil will offer the vacancy to the person standing first on the appropriate replacement list rather than consulting the political party, as is the case under the present procedure.  Third, if the person standing first on the list is not willing to serve or fails to respond within 20 days, the Clerk will offer the vacancy to the person standing next on the list and will repeat this procedure as often as necessary.</P>
    <P>Under the proposed procedure a person on the replacement list of a political party in responding affirmatively to the Clerk of the Dáil must make a solemn declaration, <i>inter alia,</i> that he or she continues to be a member of that party. There have been suggestions that a person's membership of the political party ought to be the subject of confirmation by the party.  This arrangement could put the Clerk of the Dáil in the position of having to adjudicate between a political party and a replacement candidate.  This would conflict with the role of the Clerk in the replacement procedure, which is akin to that of a returning officer in an election.  It cannot be his function to act <Col N="1110" /> as judge and jury in relation to conflicting statements.  Under the Bill, if a political party is not satisfied that the declaration made by a replacement candidate on its list is correct, the party may raise the matter by way of court action.  A seven day breathing space is allowed before a replacement candidate is deemed to have filled the casual vacancy.</P>
    <P>If no replacement list was presented at the previous election by the relevant party or the non-party candidate, or if such a list is exhausted, the present arrangement whereby the Dáil may appoint a person to fill the vacancy from any list presented for that constituency will continue to apply.  I emphasise that the selection of a replacement by the Dáil is a fallback procedure which is quite unlikely to come into play in practice. One of the objectives is to encourage parties to present meaningful replacement lists at election time in order to avoid any possibility of their seat being given to another party in the event of a vacancy.  I emphasise too that there would be no obligation on the Dáil to activate this procedure; the seat could simply be left vacant.</P>
    <P>The view is frequently expressed that a person should not be a Member of the Oireachtas and of the European Parliament at the same time.  I have much sympathy with this view and there is an increasing realisation of the difficulty of trying to discharge the two mandates.  It is interesting to note that 13 of the 15 members elected to the Parliament in 1979 had a dual mandate.  Only two of the present 15 MEPs are also Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>However, the relevant European statute which governs elections to the Parliament specifically provides that membership of the Parliament shall be compatible with membership of a Parliament of a member state.  It is not, therefore, possible to deal with this matter by way of national legislation and it falls back on individual political parties, and, more significantly, the electors, to decide whether their members should seek to discharge the dual mandate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> The Bill puts in place procedures which will apply at next year's election.  It is important that this should be done as soon as possible, particularly from the point of parties and candidates who wish to consider their position in relation to the elections.  I would like to take this opportunity to wish God-speed to any Members of the House who are proposing to put their hat in the ring.  I look forward to the speedy passage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the election date has been fixed for Thursday, 9 June 1994.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot discussion about giving voting rights to emigrants and I support efforts to devise a fair and equitable system with the necessary safeguards. Because of the importance of this issue, the Programme for a Partnership Government refers to such an arrangement. My party specifically asked for a system whereby emigrants would be able to vote in Seanad elections.  This proposal is worthy of support and investigations should be undertaken to see if satisfactory arrangements can be made.</P>
      <P>However, in regard to this proposal, we are continuing with the same process. Elections to local authorities, to the Dáil and the European Parliament should be held on a Saturday or Sunday.  I believe the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, stated this is also his preference.  That is why I am surprised to hear the elections will be held on a Thursday.  I ask the Minister to look again at this proposal.</P>
      <P>By holding these elections on a Thursday, thousands of students will be disenfranchised, commercial travellers, people working on buildings in Dublin, etc., who live in rural areas and who would like to return home to vote in these elections will not be able to do so.  It is outrageous that so many citizens are being denied the right to vote in the forthcoming European Parliament elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be argued that anyone who really wants to vote will return home to do so. However, it is important to bear in mind that on Thursday, 9 June 1994, many students will be attending lectures or <Col N="1112" /> examinations while others will be at work.  An additional consideration for these people is the cost of travelling from the cities to their homes to vote.  Will the Minister reconsider the situation so that the elections may be held on either 11 or 12 June 1994?</P>
    <P>The Bill should include a requirement stating that from now on elections to local authorities, the Dáil and the European Parliament will be held on a Saturday or Sunday.  Many students travel home at weekends and this would provide them with the opportunity to vote.  It is unfair to ask students to return home mid-week. Furthermore, it places an additional cost on parents who already find it difficult to meet the cost of having a child at college.</P>
    <P>Holding two important elections on the same day is another matter which the Minister should carefully consider.  The last time European Parliament elections were held, the Dáil elections were held on the same day.  Some 14,000 vote were spoiled in Leinster, a considerable number, and far higher than on any other occasion.  Holding Dáil, European Parliament or local authority elections on the same day is a matter which must be considered.  Some 14,000 spoiled votes may make a difference to the election of a candidate.  Deputy Bell, a member of the Labour Party, contested that election and was beaten by ten votes after four recounts and one can understand the elation of Mr. Fitzsimons MEP.  I hope there will be a good turn out for the European Parliament elections, but that there will not be a high number of spoiled votes.  If there are two lists of candidates, it is difficult for elderly people, people with poor eyesight and those in a hurry to evaluate the worth of each candidate. I ask the Minister to ensure that two important elections do not take place on the same day.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to replacement candidates.  I am dissatisfied with the existing and the proposed arrangement and I ask the Minister to reconsider this. The point I am about to make may sounds like a mother saying: &ldquo;They are all out of step except my son John&rdquo;, but I will make it anyway.  The existing system in <Col N="1113" /> relation to replacement candidates is not democratic or fair.  In a democracy a by-election is held, although people will shy away from such an election.  The last defeated candidate should obtain the seat rather than the existing system.</P>
    <P>I accept that people vote for a party and want that party to carry out particular roles and duties.  Usually a party decides to run a high profile candidate and somebody else is put on the list to assist them. People will vote for the high profile candidate, but if the person on the substitute list was put before the electorate he might only return with 2,000 or 3,000 votes.  It files in the face of democracy if the high profile candidate resigns and is replaced by somebody else.  That is not fair, equitable or democratic and the system should be examined.</P>
    <P>Political parties are under considerable financial pressure so a by-election for the European Parliament would certainly be unfair.  However, the list system is not fair either.  It is up to the parties to maximise their votes and run proper candidates but, to be fair, equitable and democratic, the person eliminated last should get the seat.</P>
    <P>I thank and congratulate the commission on the considerable amount of work it did in examining the European Parliament election system.  I note that Leinster has an additional seat which I welcome because there has been an increase in the population.  I look forward to a hotly contested European Parliament election.</P>
    <P>The Government is anxious to have this Bill passed by the Oireachtas but, irrespective of the type of election under discussion, it must be said that two Dáil by-elections have been pending for almost 12 months.  It is not right to leave seats vacant in Dáil Éireann and those by-elections should have been held by now.  They have always been held within a short time of the seat becoming vacant but people in Dublin and Mayo are disenfranchised which is not right and proper.</P>
    <P>The Government makes great play of having a busy agenda but, irrespective of its busy agenda elections are part and parcel of a democracy, giving people the <Col N="1114" /> right to pass judgment on what is happening in Government.  People in the Dublin and Mayo constituencies should be allowed the opportunity to elect new Deputies.</P>
    <P>This Bill will have our support and I hope to move amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the European Parliament Elections Bill, 1993. Under the European Assembly Act, 1977, it is necessary for the Government to review the situation and that is now being done.  It involves updating a number of areas which is both necessary and welcome.  Ireland has been ahead of most other European states in so far as, since 1979, it has granted voting rights in European Parliament elections to EC citizens resident here.  Under the Maastricht Treaty other European nations have to follow suit but Ireland set the headline and campaigned for that right over the years.</P>
      <P>The public are somewhat in awe of Europe even though we have been a member of the EC for over 20 years.  I would like to see a greater awareness of European affairs and structures, and how Ireland operates within those structures, particularly at school level.  European affairs should be taught as a subject at primary and secondary school level as part of a genuine attempt to make young people aware of the fact that they are European citizens.  In the run-up to this European Parliament election, I would like to see factual information about Europe being conveyed via the news media and our schools.  The leaflets from the EC Commission in Brussels and the EC office here help people already involved in public life trying to establish what is going on in Europe and how it affects the ordinary citizen.  I would like to see that sort of information more readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Enright said he was disappointed that 9 June 1994 had been set as the date for the European elections. Perhaps I received a different script but in mine it clearly states: &ldquo;assuming the <Col N="1115" /> normal practice is followed, the elections in Ireland will take place on Thursday, 9 June 1994&rdquo;.  That means a decision has not been taken on the matter.</P>
    <P>I agree to some extent with Senator Enright's contention that weekend elections may be appropriate.  We must be conscious, however, that there are people for whom Sunday polling might be inappropriate because of their religious beliefs.  I would not want to affront people who hold such beliefs.  That does not exclude Saturday polling and when the final decision is taken it would be appropriate to consider that.  It is not necessary to have such a proposal in the legislation because it can be implemented by ministerial order or regulation.  That is a decision for the Minister and must be left in his hands.  I have no doubt that the sentiments expressed here will be taken into consideration and if it is feasible then perhaps there will be a change.</P>
    <P>Only two MEPs in the Republic hold a dual mandate, both are Members of the other House.  One is a representative of the Progressive Democrats and the other is an Independent.  In the 14 years since the first direct elections to the European Parliament, the major parties introduced their own regulations on the dual mandate. European law prohibits the enactment of legislation prohibiting the dual mandate and specifically states an MEP is entitled to hold such a mandate. However, this does not exclude political parties from introducing their own regulations to exclude such a possibility.  We must be conscious of European legislation, which supersedes legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill EC nationals will be eligible to stand in Ireland for election to the European Parliament.  We have already granted them the right to vote. The number of seats in Leinster and Munster had to be revised to ensure greater balance and the Bill provides for this.  Given that there will be an extra seat in Leinster, Senator Enright might consider throwing his hat into that lucrative ring.</P>

      <P>A European base may be what he is seeking at this stage. However, that is a matter for himself.</P>
      <P>Votes for emigrants is an intricate issue and one in which it is important to achieve a balance.  Many people left Ireland over the centuries and there are millions of people of Irish descent scattered round the world.  It is not feasible to talk about votes for emigrants in that context.  Giving votes to people who have been abroad for a certain number of years would be more practical.  Such a proposal will require investigation but the Government should consider it and introduce legislation to provide for votes for emigrants at some level in the future.  The electoral process is being investigated and a number of electoral Bills were discussed by the Oireachtas in recent times. Such investigation will be ongoing and I hope we will debate votes for emigrants in the future.  Fine Gael has no such proposal. Its policy is that emigrants should be entitled to vote only in Seanad elections. It is a limited proposal and does not deal with the matter in depth.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is necessary and takes into consideration all the aspects which need to be dealt with at this time. Irish people are generally thought to be good Europeans.  History will show this was so long before we joined the EC. When people in Europe were beginning to have doubts about the Maastricht Treaty, we set a headline by voting for it which was appreciated in Europe.  We have proven ourselves good Europeans. I had the pleasure of serving for three years on the Consultative Council to the European Commission and found Ireland was held in very high esteem by Europeans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally accepted that representatives from Ireland on the Euromis <Col N="1117" /> pean Commission have been held in high esteem.  This is true of Mr. Sutherland and particularly of Mr. MacSharry.  It was not by chance Mr. Sutherland was appointed Director General of the GATT.  He obviously made a name for himself.  I say this even though he is a political opponent.  Irrespective of his political allegiances, it is important to have an Irish person in such an important position.  I hope he will ensure that Ireland receives fair play in the final decisions on the GATT round, which, I understand, will now be made by 15 December.  Mr. MacSharry succeeded in overturning the Mansholt plan 20 years after it was introduced even though very few people thought he could do it.  If this process had been undertaken by Mr. Andriessen, the other commissioner of the time, Ireland would have been a net loser.  We were fortunate to have people of ability at that time.</P>
    <P>Information on Europe should be provided to ordinary people in addition to elected representatives and those involved in EU structures.  Such information should come, in particular, from the Department of the Environment.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make one specific point regarding the day we hold the European Parliament elections, to which Senators Enright and Finneran referred. We should hold these elections on a Sunday, the same day as every other member country, with the exception of the UK.  We are visibly out of step with the other member states, except Britain. Being out of step is bad enough, but following the British approach sends the worst kind of signal to the rest of the EU. Many people in Europe do not realise we are an independent State.  They seem to be confused between Ireland, Wales and Scotland and think vaguely that we are part of, or associated with, Britain.  By tying ourselves to holding our elections on the same day as the British we confirm that misconception.  We should be working all the time to destroy that misconception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> Our actions regarding Europe should always reflect two basic things, first, that we are a fully independent member of the Union and secondly, that we are fully committed Europeans who, willingly and wholeheartedly, embrace the European norm.  Quite truthfully, in regard to the day we hold the election we are not sending either of those messages.  Holding European elections on a Sunday would not cause any hardship or difficulty.  For example, I do not believe there would be any religious objection.  On the contrary, voting on a Sunday would be a highly practical and beneficial.  There are three advantages which I wish to discuss.</P>
    <P>First, because Sunday is not a working day it would be much easier for people to vote.  There could be a much higher turn out even with a shorter voting day. If the polling booths were open from perhaps 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. on a Sunday, more people would vote than between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. as it is at the moment, usually on a Thursday.  If we took the daring step of asking people what they thought on the issue, most people would say they would find voting on a Sunday much more convenient than voting on a Thursday.</P>
    <P>Second, we would not have the ludicrous situation of closing our schools for a day or, as far as I can see, three days. My memory is that they are also closed on the days before and after the election. Closing schools just because their premises are needed as polling stations would be justified only if there was no alternative.</P>
    <P>Third, if we voted on Sunday and closed the polls at 6 p.m. the count could begin sooner.  We are the only country in Europe with such a dragged out counting system which does not reflect well on us. It conveys the picture of a slowcoach nation, a backward country living in another age, instead of a fully modern, sharp, fast moving country which is part of today's world.  We should be taking steps to do something about that.</P>
    <P>I am sure there are other advantages but even what I said demonstrates it is not a trivial issue.  I realise that for politicians and political parties the key issue is who <Col N="1119" /> will be elected, who will stand and which party will win the most votes.  I am concentrating only on that point because it deserves attention.  It serves many useful functions for us to be recognised in Europe and I urge the Minister of State to give it some consideration.  I admit I am not sure how he would go about doing this, whether it is in order.  I know it is not in the Bill but there may be some way in which the Minister of State can enlighten us on this.</P>
    <P>In regard to Senator Enright's point, I accept that the system of an elected candidate who steps down being able to nominate somebody else appears less than democratic.  According to the logic of democracy, if voters decide the first three, four or five candidates of their choice, it seems wrong that one of those candidates in stepping down can pick a member of his or her own party to take the seat.  It is a matter worthy of consideration but I am not sure if it is in our hands.  The Minister of State is giving me signals which suggest it is probably out of our hands.  I urge consideration of holding elections on a Sunday for the reasons I outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This Bill is certainly straightforward in its aims and wording and seeks to put in place certain provisions needed for the forthcoming European elections, which is a practical move. As the Minister of State said, the Bill has three distinct purposes.  The first is to ensure the allocation of seats between the European constituencies.  The European Parliament Constituency Commission published its report in June 1993, which recommended the retention of the existing constituencies, subject to the transfer of a seat from the Munster to the Leinster constituency.  That makes sense in the light of population trends.  The Minister of State is, therefore, providing for this transfer in sections 6 and 9 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second function of the Bill is more interesting.  It provides for the right of EC nationals to stand as candidates in European elections in this country if resident <Col N="1120" /> here.  I welcome this as it is a vital move in our becoming full citizens of Europe.  It is something which we cannot overestimate in the sense that we have always traditionally looked towards Europe in terms of what we could get out of it.  We are reaching a stage when we must be balanced and realistic about it, it involves giving and taking.  In fairness, our existing electoral laws permitted nationals of other states within the European Community living and resident in Ireland to vote in the European elections. That has been the case since the first direct elections in 1979.</P>
    <P>This legislation goes one step further by allowing EC nationals living here to run as candidates in these elections.  That, as I understand it, is a direct result of the Maastricht Treaty.  It is a welcome move because, as I said, our citizenship of Europe works both ways.  The converse, which has not already been referred to, is that all other member states are now required to provide the same rights to the many Irish citizens living abroad.  That is a uniform measure throughout Europe and allows for greater integration in the sense of the European Union.  It is a natural progression.</P>
    <P>While our legislation is progressive and ongoing <i>vis-à-vis</i> Europe we, as Irish nationals, have a long way to go in developing our sense, as individuals and a nation, of being part of the larger union. It was indirectly referred to by a previous speaker and I endorse the belief that many people in Ireland view the European elections as something on another planet.  Its relevance has not in many cases been made clear to people.  That is not through any fault of theirs but simply because it takes place in Brussels and is something with which people here are generally not too familiar.</P>
    <P>On that basis, it is important to have a broad information campaign for the forthcoming European election to give all Irish people some understanding of what Europe is all about and the role of our MEPs.  There should be information about what our MEPs do on a day to day basis <i>vis-à-vis</i> where they travel, whom they represent, what committees they are <Col N="1121" /> on and so on.  It is something with which I imagine even we in this House are not completely familiar.  If that is the case who is familiar with it?  Therefore, I advocate a general information campaign to give people a greater understanding of what they will be voting on next June.  It is essential because we have talked about it for too long.  The figures from each election show that those voting are traditionally the staunch party faithful and that other people do not bother because its relevance is not clear to them.  That should be rectified this time.</P>
    <P>The third purpose of the Bill is to provide clear provisions and procedures to deal with the filling of casual vacancies in the European Parliament, presumably, when a Member dies or retires.  The Bill provides for a listing procedure by which the first named on such a list will be given the offer to take the seat and have ten days to notify the Clerk of the Dáil of his or her intention and decision.  This appears to be a fair procedure.  A person called would simply have to sign a declaration of membership of their political party to be eligible.  The provisions would, therefore, remove any possible difficulties which might previously have required the Clerk of the Dáil to act as both judge and jury where there is confusion in such issues.  I am glad that this legislation clears that up and gives us a clear and precise procedure for such circumstances.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions provide clear rules to deal with these situations.  I am glad to see that this legislation rectifies that and gives a clear and precise procedure for such circumstances.  The remaining provisions provide clear rules to deal with these situations and should be welcomed by all political parties and individual politicians.  It clarifies the procedures and one knows in advance what one has to do.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright raised the matter of the day on which we vote.  I listened to other speakers address this issue, particularly Senator Quinn.  It is a difficult issue because the needs of various sectors of the community must be balanced.  People <Col N="1122" /> do not work on a Sunday and are therefore freer to vote on a Sunday.</P>
    <P>As a representative in Cavan-Monaghan where there is a large Protestant community &mdash; I am talking in particular about Presbyterians &mdash; I know they would not be willing to vote on a Sunday. These people are therefore being disenfranchised. They feel quite strongly about that.  A member of the Lower House did not put forward his name for election in 1989 because the convention was held on a Sunday.  That is a practical issue that must be dealt with as well.</P>
    <P>As a candidate in Cavan-Monaghan in a future general election, I would certainly be in favour of a weekend vote. Many people in my constituency live, work and go to college in Dublin and other cities because they have to.  I would therefore argue in favour of voting on a Saturday because it would allow students and others to get home to vote.  They would not then be disenfranchised simply because they are forced by virtue of their geographical location to move elsewhere. This might be an argument for decentralisation. The Minister should address the fact that many young people leave Cavan-Monaghan and maybe consider something that will give them jobs in Cavan-Monaghan.  However, I will leave that for another day.</P>
    <P>We must consider the various factors involved and I would not wish to offend the religious beliefs or sensibilities of some of our citizens by arguing for voting on a Sunday.  It is a broad picture and a difficult issue.  The area must be given some consideration but it is necessary to examine the whole scenario.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome my constituency colleague, Deputy Stagg, to the House.  The Bill is not particularly contentious although there are aspects of it which could be improved.  I will come to those presently.  Overall, I would not oppose it on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join in the thanks to Mr. Justice Hamilton and the commission who redrew the boundaries.  There is plenty of evidence to suggest that they did their work in an impartial and proper manner.  Some of <Col N="1123" /> the abuses in the way some other boundaries are drawn and some of the abuses we have seen in the past are manifestly not apparent in this case.  The way in which the revision of the constituencies was dealt with is very good and should be continued.  In the event of more population shifts in the future it would serve as a good model.  Our thanks as legislators are due to the people who participated in that process.</P>
    <P>There has been some discussion as to the day on which we should or should not vote.  When we discussed the Presidential Election Bill there was an amendment, as far as I can remember, from Fine Gael which suggested that the date for polling should be specified as Sunday.  Under that Bill we are allowed vote on Sunday and that is the way it should be, rather than specifying that the day should be Sunday.  It is highly desirable that we would vote on a Sunday, but I would not specify in legislation that it should be Sunday.  Such decisions are a matter for the commonsense of the Department of the Environment and the Government.</P>
    <P>I accept the point made by Senator Gallagher about people in the Christian Churches.  There are people in all the Christian Churches, including the Catholic Church, who would prefer not to vote on Sunday.  I mentioned this point when we discussed the Presidential Election Bill.  I went to the trouble of discussing it with members of the Church of Ireland, not the Presbyterian Church, to which Senator Gallagher referred. Opinion was divided on the issue.  Some did not really mind at all and others, as a matter of preference, would not wish to vote on a Sunday but in the event of Sunday voting would vote.  It is almost at the point that any day chosen for an election is going to discommode somebody. Saturday is the Jewish Sabbath and Friday is the Muslim Sabbath.  There are Churches in the country other than the Christian Churches.  Even though they are minorities, those points are relevant.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn is quite right in what he says.  It is extraordinary that we continually find ourselves looking to the British <Col N="1124" /> model of things.  There are other models on the European mainland which might more appropriately apply to us but which we do not seem to examine at all. Technology is at the point that I would imagine within a very few years, although maybe not in the next European election, it will be possible to have a result shortly after the votes are cast, even with our cumbersome electoral system.  I say it is cumbersome; I do not say it is bad, which is not the same thing.</P>
    <P>As one who contested the last European election, it is fairly excruciating to have the votes cast on a Thursday and not have ballot boxes opened until the following Sunday.  There is an air of unreal suspense for the few days intervening. For that reason alone I would prefer that European elections be held on a Sunday so counting would begin throughout the Community at the same time and there would be no intervening period.  I think I would be correct in saying that the Leinster result was the last result to be announced in Europe the last time around.  So, even though we had cast our votes on the Thursday, it did not help us when it came to the result.</P>
    <P>An issue to which we referred when discussing the Presidential Election Bill and which I would have liked to have seen addressed in this Bill is the need for consistency in the way the votes are dealt with by the returning officers.  It was not satisfactory in the last European election. It was ruled in three of the four constituencies that where there was a 3,4, and 5 on a European ballot paper after there had been a 1, 2 and 3 on a general election ballot paper, those votes were valid.  In Leinster it was ruled by the returning officer &mdash; as was her right, incidentally &mdash; that those votes were invalid.</P>
    <P>There was a court case arising from that and the court found in favour of the returning officer.  However, it is unsatisfactory that there is not consistency throughout the country in dealing with such matters.  There was a clear preference, even though it was a 3, as it was quite evident that the 3 effectively was a <Col N="1125" /> 1.  There should be a consistency in rulings on clear preferences.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if it is a matter for legislation. Perhaps it could be dealt with by a consultative process involving the returning officers and giving guidelines so that some of these inconsistencies are removed.  In the case of Leinster, it had a crucial bearing on the outcome of the election.  That is not to say that the person who won might not have won; but, given the closeness of the eventual result, it had a fairly significant bearing, and again it was difficult for those involved.</P>
    <P>Emigrants should of course have a vote if that is what they wish.  It is the biggest single defect in the Bill.  The Minister of State's party had a Private Members' Bill in the last Dáil which suggested that should be the case.  I know it is still their party policy, but I wish they would bring their coalition colleagues along with them on this matter.  There are approximately 630,000 Irish emigrants throughout the Community and they should have an opportunity to vote in these elections.  I do not see any great technical difficulty about it.  The election is being held throughout the Community.  The same would apply to Presidential elections. They are held throughout the country on the one day and it should be quite easy for people to participate.</P>
    <P>We should make our democracy as inclusive as possible.  We could argue about the number of years for which people might be eligible to vote after they have left the country; but, as a matter of principle, people who have left within the relatively recent past should be allowed vote if they are interested.  The argument is made, and it is a spurious argument, that these people could affect the outcome of the election.  I can imagine in a previous time very eminent and learned Ministers got up in another House in another place and gave very cogent reasons why women should not be allowed vote, saying it was because they might have a very serious effect on the democracy which existed in that country. Thank God, they did have a fairly dramatic <Col N="1126" /> effect on it when they did get the vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully say to the Senator that the analogy holds in the sense that it is spurious to say that just because the outcome of the election is going to be affected by a particular group of people they should be excluded from the franchise.  My argument is that they should be included in the franchise and I do not see any reason why they should not.</P>
      <P>Replacement candidates are on the list which will be supplied to the Clerk of the Dáil.  There will be difficulties here.  I can envisage circumstances where the first substitute on the list in the Clerk's office wants to be the person to replace the retiring or deceased Member of the European Parliament, but their party for some reason does not want that person to be the successor.  I can also envisage circumstances where the first substitute might not wish to be the person replacing. I cannot understand the urgency of this ten day period when we can allow by-elections be held in abeyance for periods well in excess of a year, as Senator Enright said.  If the person standing first on the list is not willing to serve or fails to respond within ten days, the Clerk will offer the vacancy to the person standing next on the list.  There is a certain degree of urgency gone into the legislation and I am not so sure that it is as urgent as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the thesis that it should be the next person down on the list &mdash; in other words, that there are four seats and that the fifth person, no matter what party they belong to, should automatically succeed to the seat.  That is not in accordance with European practice that, where the list system is used, the party getting the votes has the right to make the nomination.  That is how the list system works.  It is valid that the representation should be of the same political complexion as the outgoing <Col N="1127" /> representation, but I do not accept that it should be the next person down the list who goes forward.  In an ideal world there should be a by-election, that would be the best way, but even there the proportionality aspect would change.</P>
    <P>Returning briefly to the matter of votes for emigrants, I think I am correct in saying that that would involve a change to the Principal Act.  There is a difficulty about that, but we have frequently in other legislation made amendments to the Principal Act when we were bringing through related legislation, so it should be possible in this case.</P>
    <P>I agree with some of the points Senator Finneran made in regard to the fact that there will be serious difficulties in the years ahead in regard to the whole institutional framework.  What will happen when the European Union is enlarged? Will we get to the point where we have a European Parliament of 1,000 Members and Ireland has 15 at best?  If some people had their way it would be less.  I accept what you said, Sir, about the fact that we have used our influence very well, both in the European Parliament, at Commission level and in the other fora that are available to us in Europe.  It would be a major struggle for us to maintain that influence in the circumstances which we might envisage in the future where the Scandinavian countries, Austria, maybe eventually Hungary and Poland accede to the European Union.  This is perhaps not directly related to the Bill, but it is related to the European Parliament and to its composition.</P>
    <P>Under Maastricht, the Parliament has a much more meaningful role and will become more relevant to the lives of people in this country.  Some speakers made the point that the Parliament is at a remove from us.  It is certainly isolated; it may not appear to be relevant but it will become increasingly relevant under the Maastricht Treaty.  Its obligations and functions are extended and we need to bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>As to the so-called information deficit, the European Parliament office, the European Commission office and the <Col N="1128" /> Department of the Environment circulate literature in the country in an attempt to help people understand how the institutions work.  There is more a comprehension deficit than an information deficit, if I may use that phrase. We are deluged with information, particularly coming up to the elections, but it is not in language which is easily understood. A Euro-jargon has developed which is making it difficult for the average citizen to understand what is going on in Europe.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the people who are involved at European Parliament and Commission level to translate these documents and leaflets into a language which is readily understood by the vast majority of the people in this country, because it is getting worse rather than better.  I am sure the Commission and Parliament are aware of this, but being aware of it does not seem to have done a lot to improve the situation.  If we are to make the Parliament and the institutions of the European Union relevant to everybody, as we should now that we all are European citizens and share a common European heritage, that matter needs to be addressed with some urgency.  The relevance under Maastricht will not be so readily apparent if we do not make some effort to let people know what is happening.</P>
    <P>In regard to the dual mandate, which was referred to by you, Sir, when you spoke, my party has certain regulations about that particular matter and I am sure that it will be dealt with before we come to the next election.  We have never said that people should not hold the two offices; we have said that a decision should be made by the next election.  I cannot speculate as to the outcome of the present discussions about that, but there are people who are very effective Members of the European Parliament who hold a dual mandate.  Mr. Hume would be considered one of them.  Given his burden of work, it is remarkable that he makes such a contribution to both Houses of which he is a Member, the European Parliament and Westminster. The same could be said of Mr. Paisley, who is a Member of both Houses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> In terms of relevance, the media have some case to answer here, just as they sometimes have a case to answer in the case of Seanad Éireann.  The question could be asked whether it is up to the institution to make itself relevant so that the media becomes interested in it or whether the media should be interested in it because it is such an important institution. I do not believe the media gives the European Parliament the attention it deserves.  There have been some improvements in the past year or so in regard to television and there is a fairly regular programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the primary purpose of this Bill is to revise the allocation of seats for the election of representatives to the European Parliament, I want to return to a point I made here in relation to Northern Ireland and its representation in the European Parliament. This could be an occasion for a dramatic gesture of goodwill if, by agreement with the British Government, the revision we are talking about here, which is presumably also being dealt with in Westminster, was extended to the whole of Ireland.  At present the Republic has 15 seats in the European Parliament while Northern Ireland, with almost half the population, has only three seats.  I stress that this distortion is not a consequence of any discrimination on the part of the Government and much less of the people of the Republic.  It is a consequence of the allocation of seats to the North of Ireland in proportion to the population there with the rest of the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>The North of Ireland is disadvantaged. It has suffered because of this discrimination, as it has by virtue of its lack of representation in any meaningful way at the Commission and its lack of presence at the Council of Minister in the European Union.  If we are to pursue a common cause in the common interest of all the people of Ireland in terms of the impact on them of European decisions, this is an area which holds great opportunity for review and adjustment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The North of Ireland and the Republic have much in common in relation to all of the issues that come before the European Parliament, such as agriculture, regional development, employment programmes, infrastructure, environment, education, training and, above all else, actions to counter unemployment.  There is much more in common between the North and the Republic than the North and the rest of the United Kingdom.  One does not just have to underline this in practical physical terms; but, clearly, Derry city and the Glens of Antrim have much more in common with Donegal and the Malin Peninsula than, we must admit, the Malin <Col N="1131" /> Peninsula has with Ballyconneely in west Connemara.</P>
    <P>If we are talking about real regional representation, this opportunity could arise for a dramatic review of the representation of the whole island in the European Parliament.  It hardly needs to be said that Strabane and Ballycastle have more in common in terms of major European issues &mdash; and I have dealt with many of them over the years &mdash; with Monaghan and Cavan than with Birmingham, London or Devon.  If the European Parliament is to be a meaningful, effective representation of the interests &mdash; as we often say in the European jargon Senator Dardis referred to &mdash; of the regions and of the peoples, and if we want to make it relevant, this is an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>We must welcome the surge of support for peace, co-operation and harmony which is evident throughout Britain and Ireland.  Once a peace is achieved &mdash; and hopefully it will be &mdash; it can only be secured by pursuing our common interests with a common purpose through whatever structures are agreed, as the Taoiseach and Tánaiste have said, particularly in those areas that directly affect the lives and wellbeing of our citizens every day.  As an example, is it not ludicrous that in regard to the competition role of the European Community, that it would introduce legislation or regulations to protect one part of Ireland from the other against what it would see as undue support in one part of Ireland? However, if we were all pursuing one common interest in favour of the huge potential of this island across the range of areas, such a distortion would not arise. From my experience over a considerable number of years I can say that our European partners would warmly welcome such an understanding on the part of both Governments.</P>
    <P>In this regard a major gesture from the Republic in the first instance &mdash; as it has always said that it wants to prove its generosity and willingness to share a common purpose &mdash; and also from Great Britain in relation to representation in <Col N="1132" /> the European Parliament would be useful.  It is ludicrous that there are three Northern Ireland MEPs who are being presented in confrontation with each other.  When Mr. Hume says one thing, Mr. Paisley is expected to say something else and other Unionists something else again.  That is ludicrous in comparison to our representation.  That is not because of any discrimination on our part.</P>
    <P>If they cannot speak for themselves as much as our representatives can &mdash; and I acknowledge what Senator Dardis has said in terms of the impact of those voices in Europe &mdash; we owe it to them to have our voices heard in their support.  Such a gesture would have a dramatic effect in demonstrating our willingness to share responsibility with our fellow Irishmen and women in the North on all matters affecting our common interests, subject to whatever agreements and political structures will emerge at whatever time. This is quintessentially an area where we should be pursuing these common interests.</P>
    <P>I want to return to something Senator Dardis said and which is clearly the case. Under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty the new Parliament will have greatly extended powers and, significantly, the balance between it and other institutions, such as the Commission and the Council of Ministers, will be adjusted in favour of participation by the Parliament.  For example, the Commission members &mdash; and as one who had experience as a Commission member I can speak with a degree of personal knowledge &mdash; must from now on come before the Parliament for approval.  They must have the approval of the Parliament before going to the Court of Justice for the formal entry into office.</P>
    <P>That is a major new power for the European Parliament and it raises significant new possibilities.  It is open to the Parliament to withhold its approval.  If the Parliament decides that an individual nominee as Commissioner or the Commission in general is not in its view suitable to undertake the executive role of the Commission, the Parliament can under the Maastricht Treaty withhold its <Col N="1133" /> approval until such time as it is satisfied after further discussion, consultation, cross examination and exploration.  In other words, it can put a stay on the new Commission coming into office.  Parliament has always had the right to dismiss the Commission <i>en bloc</i>, but the right to approve the Commission for entry into office brings a new dimension to the balance between the institutions of the European Union.  It is one which I welcome and support.</P>
    <P>In addition there is a significant change in the relationship between the Council and the Parliament and, more specifically, in what is called the co-decision procedure, which is being introduced in a range of areas such as internal market legislation, public health, consumer protection, education and cultural measures, the equivalents of diplomas and qualifications and the free movement of workers.  That range of issues is of immediate impact for our people and Parliament will henceforth have a much more significant role under the co-decision procedure.  I have probably served on more councils of the European Community than any other Member of this Oireachtas &mdash; Transport, Agriculture, Social Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Finance and I think there was one more&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not, I hope not.  In all those councils the conciliation procedure, particularly that practised at the General Council of Foreign Affairs, was nothing short of a facade.  The consultation and conciliation with the European Parliament was not an effective exercise in consultation much less a democratic expression of the will of the people of Europe who elected those parliamentarians. I welcome the new co-decision procedure, particularly in relation to those areas I have outlined as being of major significance.  These areas affect the citizens of the European Union in their daily lives and in their future prospects.  I hope I am not misunderstood <Col N="1134" /> when I say that our Members of the European Parliament must be fully briefed and familiar with the regulations and directives across the range of these areas and also on their impact in every member state of the European Union.</P>
      <P>The new Parliament will have a significant additional role, as shown by a quick look at the Maastricht Treaty, which does not go into detailed legal analysis of where there are other channels for expansion of power.  One of the obvious new powers is that the new Parliament will have a significant role determined by the majority of its members for or against accession of new member states under the assent procedure of the Maastricht Treaty.  Think of the significance of that in terms of the applications of Norway, Sweden, Austria and perhaps Switzerland and Turkey.  That is real significant power.  It gives the Parliament a major new role in the European Union and its future direction.  It also underlines how well qualified the Irish Members must be on all these issues which relate to the well being of the people of Ireland and the European Union so that they can play a proper and significant role in the work of the Parliament.  By and large our Members have clearly demonstrated that they have that qualification, but the new range of responsibility is much wider than it has been hitherto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that will not change is the fact that the European Parliament will still be the only public forum in the institutions of the European Union.  As such it can greatly influence the public mood throughout the Union on a range of relevant issues.  The Commission and the Council conduct their business behind closed doors.  I experienced the procedures in both those institutions. Members of those two institutions devote much time and energy to giving, through their <i>portes parole</i> outside, their presentation of their dramatic contribution inside.  That is, unfortunately, becoming a regrettable feature of the political relationship with the media nationally and internationally.  The Parliament conducts its business in public and the press <Col N="1135" /> does not have to wait for a subjective presentation as to what major contribution a Member has made.</P>
    <P>I recall asking innocently at my first Council meeting a number of years ago &ldquo;What is the procedure here for briefing the press?&rdquo;  I was told in a cynical response from Gaston Thorne: &ldquo;It is very simple, Michael.  Henri [Simonet, then President of the Council of Ministers] speaks for all of us.  That is, of course, unless you get there first.&rdquo;  The practice of people &ldquo;getting there first&rdquo; has not, as yet, discontinued.  That is why the public forum, where people hear the truth through the media, is preferable to the distorted presentation to which we are subject from time to time.  This is not confined to European politics.  When I hear about &ldquo;sources&rdquo; I wish people would say openly and clearly what the position of the Government or whatever is.  I was never well qualified in the sources business and it is perhaps one of the reasons why I do not have a particularly cosy relationship with some members of the press.  What must be said must be said and one must stand by it openly.</P>
    <P>This is where the Parliament is very important.  Members from Ireland should be imbued with a sense of purpose, application and a readiness to research a range of issues.  This is a full time job, very amply rewarded.  Members can achieve major and desirable changes in a new Parliament.  It is no place, and I hope it will not be a place, for casual travellers to and from Strasbourg or Brussels.  It is to be hoped that the Members elected from all parties here will be the most suitably qualified and the most committed members at this crucial time in the interest of Ireland and of Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation and, like all legislation from the franchise section of the Department of the Environment, it is well and carefully drafted.  I do not think any faults will be found with the drafting or the content of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator O'Kennedy's very imaginative proposal.  While in practical <Col N="1136" /> terms I believe it is now too late to make it a reality for the coming European elections, it is an ideal we should work towards as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament tends to work best when it deals through community and interest groups.  That is the way it conducts its business.  We are familiar with the briefing sessions and meetings held throughout the country and the travelling to Strasbourg and Brussels undertaken by various groups to put forward their points on legislation in the European Union.  One very striking aspect of the way in which the European Parliament operates in this country is the disparity between North and South. People in the Republic can feel that their representatives in the European Parliament have some significance, that they are good at working the system and that the Irish case is better made for them in the European Parliament and in the Community than is done by the representatives of Northern Ireland.  We all know that from talking to officials in Northern Ireland and the various pressure groups there.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy makes a valid case in saying that it would be more appropriate that Malin peninsula should be represented with the Glens of Antrim rather than perhaps with Ballyconneely as it is at present.  It is a case that would obviously meet with strong political resistance from some sections in Northern Ireland.  However, I suspect that the Ulster Farmers' Union in Northern Ireland, the local government bodies and the professional associations would see that this proposal has a great deal of practical sense.  I give it my warm support.</P>
    <P>One of the great ideals for the European Parliament, which was established as the European Assembly when the institutions were only taking shape, was that it would break down barriers and be a force for integration.  What better way to do that than by starting in our own country to let it work this way?  Over the years I have been heartened by the fact that a number of our MEPs consistently developed relations with groups in <Col N="1137" /> Northern Ireland and have, almost <i>de facto,</i> become the representatives of some groups there or of the Government acting on behalf of Northern Ireland interests in the Community.  I am glad to support this idea, although it needs to be developed.  It should be part of the ongoing process for peace, a further means of integration and which, in a practical sense, is worthwhile for many people in this country.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher made a valid point in her thoughtful contribution which has been made since the European Parliament came into existence, although it is not directly relevant to the Bill, relating to the lack of information about what the Parliament does and how it affects people.  I said earlier that the best means of transmitting information is through interest and community groups, etc.  The MEPs have been fairly effective in dealing with these groups around the country. However, there is still this comprehension gap for the public, to which Senator Dardis referred.</P>
    <P>I do not know how to overcome this problem.  Our expensive European Parliament office has all the modern means of mass communication.  Perhaps there is resistance to learning more about the Parliament because of its distance and apparent lack of relevance.  This makes it more difficult, it is almost the chicken and egg.  The European Parliament office has been in existence long enough to take a very hard look at the effectiveness of its programmes and to acknowledge the gap between the desired amount of information about the Parliament and the current situation.  Like Senator Gallagher, I hope the electoral process will be accompanied by &mdash; I hate to use the phrase &ldquo;an educational campaign&rdquo;&mdash; or an information campaign.</P>
    <P>At present, we are talking about the democratic deficit, a well worn cliché. This party and other Members of the House have said on many occasions that it is difficult for Members of the European Parliament to find a platform in this country where the interaction of European and national issues can be debated. We should be allowed to question its <Col N="1138" /> Members because, with the prevalence of directives, the application of decisions are being taken out of this country.  I and many other people have said that this House would be an ideal forum for monthly discussions which included members of the European Parliament.  These discussions, which should not be formal, should include current issues and the concerns of those who represent national interests.  This interaction would be useful for us, the Members of the Parliament and the public.  I am disappointed that MEPs have not accepted this idea because it would be to their advantage.  I am not talking about meeting midweek when they are busy because we are also busy at that time.  However, it would be possible to have such a session on Mondays or Fridays.</P>
    <P>The dual mandate was mentioned by a number of speakers and it will remain although, like Senator O'Kennedy, I see no justification for it.  Being a Member of the European Parliament is a full-time and well paid job.  It is not possible for a person to do the two jobs adequately because he or she will be unable to give 100 per cent commitment.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, explained in his speech why it has not been dealt with this time.  However, the people are the final arbiters of who they want in the European Parliament.  I do not believe anyone in this House is happy about the dual mandate.</P>
    <P>I am glad the replacement process is being tidied up.  We had a few unseemly wrangles in the past where, due to internal party difficulties, there was some jousting before the final decision was taken although, in the case I have in mind, the person chosen has been an excellent Member of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The question of votes for emigrants was raised by Senator Dardis and a number of other people and my colleague, Senator Enright, has tabled an amendment on this matter.  One could be a dog in the manger about this issue because the proposals in this Bill allow Irish people in the Community to vote. <Col N="1139" /> There is a growing agreement among all parties in this House about the need to find procedures so that our emigrants or recent emigrants, especially those who hope to return to this country, can vote in national elections.  It might be possible to allow Irish people in the United States, Australia and places where we have embassies to register for the vote in this election on a trial basis.  Perhaps there is no time to do this at present.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Enright, has tabled a number of amendments which he will move on Committee Stage.  I support the thrust of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members for their contributions and welcome for the Bill.  I will try to deal with the main points raised by them.</P>
      <P>I have a strong inclination to allowing Sunday voting in local, Dáil and European elections.  I was quoted in a newspaper yesterday as having said this. Government backbenchers have also agreed and the Minister indicated in the Dáil that he was considering the matter. Present legislation, the Maastricht Treaty and the European elections allow for Sunday voting.  The dates for the election are 9 to 12 June, inclusive.  There is no requirement for specific legislation because the Minister can, by order, make that decision.  Senator Enright said he was disappointed that I announced the date of the elections.  I did not, I said that assuming normal procedures were followed as on previous occasions, the date would be 9 June.  However, no decision has been made by the Minister and I will convey the Members' opinions on this issue to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Favourable opinions were expressed about weekend voting.  Perhaps there are objections, but there are also advantages. There are also disadvantages because some people leave their homes at weekends and this makes it more difficult for them to vote.  There are also religious objections to voting on Saturday and Sunday.  These problems can be overcome and I will continue to favour <Col N="1140" /> Sunday voting.  However, the Minister for the Environment must make this decision by order and this has not yet been done for either the local or the European elections.  As I mentioned in my earlier contribution, this depends on assuming the normal practice.</P>
    <P>In relation to dual elections on the same day causing difficulties, a list of elections is promised in the near future. We have local elections for the sub-county tier of local elections, European elections, by-elections and a number of referenda.  It would not be a good idea to have one election per day because money would be wasted, schools would be closed for long periods and there would be other disadvantages.</P>
    <P>It is likely that the European and local elections will be held on the same day. In fact, the Minister clearly indicated that this will be the case.  This has definite advantages because it will assist the process of information which has been referred to by highlighting the message regarding both elections.  It will also encourage people who might not vote in European elections to do so.</P>
    <P>The issue of replacement candidates exercised the minds of a number of Members.  Among the suggested measures was that the person last eliminated should be chosen.  We need to be clear about what we are doing here. There is List A, the candidates to be elected on the day and clearly attached to these, in an inseparable way, is List B. These are the people who will replace List A if they leave the European Parliament for one reason or another.  The public should be clearly aware when they are casting their vote for candidate A that candidates B and C and D may take that place, the consequences of voting for candidate A means that only a heartbeat separates the seat that person wins on that vote from List B.</P>
    <P>It is a requirement of the European Parliament regulations to put all the persons who may be candidates before the electorate.  We cannot allow a political party to simply nominate a replacement. We cannot have co-option in the normal sense of what takes place at county council <Col N="1141" /> elections and we cannot provide that the last eliminated is the best person &mdash; there are many disadvantages to that. The system we now propose gives the candidate a superior position over the political party and that is desirable.  If the political party deems it necessary to challenge that it is in a better position to do so in the courts than an individual and there is ample time to make such a challenge.</P>
    <P>There may have been confusion arising from the fact that an explanatory memorandum is not reprinted after the Dáil amends the Bill, it is still circulated to Senators.  However, the number of days available for a candidate to indicate whether they are accepting the position has been changed, from ten day to 20 days, by amendment in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn made the point, valid to a degree, that we should not imitate the UK and that we should show a more European stance by proceeding with the rest of Europe.  However, not all European countries vote on Sundays.  I am informed that the UK, Denmark and the Netherlands all vote on a Thursday.</P>
    <P>The points by Senator Gallagher regarding the enhanced role of the European Parliament should be taken on board, including the issue of nominating serious people to List B by ensuring they are candidates with a real possibility of being Members of the European Parliament in a Parliament with a greatly enhanced role.  It is important to stress this.  I understand that the European Parliament information office in Dublin is organising a special campaign of information, to run in conjunction with the election campaign, about the new European Parliament, its new role, new powers and the systems of electing people to the Parliament.  In this respect Senator Dardis's point is valid.  We do not need information in Euro jargon, we need simple information in the language of ordinary people which they will understand. People will reject jargon as it is not the volume of material that is important, it is the format in which it is presented.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1142" /> The large numbers of spoiled votes in the last European elections were raised by a number of Members.  There will be consultation with the returning officers and guidelines will be agreed to ensure consistency in establishing what is a spoiled vote arising from two ballot papers being available on the same day.</P>
    <P>The issue of votes for emigrants has been raised repeatedly.  In the Programme for a Partnership Government there is a commitment to a referendum to allow votes for emigrants.  How that should be done is currently being examined within my Department by the Minister for the Environment.  There is no constitutional bar to allowing votes for emigrants in the European elections, but the Government does not wish to proceed with this on a piecemeal basis because it has a definite commitment to it in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  In this respect I repeat the commitment given by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Browne, that, within the period of this Government, the necessary referendum and legislation will be put in place to allow votes for emigrants.  I am unable to advise at present what format that will take because it has not been decided.  There are various opinions, within and between parties, as to how best to proceed with this, but I can give a commitment that it will be undertaken within the period of the life of this Government.</P>
    <P>Those are the main points raised by the Members and some of them are subject to amendments on Committee Stage when perhaps they can be dealt with in more detail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> In page 2, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  Persons who are not normally resident in the State but who are citizens of the State shall be eligible to vote for representatives to the European Parliament subject to certain provisions contained in regulations to be made by the Minister for the Environment.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is reasonably selfexplanatory. Many people living outside the State wish to vote in our elections.  I understand that at present members of the diplomatic corps and of the Army serving overseas have voting rights. Where possible we should try to ensure that, with the introduction of proper regulations, voting rights will be extended to Irish people overseas.  This is important as many people are anxious to have the right to exercise their franchise. I believe that we are the only country in the EC which does not have the kind of right I am seeking to have inserted by this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I realise this matter was considered in some detail when it was discussed by the select committee.  As far as I understand, there are 63,000 people from other countries resident here who can vote in the European Parliament elections and that is welcome.  It is also welcome that people can stand in the member state in which they are resident if they are citizens of the European Union.  However, if that was to be brought to its logical conclusion, our 630,000 people, who are throughout the EC should be able to vote.  As the elections are at the same time there should not be a difficulty about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the Minister's point that it is intended to have a constitutional referendum on the overall problem.  The Minister said it is intended to have a constitutional referendum on the issue. That is welcome and it should happen sooner rather than later.  Nonetheless these amendments would improve the Bill.  Our democracy should be all <Col N="1145" /> embracing.  Citizens of this country who left it in the recent past should be entitled to vote if they want to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes that Irish people living abroad should have the right to vote in a constituency at home.  As I said on Second Stage we have given a commitment to hold a referendum to allow for emigrant voting, not just in European elections but in elections generally.</P>
      <P>Irish citizens, no matter where they live in Europe, will be entitled to vote in these elections.  They are not in the same position as in other elections.  I am not aware of any argument by Irish emigrants for the right to vote in European elections. It is some time since I took part in discussions on this and some emigrants may have formed a new opinion on the matter but I am not aware of a case being made because under the Maastricht Treaty they can already vote for the European Parliament in the area in which they live.</P>
      <P>It may be unusual for the Seanad to do what is suggested here because, if passed, the amendment would give amazing powers to the Minister.  He could, without reference to the elected Parliament, make any type of regulation on votes for emigrants.  If I was in Opposition I would strenuously oppose such a provision.  It gives the Minister a wide power to act.  I fully trust the Minister, naturally enough&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> In page 2, after line 32, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  Candidates seeking election as representatives to the European Parliament and who, at the time of the election, are Members of either House of the Oireachtas shall, if elected to the European Parliament, cease to be a Member of either the European Parliament, or the Oireachtas, as the case may be, at the next following election for membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is dissatisfaction with the dual mandate.  It is not in the interests of the people that a representative in Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann is also a Member of the European Parliament. People involved in politics at national level find it difficult and onerous.  To do two jobs while also travelling between the European Parliament and Ireland would be even more so.</P>
    <P>There are some notable exceptions. Mr. John Hume has performed in a distinguished manner as a Member of both the House of Commons and the European Parliament.  He succeeded in discharging his duties and performed creditably in both fora.</P>
    <P>The position is somewhat different here and we would have reservations about the dual mandate.  I read the debates in the Dáil and the Minister said he does not think it possible to legislate along the lines I suggest.  We may have to leave this matter to the wisdom of the political parties and allow them to monitor the situation.  Political parties should ensure that its members sit in one parliament at a time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anyone can carry out duties as a full time politician in Europe and be a full time politician at home at the same time.  The case of John Hume, cited in both Houses, is not comparable to the norm.  He has a special role which he can fulfil in both parliaments. He is not in a normal position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently two of our 15 MEPs are also Members of the Oireachtas; perhaps they are magicians.  One is an Independent and the other a member of the <Col N="1147" /> Progressive Democrats.  From my experience as a backbencher in Opposition, I do not know how anyone has time to be in Europe for one third or one half of the week.  It is a full time job.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the possibility, it is not desirable to legislate to say one cannot be a member of both bodies.  The political parties and the electorate should decide the matter.  The parties should make inhouse rules on the issue, if not the electorate will give a clear message to candidates holding dual mandates.  At the beginning of our EC membership 13 of the 15 MEPs held dual mandates, which, as I said, has now been reduced to two.</P>
    <P>The most important point is that a provision in the European legislation introduced on 20 September 1976 governing this matter states: &ldquo;The office of representative in the assembly shall be compatible with membership of the parliament of a member state&rdquo;.  If we introduced legislation which ran counter to European legislation I do not believe it would stand up in court.  We are not proposing to do so but even if it were possible I would still argue against writing into legislation that the dual mandate was to be banned.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.  Notwithstanding anything in any other legislation the Minister for the Environment shall appoint either Saturday or Sunday as the polling day at European elections.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and his officials on the wording of the following sentence: &ldquo;Assuming the normal practice is followed the elections in Ireland will take place on Thursday, 9 June 1994&rdquo;.  If the Minister and his advisers had been writing the transcripts of the documents <Col N="1148" /> exchanged which were disclosed by Sir Patrick Mayhew, there would not have been 22 typing and typographical errors.</P>
    <P>It is important that the elections are held on either Saturday or Sunday.  I listened closely to Senators Quinn, Finneran and Gallagher on Sunday voting. Senator Gallagher expressed the viewpoint of some people in her constituency. There are a number of people with similar views in my constituency but there are far more in hers.  Religious beliefs must be respected and therefore I would favour elections on a Saturday.</P>

      <P>They must exercise strategic voting because there are three of them in Dáil Éireann.  Nonetheless it is essential that the elections take place either on a Saturday or a Sunday.  Many students are unable to get to their constituencies when elections take place in the middle of university and regional technical college examinations.  If the election is held on a Thursday, a lot of them will not be able to vote.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister can ensure normal practice is not followed on this occasion and that the elections are held on either a Saturday or Sunday.  This subject comes up at our branch meetings on a reasonably regular basis.  The Minister is on record as preferring a weekend vote, so he should put his view into practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of whether there should be weekend voting is a finely balanced argument.  The last Electoral Bill looked in great detail at the obstacles in the way of as full a turnout as possible. With improvements in technology, there are ways in which late registrations and some of the other obstacles against voting can be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early part of this century, general elections took place when we were still with mother England, so the results would take between a week to ten days to arrive.  That would certainly provide extra work for the sophologists and the <Col N="1149" /> commentators on radio and television, but I am not recommending it to the Minister.  We would all be dead if we had to wait that long &mdash; it was bad enough last time.  The question on how to get maximum voter turnout is not static. There are changing circumstances and we should keep looking at it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say, in his Second Stage reply, that there was nothing in this legislation that would preclude voting on a Sunday.  In the Presidential Election Bill voting on a Sunday is also permitted.  I do not see the need for it to be enshrined in legislation, but I make a strong plea to the Minister to try it on this occasion.</P>
      <P>The central issue is what day of the week would allow most people to vote. There are always reasons why some people cannot vote.  Holding the election on a Sunday would allow most people to vote.  One only has to stand by the motorway on a Saturday to see the number of buses going down the country from Dublin carrying students, civil servants and others who live in the city. Many of those people are registered to vote in the country.  I think the Minister would accept that either a Saturday or Sunday would facilitate as many people as possible to participate in the democratic process.</P>

      <P>I thank Members for their contributions to this debate.  I have nothing new to add to what I have to say. Facilitating the maximum numbers of people to vote and the increased convenience is, I assume, the reason for the proposal for Sunday voting.  There is no argument against that.  The Minister has the power to do that, so we do not need legislation for it, unless the intention is to force him into that situation.  That is an undesirable type of restriction on the <Col N="1150" /> Minister.  People like students, who are away from home, can register to vote at their college.  Those from the country who are living in Dublin probably should be registered where they normally live, rather than where they come from, a place they might only visit on weekends.</P>
      <P>Many countries have compulsory voting.  Maybe we should look at the possibility of making people who refuse to exercise their franchise providing a good reason for doing so.</P>

      <P>In Australia, for example, one has to provide a medical certificate if one does not vote, otherwise there are severe penalties.  I will refer the matter back to the Minister for the Environment and impress on him the strength of the arguments made on the Seanad in support of weekend voting, whether it is on a Saturday or Sunday.  I will be adding my own support to that.</P>

      <P>I put forward the amendment to make it compulsory under the legislation that the elections would be held on a Saturday or a Sunday.  I will not put it to a vote, but I want to make it clear that there is a considerable body of opinion across the country that the elections should take place on either of the two days.</P>
      <P>The Minister's point that students in Dublin, Cork or other cities should register and vote there is not favourable. Those from different parts of the country have their own affiliations and would be more interested in the results from their own constituencies than those in the Dublin area, where they would not have a personal affinity with the candidate.  I hope that people will be encouraged to go back to their own areas to vote.</P>
      <P>In regard to compulsory registration, Senator Dardis was correct in saying that it is one way of making sure that the numbers that are voting would decline.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking this item on the Adjournment. The area I represent at local authority level covers approximately six parishes and some rural hinterland.  Four of the six parishes are designated as CODAN by Dublin County Council.  As a previous <Col N="1152" /> member of the council the Minister knows exactly what that means.  St. Philip's senior national school, Mountview, is in one of these parishes and is also designated by the Minister's Department as disadvantaged.  It is located in an area which has an unemployment rate of in excess of 70 per cent.  According to the school's principal, alcohol, drug abuse, domestic violence, crime and vandalism are major influences on the daily lives of the pupils.  I know the Minister feels very strongly about the fact that a significant percentage of the pupils come to school hungry and that several of them come to school without parental assistance.</P>
      <P>The principal made an application to the Minister for an additional remedial teacher and a home-school liaison officer. It is an area of huge social disadvantage and great problems.  It is also an area in which there are tremendously active groups doing great work but it is vital that the children at Mountview school get the opportunity early on to break the cycle of disadvantage.  The principal said that joyriding is a nightly occurrence and that pupils regularly witness serious antisocial activities.  Many of the pupils come from homes where parents are illiterate or semiliterate.  Some parents are lacking in the social and domestic skills necessary for family life and the principal states that in support of the need for the additional teachers in his school.</P>
      <P>The school also provides a travellers' class on the school premises and is to be commended for that.  The principal feels that liaison between the school and parents is necessary for preparing the children for confirmation, parent teacher meetings and other significant matters. There is a huge number of traveller families in the greater Blanchardstown area. Once again it is vital to make some inroad into the special problems that traveller children and women experience and to do it at an early stage in the education of the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal also states that a special class for pupils with literacy and numeracy difficulties commenced in the school on 1 September and there are 15 pupils in the class.  He also states in correspondence to the Minister the number of pupils availing of remedial teaching. <Col N="1153" /> There are 45 pupils from third and fourth class receiving regular remedial attention in English and another 55 pupils are in need of remedial attention.  It is vital that the school gets the support to ensure that these children are provided with the best form of education the State can give.</P>
    <P>Tests showed that the pupils have a reading age of two years &mdash; or more &mdash; less than their chronological age.  Testing in January 1993 showed that 80 pupils required remedial attention in maths and 29 pupils are currently being sent for assessment for literacy, numeracy and behavioural difficulties.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is very sympathetic to the needs of these areas in particular. I hope that she will be able to respond favourably.  Although I did not mention it in my Adjournment matter, I spoke to the principal who told me that they now have an additional problem.  The enrolment figure in his school has dropped to 355 which is below the requirement figure of 370 to retain the present teachers.  That is without the additional appointments I am asking the Minister to consider.</P>
    <P>Next September the school will face a reduction in its teaching staff, despite the fact that the enrolment figure will increase to 390.  In addition to the request for a remedial teacher and a home-school liaison teacher, it is vital the school retains its present allocation of teachers. The Minister is aware of the disadvantage to which I refer and the need which exists in this regard, she has a particular approach to her ministry and has identified these children as a priority.  This matter must be considered in the immediate future.  Although the number of enrolments will increase to 390 next September, the principal said the school will lose a teacher because enrolments did not reach a certain level last September and this will place it at a considerable disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Although I extended the area which I asked the Minister to examine, I ask her to consider the request for a remedial teacher and a home-school liaison teacher.  I am a member of the board of a community school in the Corduff area and the appointment of a home-school liaison teacher has been successful.  The practice in the inner city and in the county <Col N="1154" /> where the Garda acted as the school inspector was counterproductive in getting children to school.  The appointment of a school-liaison teacher as a link between the family and the school is vital. I ask the Minister to favourably consider the application for these teachers. However, the school must retain its existing quota of teachers, otherwise class sizes will exceed 30 pupils.  As a teacher, the Minister will appreciate the difficulties the teachers face.  I hope she will respond to the two requests and that regulations will not tie her into reducing the quota of teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the House in the past, remedial education at primary level is a matter, in the first instance, for the ordinary class teacher.  The majority of pupils with remedial needs would, therefore, be helped within the scope of the ordinary teaching service.</P>
      <P>However, we must acknowledge that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of under-achievement in primary schools.  It was with this in mind that 86 posts were created and allocated for remedial purposes under the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  These appointments were made following the collection of information from schools.  The posts were then allocated on the basis of priority need, as indicated by the information collected.</P>
      <P>There were applications from more than 1,100 schools for these posts and, in all, 308 schools benefited from the allocation.  This included 20 schools in Dublin to which a total of 11 remedial posts were allocated in the current year. This brings to 1,033 the total number of remedial teachers operating in the primary school sector at present.  Of the 3,209 ordinary national schools in the country, 1,700 have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or shared basis.  As a result of the recent allocation of posts, 77 per cent of primary school pupils have access to remedial education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, all primary schools with enrolments above 362 pupils, which <Col N="1155" /> sought remedial service, have at least one remedial teacher and many smaller schools have the service on a shared basis.  This allows for a visit at least one day each week and in a remote rural community this is more than the allocation in the past.  Some 352 schools in Dublin now have access to the service and it embraces 94 per cent of primary schools in the area.  I take the Senator's point about CODAN areas and remedial services are available there.</P>
    <P>The school referred to by the Senator currently has the services of a full-time remedial teacher as well as a concessionary teacher under the disadvantaged scheme.  This means the teacher quota rate is one above that in schools outside the CODAN area.  The appointment of further remedial teachers will be kept under regular review as part of a broader commitment to provide a substantial number of additional remedial teachers in the coming years.  I assure the Senator that the needs of the school referred to will be taken into account in this context.</P>
    <P>The home-school-community liaison scheme was established in 1990 as a three year pilot project.  It is one of a number of initiatives aimed at addressing the problems of under-achievement and marginalisation of young people as well as poor participation in education in areas of socio-economic disadvantage.  I am satisfied the scheme has since proved its value and for this reason, I recently announced a decision to put the scheme on a formal footing which will allow us to extend it to other areas.</P>
    <P>At present there are 106 primary schools and 38 post primary schools in the scheme, embracing a total of 55,000 pupils.  This includes 27 primary schools and 12 post-primary schools newly included in the scheme in 1993.  The scheme now has a total of 98 locally based co-ordinators working under the direction of a national co-ordinator.  Each co-ordinator is responsible for an area and acts in support of local schools in establishing contact with parents, encouraging them to become involved in their children's <Col N="1156" /> education, organising locally based activities which contribute to closer contact between parents and teachers and establishing links with pre-school groups in an area.  A national steering committee, comprised of experts in this field, advises on the overall direction and focus of the scheme, it is being constantly monitored.  I received a positive response to the scheme and I welcome the Senator's comments in this regard.  The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to developing a nationwide service and additional posts were allocated in September.  I assure the House of my commitment to further developing this scheme.</P>
    <P>The case of the school in question will be fully considered.  I accept the urgency of the situation which caused the Senator to raise a supplementary question to the debate.  However, I came to the House without the information referred to by the Senator.  At present the school has a principal, 12 assistants, one ex-quota concessionary teacher and one full-time remedial teacher.  The school also has two special assistants responsible for a special class for travellers and mildly mentally handicapped pupils, an initiative welcomed by the Department.  Current enrolment at the school totals 353 pupils and I take the point about the required level of 362.  This matter will be kept under review and we will keep in constant touch with the principal.  I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for the opportunity to come to this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for dealing with this matter sympathetically. She also recognised the situation in the school and I am sure she will continue to do so.  I might raise the matter relating to the possible loss of a teacher with the Minister in the future.  I agree that remedial education should start with the class teacher.  If the school can retain that teacher, perhaps it will not look for a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 8 December 1993.</P>
