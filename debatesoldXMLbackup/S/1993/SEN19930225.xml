      <P>I have notice from Senator Daly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to outline the impact on farmers' incomes and on agricultural employment arising from the Common Agricultural Policy policy reforms now taking place and the main effects that these reforms will have on the agricultural industry in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have also received a notice from Senator Cassidy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to implement as a matter of urgency phase two of the development of the general hospital, Mullingar, County Westmeath.</P>
      <P>I have also received a notice from Senator Sherlock of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to confirm his commitment and that of the Government to the future of Irish Steel in view of pressure from the European Community to secure the closure of the Haulbowline plant as part of the <Col N="178" /> EC plans for rationalisation of the steel industry.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters which have been raised by Senators Daly, Cassidy and Sherlock as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Cassidy's and Senator Sherlock's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Daly may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take items 1, 2, 3 and 4 and all Stages of item 4; it is a money Bill and there is a 21 day stay on it.  At 4 p.m. we will have statements on the position of Digital.  The Minister has agreed to come to the House but he may be late, because the Dáil might be discussing the issue at 3.45 p.m. Therefore, the statements on Digital will take place as near to 4 p.m. as possible. We will have 15 minutes from the Minister and ten minutes from each Senator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank the Leader of the House for having arranged the statements on this matter of vital concern for this afternoon?  May I also raise the strike affecting many people working in this House?  I do not want to discuss the details as it would not be helpful at this stage but, I hope every effort is made to resolve this strike as speedily and as justly as possible.  Will the Leader of the House agree to a major debate on Northern Ireland next week?  The Tánaiste will be making a major statement on Northern Ireland in the Mansion House next week. He is entitled to do that but this House <Col N="179" /> would be an appropriate place to have the first major debate of this session of Dáil or Seanad on Northern Ireland. There are many new Senators who have particular insights on Northern Ireland &mdash; Senator Wilson, Senator Lee and others.  It would be helpful at this time of political vacuum in Northern Ireland, when there are no ongoing talks that can be jeopardised, that we have a full discussion on this most important national topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a correction to Item 2 on the Order Paper; the name of Senator Quinn should not have appeared on it.</P>
      <P>On the point raised by Senator Manning, I appeal to you, a Chathaoirligh, to intervene with the Ceann Comhairle on behalf of those members of staff who are on strike.  You will recall on the closing day of the last session all sides of the House praised their commitment and work.  We are all clear on that.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would be helpful to intervene publicly in an industrial relations dispute and I do not intend doing that but I appeal to you, a Chathaoirligh, to contact the Ceann Comhairle with a view to establishing some method of mediation for those people who are outside the gate at the moment.  That is no reflection on either Transcribers or Audio Typists.  They are given a job and they do it to the best of their ability.  There is a clear need that we show support for those people who have worked with us for so long, and I ask you to intervene with the purpose of estabishing some form of mediation.</P>
      <P>A list of legislation was circulated by the Leader of the House in recent days. This is very useful.  We on the Independent benches would appreciate some indication of the legislation to be initiated in this House so that we may do the necessary preparation work.  I ask that that be emphasised to the various Departments to ensure that we have enough notice to prepare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the request <Col N="180" /> that the Leader provides time for discussion on the problems in Northern Ireland.  For some time we have requested such an opportunity.  I also request an opportunity to discuss the International Fund for Ireland.  This is a valuable part of the support structure in the North and the sponsors of the fund are anxious to get a response, and the-most appropriate body to respond would be this House.  I ask the Leader of the House to consider providing time for the dicussion on the North and the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Manning and Senator O'Toole in seeking a resolution to the industrial dispute as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Manning in hoping that we can resolve the issue of the pickets outside.  Those people have worked diligently and industriously in this House and it is sad that they are outside.  We should do everything possible to have this dispute resolved and have them working again.  I also support Senator McGowan's proposal for a debate on the North and the cross-Border fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Have there been discussions within the Houses regarding this dispute?  It is appalling that the Government is prepared to spend money in other areas while allowing its own people to stay outside the door.  That is despicable. If the Governemnt is prepared to treat its own staff like that, what is it prepared to do to everybody else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole that it is not helpful to intervene in industrial disputes.  I have to declare an interest as I served on the national executive of that union for a number of years.  I would like to add my concern that staff who served this House well and loyally should be outside&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be making a comment on that before I ask the Leader to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="181" />
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader and the Whips to look at the possibility of providing time to discuss the many reports of Oireachtas joint committees which he on shelves collecting dust.  I would point out that today we will be discussing the National Stud.  In fact, an Oireachtas joint committee report was produced a year and a half ago on that issue and both Houses ignored it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It was discussed in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there was a formal debate on it.  I think it was raised, but not formally.  There is little point talking about Dáil reform when we have Oireachtas committees preparing reports which are not being discussed.  I ask that we give some time to that issue, and I can think of many fine reports we could valuably discuss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Leader any news for us regarding the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs?  I asked this last week but I understand that he might not have had any information at that point.  I would like to place that in the context of the fact, a Chathaoirligh, that you very properly permitted the House to stand in silence in memory of Nurse Place.  It is important that we have a forum where we can discuss, for example, the protection of Irish voluntary personnel in these international conflicts.</P>
      <P>I support what was said about the picket outside the House.  I understand that you intend making a statement on that and I will simply record my concern that a dispute should arise which inhibits the production of the record of this House.</P>
      <P>When will we have a major debate on the economy?  It would be particularly appropriate in the light of various developments, and not confined to the Digital computer company.  I hope that we will have a wide ranging debate on the economy, particularly in the light of the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Roche that there <Col N="182" /> are a number of important papers laid before the House which should be urgently examined.  I would ask the Leader of the House if there is any provision at the moment for taking some of the non-statutory reports, in particular the Second Commission on the Status of Women Report dated January 1993.  This is a very important document which is being widely discussed, and it would be regrettable if we did not have an opportunity to ventilate this very important report in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear there is a request to have an early debate on Northern Ireland.  I want that to happen and hope to contribute to it.  Next Wednesday was mentioned but that would present me with a problem, to say the least.  I have a long standing, early evening engagement in County Tyrone which would mean my leaving here not later than 4 p.m. and I am sure that the debate would not be finished by then. Thursday and the following Wednesday would not present a problem but if the debate were scheduled for next Wednesday I could not be here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree that the debate on Northern Ireland should be held on a day to accommodate Senator Wilson.  I am pleased, we have been given time to discuss Digital.  I am sure the Leader and the House will agree that it is a tragedy for the West and for the country in general.  If there are many Members offering on that debate, could the Leader be flexible on the time it concludes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with others in asking that talks be initiated as quickly as possible to resolve the dispute in the spirit of the code of practice on industrial relations disputes.  Would the Leader of the House consider changing the approach to Matters of Concern during the life of this Seanad?  I especially ask him if he would allow it to take place after the Order of Business and if he would initiate a procedure whereby we would get an early reply from the Minister. <Col N="183" /> At present it takes four to six weeks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is for another area of the House; the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House if he would introduce a system of early replies from the Minister?  I support Senator Roche's request that we debate reports of Oireachtas joint committees in the House.  Prior to the end of the last Seanad the Leader agreed to a debate on the report on Bord na gCon.  I ask him now if he will give us his views on whether the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should be invited to the House to discuss Bord na gCon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House whether he intends to find time at an early date to debate the economic challenges facing the country?  During the past few months when the Seanad was not sitting we had the currency crisis and devaluation and now the unemployment figures have reached a new high.  We cannot ignore these events.  The Seanad should debate these matters not just because it is important to show our interest but because we should concentrate on the future rather than on the past.  The constructive contributions that could be made in the Seanad would be of great benefit and I ask the Leader to consider that at an early opportunity, as Senator Norris has asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad a debate will take place today on the dreadful problems at Digital.  It was shocking to hear this morning of the loss of 800 jobs at that factory.  I suggest to the Leader that a debate should take place in this House which is not confined to the problem of Digital but to the totality of investment by the IDA in foreign companies or indeed their investment plans for the future.  It seems to many people that there is a need for a change in emphasis in employment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want a debate or speech on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to make a speech but I would like the Seanad to have an overall debate on the prospects for jobs being created by the IDA or under the Leader programme or any other scheme.  I also ask the Leader to have an early debate on international matters concerning the United Nations and their intervention in places where there are problems at present.  In this context there seems to be a conflict between intervention by the United Nations and unilateral or multilateral intervention by nations.  We must debate these matters; the Mogadishu issue is one thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lanigan, you are making a speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many such issues that could be debated and I would like the Seanad to take the initiative in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Leader will take that on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader if he would consider having a debate or a series of debates on issues affecting the European Community.  I refer in particular to the question of enlargement which is imminent and has profound implications for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>We must all sympathise with the people of Galway this morning on the announcement made a few moments ago that 800 jobs are to be lost at the Digital plant.  A statement has just been issued to the workers there.  It is a tragedy not alone for Galway but for the whole western region.  Will the Leader allow time in the near future for a debate on the semi-State sector?  I request such a debate for two reasons; first, there is our dependence on foreign industry and, secondly, the activities of semi-State companies in this country are being <Col N="185" /> reduced in order to make them commercially and financially viable but we have never taken into consideration the human cost involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week Senator Manning requested a debate on the economy and the Leader of the House said he would reply at the first available opportunity. There have been two other similar requests this morning from other Members.  I would have thought that the Leader, after having a week to reflect on the issue, would have told us this morning when time will be made available to have such a debate.  I ask him to do so in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, please excuse my lack of knowledge on this matter but perhaps you will give me some guidance.  My understanding is that the debate on the budget takes place in the Lower House and subsequently the Finance Bill is published.  I am anxious that we have a debate in this House prior to the publication of the Finance Bill because we are unable to make any real contribution in regard to amending the Finance Bill at that stage.  It is important that we have a broad-ranging discussion in this regard to see what changes, if any, we wish to propose in this House and what input we can make.  There is a range of views on this and valuable contributions could be made by this House. For instance, we could have some input in regard to the 1 per cent levy, to see if we could make any changes in a proposal of that nature.  This debate should take place as soon as possible, with the Minister and his officials present in the House. It is very important that they be present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before calling the Leader I wish to make two points.  One is in relation to the Order of Business. We have introduced reforms to streamline the Order of Business.  I have allowed some leeway today to help the new Senators but in the future on the Order of Business we will deal only with matters arising from the Order Paper of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senators have raised the <Col N="186" /> question of the audio typists' dispute.  I understand it is hoped that a third party mediator will be appointed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  I am sure Senators will understand I would prefer not to comment further at this stage.  I will keep the House fully informed of developments as they arise and, in regard to the point raised by Senator O'Toole, I will willingly talk to the Ceann Comhairle regarding the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased, a Chathaoirleach, that you have outlined the efforts being made with regard to the dispute.  I support all the comments made by Senators on the situation and I fully support mediation.</P>
      <P>I hope all Senators have received a copy of the Government's programme of legislation.  I hope in the next two weeks to have information on the Bills that will be dealt with in this session.  I said last week I would write to each Minister, the Taoiseach and the Chief Whip of each party to ask them to give due consideration to the initiation of legislation in this House.  I hope that will happen.  In regard to Northern Ireland I have written specifically to the Tánaiste to ask him to come to the House at the earliest opportunity to have a debate on Northern Ireland.  I hope he will respond positively to the suggestion.</P>
      <P>Thursday afternoons will be set aside for two hour debates on reports of Oireachtas joint committees.  Like Senator Quinn, I am very keen to have a debate as quickly as possible on the economy and perhaps the Whips will arrange today for such a debate next week or the week after.  With regard to committees, I understand announcements will be made quite soon on the matter.  In relation to Digital I am sure the Minister in question is anxious to be as accommodating as possible with regard to a debate.  I am sure that today the Whips will arrange a debate on that matter and will finalise details regarding speakers and so on.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Senator Liam Naughten be elected Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>I have great pleasure in proposing Senator Naughten as Leas-Chathaoirleach. I appreciate the decision of both Government parties to continue the tradition of electing the Leas-Chathaoirleach from the Opposition benches.  As I said last week, this House depends for its success on an element of good faith and co-operation and I view the decision of both Government parties as evidence of this and will respond accordingly.</P>
      <P>In proposing Senator Naughten I am proposing an experienced, fair minded, tolerant and good humoured politician. He was a good chairman in the last session and his integrity as a chairman, and indeed in all matters, was accepted by all sides.  He will continue to bring distinction to the office of Leas-Chathaoirleach and I commend him to the House with enthusiasm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Naughten for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach. As outgoing Leas-Chathaoirleach he showed an ability to administer the Standing Orders of this House fairly and firmly to all Members. He has shown equal competence to represent <Col N="188" /> the Seanad on various delegations outside this country.  He is a man of tremendous experience in public life.</P>
      <P>Each Senator must strive to make the Seanad more relevant.  Goodwill and flexibility are required between Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach, now as always, to enable the House to respond to national developments at once.</P>
      <P>It is in the best interests of this House that Senator Naughten is elected Leas-Chathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Senator Mary Henry be elected Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Manning I welcome the continuance of the tradition that the Leas-Chathaoirleach should be chosen from this side of the House, not necessarily from what is generally termed &ldquo;the Opposition&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The five Independent University Senators who regard themselves as &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; take that freedom seriously; from time to time, as a matter of individual conscience, we vote with the Government.  In urging that the Leas-Chathaoirleach be chosen from among the Independent University Members, I do not imply that we consider ourselves as Opposition.</P>
      <P>It is important that we have something more than tokenism with regard to the position of women in this country.  I raised on the Order of Business the question of the Second Report of the Commission on the Status of Women.  The person I am proposing today has had an honourable record in this regard.  It is notable that the named officers of both Houses are all male party members.  I have the honour and the pleasure to propose for the office of Leas-Chathaoirleach a distinguished female independent representative of the constituency of Dublin University, Senator Henry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the Leas-Chathaoirleach should on this occasion be independent, a woman and of the international distinction of Dr. Henry. Her record needs no great fanfare from <Col N="189" /> me.  She was a rival of mine in the recent election, and it did not gladden my heart when one of the members of the gymnasium I attend said, &ldquo;That is a wonderful woman, she got 15 major prizes in the university&rdquo;.  I was flattened by that and when I read her manifesto I realised that her 15 major prizes included the first non-foundation scholarship in the school of medicine.  This scholarship is a very important honour conferred on an undergraduate; one must achieve first place among the best in one's year in a special examination.  &ldquo;Non-foundation&rdquo; refers to the fact that she was a woman. Under the statutes of the college women were not allowed to be admitted to the foundation of the college but the honour was conferred as a non-foundation.  This is an historic achievement.</P>
    <P>With regard to her capacity to chair, I acknowledge that she is a new Member. She has shown, however, that she is well able to contribute, as she did upon her first day and I understand that she intends contributing on the National Stud (Amendment) Bill, 1993, this afternoon. She has chaired a variety of important national and international committees including the overseas committee of the Irish Red Cross.  She is also a member of the National Women's Talent Bank, which we should bear in mind in this House, and was a founder member of the Women's Political Association.  What better recommendation of qualifications could we have than this abbreviated summary of the distinctions of my colleague and friend, Senator Henry.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry will continue the honourable tradition of the independent benches of fluent Irish speakers.  In the last House as the Cathaoirleach will recall after certain re-arrangements of the university representation &mdash; I will not detail them further &mdash; we became the only all-Irish speaking section.  Senator Henry is a distinguished holder of the gold Fáinne, although she did indicate that she felt it might need polishing, which I am sure she will give it.  It is my pleasure to propose Senator Henry as Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
    <P>I attempted, after the last election, to propose as Leas-Chathaoirleach my distinguished <Col N="190" /> colleague, Senator Murphy, who exercised his option to withdraw at the last moment and said that he was not in favour of empty political gestures.  I do not regard this position as an empty political gesture.  It is most important for democracy that there should be a contest, even though the outcome of this vote is inevitable because of cosy party arrangements. We should ensure that somebody is really elected rather than simply carried in by popular acclaim.</P>
    <P>It is particularly important that we should face all the political parties with the option of giving some form of substance to their often-mouthed assents to equality for women, to equal representation, to making sure that women are included on State boards and so on. Here is a perfect opportunity of exercising their vote in order to implement all they speak about so glowingly in party manifestos.  I urge Senators in the spirit of independence to break ranks, and I address myself in particular to the Taoiseach's nominees who have the right to exercise the vote any way they please. This has happened in the past on one or two occasions and I urge them strongly to vote for Senator Henry.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats it gives me great pleasure to second the nomination of Senator Henry.  She is very capable and committed person who would carry out the duties of Leas-Chathaoirleach with great distinction.  Our party favours the representation of women at every level in the Oireachtas.  A precedent was set with the election of an excellent Cathaoirleach, Mrs. Tras Honan.  Unfortunately, she was not re-elected and will be sadly missed in this House.  This Government as Senator Norris said say they are committed in their Programme for Government to equality and have, for the first time, appointed a Minister for Equality.</P>
      <P>I ask the Government benches to show that they are so committed by supporting Senator Henry's nomination today.</P>

      <P>On the issue of nominations <Col N="191" /> for Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad both candidates are equally good candidates.  I have not experienced Senator Naughten chairing the Seanad in the past because I am a new Member of this House as are a substantial number of Senators, whom, I hope, will revitalise the Seanad and change the image to a great extent.  On this occasion I will be supporting the nomination of Senator Henry for the reason stated by other speakers.  We are aware of the great impact made in recent years by mná na hÉireann and the great leadership they have given.  The Seanad should avail of this opportunity to show its recognition of that by supporting the nomination of Senator Henry.</P>

      <P>That would have dition in this House that the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach has gone to an member of the Opposition.  Our party's view is that this has a positive effect on the transaction of the business of the Seanad.  It promotes a co-operative and constructive approach and we will be adhering to that tradition, as has been said already by Senator Manning.  We have no intention of taking the position simply because we might have the political muscle in the Government to do so. The Opposition has presented us with two admirable candidates in Senator Naughten and Senator Henry.</P>

      <P>There might be a certain high spirited mischief behind the proposals to nominate Senator Henry in so far as the Fine Gael Party is in the stronger numerical position on the Opposition benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry has a very fine record of radical campaigning on progressive issues.  I have also battled on many of those issues, and would agree with her on many of them.  She would probably have a better chance to battle on those issues in future from the floor of the House than from the impartial position <Col N="192" /> of the Chair.  I am sure she will contribute in a positive way in this House, whether she is elected to the Chair.  Our party will not be voting on the issue; we will be leaving it to the Opposition benches to make the decision.  They are both fine candidates.</P>
    <P>May I answer the suggestion that in not voting today we may, in some way, not be supporting women in positions of power?  In my party I have been chosen as Leader in the Seanad and I do not think we can be accused of not taking a stand in promoting women to positions of power in this House.</P>
    <P>If the Independents, Democratic Left and Progressive Democrat Members were serious in having a women elected to the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach, perhaps the very able and experienced member of Fine Gael, Senator Taylor-Quinn, might have been a unanimous choice of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Henry <Col N="193" /> would make an excellent Leas-Chathaoirleach. I have come to know her in the past week but all I have heard and read of her suggests that she would do an excellent job.</P>
      <P>While I would welcome a woman in the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach, I do not agree with the idea of having a contest for the position.  I support the tradition, that this House has had for many years, of having the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Cathaoirleach shared between the Government and what appears to be the main non-Government party.  That tradition reflects the kind of co-operative approach I would like to see built on in our future deliberations.  I would not like to see that eroded in any way.  I look on that tradition not as a cosy arrangement, as has sometimes been suggested, between the parties, but as a very useful symbol, a message to send to the outside world that the Seanad is a different kind of place and, with its own way of doing things, it is a small bridge that crosses the gulf in our deliberations.</P>
      <P>I am not in agreement with my colleagues on this matter.  I am making the point publicly because I want to lay down a very clear marker about how I see the grouping of Independent Senators.  The grouping is, in my opinion, a technical matter and one which we require to have the right to debate in order.  However, just as Independent Senators are independent of political parties, we are also independent of each other.  It is important that we stay that way if we are to remain Independent.  It is appropriate for party members to be bound by the Whip and they should be bound by the will of the majority in their party, but for Independent members to follow that approach however, would be a travesty of the word &ldquo;independence&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It is also important to create within a democracy a sense of choice.  That sense of choice is being offered today.  Supporting the candidacy of Senator Henry in no way reflects on the exceptional chairing by the outgoing Leas-Chathaoirleach who is being proposed now by the Fine Gael Party.  He would see that point better than most.  It is important that the record be kept and on the return of all the staff, to normal working I look forward to a written record this day week.  I urge my colleagues on all sides of the House to give their full support to Senator Henry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended speaking on this matter but I would not wish that my vote be characterised as sexist in any way.  We have two proposed candidates, Senator Naughten and Senator Henry, each excellent in their own right. <Col N="195" /> The issues as to who should be Leas-Chathaoirleach should not be dealt with in terms of gender.  It would, for example, be convenient for members of my party to also abstain on the vote and let the opposite side of the House decide this matter between them.  Perhaps it would be better if the combined Opposition decided among themselves who should be Leas-Chathaoirleach.  It is important for that position to be filled from the opposite side of the House.</P>
      <P>The issue I would consider when making my decision is not one of gender, but of experience.  I have no doubt about the extraordinary capacity of Senator Henry and her great academic achievements. If this were an issue to be decided on the basis of academic achievements there is no doubt where the vote would go.  It is a valid point to make that the Chair requires considerable experience in the operations and may I say, the idiosyncrasies of this House.  Experience must play a role here if progress is to be made.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris, whom I would never describe as mischevious suggested that we could have a rotating Leas-Chathaoirleach. Perhaps that would be worth considering in the future.  It is a novel suggestion and I am sure it is also a serious one.  I hope Senator O'Toole's suggestion that we should simply make this decision as a gesture is not serious.  I do not believe this has any merit.  The position is an important one.  We should weigh the merits of both excellent candidates and reach a decision on the basis of objective criteria, and not simply on the basis of a gesture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I congratulate the Seanad on electing Senator Naughten as Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>Today's business relates to the Irish National Stud.  It is asking the Seanad to allow the borrowing capacity of the National Stud and its share capital to be increased.  This matter was debated in the Dáil two weeks ago and the Members there were very constructive and helpful and the Bill was passed unanimously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish National Stud is located at Tully, County Kildare, at the Curragh on 800 acres of land.  It is in State ownership since 1945 and was set up originally to operate schemes for the improvement of <Col N="199" /> the thoroughbred horse industry.  The Stud's main method of operation is to improve available blood lines by providing the services of high-class quality stallions to as wide a range of breeders as possible.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the Seanad proposes to amend the National Stud Acts, 1945 and 1976, by increasing the National Stud's borrowing powers from £0.5 million to £5 million and its share capital from £5 million to £10 million.  These financial provisions are purely enabling ones.  The power to borrow is subject to the consent of the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Finance. The increased share capital will be issued, when considered appropriate, by these two Ministers.  To date the State has purchased all but £24,000 of the £5 million in share capital which is authorised under existing legislation.  The last purchase of 800,000 shares of £1 each was by the Minister for Finance in December last year.  The Bill also provides a technical provision concerning the control of staff pay.</P>
    <P>The Stud is now 47 years old and has been central to the development of the thoroughbred industry during that time. While the core activity of the Stud is, of course, the breeding of thoroughbred horses, we should not forget that it is not simply a working stud farm.  It provides training for the stud managers of the future in addition to hosting thousands of overseas visitors each year.</P>
    <P>One of the major successes of the Stud in the recent years is its horse breeding training course.  This course has been in operation for 20 years and caters for 25 to 30 students each year.  It is recognised worldwide as the best of its type.  Graduates of the stud manager courses manage some of the largest studs in the world including the British National Stud and Wyndham Farms in Canada which was the home of Northern Dancer for a good number of years.  Indeed course graduates were responsible for training winners on three continents during 1992.</P>
    <P>Given the excellence of the course and the esteem in which the Irish National <Col N="200" /> Stud is held worldwide, it is no surprise that it is virtually unknown for a graduate to fail to find employment.  I am sure that Members of the House will agree that this is no small achievement in the present environment of high unemployment.  It is even more remarkable when one considers that it is operated without a subsidy of any kind and without assistance from the State.</P>
    <P>The Horse Museum and the Japanese Gardens at the Stud are well established tourist attractions with over 80,000 paying visitors annually.  This activity has been turned into a profit maker in recent years and is capable of further significant development.  The general facilities at the Stud are not adequate, however, to cope with an increased throughput of visitors. A new visitors centre, costing in the region of £600,000, is under construction and is scheduled to open at Easter this year.  This centre will be capable of servicing the projected increase in tourists by providing the ambience demanded by discerning visitors.  The centre will incorporate a ticket office, restaurant, souvenir shops, toilet and washroom facilities.  It will provide an appropriate backup to the unique and celebrated Japanese Gardens.</P>
    <P>The Irish Horse Museum within the Stud grounds was established in 1977. The Museum, featuring the skeleton of the great Arkle, traces the evolution of the Irish horse from pre-historic to modern times.  I was asked in the Dáil if it would be possible to include the skeleton of Shergar, if he could be found, and we are working on that.  Included in the museum are exhibits of folk life, transport, racing, hunting and showjumping. The existing building is rather cramped and plans for a new building are under consideration.  There are plans to extend the range of activities in the museum and to have videos and brochures of various kinds featuring famous personalities of the Irish thoroughbred and racing industry over the years and many famous horses too.  The visitors centre, Japanese Gardens and museum are complemented by the development of a walking trail through the general <Col N="201" /> Stud grounds where visitors can view horses in paddocks at all times.</P>
    <P>The farm activities at the National Stud are an essential part of and provide vital support for the core study activity.  Of primary importance here is grassland management, geared to supporting the horses in the Stud.  In this regard the primary non-bloodstock farm activity is the production of beef cattle.  The system of farming was altered in 1991 to a more intensive one than had been practised previously.  This switch in activity led to losses being recorded in 1991.  However, I understand that the final accounts for 1992 will show a return to profit on the farm.  Current cattle prices should help ensure a profit situation is recorded also in 1993.  The board is examining the farm activities carefully and may make further changes this year.  Indeed it would be difficult not to make a profit in the current buoyant farming situation.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, the central activity of the Stud is and will remain the breeding of thoroughbred horses.  Considerable losses have been incurred in this area in recent years.  The industry worldwide is going through a major recession with consequential substantial falls in the prices being paid for thoroughbreds and nomination fees being commanded by stallions at stud.</P>
    <P>The net nomination fee income earned by the Stud has fallen from £1.2 million in 1987 to almost £250,000 in 1991.  It is clear that when this fall in income is set against a more or less static cost base, substantial losses were inevitable.</P>
    <P>We are now faced with the question of what we should do about the situation. Currently the Stud has seven stallions standing, considerably fewer than the maximum number the Stud is capable of accommodating.  The realistic alternatives are to provide the Stud with new equity to enable it to purchase additional quality stallions and earn more fee income or to close down the Stud entirely.  In all my discussions regarding the future of the Stud no one has suggested that it should be closed.  It is widely regarded as a major national asset well worth preserving.  It is widely recognised <Col N="202" /> that it has contributed significantly to the improvement of the thoroughbred sector and that under reasonable conditions it has the potential to do so again.</P>
    <P>While the breeding of thoroughbreds is a specialised activity it is primarily a farm-based enterprise in this country.  I regard this as one of the basic strengths of our thoroughbred breeding sector. Breeding activity is characterised by the relatively large number of breeders with just a few brood mares.  Obviously the brood mares are normally used to supplement the farm income achieved from more conventional farm activities.  Most of these small breeders are involved in the business of producing foals or yearlings for the annual sales.</P>
    <P>The National Stud exists in the first instance to meet the demands of these breeders for high-class stallions at reasonable fees.  Given the structure of the thoroughbred breeding sector the rationale for the Stud's continued operation is clear.  The logic underpinning the need for the Stud is as valid today as it was when it was originally established.</P>
    <P>The Stud must now look to the future and I, as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, will do my utmost to secure its future.  The recession in the industry can hopefully be turned to advantage through the purchase of additional stallions at the lower prices now prevailing.</P>
    <P>The current limits of £5 million in share capital and £0.5 million in borrowing powers are clearly inadequate and it is difficult to see how the Stud can resume its former role in thoroughbred breeding within these constraints.  The Bill before us today provides a more relevant framework for the Stud.  This will allow the State to provide greater share capital for the purchase of the quality stallions required.  The borrowing facility will allow the Stud to move quickly once suitable stallions are available.</P>
    <P>I received the board's five year programme last year and I have asked them to update it with a view to restructuring the Stud's activities in the most cost effective way.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to commend this Bill to <Col N="203" /> the House as it will put the Irish National Stud on a sound footing.  It will be a vote of confidence in the Stud, in its activities, in the chairman and in the board of directors. I have the utmost confidence in the chairman and the board to turn the Stud's activities around.  They have already started on that programme.</P>
    <P>It is also a vote of confidence in the thoroughbred industry.  It is not widely appreciated that the Irish horse industry directly employs a substantial number of people, 12,500, in stables and training, in bookies' offices, in ancillary activities; at racecourses and on stud farms.  The thoroughbred industry is one in which the Irish can compete at the highest level internationally.  It enhances the position of Ireland beyond the bloodstock industry itself.  As well as the 12,500 people directly employed, about the same number benefit indirectly from the thoroughbred industry, including the small farmers with one or two brood mares and various other people.  It is a major contributor to our tourist industry with regional meetings which many people attend and I would hope many more of them will go racing in the future.</P>
    <P>From the employment and the economic points of view, the bloodstock industry is an important and positive industry.  I want to express my thanks to the people who have given us this fine industry.  The National Stud will continue to contribute in a major way, as it has done in the past.  It has stood international class stallions over the years, including Lord Gayle, Salus, Ahonoora, African Sky and Crash Course.  In fact, during the Dáil debate on this Bill, Jodami was tipped to win the Hennessey Cognac Gold Cup and, of course, Jodami was out of Crash Course; I wonder if we will get any tips this weekend in the Upper House.  I look forward to what you have to say.</P>
    <P>As well as its immediate activity, the Stud, from time to time, has had a horse in training to run in the President's colours. It has had some good ones like Seskin Bridge and Giollamar and there is a nice bluewin filly in training with <Col N="204" /> Michael Grassick at the moment which, hopefully, will run this summer in the President's colours.  It would be of great importance to the Stud and to the industry if we could come up with a winner or two in the President's colours.</P>
    <P>For all those good reasons I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill which I welcome.  Something should have been done three to four years ago as far as the National Stud is concerned. However, we are here now and we should do our best.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and it is my intention to raise agricultural matters in the Seanad while I am a Member.  I have great respect for the Minister, but I cannot share his view of the great wealth in agriculture.  There are many difficulties there as the Minister must accept and over the years perhaps they will be sorted out.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Second Stage of the Bill is being taken today and that we will have a chance to put down amendments, which I intend to do on either the Committee or Report Stage.  I welcome that because, when the debate was mentioned, I was told all Stages would be taken by one o'clock today and that would be a bad start to this session.  We are here to debate issues and we cannot debate all Stages of any Bill in two hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish National Stud has served Irish bloodstock breeders well over the years, despite the fact that it has been hamstrung by virtue of its semi-State structure.  This has meant that inadequate resources have been provided to allow the Stud to compete on an equal footing with the well funded studs such as Coolmore. The reluctance of successive Governments &mdash; I am not blaming just this Government &mdash; to provide realistic financial backing to the National Stud forced the sale of many a good stallion, and in particular forced the sale of Ahonoora.  This sire, thankfully, remained in Ireland but his earning <Col N="205" /> power was lost to the National Stud because of the shortage of cash.</P>
    <P>The National Stud should not be in a position where its good judgment in purchasing an ultimately successful stallion results in it having to be sold because of Government reluctance to provide adequate funding.  I, therefore, warmly welcome this Bill which is designed to put the National Stud on a more realistic financial base.  In terms of competing with the private sector, the National Stud is constrained to a certain extent by the absence of flexibility in the labour costs associated with running what is a seasonal business.  As a State owned enterprise this inevitably results in substantial extra labour costs which do not necessarily arise in the private sector where flexibility by staff is an accepted norm.</P>
    <P>Flexibility is a vital ingredient in a business where trends in economies in other countries can severely affect the demand for bloodstock.  Perhaps in this regard an element of privatisation could be considered at the National Stud.  The Minister, in his speeches to the Dáil and Seanad, never mentioned privatisation of any kind and I would like to hear if he has given any consideration to privatisation in respect of the National Stud.</P>
    <P>The Stud through its excellent training programme has produced many highly qualified people with capacity to operate stud farms.  I would like to see a situation provided at the National Stud where skilled professionals, without their own stud farms, could rent facilities at the Stud and even permit the standing of privately owned stallions when there would not be a full roster of stallions available.  This is nothing new in other breeding stations.  The Dublin District Milk Board operate the same system with bulls rather than stallions.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to these ideas.</P>
    <P>The board of the National Stud should be concerned to make the maximum return from the valuable State asset at Tully.  In this regard a flexible approach could result in increased earnings and a bottom line performance which needs to be greatly improved.  I am not casting aspersions on anybody when I make that <Col N="206" /> statement.  The current board is well balanced and its chairman, David Shoebottom, I believe the Government made a good choice.  We need financial experts in all State bodies and his combination of financial ability and knowledge of the horse industry, as a breeder and owner, ensures that the National Stud has an admirably qualified person to guide the Stud to new levels of performance.</P>
    <P>The National Stud, in common of all elements of the breeding sector, would benefit considerably from any boost in the racing sector.  The health of the racing sector very much determines the demand for bloodstock and their value.  It is, therefore, of the utmost importance to the National Stud and to the entire bloodstock industry that the proposed national authority for racing be brought into existence without delay.</P>
    <P>The racing industry with its considerable potential for providing jobs has been ill served in the past by the absence of a dynamic and co-ordinated development agency.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, has a unique opportunity to provide the racing and breeding sector with the structure necessary to maximise opportunities from one of our most important indigenous industries.</P>
    <P>A large number of people are employed in the horse industry and, coming from Wexford, I clearly understand that situation.  County Wexford is one of Ireland's most important and successful producers of quality horses and horsemen.  Indeed, the country's leading horse trainer, Jim Bolger, is Wexford bred and he has most of his horses in Clonroche in County Wexford.  He is making a major contribution to Irish racing both as a most successful trainer and as a member of the Racing Board.</P>
    <P>Earnings from thoroughbred breeding are important to County Wexford and the National Stud is needed to meet the requirements of smaller breeders for quality stallions at reasonable fees.</P>
    <P>I will comment on two areas of the Minister's speech.  I welcome the worthwhile improvements due to take place at <Col N="207" /> the museum at the National Stud.  I am glad to see that £600,000 is to be spent modernising and updating the museum.  As a tourist attraction it could be a valuable asset for the National Stud.</P>
    <P>Stud fees stood at £1.2 million in 1987 and £234,000 in 1991.  There is something wrong here.  At present there are only seven stallions standing at the Stud. There must have been a greater number of stallions standing in 1987 than in 1991 if stud fees have decreased to such on extent.  An explanation is required.</P>
    <P>I strongly support this Bill and look forward to a significant contribution to the development of the Irish bloodstock sector and the strengthening of the National Stud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his reappointment as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  It is appropriate that he is present today because I usually meet him when I attend race meetings.  I do not know whether I have ever received a winning tip from him, but he supports horse racing and it is appropriate that he should introduce this Bill.</P>
      <P>Horse racing and breeding have for many years formed an important part of Irish life.  Racing provides an ideal leisure activity for many people.  It can be regarded as a family activity enjoyed in a healthy and natural environment. There is also room for the armchair enthusiast, whether at home in front of the television or in the betting shop. Although I rarely frequent betting shops I enjoy watching racing on television and I compliment television stations on their coverage of horse racing in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Despite the difficult economic conditions prevailing last year, attendances at race meetings and betting on the tote held up well.  Attendance rose by 3 per cent and stood at 1.053 million people. This was the sixth consecutive year in which attendance topped the one million mark.  Tote betting also increased by 3 per cent in 1992, an indication of the popularity of horse racing in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Stud Company Limited <Col N="208" /> was set up under the National Stud Act, 1945 to lease land from the Minister for Agriculture to continue the business of stud farming and horse breeding.  This Act gave the Stud the power to set up and operate schemes for the improvement of thoroughbred breeding.  The Stud's main method of operation was to improve available blood lines by providing the services of high class stallions to as wide a range of breeders as possible.</P>
    <P>In addition to its core stallion and thoroughbred breeding business, the National Stud is involved in a wide range of activities including farming tourism and the training of personnel for the bloodstock sector.  The Stud and the Japanese Gardens at Tully are well established tourist attractions with over 80,000 paying visitors annually.  These activities have generated profits in recent years and there is potential for further development.</P>
    <P>The Stud organises a horse breeding training course for 25 to 30 people each spring.  This course, now in operation for over 20 years, is recognised within the blookstock industry as the best of its type in the world.  Graduates of the course manage some of the best stud farms in the world and trained winners in three continents last year.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to empower the National Stud to increase its borrowing and its share value to ensure that the Stud remains viable.  The merging of a small number of highly professional stallion studs over the last 20 years has led to doubts about the continued necessity for a National Stud.  It is important that the Stud remain viable and competitive to service breeders in the long term.  The Killanin report, 1986 was also of this view.</P>
    <P>In recent years major changes have taken place in the equine industry in relation to thoroughbred and sport horses.  Thoroughbred breeding has gone through a difficult phase because of worldwide recession.  Stallion fees and prices fetched by young racehorses have dropped considerably.  While the sport horse business has been affected, the disciplines of showjumping, eventing and <Col N="209" /> dressage have continued to increase in popularity.</P>
    <P>Ireland has always been famous for thoroughbred and sport horses but in recent years the sport horse section of the industry has not been as prominent as heretofore because of major advances in pedigree research and horse performance in Germany, Holland, Belgium and France.  Ireland has lagged behind in these areas.  It is now accepted by all that change is necessary to enable Irish horses and competitors to reach international performance standards.  To achieve this the Government has appointed an interim horse board and some innovative thinking has emanated from this.</P>
    <P>The University of Limerick has introduced major innovative equine programmes and projects at the college.  At present the University is researching the performances of the Limerick Lady and two and three year old filly champions at Limerick shows.  Their performances over a number of years will be recorded and made available so that best breeding lines can be recorded, identified and developed.</P>
    <P>The university plans to develop a commercial computer sport horse database which will make available to Irish breeders and buyers information on the combined pedigree and performance of all Irish sport horses.  All necessary information is available to breeders of cattle, especially on pedigrees.  Similar information is necessary in the equine industry.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 20,000 owners and breeders of sport horses in Ireland.  The sport horse data base which will be developed at the Equine Research Centre at the University of Limerick will supply much needed information to owners and breeders.  Money will be required to develop these and other projects and the college is fund raising for part of the cost.</P>
    <P>Another research project planned for the university is an exercise in physiology study to record and analyse thoroughbred performances during training. Heart-rates and other physiological fitness indicators will be monitored so that <Col N="210" /> more effective training schedules can be planned.  The identification of talent in both horse and rider will take place at some future date.  The university hopes that the stallion genetic index programme will be awarded to the college.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the educational programme at the National Stud. We lack adequate education for those involved in the equine industry.  There are wonderful educational opportunities, both vocational and academic available for those in agriculture.  Courses are available in vocational schools and others are organised by Teagasc.  Prospective farmers should always complete a certificate in agriculture.  Until recently no academic qualifications were necessary or available in the equine industry which has served Ireland well at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>The University of Limerick must be congratulated on its initiative in introducing a Bachelor of Equine Science degree, the first of its kind in Europe. We live in a competitive world and we need to make a greater input than heretofore into education programmes for the development of the equine industry. Such an education programme is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The University of Limerick will help to provide education opportunities currently not available in the equine industry. Horsemanship was learned traditionally through intuition, handed down from generation to generation, with hardly any formal schooling. Specialised degrees or diplomas did not exist.  This omission was identified by Lord Killanin in a major investigation in the mid-1980s in which he concluded that there was little formal training in the racing industry: most of those involved learned through their family involvement with racing or because they came from rural areas where racehorses were trained and bred.</P>
    <P>A survey conducted in 1985 or 1986 confirmed Lord Killanin's finding that the standard of equine education was low. That survey prompted the University of Limerick to introduce the Bachelor of Equine Science degree.  It is a four year <Col N="211" /> course and of the 36 pupils enrolled 15 are from urban areas, 11 from equine backgrounds and ten from farming backgrounds. This degree course enables people from urban areas to train in horse breeding and in equine matters, generally.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention in praising the University of Limerick to take from the National Stud, which has served the equine industry well and must be placed on a sound footing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I support this important Bill.</P>
      <P>The Culliton report urged us to pay particular attention to our indigenous industries and today's events in Galway bear out the wisdom of that advice.  Perhaps, because horse breeding is located in different areas throughout the country, its national importance is not recognised. I am glad the Minister revealed the number of direct jobs in the industry &mdash; there is also an enormous number of indirect jobs.  The equine industry is more important to Ireland than to any other European country because the horses to humans ratio is higher here than elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The promotion of the Irish horse breeding industry has been ably done by the National Stud and it is essential that the Stud receives the money proposed in this Bill.  Things have changed enormously since 1976 when the last financial levels were set.  The Stud does incredible work.  The availability of good flat racing stallions and national hunt stallions at many commercial studs does not affect the value of the National Stud.</P>
      <P>Important services provided by the Stud exclusively include the training programmes and in particular the farrier programme, which is an essential part of the Irish equine industry.  Without the training course in the National Stud with a master farrier, the equine industry would be in a difficult position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The visitors centre is also a big money maker and a great show place for international visitors.  I have seen the new <Col N="212" /> centre which is being erected and I am sure it will be well used.  I would like to make a suggestion regarding the Irish horses shown at the centre.  I have visited the French national stud in Harras-lesPins. There they have Percherons &mdash; a French native horse &mdash; a well as racehorses. Would it be possible for the Stud to include some Irish draught mares and Connemara ponies to allow visitors to see other native Irish horses?</P>
    <P>I wish to comment briefly on &mdash; and Senator Rory Kiely also mentioned this &mdash; the position of the sport horse.  While the success of flat racing and the national hunt has declined the situation of the sport horse has continued to improve. The Killanin report recommended that the Stud become involved in non-thoroughbred breeding.  If it did, it might assume a leading position in the sale of sport horses, internationally, where Ireland is doing well.  I find it disappointing that so many Irish bred foreign owned horses do much better at international sport horse competitions than Irish owned horses.  I am not sure whether that is because owners here do not have the money to buy potentially good horses, fail to recognise potential or lack adequate training facilities.  Certainly, Irish sport horses are doing extremely well and I hope the Minister will consider using the National Stud to help Irish owners of sport horses.  I know that the report of the joint committee chaired by Senator Roche a few years ago, was not enthusiastic about this idea. However, in view of the decline in flat racing, in particular, and there is no immediate sign of recovery; Arab interests lie elsewhere now &mdash; perhaps, it is an area the Stud should concentrate on.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on the situation regarding the Kildare by-pass. I do not think any decision has been made, but if the by-pass goes through the Stud farm, it will entail not only the loss of farming land, but also the break-up of the various stud areas.  I hope this will not happen.  Perhaps the Kildare by-pass should be considered as part of the overall <Col N="213" /> plan for a south-bound motorway rather than as a by-pass of Kildare town only.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Finneran)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a sign of inexperience and I apologise.  The Minister said of the National Stud, and I quote: &ldquo;It is widely regarded as a major national asset well worth preserving&rdquo;.  In the final part of his speech to the Dáil he said: &ldquo;I believe that the Bill before the Members today is necessary if the Irish National Stud is to have the financial flexibility necessary to enable it to continue to deliver access to international quality stallions to small breeders at affordable rates&rdquo;.  The two terms I draw attention to there are &ldquo;small breeders&rdquo; and &ldquo;affordable rates&rdquo;.  The suggestion by Senator D'Arcy that the National Stud should be privatised flies in the face of the sentiment that international quality stallions should be made available to small breeders.</P>
      <P>I would like to stress the importance of horse breeding and of the horse industry generally, particularly in rural Ireland. In County Limerick where I come from many stud farms operate on a small scale. They may not hit the headlines or become well known but they are an important part of the rural landscape.  They provide alternative employment for many small farmers and the larger studs are a valuable source of employment for jockeys, grooms and they help the local economy. Many of the stud farms provide over ten times the amount of employment that the same acreage would provide, if used for dairy farming, cattle or tillage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish horse industry is important to our tourist trade.  Many tourists come to Ireland to go racing or hunting and to engage in equestrian sports.  This is an important aspect of an economy, particularly <Col N="214" /> in a rural area that is trying to encourage tourism.  Continental tourists find Irish horses are more tame and easier to manage and French and German tourists often have an enjoyable holiday here.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely has already emphasised the importance the University of Limerick has given to the equine industry by the foundation of a Bachelor of Equine Science.  This should not be seen as being opposed to the activities of the National Stud.  It should be seen as an adjunct to it, carrying on the work already done in the National Stud by providing a scientific base for the training of stud farm managers. I am a frequent visitor to the Japenese Gardens and the National Stud and I think they are well worth visiting.  They are assets of which we can be proud and which we should promote wherever possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  His contributions to the Seanad during the last session were helpful and I am glad to see that he has retained his portfolio.</P>
      <P>This is a very important matter.  At the outset, I must declare a vested interest because I happen to be one of those unfortunate people who has owned one of these animals.  It was not a stallion but a mare and I bred from the mare.  An interest in horses can become addictive, with some unfortunate results; at this stage, I have overcome my addiction. The other interest I should declare is that I was nominated to contest the election by the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association.  In the spirit of the new openness in Government, it is important that we put these matters on the record of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Stud is an important national asset.  I live a short distance from it and I am aware of its work over a number of years.  In my view, it has three important functions.  First it is a working stud providing good stallions for breeding to the industry.  Secondly, it is a tourist amenity.  The Japanese Gardens attract 110,000 visitors a year.  It is a very important tourist attraction for County Kildare, it is an important amenity for Kildare <Col N="215" /> town and it brings a lot of business to the town.</P>
    <P>The third dimension of the National Stud is its farming activity.  Some of the figures available from the 1991 report make for sorry reading.  The Stud's performance over the past few years has been disappointing.  It is engaged in a competitive industry and many stud farms are finding the going extremely tough at the moment.  The importance of the industry nationally is spelled out in the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored bodies the first report on the National Stud.  It is on the record and everybody is aware of the value of the industry to the country.  In Kildare there are 136 stud farms covering 27,000 acres and there are over 5,500 people either directly or indirectly involved in the industry.  It is of huge importance to the county.</P>
    <P>In many ways, it is a flagship for Ireland.  If one asks people around the world what they associate with Ireland, many would say good horses produced on good stud farms with good grass but we have reached the point where anybody who goes to Goffs or Tattersalls is aware of how difficult it is to produce foals profitably.  The pre-Christmas sale in Goffs was a disaster.  I had an animal there and I was fortunate enough to sell it but I saw people leaving Goffs crying because they had invested so much in the business and were getting a meagre return.</P>
    <P>The Stud is definitely worthy of our support.  In 1987 there was a net profit of £134,500 and in each of the subsequent years there was a loss, beginning in 1988 with £429,000 and increasing to £786,000 in 1991.  That must raise questions about the way the business is being managed.  I am aware of the dedication of the staff in the National Stud.  They work extremely hard and are good people who know their business but the Stud is facing a difficult time.  Its assets have decreased from £12 million in 1987 to £5 million in 1991.  It is accepted that the State has a responsibility to invest in this business but I wonder about the stallions standing at <Col N="216" /> the Stud.  I accept the remit that the Stud should have to provide good quality, reasonably priced stallions to the smaller breeder, but it can also look profitably at the upper end of the market.  At the moment that seems to operate through syndication.  I wonder whether the National Stud should be involved in syndication with private stud farms and other stallion owners and be totally involved in the industry.  Syndication is a standard practice and perhaps the National Stud should go down that road now.  I hope the Minister will address this in his reply.</P>
    <P>We need the mix of good stallions.  We all think of the five or six furlong sprinter or the potential Derby winner but the racing industry is based on the owner with one or two horses who is concentrating on a mile or a mile and a half and will subsequently go onto hurdles and maybe chasing.  That is the side of the business that is neglected.  It is all right for the Maktoums, the sheikhs and others but for those who want to be involved in the sport, it is an expensive hobby.  Nevertheless, without these ordinary owners, who seem to be decreasing in numbers, I wonder how viable the racing industry can remain.  The recession has affected stud farms and breeding.  The reverse of that coin is that there is value for those who have the money and are prepared to invest.  Some stallions are breeding far too many mares.  The foals are coming on the market and they cannot be sold. Consequently, there is a degree of oversupply in the industry.</P>
    <P>The Japanese Gardens have enormous potential to generate income.  If anybody from abroad comes to County Kildare and wants to go somewhere, six out of ten people in Kildare will bring them to National Stud and the Japanese Gardens. The National Stud is well known.  It is a huge resource and could be exploited to better effect.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the matter raised by Senator Henry, that is, the potential effect of the motorway by-pass.  I realise this matter is not within the Minister's remit but I assure him that the motorway by-pass is a matter of controversy within the town of Kildare.  It is proposed by <Col N="217" /> Kildare County Council to bring the bypass through the National Stud.  There are three different routes but the preferred route goes through the middle of the National Stud.  That is regrettable but when you look at the geography of the area it is difficult to see an alternative.</P>
    <P>The big worry of the people in the town of Kildare is that the design of the motorway is going to bring all the tourist traffic to the Japanese Gardens and away from the town.  They are extremely worried, and they are right to be worried. They have made numerous representations to Kildare County Council, all of which have been rejected.  I wonder about the extent to which the rights of local communities are attended in this age of subsidiarity.  There does not appear to be any sympathy for their side or any understanding of their cause.  It is regrettable that the motorway should bisect a stud of this quality and of such international standing and it definitely will not be to its advantage.  However, it is difficult to see an alternative to the route proposed.</P>
    <P>I am a farmer in County Kildare and I cannot understand how a farm of this size can show the sort of losses that it has shown.  I realise that there are difficulties in the cattle trade and that there are difficulties in farming in general but if anybody were given a farm of this size in this location &mdash; given that it operates Barrettstown House as well &mdash; they would expect to make money out of it. The whole question of farming needs to be looked at.  It strikes me as odd that there is no one with professional agricultural expertise on the board of the National Stud.  I realise that people who own stud farms also know a bit about farming but my experience is that they would much prefer that someone else put the cattle on their land, that they pay them a fee and they do not want to be bothered about it.  The National Stud should consider appointing to the board somebody with a qualification in agriculture or a practising farmer of known quality and expertise.  That would be a step in the right direction.  I do not mean to suggest that the present members of <Col N="218" /> the board are in any way deficient.  I would not begin to suggest that and the Minister knows it.</P>
    <P>I believe the National Stud might consider syndication.  I am not in favour of privatisation because I do not think it is the road to go.  The Stud has a particular role within the national bloodstock industry. It can fulfil that role if it is given the necessary resources and if it is managed properly but it needs to involve itself more fully in the industry.  For instance, if you go to most race meetings you will find races sponsored by Coolmore and Earlie studs among others.  I do not know if the National Stud sponsors anything; it probably does not have the money and I can understand that.  That is an example of how it should be involved in the totality of the industry.  It has the capacity to represent Ireland in a very positive way. It has enormous tourist potential.  I hope that given the resources which the Minister intends to make available, it can be restored to profitability and contribute fully to the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first occasion to speak in the Seanad.  I am delighted to be a Member of this House.  There is a more relaxed and industrious atmosphere in this Chamber than in the Dáil. I never saw as many Members present in the Dáil as I see in the Seanad, and that is a good sign.  I look forward to working with the other Members to make this a very successful Seanad.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very welcome legislation.  I compliment the Minister for being here.  The Bill will enable the National Stud to purchase more stallions.  That makes sense given that it can become much more profitable through an expansion in its main core business.  With that will come the opportunity to immediately expand one of their other important services, the training and education of young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 22 or 23 young people being trained there at the moment.  This number would immediately increase to between 40 and 50 given the extra resources and the extra number of stallions that could come into the Stud.  It is <Col N="219" /> interesting to note that there is guaranteed employment for people who train at the stud.  I am disappointed that it has taken so long to introduce this legislation given the potential in the industry.  The Minister, Deputy Walsh, is in no way responsible for this.  He has been more than supportive of the National Stud and of the people in the industry.  I welcome the fact that he has taken such a keen interest in the racing industry because of the significant potential it has for job creation.  We should focus for a moment on our real problems when we cannot recognise opportunities for growth, investment and job creation and yet this legislation has been sought since 1986 by the National Stud.  It has taken until 1993 to introduce it.  This legislation is straightforward and deals with the outdated statutory limit of £500,000.  Despite the fact that the stud can immediately double the number of young people they train and can significantly increase their profits through the purchase of more stallions, we, the politicians have held back progress until now.  I compliment the Minister for introducing this legislation.</P>
    <P>There is great potential for job creation in this industry.  I hope the Seanad will highlight the possibilities for increasing the present 25,000 jobs in the equine industry to 50,000 jobs within the next four to five years.  This is one area where we can immediately increase the number of jobs and profit.</P>
    <P>While the National Stud is primarily there to be of assistance to the Irish commercial breeder, there is great potential to increase foreign investment as a result of the decision taken here today.  The National Stud will now be in a position to do much more international business. That makes sense because the increase in its activities will give it a greater international profile and will bring greater attention to the Irish horse industry.  Such a profile and such attention will clearly attract people worldwide who want to invest in the Irish horse industry both on the stud side and on the racing side.  That is of the greatest significance overall in this decision to increase the borrowing <Col N="220" /> powers of the National Stud to £5 million and the share capital to £10 million.</P>
    <P>I have read with interest the Oireachtas joint committee's report on the National Stud.  I believe there is potential to allow the non-thoroughbred industry become involved in the National Stud.  As I understand it there is a desire among people in the National Stud, and in the industry to become involved in the non-thoroughbred side.  The expertise, knowledge and contacts of the National Stud could be put at the disposal of the non-thoroughbred industry, for instance, in the purchase of stallions.  Galway would not be noted as a significant part of the country in terms of training, etc., for the thoroughbred industry.  Its strengths lie in the non-thoroughbred area.  There is significant potential for the National Stud to be of assistance to people in the non-thoroughbred and the thoroughbred industries.  We have two relatively young horse trainers, Val O'Brien and Pat Kelly doing extremely well.  If they got help and support they could expand their businesses and employ more people.  I fail to understand why the Oireachtas joint committee recommended that the company should not become involved in the non-thoroughbred area.  Clearly the National Stud's first priority is the development of the thoroughbred side but it should provide support and assistance for the non-thoroughbred side also.</P>
    <P>With regard to the education and training of young people, there is a significant potential for pre-training courses for those who are thinking of getting involved in the industry, and for courses in the equine business in addition to the core course which can be expanded significantly into stud management etc.</P>
    <P>I hope this legislation will draw to the attention of Members the fact that the racing industry has significant potential. This is a black day for Galway on the manufacturing side and I am convinced that job creation can best be brought about through investment in and development of areas, such as the racing industry.</P>
    <P>I am confident that as a result of the Minister's leadership, we will see a major <Col N="221" /> move forward.  The Department should become far more involved in this area and the relevant section should become a bigger, stronger and more important part of the Department.  People in other areas of the State should also become involved in this drive to develop the industry.</P>
    <P>The current developments are encouraging. It is great to see Tattersalls moving their yearling sales from Newmarket to Fairyhouse and to see some of the leading trainers seeking new business so that they can provide more jobs.  I spoke recently with some of those trainers &mdash; Dermot Weld, Jim Bolger and John Oxx, and it was interesting to hear them talk about their potential to create more jobs, given a climate conducive to expansion.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the syndication question which Senator Dardis raised. While the Stud should not get involved in the upper end of the market, there may be good commercial opportunities to get involved in syndication.  The conservative approach of the past should now be replaced with a more aggressive approach to money.  If this means syndication, we should get involved in it.</P>
    <P>I was listening on my monitor to the Minister's reference to some of the progeny which had gone through the Stud I heard him mention a bluewin filly which hopefully will run in the President's colours in the coming months and anybody who participates in today's debate should be privy to that tip.  I heard him mention Jodami.  My tip for Cheltenham is Jodami and Senator Cosgrave can bet all he wants on it.  I did not know Jodami came through the National Stud.  I am pleased to hear it, because this will be one of the top horses in the next year or two.  I look forward to good results in Cheltenham.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is unknown for a graduate of the National Stud to be unable to find employment, yet the National Stud has tried for seven years to get this legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas. They say they can double the number of people they can train immediately as a result of this legislation.  As politicians, we must look carefully at our role to <Col N="222" /> ensure that we are not stopping development in areas like the racing industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his recent reappointment.  While this is an enabling Bill, this debate gives us an opportunity to express our thoughts on the breeding and racing industry, and related matters.  This industry is undergoing a very thorough examination and is facing severe difficulties in the management of its affairs.  The Arabs, who took over part of the industry in the 1980s and 1990s, are re-examining the situation and cutting back.  There are lessons to be learned from this.</P>
      <P>I compliment those involved in the running of the National Stud over many years, especially during the very successful years.  Obviously, that did not happen without planning, development and foresight by the managers.</P>
      <P>It is important to look ahead.  The Minister mentioned two alternatives &mdash; an injection of money into the development of the stud or, the unthinkable, closing the Stud.  Nobody is advocating the latter.  As the Minister said, that would be a national act of sabotage.  If the present trend continues, something like that could be on the cards.</P>
      <P>It is clear there has to be a rethink in this area.  One has to look at all aspects of the stud and how it is being managed and developed.  I was interested to hear what Senator Dardis had to say.  He would know from experience that if we cannot make money on an 800 acre farm despite the difficulties, questions have to be asked.</P>
      <P>The Stud should have the funding necessary to stand stallions of high calibre and some of these stallions should be household names.  Many people are now involved in horse racing purely for investment purposes.  Numbers of syndicates are increasing while the number of wealthy individual owners is declining in times of recession.  Indeed, many associates of mine are now involved in syndicates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before considering the National Stud, we need to look at the management of the racing industry of which the Stud is <Col N="223" /> an integral part.  Levels of employment direct and indirect within the Irish blook-stock, racing and breeeding industries, are high.  Today has been a bad day for jobs in Galway and the situation there highlights the need to guard existing jobs everywhere.  Senator Dardis referred to the number of people in Kildare who are dependent on the equine industry.  There is tremendous potential in the equine industry but we must examine it in its totality.</P>
    <P>A new racing authority has been set up but many older practices still need to be changed.  Racing is now competing with pop concerts and big matches for attendance and marketing in the industry will have to improve and that depends on the willingness of people of authority in the industry to effect change.</P>
    <P>Government commitment to the industry is necessary.  I hope the Minister will press this case and also any application from the National Stud to purchase a high calibre stallion.  Stock has to be replenished. More stallions at the National Stud are not household names.  It is only by winning races that horses become famous.  I hope the Minister will fight his corner at the Cabinet table to ensure that, despite the difficult times, additional money is made available for the purchase of stallions and that a thorough review of the racing industry is carried out.  I am sure that the Minister will have the willing ear of the Taoiseach who is interested in many aspects of the racing industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the granting of more money to the racing museum.  Greater effort should be made to promote the Japanese Gardens and the museum as tourist attractions.  Tully is located on one of the main southern routes and could attract more tourists, if marketing were improved.  This could be one way of redressing the National Stud's deteriorating balance sheet.</P>
    <P>The racing industry is experiencing difficult times in comparison with heady days when Irish horses won many prizes at Cheltenham and Ascot.  This is a vicious circle; if prize money is not pumped back into the industry it becomes <Col N="224" /> increasingly difficult to keep the better horses at home.  As the Minister said, the public responds to quality horses, as in the case of Jodami which ran at Leopardstown recently.  Sunday race meetings have been successful but many meetings on Saturdays and weekdays are poorly attended.  Race going is expensive but its marketing must be improved and meetings made more family-orientated. Facilities require improving at some tracks.  Greater investment is required if results are to be achieved.</P>
    <P>We are considering the National Stud in this Bill but its problems are mirrored throughout the racing industry which currently employs 25,000 people directly and indirectly with potential for more employment.  The Minister should under no circumstances consider closing the stud.  Instead, it should be developed and a broader range of attractively priced stallions made available to breeders. Famous stallions need to be purchased whether by syndication, or otherwise. Irish horses must be seen to compete and win at home, in England and throughout the world for the development of the Irish racing industry.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  We will support the Bill although we might propose amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is nice to see a Minister hold a portfolio in which he has a deep interest and I have no doubt of the Minister's commitment to the equine industry. Like Senator Dardis I have a vested interest in the industry.  I was often lucky to have my vest left after a day at the races.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The horse industry is synonymous with Ireland for many people and is one of the most vital national assets.  The National Stud in Tully, County Kildare, is the cornerstone of what we have achieved in equine matters.  The Stud has declined over the past few years, mainly due to lack of funding which has been rectified today.  We need to appreciate the significance of every facet of the horse racing industry.  The importance of racing <Col N="225" /> in Ireland is evident by the numbers who attend race meetings.  The greatest potential for exploitation in this industry lies in the export market.  It is vital that the Stud have the funding necessary to stand stallions of high calibre so that when we sell and export them, they will be successful on foreign race courses.  A good product is vital to any industry.</P>
    <P>Over the years I have been amazed by the growth of syndication in the horse industry.  It is under these circumstances that the Stud must compete.  Will it be able to increase its present number of standing stallions?  Stallion purchase costs are high.  There is no point however in filling stables with stallions not of the quality necessary to rejuvenate this industry.</P>
    <P>In a recent advertisement, Team Aer Lingus used the image of the Irish thoroughbred as a marketing ploy, successully. Other countries regard Ireland as the home of horse racing.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides adequate funding for the National Stud and I am pleased that the Minister has moved on it quickly. Many recommendations were made on the Joint Committee Stage and it is disappointing that the Bill did not appear sooner.</P>
    <P>I know of people who have gone to Kentucky having graduated from the Tully stud farm and who have been very successful abroad.  As mentioned already, Winfield is the home of Northern Dancer, an Irish horse.  I think the English Stud is also managed by an Irish graduate.  Throughout the world Irish people have been excellent at their jobs. It is vital that this funding be made available.</P>
    <P>What has happened in the past is that the National Stud was not able to move quickly enough to buy stallions.  Good stallions do not stay on the market long and it is vital that the £5 million be used to buy suitable animals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire Stáit ag an Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta (Mr. Gallagher,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Donegal South-West):</i> Ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leat féin as tú bheith tofa inniu mar Leas-Chathaoirleach an tSeanaid.</P>
      <P>Is mór an phribhléid dom an deis seo a bheith agam an Bille seo a chur faoi bhráid an tSeanaid.  Sula luífidh mé isteach ar chuspóir an Bhille féin, ba mhaith liom cur síos gairid a tabhairt don Seanad faoi conas mar a d'éirigh le Údarás na Gaeltachta anuraidh maidir le fostaíocht a chruthú sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Bliain deacair a bhí ann anuraidh maidir le fostaíocht a chruthú agus a chaomhnú sa Ghaeltacht is cuma cén earnáil tionscail ina raibh gnóanna nó cén margadh lena rabhthas ag iarraidh earraí a dhíol.  Cruthaíodh 975 phost nua lánaimseartha ar an bhfód i 1992 i dtionscail a fuair cúnamh ón Údarás agus, tar éis caillteanais de 920 post a chur san áireamh, bhí méadú glan de 55 phost sa bhliain sin.  Ba í 1992 a t-aonú bliain déag i ndiaidh a chéile ina raibh glanmhéadú san fhostaíocht i dtionscail faoi scáth an Údaráis.  Ag deireadh 1992, bhí 5,652 dhuine fostaithe go lánaimseartha i dtionscail sa Ghaeltacht faoi scáth an Údaráis i gcomparáid le 5,597 nduine ag deireadh 1991.  Chomh maith leis sin, tá acmhainn de 1,440 post nua i dtograí ar cheadaigh an tÚdarás cúnamh ina leith anuraidh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá fostaíocht shéasúrach an-tábhachtach don Ghaeltacht agus tháinig méadú de 320 ar líon na bpost sin sa Ghaeltacht le linn 1992 ó 2,260 duine i 1991 go dtí 2,580 duine i 1992.  Luíonn na poist shéasúracha pháirtaimseartha sin le sean tráidisiún an iarthair mar tugann siad deis do na hoibrithe a bheith ag plé le farraige agus le talamh agus móin in am tráth. Chomh maith leis an bhfostaíocht shéasúrach/pháirtaimseartha sin, bhí 77 scéim fhostaíochta shóisialta a raibh luach £1.4 mhilliún ag gabháil leo agus <Col N="227" /> 635 dhuine fostaithe orthu á riaradh ag an Údarás i 1992 i gcomhar le FÁS agus coistí áitiúla Ghaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an 920 oibrithe ar scaoileadh leo i rith na bliana seo caite, is ábhar imní agus machnaimh dúinn uile gur cailleadh an líon mór post sin i dtionscail éagsúla sa Ghaeltacht.  Is sásamh éigin é gur athchruthaíodh timpeall 300 díobh trí thograí nua a bunaíodh ar shócmhainní na gcomhlachtaí ar theip orthu.  Bhain formhór na gcaillteanas eile le laghduithe ar a bhfoirne oibre a b'éigean do chomhlachtaí a chur i bhfeidhm de bharr deacrachtaí trádála i margaí éagsúla.  Is fadhb mhór í líon na bpost a chailltear sa Ghaeltacht gach bliain a chealaíonn beagnach iomlán na bpost a chruthaítear go bliantúil. Tá sé ráite go soiléir sa Chlár le haghaidh Rialtais Chomhpháirtíochta go mbeidh an tÚdarás ag cur lena gcuid iarrachtaí ní amháin chun fostaíocht bhreise a chruthú ach freisin chun an fhostaíocht atá ann a chaomhnú.  Is cinnte go gcaithfear scrúdú a dhéanamh ar na critéir a úsáideann an tÚdarás i dtaca le cúnamh a cheadú do thograí agus iarracht a dhéanamh chun na laigeachtaí a thagann chun cinn i gcomhlachtaí beaga maidir le bainistíocht, margaíocht agus teicneólaíocht a mhaolú oiread agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>Tá dul chun cinn sásúil á dhéanamh ag an Údarás maidir leis an meánchostas deontais in aghaidh an phoist a laghdú. Anuraidh ba é an meánchostas ná £9,130 i gcomparáid le £9,800 i 1991 agus £11,470 i 1990.  Tá an laghdú seo ag teacht le cinneadh polasaí a glacadh cúpla bliain siar maidir le meánrátaí deontais a laghdú agus scair níos airde den infheistíocht a lorg ó na hinfheisteoirí féin.  Leanfaidh an tÚdarás lena chuid iarrachtaí chun an costas sin a ísliú de réir a chéile le cinntiú go bhfaighfear an sochar is fearr agus is féidir as an infheistíocht Stáit i bhforbairt tionscail sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Anois tiocfaidh mé chun chuspóir an Bhille féin.  Tá dhá aidhm leis.  Is í an chéad aidhm foráil a dhéanamh trí alt a 2 den Bhille le gur féidir caipiteal a chur ar fáil feasta d'Údarás na Gaeltachta, le haghaidh scaireanna a ghlacadh i gcuideachtaí <Col N="228" /> agus le haghaidh caiteachas a thabhú ar mhonarchana nó eile, mar dheontas-i-gcabhair trí Vóta mo Roinne seachas mar airleacain ón bPríomh-Chiste. Go dtí deireadh na bliana seo caite, bhíodh caipiteal ón Stát á chur ar fáil don Údarás, agus do Ghaeltarra Éireann roimhe, ar dhá bhealach: ó Vóta na Roinne mar dheontas-i-gcabhair chun deontais a íoc; agus mar airleacain inaisíoctha ón bPríomh-Chiste chun a chumasú don Údarás scaireanna a ghlacadh i gcuideachtaí agus caiteachas a thabhú ar mhonarchana nó eile.</P>
    <P>Is é an tÚdarás an uirlis forbartha tionscail atá ag an Rialtas don Ghaeltacht. Nuair a rithfear an Bille seo is trí Vóta mo Roinne amháin a chuirfear an soláthar caipitil in iomlán ón Stát ar fáil don Údarás agus beidh an tÚdarás ar an mbonn céanna leis an Údarás Forbartha Tionscail maidir le cúnamh Stáit d'fhorbairt tionscail.</P>
    <P>Ó bunaíodh an tÚdarás ar 1 Eanáir 1980, tá suim £77.182 mhilliún airleachta dó ón bPríomh-Chiste suas go dtí deireadh na bliana seo caite.  Chomh maith leis sin, bhí suim £41.791 mhilliún airleactha do Ghaeltarra Éireann ó 1 Aibreán 1965 go dtí 31 Nollaig 1979.  Faoi alt 23 (2) (c) den Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, níl an tsuim iomlán sin, i.e., £118.973 mhilliún, inaisíoctha ná níl ús iníoctha ar an gcéanna go dtí dáta a chinnfidh an tAire Airgeadais tar éis comhairle a ghlacadh le Aire na Gaeltachta &mdash; an tAire Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta anois.  Tá sé soiléir le fada nach mbeadh ar chumas an Údaráis na hairleacain sin a aisíoc in iomlán riamh.  Is é an dara aidhm leis an mBille seo, mar sin, foráil a dhéanamh trí alt a 3 nach mbeidh an tsuim sin inaisíochta ná nach mbeidh ús iníoctha air.</P>
    <P>Míneoidh mé anois cén fáth nach mbeidh ar chumas an Údaráis na hairleacain a tugadh dó agus do Ghaeltarra Éireann a aisíoc in iomlán.  Léiríonn cuntais fhoilsithe an Údaráis don bhliain dar chríoch 31 Nollaig 1991 gurbh é glan-luach monarchana, foirgneamh agus áiseanna eile, agus sócmhainní dochta eile na heagraíochta ar 31 Nollaig 1991 ná £59.013 mhilliún.  Léiríonn na cuntais <Col N="229" /> chéanna gurbh é glan-luach, tar éis soláthar i gcomhair athluacháil a dhéanamh, infheistíochtaí an Údaráis i gcuideachtaí ag 31 Nollaig 1991 ná £9.047 milliún. Chomh maith leis sin, bhí féichiúnaithe iarchurtha de £1.685 mhilliún ag an Údarás.  Tagann na suimeanna sin ar fad go dtí £69.745 mhilliún.  Go dtí 31 Nollaig 1991, tugadh airleacain dar luach £113.473 mhilliún don Údarás.  Mar sin tá easnamh de £43.728 milliún sa chuntas. Déantar suas an £43.728 milliún sin mar seo a leanas:</P>

    <P>Níl figiúirí iniúchtha do 31 Nollaig 1992 ar fáil go fóill ach meastar gur easnamh de £44.326 mhilliún a bheidh ann ar an dáta sin.</P>
    <P>Ag féachaint don mhéid airgid mar airleacain a chuir an Stát ar fáil don Údarás i gcomparáid le glan-luach na maoine agus na n-infheistíochtaí anois, is léir go raibh agus go bhfuil costas ard ag baint le forbairt tionscail sa Ghaeltacht. Níor mhiste a threisiú, áfach, go bhfuil breis agus 5,600 post lánaimseartha agus beagnach 2,600 post séasúracha i dtionscail sa Ghaeltacht faoi scáth an Údaráis. Chomh maith leis sin, tá oiliúint thionsclaíoch curtha ar fáil do líon mór oibrithe agus tá eastáit tionscail agus líon maith monarchana aonracha tógtha ar fud na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh bíonn deacrachtaí móra le sárú ag an Údarás d'fhonn tograí fiúntacha a mhealladh chuig ceantair Ghaeltachta atá scartha amach ó na príomhionaid thráchtála agus atá faoi mhíbhuntáiste cheana ó thaobh bunstruchtúir agus easpa saoráidí i gcoitinne i gcomparáid leis an gcuid eile den tír. Bíonn an tÚdarás ag snámh in aghaidh an tsrutha i gcónaí ag iarraidh gníomhaíochtaí oiriúnacha eacnamaíochta a <Col N="230" /> spreagadh agus a fhairsingiú ionas go mbeidh deiseanna leormhaithe ag muintir na Gaeltachta chun fostaíocht shocrach a fháil ina gceantair féin agus caighdeáin réasúnta mhaireachtála a bheith acu.  Tríd is tríd, táim sásta go bhfuil dea-thoradh bainte amach leis an gcaiteachas mór Stáit ar fhorbairt tionscail sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Maidir le cuntais an Údaráis, beidh athruithe le déanamh ar an leagan amach nuair a bheidh feidhm leis an reachtaíocht is ábhar don Bhille seo.  Is ceist í sin a bheidh le socrú tar éis plé idir an Údarás, Aire na Gaeltachta, an Aire Airgeadais agus an Ard-Reachtaire Cuntas agus Ciste.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go bhfuil cuspóir an Bhille seo mínithe go soiléir agam.  Cé gur Bille gairid é, is Bille tábhachtach é agus molaim don Seanad glacadh leis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire as an post atá faighte aige.  Is fear iontach maith an tAire agus tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go geal leis.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on being reappointed to this portfolio.  I wish him well in his job which is going to be difficult this year and, I assume, for a number of years to come.  Given the calibre of the Minister and his senior partner in this Department, I think we can expect some good things to happen over the next few years.</P>
      <P>However, I am somewhat disappointed with the Minister's speech.  It is historical in content and deals with the Bill before us but it does not show any sign of new thinking or any proposals for improving the situation in the Gaeltacht areas or for a root-and-branch reappraisal of An tÚdarás and the way it is spending its money.  Given that the senior Minister in the Department is a man who is somewhat of a visionary and who is given to flights of fancy and poetic musing, I am surprised there are not some signs of change in his Department already.  It appears we will have to wait a little longer for evidence of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a huge haemorrhage from the jugular vein of the country and this calls urgently for fresh thinking.  It means the <Col N="231" /> Minister and Ministers of State must use their ingenuity and whatever ingenuity they can borrow to try to find some way to improve the lot of people not just in the Gaeltacht areas but right across the country.  Many of us who are not from Gaeltacht areas or from the Shannon region, are not too happy that these two areas have statutory development authorities whereas the rest of us do not have such a facility.  In the case of the Gaeltacht areas, our nationalism justified why it is necessary to have Údarás na Gaeltachta in place.  I accept that and I fully support the Minister, his Department and Údarás na Gaeltachta in that respect.</P>
    <P>It is a different matter with SFADCo, I am afraid.  People outside the Shannon region find it hard to accept that that region should get preferential treatment, including its own authority with a statutory base such as the IDA has.  It is a source of embarrassment for many people who go abroad on delegations and find there is confusion created by the fact that both the IDA and SFADCo are vying for whatever loose investment might be available.  This confuses people who are coming in contact with them and many people in tourism and other areas are unhappy that that should be the case.</P>
    <P>I do not envy the people of Limerick and the Shannon region.  They are entitled to hold what they have at this stage.  Like An t-Údarás, SFADCo has done a lot of good work in that region. Why, however, do the people of the north-east, for example, not have their own statutory development authority? The north-east is a great blackspot area as far as employment is concerned.  If the Shannon region is entitled to it, we should be entitled to it.  Fairness should be the basis for all Government action. It is patently obvious that most people in the Republic, outside the Limerick/ Shannon region, are not all happy with that.</P>
    <P>When you peel off the nationalism we all have in our hearts, you might say that if the Gaeltacht has a statutory authority and the rest of us do not, then it should be abolished.  But I do not hold with that, <Col N="232" /> and I think most people would be of the same opinion and say that the Gaeltacht area is entitled to special treatment; it represents something unusual for us &mdash; tradition and culture, something we want to preserve.  Having looked over the annual reports for the last number of years, I congratulate Údarás na Gaeltachta for doing a fine job in difficult circumstances.  I know the Minister is proud to be associated with Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>The events of yesterday, however, will not make it any easier for the Minister and for Údarás na Gaeltachta to fulfil their functions over the rest of this year and in the years to come.  After yesterday's ill-formed, backward and hopeless budget, it is clear that the electorate, who wanted something new, got nothing but tradition.  It was obvious in the November election &mdash; and there are many of us in this House as a result of it &mdash; that the electorate decided that tradition and traditional things were bad.  Traditional politics in Ireland has meant a whole lot of improper things.  While that may not be entirely true, the fact remains that the public perceives traditional politics as meaning many scandals in high places, not a very fair system for anybody, and laws which are applied to the ordinary people not being applied to others.  They rejected that in November.  Many of us suffered the consequences and we have to accept that.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that those people and the people of the Gaeltacht areas feel cheated and let down because what they offered yesterday was more of the same. No nuance, no inventiveness, no vision, nothing that would say to the people who are looking for work and toiling to survive on far too little, that there is hope, what we have done today will improve your lot.  There was nothing like that in yesterday's budget.</P>
    <P>People in the Gaeltacht who have jobs in factories managed and put in place by An t-Údarás are today trying to get information on social welfare payments because they have less money in their pockets as a result of the budget.  Many <Col N="233" /> of them would be of the opinion that they would be better off staying at home.</P>
    <P>In the past few years it seemed to be more profitable not to work, and that situation has worsened as a result of the budget.  That is very sad.  When the population at large loses the desire to work because there is no profit attached to it, it is very difficult for factory managers and people who are trying to be successful in business to motivate their staff to do a good job and to supply services and goods at the best possible price. Because that attitude has been put in place and has been creating a worse situation than existed before, we can assume that, as a result of yesterday's budget, we are in for a pretty rough time.</P>
    <P>National morale took a dive yesterday. That is clear from most people's view and that will impinge on the Department, on the activities of Údarás na Gaeltachta and on every enterprise right across the Republic.  People feel they are in a hopeless situation which has been exacerbated by the budget.  That is against that sad background that Údarás na Gaeltachta has to work.</P>
    <P>In his review of the activities of An tÚdarás the Minister was proudly able to say that at the end of 1992 there were 5,652 people in full-time employment in industry supported by An tÚdarás.  That was an increase, albeit a small one, on the number of people who were employed at the end of 1991.  He also said that 1,440 new posts were coming onstream as a result of investments made possible by the activities of An t-Údarás.  That is good.  He also said there was considerable seasonable employment of approximately 2,580.  That was an increase on the previous year.  This shows the activities of An tÚdarás are fruitful and that grants made to them are worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that a number of jobs were lost last year.  However, this was expected, given the climate that existed in the country.  Approximately 1,000 jobs were lost during the year and this is a cause for great concern.  We all deeply regret the announcement made this morning about Digital in Galway.  It has come at a bad time and has sent <Col N="234" /> shock waves not only through Galway but throughout Ireland.  I am sure the public are wondering if more multinational companies will follow the same course in the next few months.</P>
    <P>The public has always been sceptical about the fact that foreigners seem to be able to come to this country with an idea and that the IDA will offer them grant aid.  We who know the scene would not agree with this statement but it must be said it is a measure of how the IDA has conducted its activities over the past 25 years that foreigners found it very easy to get grants in Ireland while locals found it much more difficult.  The majority of the population felt that the IDA took a more rigorous approach when proposals for new enterprises were put forward by Irish people.  It was generally believed we turned our backs on native enterprise because we were able to get our hands on the occasional &ldquo;plum&rdquo; project from abroad, and many of them did wonderful things for the community.  However, we have sad stories like Digital where, when times get tough they leave.  Family concerns never do that.  They put their backs to the wall, they batten down the hatches and try to survive.  That is why our policies have been wrong over the last 25 years.  We should have made greater efforts and invested more in small native enterprises.</P>
    <P>Anyone who wants to see whether this would be a good national policy should visit County Monaghan where there are many examples of local enterprise which stated with some State assistance.  Monaghan Mushrooms has survived the trauma of the past four or five months and many other Monaghan industries, including the furniture industry, are thriving.  They employ a considerable number of people and have cost the State very little.  They will not go under without a fight.  This is one lesson we have learned, but it took a long time to learn it.  We now have county enterprise boards and this is good because money is guaranteed for each county.  It also gives the local people a chance to exploit their skills to the best advantage.  It took a long <Col N="235" /> time for us to learn that this was the correct way to do things.</P>
    <P>A good mix of international and local investment is always right.  In hindsight it is easy to say that those in charge should have known better.  The fact is we were happy to accept the large factory in our town or region.  At times we pay the price; we are changing even though it is a little late.  Other things also need to be done and I hope we get opportunities in the Seanad to discuss economic and investment policies and the best way to improve our ability to create jobs and help our people.</P>
    <P>I tabled an amendment.  I confess that I did so without having a complete understanding of the Bill as I was asked to deal with it at short notice and I did not have time to discuss it.  When I read section 2 of the Bill and also looked at the 1979 Act it seemed the Minister could only act in respect of Údarás na Gaeltachta under the terms of the Bill and it was not clear to me that the Minister had the power to reclaim grants paid from voted money. Therefore, I tabled an amendment and I would like to have it discussed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy enough with the activities of An t-Údarás.  However, I am unhappy with the full content of the Minister's speech.  It has analysed the past but there is no mention of the Minister carrying out a root and branch examination of the activities of Údarás na Gaeltachta, in conjunction with An t-Údarás, or that he <Col N="236" /> intends to examine their activities and method of investment.  I was hoping this new Government would use every opportunity to discuss this issue.  Although this is one of the few opportunities we have to discuss Údarás matters, we did not make the most of it.  The Minister did not talk about the future, about innovation or about how he proposes, with his senior Minister, to tackle the dreadful problems in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>We will have opportunities over the next month or so to discuss the budget and financial and investment matters.  I hope to develop my comments further at a later stage.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, déanaim comhghairdeas leat agus tá súil agam go dtabharfaidh tú cothrom na Féinne do gach Seanadóir.  Ba mhaith liom fáiltiú roimh an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Gallagher agus tréaslú leis ina athcheapadh mar Aire Stáit ar Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Molaim agus aontaím le haidhmeanna an Bhille seo mar go dtugann sé an taitheantas airgeadais céanna d'Údarás na Gaeltachta agus atá ag eagrais Stáit eile. Go dtí seo, bhí ar an Údarás airgead a iarraidh gach cúpla bliain.  Leis an mBille seo, beidh siad i dteideal airgead d'fháil dála na heagrais fhorbartha Stáit eile.</P>
      <P>Bunaíodh an t-Údarás i 1980 chun forbairt eacnamaíoch agus chultúrtha na nGaeltachtaí.  Faoi láthair, tá beagnach, 1,000 comhlacht ag fáil cabhrach ón Údarás; tá beagnach 6,000 post lánaimseartha agus 2,000 post páirtaimseartha i gceist.  Fuair 4,053 post cabhair airgid ó Ghaeltarra Éireann roimh 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is job fiór-dheacair atá idir lámha ag an Údarás ó bunaíodh é i 1980 agus a bhí ag Gaeltarra a bunaíodh i 1958 i ngeall ar iargúltacht na nGaeltachtaí.  Gan dabht, is fearr le Comhlachtaí lonnú áit a bhfuil infrastructúr sásúil agus dá bhrí sin faigheann an IDA an chéad seans i gcoimhlint leis an Údarás.  Ba cheart <Col N="237" /> comhoibriú níos fearr a bheith eatarthu. Táimid go léir ag troid ar son postanna don tír agus ba chóir téip dhearg agus coimhlint idir eagrais a ghearradh.</P>
    <P>Gníomhaíonn téip dhearg na n-eagras Stáit eagsúla i gcoinne forbartha.  Má theastáionn ó chomhlacht dul i mbun phróiseáil éisc bíonn air dul trí seacht eagrais dhifriúla idir cheadúnais, shláintíocht, chomhshaoil, shláinte, phleanáil, chomhairle contae agus eile.  Ba chóir an téip dhearg seo a ghearradh agus go mbeadh an tÚdarás in a chomhordnóir iomlán chun cabhrú le comhlachtaí.  Tuigim go bhfuil &ldquo;Statutes&rdquo; áirithe le comhlíonadh ach tá sé seafóideach claíanna a chur sa bhealach ar phostanna.</P>
    <P>Údarás na Gaeltachta does not have an easy job promoting industry and creating jobs in the parts of Ireland for which they have responsibility &mdash; the hills of Donegal, the mountains of Kerry and the rough terrain of Mayo, Galway and west Cork &mdash; and undoubtedly have the worst roads and infrastructure.  I agree things are changing fast and on my trip to Donegal recently I noticed they have good roads, particularly in the Gaeltacht area. I hope the Minister will give money to the Dingle Penninsula, west Cork and similar places.  An onerous task has been given to An tÚdarás to attract industries and create jobs in places like this.  I would hate to say they are poor but they are severely disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The three main industries keeping our Gaeltacht communities alive are fishing, agriculture and tourism.  The fishing industry has been built up over the last number of years.  I would like to see An tÚdarás more deeply involved in the provision of moneys for new piers and harbours in Gaeltacht areas and to increase, if possible the number of processing plants, because this is where jobs can be provided and the added value is. Far too often fish are caught, loaded on to lorries and shipped direct to the market in Spain.  If the fish were processed and added value, that would create more jobs.</P>
    <P>Not too many people are engaged in agriculture in the mountains of Kerry and <Col N="238" /> the hills of Donegal, but there is a huge sheep population there.</P>
    <P>About three months ago, I urged Údarás na Gaeltachta to carry out a study on creating extra jobs by processing or added value on the wool.  I checked how much wool was being exported in the raw state and was amazed to find it was worth £12 million.  I disagreed with the letter I received from An tÚdarás, stating that according to their study my suggestion was not viable.  I ask the Minister to take this case up again with An tÚdarás or his Department to see if a small wool processing factory, involved in cleaning or adding value to wool, could be established in one of our Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>At the moment the price of wool is rock bottom.  Sheep farmers in my community are paying 15p to shear their sheep and the shearer can keep the wool.  It costs about 15p per pound at the moment. It leaves the country and comes back processed.  I cannot understand how it leaves at 20p per pound, returns and is advertised as pure guaranteed Irish wool at between £6 and £7 a pound.  Let no State organisation tell me there are no jobs to be created between when we get 20p per pound for the raw material but we import the finished product at £6 and £7 per pound.  Somebody is making big money and it is not being made in Ireland.  I ask the Minister to have another look at this, even if it only provided, five, ten or 20 jobs.</P>
    <P>In my parish there was some wool processing, called combing the wool.  I often went with my grandmother, who brought her little bag of wool.  She had it combed and cleaned, then came home and started spinning.  There was socks, gansies, etc., knitted from that wool.  We produced good wool when I was growing up and no one could find fault with the wool we are producing now.  I would like to see An tÚdarás involved in tourism.  Ba cheart go mbeadh Údarás na Gaeltachta freagrach as cúrsaí turasóireachta sa Ghaeltacht.  Is rud ar leith é &ldquo;cultural tourism&rdquo; agus ní thuigeann éinne cultúr na Gaeltachta níos fearr ná muintir na Gaeltachta féin.  Tá muintir Gaeltachta fostaithe san Údarás agus is acusan <Col N="239" /> amháin atá an tuiscint agus an oiliúint chun turasóireacht a chur chun cinn sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Cad atá déanta ag Bord Fáilte don Ghaeltacht?  Cén tuiscint atá acu ar chúrsaí Ghaeltachta?  Cad atá déanta acu don Daingean, mo bhaile féin?  Tuigim an gá le caighdeán a choinneáil ach bíonn na daoine a thugann cuairt ar na Gaeltachtaí ag lorg teagmháil le muintir na háite, an cultúr a bhlas agus an ceol agus an teanga a chlos.  Níl siad ag lorg ostán mór.</P>
    <P>Cad atá déanta ag Bord Fáilte ar son na coláistí samhraidh?  Ní leanaí amháin atá i gceist anseo ach a dtuismitheoirí freisin.  Tá méadú ag teacht ar líon na gcúrsaí do dhaoine fásta ann.  Baineann an ghné seo le job an Údaráis forbairt chultúrtha agus eacnamaíoch a chothú sa Ghaeltacht.  Ba cheart go mbeadh an tÚdarás i dteideal deontais fostaíochta a chuar ar fáil do lucht na n-ostán agus na dtithe lóistín.</P>
    <P>Tá an-obair déanta ag an Údarás i dtaobh próiseáil agus feirmeoireacht éisc i dteannta le BIM ach ba cheart go mbeadh an tÚdarás ábalta tuilleadh cabhrach infrastructúrtha a shólathar ar mhaithe le forbairt an tionscail seo. Tá níos mó cabhrach de dhíth freisin ar choistí agus ar chomharchumainn aitiúla, leis, atá ag gabháil do chúrsaí cé agus bóthar.</P>
    <P>Fáiltím roimh an ráiteas sa cháinaisnéis inné go mbeidh an t-airgead riachtanach ar fáil chun céanna Inis Oírr agus Inis Meáin a thosnú.  Fáiltím freisin roimh an chinneadh chun airgead a chur ar fáil do theilifís Ghaeltachta.  Má bhíonn meán oiriúnach ar nós na teilifíse ag tabhairt tosaíochta do chultúr agus do shaol na Gaeltachta b'fhéidir go meallfar tuilleadh infheistíochta isteach sa cheantar.  Beidh scileanna breise agus jobanna le fáil tríd na forbairtí seo freisin.</P>
    <P>Anois go bhfuil deacrachtaí móra eacnamaíochta le sárú ag Éire bheadh sé furasta dearmad a dhéanamh ar Údarás na Gaeltachta agus ar na cúraimí tábhachtacha atá leagtha air.  Tá gach tacaíocht ar féidir a thabhairt ag teastáil uaidh agus ag dul dó.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire Stáit agus an Leas-Chathaoirleach as ucht a bpostanna nua.</P>
      <P>D'éist mé leis an Seanadóir Cotter ar ball arbh as Contae Mhuineacháin dó, cosúil liom féin, agus tá eolas agam ar fhadhbanna tionsclaíocha an chontae sin.  Cé nach bhfuil cónaí orm i nGaeltacht tuigim an gá atá le forbairt thionsclaíoch sa Ghaeltacht trí mheán an Údaráis.  Aontaím lena dúirt an Seanadóir Cotter faoi fhadbanna tionsclaíocha i gcoitinne.  Is dóigh liom gurb é an tÚdarás an meán is fearr chun forbairt a dhéanamh ar na limistéir Ghaeltachta atá ar na háiteanna is iargultaí sa tír iomlán agus, ar an ábhar sin, i dteideal cabhair ar leith.  Ní mór &ldquo;potholes&rdquo; bhóthar Mhuineacháin agus an Chabháin a dheisiú.  Ba mhaith liom ceist infheistíochta na mbóthar a phlé chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>
      <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an Bille ag leasú an Achta um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, faoi bhráid an tSeanaid inniu.  Níl deacracht agam leis an mBille; feictear dom gur Bille gairid é.  Ainneoin é sin, is ábhar tábhachtach atá faoi chaibidil againn anseo.</P>
      <P>Tá dhá aidhm leis an mBille seo.  Is é an chéad aidhm ná caipiteal a chur ar fáil d'Údarás na Gaeltachta as seo amach mar dheontas-i-gcabhair le haghaidh caiteachais ar mhonarchana nó eile agus chun scaireanna a ghlacadh i gcuideachtaí. Beidh an t-airgead seo ag teacht díreach ón Roinn Ealaíon Cultúir agus Gaeltachta.  Roimhe seo bhíodh caipiteal ón Stát á chur ar fáil don Údarás agus roimhe sin do Ghaeltarra Éireann ar dhá bhealach &mdash; mar dheontas-i-gcabhair ó Roinn na Gaeltachta chun deontais a íoc agus mar airleacan ón Statchiste chun go nglacfadh an tÚdarás scaireanna i gcuideachtaí agus ar son caiteachas ar mhonarchana agus mar sin.  Bhí na hairleacain sin inaisíochta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is fiú tagairt anois don IDA a bhfuil an obair chéanna ar siúl acu lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht agus a bhfuil ag Údarás na Gaeltachta laistigh.  Go dtí seo bhí an IDA i dteideal deontais-i-gcabhair nach raibh inaisíoctha i gcomparáid leis an <Col N="241" /> Údarás arbh éigean dó airgead agus ús a aisíoc.  Aimhrialtacht sa reachtú ab ea an coinníol sin.  Tá an deis againn anois an aimhrialtacht sin a cheartú.  Mar sin is í chéad aidhm an Bhille seo ná foráil a dhéanamh le gur féidir caipiteal a chur ar fáil d'Údarás na Gaeltachta ón Roinn Ealaíonn, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta go dtí go mbeidh an tÚdarás ar an mbonn céanna leis an IDA agus eagrais eile maidir le cúnamh Stáit d'fhorbairt thionsclaíochta.</P>
    <P>Thrácht an Seanadóir Fitzgerald ar stair an Údaráis.  Ó bunaíodh an tÚdarás i 1980, tá iarracht mhór déanta aige chun tionscail a bhunú sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá míbhuntáistí géografaíochta, bunstructúir agus fostaíochta ar leith le sárú ag na limistéir Ghaeltachta.  Ní mór dúinn a mheabhrú dúinn féin go bhfuil breis agus 5,600 post lánaimseartha agus 2,600 post seasúrtha, beagnach, i dtionscail sa Ghaeltacht faoi scáth an Udaráis.  Chomh maith leis sin, tá oiliúint thionsclaíoch i gcomhar le FÁS ar siúl ag Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Ag deireadh 1992 bhí 5,652 dhuine fostaithe sa Ghaeltacht i dtionscail a fuair cúnamh ón Údarás.</P>
    <P>Cailleadh 920 post sa Ghaeltacht anuraidh agus cruthaíodh 975 phost nua. D'éirigh leis an Údarás an uimhir sin post a chruthú d'ainneoin deacrachtaí ginearálta eacnamaíochta na tíre.  Ní cóir locht a fháil ar an Údarás as ucht na bpost a cailleadh de thoradh deacrachtaí tradála i margaí éagsúla.  Ó tharla go bhfuil an tÚdarás ag obair go crua chun bua a fháil ar na fadhbanna a bhaineann le limistéir Ghaeltachta ní mór dúinn gach cabhair a thabhairt dó.</P>
    <P>Is é an tarna aidhm atá ag an mBille seo na foráil a dhéanamh mar atá scríofa in alt a 3 anseo ionas nach mbeidh na hairleacain a tugadh dó ón státchiste inaisíoctha agus nach mbeidh ús iníoctha orthu.</P>
    <P>Tá sé soiléir anois nach mbeidh ar chumas an Údaráis na hairleacain a fuarthas chun scaireanna a ghlacadh i gcuideachtaí agus eile, a aisíoc in iomlán nó i bpáirt, fiú.  Léiríonn Cuntais Fhoilsithe an Údaráis don bhliain dar chríoch 31 Nollaig 1991 gurb é glanluach monarchana, <Col N="242" /> foirgneamh agus áiseanna eile chomh maith le socmhainní dochta na heagraíochta ná thar £59 milliún.  Feictear freisin gurb é glanluach, tar éis soláthar i gcomhair athluacháil a dhéanamh infheistíochtaí an Údaráis i gcuideachtaí ná thar £9 milliún.  Tá féichiúnaithe iarchurtha de £1.685 mhilliún ag an Údarás. San iomlán, tá easnamh de £43.728 milliún sa chuntas.</P>
    <P>Is léir go bhfuil forbairt thionsclaíoch a Ghaeltacht costasach.  Ach mar sin éin, tá gnó riachtanach ar siúl ag an Údarás sna limistéir Ghaeltachta agus aontaím leis an Aire Stáit nuair a deir sé nach cóir é sin a ligean i ndearmad.</P>
    <P>Is í an dara aidhm atá leis an mBille seo ná foráil a dhéanamh le nach mbeadh airleacain an Údaráis inaisíoctha.  Aontaím leis an gcuspóir seo agus measaim nuair nach mbeidh a chuid fiacha ag ualú air, go mbeidh ar chumas an Údaráis breis obair riachtanach agus iontach a dhéanamh.  In éagmais na forála seo, beidh an tÚdarás i mbaol a scoir.  Bheadh díomá orm an tÚdarás a fheiceáil i mbaol agus má táimid dáiríre faoi thábhacht na nGaeltachtaí agus an chultúir ba cheart dúinn gníomhú chun an tÚdarás a chosaint.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go nglacfar go fonnmhar leis an deis seo agus molaim don Seanad glacadh leis an mBille.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in welcoming the Minister and I congratulate him on his reappointment.</P>
      <P>We regard the Gaeltacht as important because it forms a large part of the west of Ireland, which is the disadvantaged part of the country.  Therefore, it is important to have somebody in charge of Gaeltacht affairs who is aware of the difficulties.  I would like to pay tribute to Údarás na Gaeltachta, to the present Minister, Deputy Pat &ldquo;Cope&rdquo; Gallagher, and to the people in the Department who have administered funding in the Gaeltacht area.  One can be critical and point out where they have had their share of losses but that is the type of business it is: you win some and you lose some.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was difficult when we lost some great industries; one in Killybegs, the Donegal <Col N="243" /> carpet industry and another was the crolly doll factory, and both had important international business.  It is important to have a number of different industries. The biggest single contribution from Údarás na Gaeltachta, in my assessment, is the fact that they support native industries using Irish raw materials.  They support craft industries.  Support is difficult in the terrain they have to cover; for example they have to look after the isles. Some years ago when somebody criticised the amount of money being spent in the Gaeltacht, the late Cormac Breslin responded by saying: &ldquo;That is the price you pay for driving us to the rocks&rdquo;.  This is the disadvantaged area that is being looked after by the Department of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The performance of industries, large and small, has been tremendous and they have provided jobs where we would have had to pay out dole, supplementary welfare benefit, supplementary rent allowances and many other subsidies.  The money spent by the Minister through Údarás na Gaeltachta has been well spent and I would encourge more input to those areas to help sustain people living on their own holdings.  Somebody recently remarked on the nice houses in the Gaeltacht of west Donegal and wondered where the money came from to pay for it.  I responded by saying that the people were thrifty and looked after themselves.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge, 90 per cent of the houses in the Gaeltacht area are built without loans, grants or other financial support.  These people have a work ethic in their handcrafts, fishing or other activities; they have a thrifty attitude; they are not sitting back waiting for the gravy train.  I enthusiastically support funding for the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Occasionally businesses have not been successful.  In Fintown there is a timber industry which was started by people from outside the Gaeltacht who were enthusiastic about developing the timber industry.  It was wise and proper to support that development and I hope that a rescue package can be arranged for that industry at Fintown.  I strongly urge the <Col N="244" /> Minister to be supportive because this is a native industry and is not dependent on imports.</P>
    <P>Some people try to take advantage of the Gaeltacht.  I will not go into details or identify them.  An industry set up in the Gaeltacht received substantial funding but the raw material came from Japan and the finished product was exported to Germany.  Such an industry is risky in my opinion.  Nevertheless, if one is promoting industry and providing jobs one cannot be selective, one has to take what one gets.  The development plan and the programme to assist projects by Údarás and the Department of the Gaeltacht are great although they have been modest enough about their achievements.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, mentioned the wool industry.  It is sad to see the number of woollen mills like Blarney and Convoy that have closed down; eight woollen mills have closed down and we do not process an important and expensive product that is used throughout the world in garments and carpets.  We have a sheep population of about five million and many of them are in the Gaeltacht area.  I urge the Minister to suport and look for people to set up a wool processing industry.  That is only one area of activity.  We must establish native industries in areas where we get our raw materials.  This can best be done in the Gaeltacht area.  Given the problems experienced by people living on an island off the west coast, they have to be supported.</P>
    <P>We have not been successful in fully developing our important fishing industry. In Ireland there are one and a half on shore jobs for every fisherman at sea whereas in Europe there are six jobs onshore for every fisherman at sea.  We have not succeeded in increasing the number of onshore jobs.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Minister and his Department to recognise the potential for jobs in areas such as fishing industry and the craft industry.  The possibility of such industries surviving in the long term is greater than for, say, multinational concerns who set up here in a flurry of <Col N="245" /> publicity.  I welcome the additional provision which the Bill seeks and I urge the Members to support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, I congratulate you on your appointment. It was obviously a popular appointment among the Members present.  We took a different line; we abstained which is a sign of consent.  I welcome the Minister, a fellow county man and congratulate him on his appointment.  He is a very eloquent person to have as a representative of the Gaeltacht.  He is a Donegal man and Donegal has a strong tradition in relation to the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>What this Bill bears out is the importance of providing jobs in an area such as the Gaeltacht.  It is something which is most important it should be supported. The people of the Gaeltacht have a tradition and culture of their own.  It is an area which has been plagued by emigration down through the years.  This Bill and the development of Údarás na Gaeltacht has helped to stem the tide of emigration in areas such as Donegal, Connemara, Meath and Kerry.  There are all strong Gaeltacht areas.  Keeping people in the Gaeltacht is important and by providing jobs something is being done to retain the culture and warmth which exist in those areas.</P>
      <P>People are at the heart of the Gaeltacht. One can see this every summer when many people come to the Gaeltacht to learn Irish and support the Irish colleges. There is an exodus of people from Northern Ireland who come to learn Irish.  It is an opportunity for young people from Northern Ireland to try to understand our culture and for us to learn from them.  This is something which benefits both communities.</P>
      <P>This year we celebrate the centenary of a well-known Irishman, Peader O'Donnell.  He came from the Rosses, the same area as our Minister and wrote numerous books.  He also talked about the problems of emigration from the Gaeltacht.  This Bill is extremely important in that it will help keep people in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cotter went off on a tangent. <Col N="246" /> He was not talking about Údarás na Gaeltachta but about the budget and Digital, which matters, bear no relation to this Bill.  It is typical of Fine Gael at the moment &mdash; no content and a lot of whinging.  Senator Cotter also mentioned the multinationals.  It is easy to criticise the multinationals but there are good and bad firms.  I invite him to Letterkenny where many jobs are provided by the multinationals in firms such as UNIFI which employs 500 people and possibly another 500 coming onstream.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>The American company Imed in Letterkenny employs 300 people and Fruit of the Loom employ a considerable number.  These are multinationals with a proven track record.  I might not always have been the greatest champion of multinationals but they have been of enormous benefit to the community.</P>
      <P>I return to the area of tourism in the Gaeltacht.  By providing employment in the Gaeltacht, Údarás na Gaeltacht is keeping people in the area.  Wherever there is a strong vibrant community people will come and visit.  Tourism will bring money to the Gaeltacht.  Senator Fitzgerald mentioned the roads.  As a member of Donegal County Council I am not happy with the condition of the roads althought they are probably better than those in other counties.  Money earned from tourism goes a long way to help maintain the roads.  I commend and support this Bill.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, I offer you my congratulations on your appointment.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  I do not claim to be an expert on matters relating to the Gaeltacht. I am a Dubliner but improvements in Gaeltacht areas are of benefit to those living in Dublin also.  The current thinking is that we should support indigenous <Col N="247" /> industries and I have often wondered exactly what that means.  This Bill clearly supports indigenous industries and I am in agreement with that.</P>
      <P>I do not know what remarks were made about Digital but there has been a lot of criticism of multinationals.  One of the positive effects of this Bill is that people can live, work and enjoy a decent standard of living in their own area.  I represent a Dublin area and constituents have come to me asking if they could be re-located in the country because of the quality of life enjoyed in these areas. Hand-in-hand with an improvement in the quality of life must be an improvement in job creation.</P>
      <P>It would be better if we had a more even dispersal of the population in this country.  Approximately one-third of the population is concentrated in the east and in Dublin.  This is not good because there are areas within that region with 60 to 70 per cent unemployment.  These are areas with serious social problems and deprivation, some of which we have seen in the satellite towns in County Dublin.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill and commend it to the House.</P>

        <i>Donegal South-West):</i> Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl do na Seanadóirí go léir a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht thábhachtach seo; na Seanadóirí Cotter, Fitzgerald, Gallagher, McGowan, Maloney, agus McGennis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an Ghaeltacht tábhachtach mar is í tobar na Gaeilge í.  Má tá suim againn i dtodhchaí na Gaeilge, caithfear jobanna a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht.  Ní bhaineann an Ghaeilge le muintir na Gaeltachta amháin.  Tá pobal mór Gaeilge sa tír iomlán agus maireann muintearas agus caidreamh idir na pobail Ghaeltachta agus Ghalltachta.  Tá na mílte daoine sa chathair seo a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge agus a bhfuil baint acu le cúrsaí Gaeilge. Is cairde móra don Ghaeltacht iad.  Is í an Ghaeltacht tobar na Gaeilge agus gan an Ghaeltacht agus gan na jobanna sin ní dóigh liom go mbeidh todhchaí ar bith ag an Ghaeilge.  Tá mise réasúnta sásta go <Col N="248" /> bhfuil todhchaí ag an Ghaeilge agus go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó suime ag muintir na tíre seo sa Ghaeilge sa lá atá inniu ann ná mar a bhí.</P>
    <P>Cruthaíonn ár dteanga rud amháin dúinn, go bhfuil flaitheas againn.  Is deas an rud é dul amach go dtí an Comhphobal nó go dtí cruinnithe den Chomhphobal agus ár dteanga féin againn faoi mar atá ag na Francaigh, na Gearmánaigh, na hIodáiligh nó muintir ar bith eile.  Ba cheart dúinn úsáid a bhaint as an Ghaeilge gach deis a fhaighimid.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Seanadóir Cotter go ginearálta fá dtaobh den Údarás, fá dtaobh den Údarás Fhorbairt Tionscail agus faoi go leor nithe eile.  Dúirt sé gur thug mise ráiteas ar stair Údarás na Gaeltachta agus an méid atá déanta acu gan trácht ar bith ar na polasaithe atá againn ó thaobh na Gaeltachta de.  Ceapaim go raibh sé tábhachtach an méid sin a rá maidir leis an nGaeltacht agus maidir leis na jobanna atá cruthaithe sa Ghaeltacht le blianta beaga anuas, go háirithe ó 1980 tar éis Údarás na Gaeltachta a bhunú.  Deineadh tagairt chomh maith do cé chomh deacair is atá sé do dhaoine agus do chomhlachtaí ón dtír seo agus ó thíortha eile teacht go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus airgead a infheistiú inti.  Táimid ar imeall na hEorpa, nó b'fhéidir gur féidir a rá, ar imeall an domhain, agus caithfear an cúram speisialta sin a thabhairt do Údarás na Gaeltachta chun freastal ar an nGaeltacht agus chun an cuidiú atá riachtanach chun comhlachtaí a mhealladh trí dheontais a chur ar fáil do na daoine sin.</P>
    <P>Níl an oiread sin difríochta idir na deontaisí atá le fáil ó Údarás na Gaeltachta agus ón Údarás Fhorbairt Tionscail. Má fhéachann tú ar na meán-chostais ar jobanna cífear gur £9,130 an meánchostas anuraidh i gcomparáid le £9,800 i 1991 agus £11,470 i 1990.  Má chuireann tú na figiúirí sin i gcomparáid leis na jobanna atá á gcruthú ag an Údarás Fhorbairt Tionscail níl an oiread sin difríochta. Ar ndóigh, tá fadhbanna maidir le infrastructúr agus bóithre sa Ghaeltacht. Is fada an tuaras é ó fhágann tú an teora ag Doire Cholmchille nó Strabane ag dul isteach trí Lifford go dtí Litir Cheanainn agus as sin go dtí an Ghaeltacht, go dtí Ros Ghoill nó na Dúnaibh <Col N="249" /> nó go dtí iarthar an chontae.  Agus tá sé ag éirí níos deacra mar tá orainn bunábhair a cheannach taobh amuigh den tír agus iad a thabhairt isteach, a phróiseáil agus a allmhairiú arís.  Dá bhrí sin, tá an ceart ag na Seanadóirí a dúirt gur chóir béim a chur ar na hachmhainní nádúrtha atá againn deis ar bith a fhaighimid.  Sin an polasaí atá againn.  Luaim an tionscal turasóireachta, iascaireacht, talmhaíocht agus na tionscail sin go léir ach go háirithe tionscal na hiascaireachta agus na turasóireachta. Ar ndóigh, níl na cúraimí sin ag Údarás na Gaeltachta go fóill, ach faoi mar adúirt mé cheana, tá mé báúil cúraimí breise a thabhairt do Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Tá sé sin á phlé idir an Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta anois agus an Roinn Turasóireachta agus beidh sé á phlé againn arís amach anseo.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil go leor jobanna cruthaithe ansin toisc go bhfuil siad bunaithe ar na hacmhainní nádúrtha atá againn agus caithfear forbairt a dhéanamh air sin.  Dúirt an Seanadóir Cotter go gcaithfimid súil ghéar a choinneáil ar an Údarás.  Is ceantar mór fairsing í an Ghaeltacht ach níl an oiread sin daoine ina gcónaí ann.  Bím féin agus m'Aire an Teachta Higgins agus bhí Airí roimhe sin i dteangbháil go rialta, beagnach gach uile lá, leis an Údarás, le feidhmeannaigh an Údaráis agus le comhaltaí Bhord an Údaráis, agus beimid ag leanúint ar aghaidh leis sin.  Labhair an Seanadóir Fitzgerald faoi na deacrachtaí infrastructure atá againn.  Ar ndóigh, tagann sé sin faoi chúram an Roinn Comhshaoil ach tá suim againn ann agus déanfar gach iarracht chun an infrastructure a chur in ord ionas go mbeidh daoine sásta teacht isteach agus infheistiú a dhéanamh. Luadh tionscal an olainn.  B'fhéidir nach bhfuil an oiread sin taithí agam ar an dtionscal sin ach tá an oiread seo taithí agam: go bhfuil sé deacair an tionscal olainn a fhorbairt os rud é go bhfuil coimhlint ghéar ann i láthair na huaire mar gheall ar na synthetics.  Tá an choimhlint ghéar sin ag éirí níos measa.  Beidh deis agam castáil le feidhmeannaigh an Údaráis agus is cinnte go bpléifear an cheist sin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="250" /> Thug an Seanadóir Gallagher léiriú ghinearálta dúinn maidir leis an mBille seo agus ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl di as ucht an méid a bhí le rá aici, maidir leis an Ghaeltacht agus cé chomh tábhachtach is atá an Bille seo don Ghaeltacht agus do Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Seanadóir McGowan an pointe céanna arís maidir le acmhainní nádúrtha.  Luaigh sé an Ghaeltacht Lár agus Baile na Finne agus tionscal na foraoiseachta. Táimid ag déanamh ár ndícheall chun forbairt a dhéanamh ar na hacmhainní sin.  Ní jobanna sealadacha amháin atá uainn.  Cé go bhfuil jobanna sealadacha agus jobanna pháirtaimseartha &mdash; ar ndóigh tá difríocht idir jobanna shealadacha agus jobanna pháirtaimseartha &mdash; táimid ag déanamh ár ndícheall jobanna bhuana a chruthú don Ghaeltacht.  Ag deireadh na bliana seo caite bhí suas le 5,652 dhuine fostaithe go lánaimseartha i dtionscail sa Ghaeltacht a fuair cuidiú ó Údarás na Gaeltachta thar na blianta i gcomparáid le 5,597 sa bhliain roimhe sin.  Chomh maith leis sin táimíd ag fanacht anois ar na jobanna agus na tograí atá ceadaithe againn.  Deirtear nuair a bheidh na tograí sin faoi lán seol go mbeidh 1,440 jobanna cruthaithe.  Táimid ag súil leis na jobanna sin os rud é gurb iad an dífhostaíocht agus an imirce na fadhbanna is mó atá againn sa Ghaeltacht.  Glacaimidne sa Roinn agus in Údarás na Gaeltachta go bhfuil an fhadhb níos measa, b'fhéidir, sa Ghaeltacht ná mar atá sí in áit ar bith eile sa tír, agus caithfear, mar sin, gach uile chuidiú a thabhairt don Údarás.</P>
    <P>Dobfhéidir a fhiafraí an bhfuil an Rialtas seo dáiríre faoin nGaeilge, agus faoi jobanna a chruthú sa Ghaeltacht. Tá léiriú ar dháiríreacht an Rialtais sna Meastacháin a foilsíodh an tseachtain seo caite.  Sa bhliain 1992, cuireadh £15.694 mhilliún ar fáil do chaiteachas reatha agus i bhfoirm deontas agus airleacan don Údarás.  I mbliana, ainneoin fadhbanna airgeadais na tíre, tá méadú tagtha ar airgead na Gaeltachta.  Cuirfear £19.293 mhilliún ar fáil, breis is £3.5 mhilliún d'árdú ar suim na bliana seo caite.</P>
    <P>Tá 1,400 jobanna nua, beagnach, sa <Col N="251" />&ldquo;pipeline&rdquo; mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Cotter agus tá súil agam go mbeidh siad ar fáil idir 1993 agus 1994.</P>
    <P>Fear as Contae Dhún na nGall is ea an Seanadóir Maloney agus tá a fhois aige mar atá ag na Seanadóirí eile, cé chomh tábhachtach is atá an Ghaeltacht.  Tá áthas orm go bhfuil gach duine anseo chomh báúil sin leis an nGaeltacht, cé gur dóigh liom nach bhfuil ach duine amháin eile, seachas mé féin, ina chónaí sa Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> In page 4, line 19 after &ldquo;functions&rdquo;, to add the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any grants paid by the Minister to An tÚdarás under the terms of this section may be reclaimed by the Minister if circumstances arise which warrant such action.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will put my mind at ease on this matter but I decided to table this recommendation because a quick scan of the original 1979 Act brought to my attention that the Minister did not seem to have the power to require An tÚdarás to repay grants made by the Minister.  The recommendation probably does not read very well but may convey my intention.</P>
    <P>The world in which we live is becoming quite complicated.  White collar crime is rampant.  I do not suggest that the personnel of An tÚdarás would involve themselves in criminal activities but the Minister might, sometime, need to take immediate action.  It should be possible for him to do so under the legislation rather than have to go through the courts which might take longer.  It is difficult for me to come up with an example of circumstances which would force the Minister to take action of this kind but such circumstances could arise.</P>
    <P>This example probably stretches the imagination but if a bogus set of estimates was submitted by An tÚdarás and the Minister then discovered that a body or bodies was helping itself to State cash, he could take immediate action by requiring An tÚdarás to return moneys to him. This provision, if adopted, might also serve as a deterrent from dishonest behaviour.</P>
    <P>If the Minister can assure me that power to recall moneys is already contained in legislation governing An tÚdarás I will be happy to withdraw this recommendation.</P>

Ní féidir liom glacadh leis an leasú a thabharfadh isteach nós nua maidir le deontais-i-gcabhair a thabhairt ní hamháin don Údarás ach do bhord Stáit ar bith.  Nuair a thugann an tÚdarás deontas do chomhlacht, tig leis i gcúinsí áirithe an deontas sin a lorg arais agus déantar é sin ó am go chéile. Íocann an Roinn an deontas-i-gcabhair leis an Údarás i dtráthchodanna de ghnáth in aghaidh na míosa, mar chosaint.</P>
      <P>Tagann an leasú seo salach ar an gcóras bord Stáit atá leagtha amach don Údarás agus do bhoird eile.</P>
      <P>De réir alt 20 d'Acht Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, tabharfaidh an tÚdarás don Aire aon eolas a iarrfaidh an tAire ó am go ham maidir le comhlíonadh feidhmeanna an Údaráis.  Chomh maith leis sin bíonn feidhmeannaigh na Roinne i dteagmháil laethúil leis an Údarás. Nuair a shínítear conradh idir an Údarás agus comhlacht ar bith, bíonn coinníolacha iomadúla ann.  Mar shampla, le blianta beaga anuas tá deontais do chomhlachtaí ceangailte le soláthar jobanna. Má gheallann comhlacht go gcuirfear uimhir áirithe job ar fáil, tá deis &ldquo;claw-back&rdquo; ag an Údarás.  Más léir go bhfuil caimiléireacht ar bun ag comhlacht ar bith is féidir a ndeontas a lorg arais.</P>
      <P>Is dóigh liom go bhfuil dóthain cosanta sa Bhille.  Tuigim pointe an Seanadóir Cotter ach ón eolas atá agam ní gá an leasú a mholann sé.</P>

      <P>I am to a degree.  I suspected that was the case even though I did not find the provision when I glanced through the Bill.  I suspected there was adequate protection for the Minister's interests within the Bill.  The section to which the Minister refers states that an tÚdarás will supply to the Minister any information regarding the performance of functions which he may require from time to time but that does not address the point I want addressed.  I think the Minister should have power to withdraw or seek to recover grants paid.  If the <Col N="254" /> Minister discovered in two years time that an tÚdarás was carrying out its functions in an improper way, under this legislation I cannot see that he has the power to disband an tÚdarás.  That power may well be there but I did not notice it when I was reading.  If that situation arose, how would he handle it?</P>

      <P>Tá dhá cheist anseo.  Deir an Seanadóir go mba cheart go mbeadh an chumhacht ag an Roinn airgead a lorg ar ais ón Údarás.  Bhí mise ag déanamh an phointe chomh maith go bhfuil coinníollacha le comhlíonadh sula n-íocann an tÚdarás airgead amach ach níor shin pointe an tSeanadóra ina leasú.</P>
      <P>I mbliana, beidh an Roinn ag íoc £7.15 mhilliún leis an Údarás i bhfoirm deontas agus £9.8 milliún i bhfoirm airleacan.  Tar éis an Bhille seo dul tríd agus é a bheith sínithe ag an Uachtarán, beidh an £9.8 milliún d'airleacain ag dul chuig an Údarás faoin bhfotheideal céanna leis na deontais.</P>
      <P>Ní íoctar an £17 milliún ag tús na bliana ach i dtráthchodanna, b'fhéidir in aghaidh na míosa ag brath ar an éileamh ón Údarás.  Níl fadhb againn sa ghné seo agus bímid i dteangmháil rialta leis an Údarás.  Ní dóigh liom go dtarlóidh an rud a luaigh an Seanadóir agus tá dóthain cosanta chuige i mBille 1979.</P>

      <P>I share the major disappointment and the trauma caused to the people of Galway by these job losses.  One can only sympathise with the loyal and committed work-force who have a record second to none of performance and quality over the last 22 years.  Digital, Galway, is a classic example of a company putting down deep roots in the community in a variety of ways.  This makes these job losses all the worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 780 jobs scheduled to go over the next 12 months are no reflection on the knowledge and skills of the workforce but are the result of the harsh trading conditions of the 1990s.  Digital is trading on a global scene characterised by spectacular advances in technology and changes in customer preferences.  The decision, as we have been told in the statement from <Col N="256" /> Digital today, is a strategic one based on commercial criteria only, unrelated to the performance and quality of the work-force.</P>
    <P>As a company it is at the cutting edge of modern human resource management. In that context, I would like to put on record my personal thanks to Digital who accommodated my post-graduate students at UCD over many years, who studied human resource management in that company.  They have always treated people as a most important resource and integrated them into the other branches of the business.</P>
    <P>Top management have always treated people as a key resource, that is their basic philosophy.  They have invested heavily in careful recruitment selection and training; they have put a great value on improving the skills of the workforce. The nature of the industry lent itself to team work and to employee involvement and in a very real way Digital was a model of worker participation.</P>
    <P>They have integrated themselves into the local community by supporting a whole range of local activities and, in particular &mdash; and I know this is near to the Minister's heart whom I welcome on her first visit to the new Seanad &mdash; they were linked to the local economy.  Last year, the committee dealing with unemployment, of which I was a member, estimated that £1 billion worth of imports to multinationals could be produced in Ireland, providing valuable jobs.  Here we had a case, albeit in very difficult circumstances, where there was a linkage between local production of parts and components and the major employer, Digital, in Galway.  It is a good example of what can be achieved in terms of linkage. As I said, Digital supported a variety of local efforts and funded and was involved in research at UCG.</P>
    <P>We have a very dynamic and difficult industrial environment.  We have to know and understand that environment because, of the EC countries, we are the most dependent on exports and it is vital for us to be competitive.  There is cutthroat competition for international mobile investment.  There have been <Col N="257" /> spectacular advancements in technology and Digital has been affected by shifts in customer demand and preference.  Digital like so many other industries, has been affected by the slow-down in the international economy in recession.  Six years ago there was investment in the Ayr, Scotland, plant which gives them a edge at this stage.  Worldwide, Digital has lost heavily in the last two years.  At the end of the day, commercial decisions are leading to job losses and this is not a reflection on a gifted workforce.</P>
    <P>The question has risen as to whether the Government and its agencies could have done any more.  I do not think they could.  The visit to Boston by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, over the weekend was an important part of a very comprehensive effort made by the Government.  I know that last Monday week the Taoiseach spoke directly by telephone to Mr. Palmer, head of Digital worldwide, pressing our case.  The IDA has been tireless in its efforts on the industrial front, monitoring what is going on at Digital and helping with further incentives.  The Government and the IDA have put the facts, the money and the arguments to Digital.  We have, in economic terms at least &mdash; and that is very important &mdash; matched Scotland in every way.</P>
    <P>We have a proven record of attracting industry to Ireland which sells into the European market.  We do have competitive advantages here.  Several electronics leaders are located in this country and export into the EC from here. However, Digital wanted a manufacturing presence where they have a big indigenous market.  A quarter of its European sales are in the UK and it clearly had a need for a manufacturing unit there.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future we know there will be a gradual phase out, of about 12 months.  We know already from the Digital statement that they will provide a financial package and benefits for those who will lose their jobs.  We saw the same enlightened approach when the plant at Clonmel was closed.  We also know they are going to retain and upgrade their European software headquarters in <Col N="258" /> Galway with 350 jobs.  That is a vote of confidence, a reaffirmation, in the quality of Ireland and our software sector.</P>
    <P>To offset the job losses the IDA, under the aegis of the Government, will increase their efforts to provide incentives to stimulate new and to expand existing small companies in the Galway area.  It is important to find employment opportunities for these highly skilled and knowledgeable people who are about to be made redundant.  It is also important, particularly in the light of the Culliton report, to search for employment opportunities in indigenous industries so that the skills of these industrial workers can be utilised here.  In that context, I am reminded of the budget yesterday, where £25 million was allocated to the county enterprise boards, together with £100 million that will be made available from the financial institutions on favourable terms, for local enterprises.  This money may provide timely venture capital required for small enterprises in Galway and elsewhere, to utilise the skills of these qualified people.</P>
    <P>I share the deep concern and regret expressed at these job losses and look forward with some optimism to the future.  The Government and its agencies will spare no effort to replace the jobs lost and to retain the experienced workforce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Digital has been an integral part of Galway city and county for over 20 years.  I have lived beside this large complex and have taken great satisfaction in its phenomenal growth and contribution to Galway city and county. Today, without a shadow of a doubt, is the saddest day, not only of my political but of my personal life also.  Digital has been the fulcrum not only of Galway but of west of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking here about the loss of 800 jobs and the spin-off effect on over 3,000 families &mdash; minders of Digital employees' children and workers in office suppliers, car hire firms, care hire rental, taxi services, buses, milk suppliers, canteens, garages and flower shops.  In my own parish &mdash; a typical rural one &mdash; of Turloughmore in County Galway, about <Col N="259" /> one tenth of the working population will become redundant, many of whom have young families and heavy mortgages. Another western parish will be decimated. I shudder to think of the consequences of today's events in Galway. We are witnessing another striking blow to the west; the death knell of another town.  I mean &ldquo;town&rdquo; because, without Digital, Galway city will be reduced to the status of a country town.</P>
    <P>There will be a shade of sadness and gloom on that sun tonight as it goes down on Galway Bay.  This is not the time for apportioning blame, but today's events are certainly not the fault of the marvellous workforce who have contributed so much to Digital International over the last two decades.  The Digital workers worked far and beyond the call of duty. They made a major contribution to Digital, and to Galway city and its surrounds. It is incumbent on the Government to respond to the call of Galway above any other call that may be made on it at this moment.  Galway is crying out for help and every means at the Government's disposal must be used to find a replacement industry immediately.</P>
    <P>The IDA and the county enterprise board must be put on alert to find suitable replacement industry for Galway, and for the west.  There is a special onus on the Ministers of the Galway West constituency to impress upon the Cabinet and upon their colleagues that Galway must be first in line for the next major industry, or foreign company to set up in Ireland.  Galway's spirit of enterprise, location and workforce are second to none.  Government initiative on a replacement industry is of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister and thank her for coming.  I would like to ask her a few questions.  Is she prepared to put Galway at the top of the priority list for the next major industry?  Has the Minister been in touch with Mr. Major, outlining our concern about alleged political interference in the choice of Ayr in place of Galway?  Has our Government impressed upon Mr. Heseltine and Mr. Major the <Col N="260" /> possible implications of this development for Anglo-Irish relations?  Will a case be taken to the European Commission arising out of allegations concerning Digital? Are the Minister and the Minister for Labour committed to finding a replacement industry for Galway, and is there any possibility that one may be available at the moment?  Can we hope for a formal announcement on this soon?</P>
    <P>I am not going to criticise anybody; this is too sad a time for recrimination. The Government's handling of the recent currency crisis and the calling of an unnecessary general election have not helped.  It was ironic that most of the British up-staging took place as our current Government leaders were jostling for power.  The Government were not as sharp as the country would have liked them to be on this issue in this period of crucial importance for Galway.  Our senior Galway Ministers have been strangely quiet on this issue which is why it is now incumbent on the Government to respond to the plight of Galway.</P>
    <P>This is Galway's gloomiest day but a new dawn of hope must be created for the city.  The Government must act; we are no longer content with pious aspirations and platitudes.  The previous speaker attempted to minimise the blow to Galway but today's events spell a disaster for the west.  I regret that my maiden speech in the Seanad should be made in this context.  I consider today's speech to be the most important Seanad speech I will ever make.</P>
    <P>Tá díomá ormsa agus ar mhuintir na Gaillimhe inniu gan dóchas.  Tá an chathair i gcruachás agus ní bheidh an chabhair riachtanach le fáil acu ach amháin ón Rialtas.  Tá dóchas i mo chroí go ndéanfaidh an Rialtas iarracht mhór ar son contae agus cathair na Gaillimhe agus go háirithe ar son oibrithe Digital atá ag cailleadh 800 post faoi láthair.  Is é seo an lá is brónaí i stair na Gaillimhe.</P>
    <P>I hope for an early and positive response to Galway's suffering at the loss of 800 jobs at Digital.</P>

      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the Seanad.  Like so many in this House and throughout the country, especially in Galway, I was saddened to hear the news of the loss of 800 jobs in Digital.  While not altogether unexpected, the news had a devastating effect on all of us when it finally came through from Boston.</P>
      <P>This is not a time for playing politics on this issue or for trying to make political capital out of the unfortunate plight of these 800 workers.  On the contrary, it is a time for unity among all Members of the Oireachtas and for a positive rather than a negative response to this great tragedy.  We should listen to the advice of Ms Janet Hughes a SIPTU representative in Galway who, although not representing the Digital workers, in expressing her concern for the plight of the workers as a trade union representative in the area appealed for restraint from destructive point scoring. She urged that we talk, and I quote: &ldquo;not about what others have done to us but about what we can now do for ourselves&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The announcement was not unexpected. As can be seen from a brief look at the background to this event, the computer industry throughout the world has been undergoing rapid change and upheaval over the past four or five years. The market leaders in the field, IBM, Wang and Digital, have all suffered great losses and these losses have caused them to lose their leading places in the computer world.  We have also seen the emergence, as major players, of companies like Del and Apple.  In this volatile world relocation and casualties are inevitable, and today we saw the huge loss of jobs in the Galway area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The writing has been on the wall for the Digital company for some time.  Two years ago the company closed its Clonmel plant with a loss of approximately 300 jobs.  This was a major loss to Clonmel. It was part of a worldwide cut which saw the loss of approximately 35,000 jobs worldwide in the industry.  Unfortunately, <Col N="262" /> multinational companies are here to make profits and they make decisions clinically on the basis of what is good for the company.  Given this background, there was little or nothing the Government could do to effectively stave off today's sad development.  Digital has been losing massive amounts of money and it is to be regretted that the Galway workers, through no fault of their own, are casualties of the financial situation. That is the basic reason for today's announcement.</P>
    <P>Instead of having a lengthy <i>post mortem</i> on the situation, we would be better employed in trying to find alternative industries to absorb the 800 unemployed workers.  While these workers will receive redundancies and pay-related unemployment benefit, these payments are a very poor substitute for regular, well-paid employment.</P>
    <P>This House can be assured that my party will do all we can to preserve the remaining jobs in Digital and to seek alternative employment for the 800 workers in Galway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend a welcome to the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke and thank her for coming to the House this afternoon to discuss the Digital crisis in Galway.  Senator Cregan and I share a common history in this matter in so far as Cork suffered a more traumatic experience in terms of employment when Dunlop and Ford went within a very short time of each other.  Cork fell into the trap of feeling that it was not simply that two factories had closed with the huge social implications; in some way the feeling was that Cork had been hit by an atomic bomb.  For a long time it was quite impossible to get Cork to be positive about anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We followed the same road with appeals to the Americans in relation to Ford.  The fact that Henry Ford was born in Ballydehob led some people to believe that one could go to a boardroom in Detroit and argue on that basis.  The reality as we all know, despite what may be said, is that decisions taken by multinationals are not taken on the basis of <Col N="263" /> historical links with any country.  The decision taken by the Digital management was based on what they saw to be in the best interests of their company. It matters not a whit whether there was a currency crisis in this country in relation to the Irish punt or whether the Government spent six months putting itself together rather than six weeks, or indeed any of the other factors.  While Government may have an ability to attract industry by way of attractive packaging and so on, it has very little control over a decision by a multinational company to go somewhere else.  If the IDA is successful in attracting &ldquo;mobile industry&rdquo;, it remains mobile forever.  That is the reality.</P>
    <P>Digital has been here for 20 years which is a long time for the computer industry.  We were hoping that Apple computers would remain in Cork forever. We had a crisis less than 12 months ago and, luckily, the decision was made in our favour.  Tonight they are celebrating in Scotland but, equally, Scotland could have been devastated if a different decision had been made.  It is outside the scope of Government to influence in any significant way the economic decisions made by multinational companies.</P>
    <P>Some criticism was made of the trip to Boston by the Minister, Deputy Quinn. There would have been a torrent of criticism if he had not gone.  Ministers, generally speaking, would not take a plane trip to speak to a board if the IDA and other experts indicated to them the importance of going if there was to be any chance of changing people's minds. There is very little a Government can do once a decision is made in a boardroom in Detroit, New York or Texas to relocate or to close down a factory.</P>
    <P>It is important for Galway to realise, as Senator O'Sullivan said, that it is pointless to attack the company because that will seem as if their contribution over the past 20 years, a most significant contribution, has been written off.</P>
    <P>Another positive point is that Digital is remaining in Galway.  Therefore, there is hope for the future.  Their R and D <Col N="264" /> section, as it grew once, can grow again as the markets change throughout the world.  There is a need on all sides of the House to understand the problems.  As much as we deplore the closure of a major part of that factory, there is also the need to welcome the fact that Digital have remained in Ireland, albeit in a very reduced form.  Nonetheless, 350 jobs is a significant number in any area.</P>
    <P>As regards the message we send to the workers in Galway tonight, it is that the Government must and will respond.  If there is an 800 job plant in the pipeline I would like to know where it has been because we could do with it in many parts of the country, including my own city. The budget was designed to respond to unemployment not just in Galway but throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I hope the Minister will address seriously the situation regarding the research and development area in Digital which is very closely allied with the university.  The value of this cannot be under-estimated.  The experience gained with Digital was important for graduates of Galway University.  The availability of research and development facilities is important in our efforts to encourage other companies to set up in Ireland.  As the withdrawal of Digital from Galway will take sometime there may be an opportunity to exploit the research and development facilities in the area.  I have always advocated the provision of such facilities and I have worked in this area with pharmaceutical companies in the hope that it would help them keep a foothold in this market.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the Minister's constant preoccupation with better training for people in every sphere of employment and I urge her to make this a most important part of all her efforts for the people in Digital.  If some of Digital's expensive operations are kept in Galway and we show we are behind it from an educational point of view, this could be one area where we could put pressure on the Government.</P>

      <P>May I also welcome the Minister.  It was Senator McDonagh who said this is Galway's gloomiest day and, indeed, it is.  I suggest that we look to the future rather than the past.  It is not sufficient for us to attract industry here, we have to create the environment that keeps industry here and recognise that we live in a competitive world, where no industry survives unless it manages to maintain and hold unto its customers and basic bankers.  It is not easy for any industry &mdash; whether it is a small shopkeeper, a one person trader or a large multinational &mdash; to do both but those who survive do both.  If we have a task to do in Leinster House it is to help run that company called &ldquo;Ireland Inc.&rdquo; and recognise that if we want customers we must look to those people, whether individuals or large industries, who are going to set up <Col N="266" /> here and create business and, therefore, create jobs.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that we have not always recognised that.  We believed that it is up to the Government to create jobs. I suggest that we remember the words President Clinton used a couple of weeks ago when he said it was his belief that it was a government's duty to steer, not to row.  If we are going to attract successful enterprises in future, we, in this House, have to recognise that our functions is to listen to our customers and see what we can do for those who may be attracted to establish industries here.  I hope many of them will have their roots in Ireland and will establish industries here because the environment is suitable for their purposes. I hope that what we have learned from this sad day in Galway will give us not just food for thought but fuel for action.  I hope I remember correctly: &ldquo;éist le fuaim na habhann agus gheobhaidh tú iasc&rdquo;, &ldquo;listen to the sound of the river if you want to catch a fish.&rdquo;  As a nation, we should recognise the marketplace is like that river.  If we create the environment that attracts industries here.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister well in her new position.  I am aware that she is conscious of the impact this closure will have not only on Galway but throughout the region.  The economic impact of the Digital closure will affect many families and the economies of many towns in counties adjoining Galway.  The laying off of personnel will have a major detrimental economic impact on the region and will cause distress and hardship for the many families employed in this and in ancillary industries.  It is important that we look to the future but it is equally important to remember that many families are very distressed by what has happened. All the resources of the State must be available to ensure that the people directly affected by the closure will be taken care of pending alternative arrangements being put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major challenges facing industry today are keeping abreast of the changes in technology and ensuring a supply of <Col N="267" /> trained personnel who are capable of dealing with these changes.  It is vital that all the State agencies would provide scientific and technological advice and that capital resources would be made available for retraining so that these highly skilled people can find employment, perhaps not in the same type of industry but in new ventures.  We must salvage as many jobs as possible in Digital.</P>
    <P>As has been said by many speakers already, the closure will have a devastating effect on the economy of the region.  Nevertheless, I think the regions are capable of dealing with this situation. I would like to express appreciation for the endeavours of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, the Mayor of Galway and all the public representatives from Galway and other counties who have spoken about the necessity to take urgent action to deal with this crisis.  We need to mobilise all the goodwill that exists at this time.</P>
    <P>Over the years at Shannon and in my constituency of Clare we have had many closures which impacted severely on these areas.  Recently, a multinational withdrew from Shannon leaving many people unemployed.  Under new management that company is stronger today than ever.  It formed a partnership with an American company, and this reorganised, modernised, sophisticated plant at Shannon now provides employment for many more people than were originally employed there.  We must look to the future and find ways to utilise the highly skilled personnel in Galway and adjoining counties.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to use her influence with the Industrial Development Authority, the State agencies in the technological and training area and, if necessary, the European Community to provide support to deal with this crisis which will have a severe impact on the economy of the area.  We must not allow this crisis to further depress the economy of the region.  We must find ways in which we can cope with the crisis and find hope <Col N="268" /> from what is a very sad situation at this time.  Let us find immediate and urgent solutions to the problem and let us not neglect the people who are highly skilled, professional and up to date in their work at the plant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I declare my interest in this matter.  My husband is an employee of Digital in Galway.  I put it to you and to this House that this is not just a closure in Galway, this is a transfer <Col N="269" /> of the Galway operation to Ayr eventually. The plant in Ayr is producing hardware at the lower end of the market. What is being produced in Galway is hardware at the medium to high end of the market.  Four weeks ago the Galway factory was safe, today it is being closed.</P>
      <P>The question has to be addressed in this House: why is the Galway factory being closed?  The reality is that there was political interference in the United Kingdom and our Government was not alert and was not <i>au fait</i> with the situation. They were far more concerned with making arrangements regarding Ministers and programme managers; they were more concerned with their personal and inter-party shenanigans rather than the national interest and the interests of Digital employees in Galway and in Counties Mayo, Clare, Roscommon and Westmeath.  That is the reality.  It is most unfortunate such a serious situation was allowed to develop.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister speak on the matter in the Dáil.  He spoke about being in daily contact with Digital since he took office and, despite all the Government's efforts, of being unable to dissuade Digital from leaving Galway.  The facts are that there was a very poor showing made by this Government in attempting to dissuade Digital.  The first serious political approach was when the Minister travelled to Boston last Saturday morning, two days after the decision to close Digital had already been made in Maynard. I find that type of behaviour hypocritical in the extreme and completely negligent. We had the Minister travelling to Boston after the decision had been made merely to create the illusion that something was being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The workers in Galway deserve very serious consideration in relation to this matter because they are the most excellent workforce in the Digital corporation. In all assessments, at managerial, workforce and productivity levels, they have been at the top in Europe.  They were the jewel of Digital in Europe.  In fact, in the last quarter or the previous quarter they outshone the best plant in the United States of America; yet, it is now being <Col N="270" /> closed.  Is that not poor compensation for the unfortunate people who have given of their best, who have worked diligently, conscientiously and unselfishly in the interest of Digital in Galway?  Today they lose their jobs with hardly a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This Government was not in a position to argue coherently and cogently the strong points that could have been made. I listened to the Minister in the Dáil at Question Time yesterday telling us what he did when he went to Boston.  I could only think, what hope had we when such a weak case was made.  The facts are that this Government failed at European level last week to put strongly to the Commission the irregularity that had occurred.  We had our EC Commissioner, Mr. Flynn on television, again creating the political illusion that something was being done.  The reality was the Government did not put enough effort into their attempts to put our case to Europe. There was a very strong lever there for the Government to use and they failed to use it.</P>
    <P>They also failed to highlight to people at Digital headquarters the considerable tax incentives that exist here.  They failed to emphasise the expertise and talent of the experienced workforce here.  In consequence the entire work in the medium to high range hardware will be transferred to a plant in Ayr in Scotland where the people there had neither the experience, the equipment nor the expertise necessary for the job.  The facts are, the lower end of the market used to be produced by Digital in Ballybrit and the workforce in Galway had the expertise to take on what was being produced in Ayr but, again, the Government could not persuade the company to take that course.</P>
    <P>It is a serious reflection on the Government. They have been caught napping at a crucial time in the economy of the west of Ireland and at a crucial time in the nation's economy.  We are in a crisis.  It is not just a question of 800 jobs being phased out within the next year.  As Senator McDonagh said, approximately another 2,000 jobs are dependent on Digital.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="271" /> With such a huge loss of jobs, the IDA and the other agencies will have to concentrate on Galway.  In turn, that will affect other areas, including unemployment blackspots, in Cork, Clare, Dublin and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>What has happened in Digital, combined with the debacle of the devaluation of the punt, has added greatly to the problems of the country.  The Government must take responsibility, and specific Ministers must take responsibility.  I am not referring to the Minister in this House today because I have high regard for Deputy O'Rourke.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the two Ministers in Galway city must take responsibility.  One Minister in particular, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, was far more interested in what was happening in Mullaghmore, whether a building should be erected.  That was his interest, while in his own constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is the reality. <Col N="272" /> There is still an opportunity to scale down the plant over the next 12 months.  The Taoiseach should take himself to the United States, meet senior Irish American politicians and the senior people in Digital in Maynard Massachusetts.</P>
      <P>There are many other issues I am not prepared to put on the record but the Taoiseach, the Minister for Employment and Enterprise and the IDA should be aware of them and should use them to strengthen their bargaining position. They do not, unfortunately, seem to have used all the bargaining power available to them, which is of little succour to the people of Galway.  I hope a message will be sent from this House to ask the Taoiseach to make a further attempt before the scale down process starts, to retrieve the situation.  That should not be impossible. Certain political developments in the United Kingdom associated with the job losses at Digital must be seriously followed up at European Commission level immediately.</P>

      <P>I welcome all the new Senators, to this lovely Chamber and I wish them well in the years ahead.  It is a reflection of the anxiety caused by developments at Digital that this matter is currently being debated by the other House also.  Charges are often unfairly levied at the Seanad &mdash; I was a Senator for two terms &mdash; that it is not relevant to current developments, does not take issues on the hoof, so to speak.  This is not so on this occasion.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, is present for the debate in the other House.  I chose to hear what people had to say before making my response.  I would like to thank those who contributed, Senators Hillery, McDonagh, O'Sullivan, Magner, Henry, Quinn, Daly and Taylor-Quinn.  I also thank those who did not get a chance to contribute; I know, from their alert expressions that many would have wished to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The loss of 800 jobs at Digital is a serious and saddening issue, on which we are all agreed.  I understand the feelings <Col N="273" /> of Senators McDonagh and Taylor-Quinn in particular on the matter; the former from Turloughmore in the west of Ireland and the latter with a particular interest in the western matter.</P>
    <P>We all share a same sense of desolation on this issue.  Ireland is a small country, and at this time we all feel close to the west.  As you know a Chathaoirligh for us in the midlands, Galway is literally down the road and workers in County Westmeath commute daily to Galway and to Digital.</P>
    <P>We are at one on this issue and when we debated it in the Dáil on Tuesday I proposed framing a composite, agreed motion because I did not see why different messages should emanate from the debating Chambers when all want to do the best for Galway.  I realise that two days have passed and today's announcement indicates that developments have taken place in that time.  I was struck by Senator Henry's mention of research and development.  We have a chance now, in the 12 months scaling down period, to put every effort into, the maintenance and enhancement of that facility which is to remain at the Digital plant.  If the IDA, Eolas, Bord Trachtála and all associated State agencies applied their muscle and might it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the centre of research expertise and excellence, which was built up through the company's links with University College Galway, the Regional Technical College and other agencies there, can be developed further.  Surely the accumulated expertise should not be contained solely within that group of albeit highly skilled workers who will, as of now, remain in Digital.</P>
    <P>Digital reaffirmed today that the Galway plant will be upgraded to become one of its two global locations for software development and that this new development will be phased in.  In addition, the IDA has clearly said &mdash; Kieran McGowan spoke on radio and television today &mdash; that it aims to make replacement industries for Galway an immediate priority.  I have been asked by Senator McDonagh if that is the aim of the Government.  Yes, it is.  The Government's <Col N="274" /> aim, and that of the agencies concerned, is to channel all energies and resources available into enlarging the remaining facilities, and finding replacement industries to re-employ the people leaving Digital, who as all speakers have said, are a highly resourceful and motivated workforce.</P>
    <P>As we debate the issue here we feel a sense of kinship nationwide with those affected by what has happened at Digital. The overwhelming message from this debate will be that Government Ministers and Dáil Deputies must commit themselves through combined efforts to bringing pressure to bear on appropriate authorities.  No one should leave here thinking that this debate is over.  I know a Chathaoirligh that you and your fellow Senators will ensure that that will be the way forward.</P>
    <P>Kieran McGowan, the IDA's Managing Director, has said that the subcontractors to Digital will remain the preferred suppliers to the Ayr facility.  That may seem a small point but it is significant. We must ensure that this becomes a firm commitment, not just two lines in a press release.  The suppliers to Digital in Galway must become, not the preferred suppliers, but the real ones. That is not too much to ask in the overall context of developments at Digital.</P>
    <P>I pledge the following; an unremitting, relentless effort by everyone concerned, in Government and State agencies, to enhance the remaining facility at Digital with the possibility of making it a world facility, serving not only Digital but supplying related components to other firms and plants.  I also pledge that every effort will be made, sustained and followed through by the Government and its agencies to locate alternative plants and industries in Galway so that, within the scale down time frame announced by Digital, substitute employment will be made available and extra jobs created if possible.</P>
    <P>Throughout the debate we heard justifiable expressions of anger from Senators about certain tactics of the UK Government on this issue.  This afternoon the EC Competition Commissioner, <Col N="275" /> Karel Van Miert has acceded to the Government's request and will now formally seek information from the UK authorities in regard to the allegations made.  One might say, &ldquo;So what?&rdquo;  This matter was brought up by Senators and all allegations will now be thoroughly investigated.  The publication of the results of this investigation will ensure that wrong actions, if revealed, do not recur.</P>
    <P>Finally, and this is not an adversarial tactic against my colleague, Senator Taylor-Quinn, whose strong feelings on this matter I recognise, it was not lack of effort by any Minister, past or present, which led to the Digital decision.  I have read all the relevant background information and I have been fully briefed on this matter and I can truthfully say that there was no softening, weakening, lack of knowledge, no cop-out.  As Mr. Kieran McGowan said on radio today, there was a clear understanding until two or three weeks ago that the facility would be fully retained.  We put forward a strong case based on the experience and level of commitment of the workforce and on the equipment already at the plant.  I am not known as a person who defends for the sake of defence, but I repeat, there was no lack of commitment on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>However, that is in the past.  Now, we must face the task ahead of us which is to ensure that Galway resumes its rightful place as the centre of excellence in the computer world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the emergency which has arisen at the Longford-Westmeath General Hospital in Mullingar, <Col N="276" /> I urge this House to bear with me so that I can explain why it is so important for the Minister to give phase 2 of the hospital extension the go-ahead and to have immediate approval of a tender submitted to the Department last year.</P>
      <P>The prefabricated buildings at Longford-Westmeath General Hospital have been there for 25 years.  They are serving as the casualty, accident and emergency departments at the hospital.  These buildings are in a state of decay and are a danger to the health of the staff and patients.</P>
      <P>Last Sunday night hundreds of people attended a public meeting in Mullingar and showed their anger, annoyance and frustration at the terrible conditions at the hospital and they await this announcement by the Department. Many people stated the case clearly and some outlined personal experiences. Individuals of 70 years of age recounted the terrible ordeal of receiving medical attention in these conditions.  Many explained that they waited four, five or six hours before they were attended to in the admission unit.</P>
      <P>The patient intake in this hospital has doubled, and has been increasing over a number of years.  On average, 350 patients go through these prefab buildings every week.  Approximately 650 patients attend the X-ray department which is also housed in a prefabricated building.  The throughput of patients in the Longford-Westmeath General Hospital for 1992 was 12,000.  The population of Longford-Westmeath exceeds 100,000.</P>
      <P>Longford-Westmeath General Hospital is one of the most efficient in the Midland Health Board area with a total admission cost of £148 per patient. It must not be punished for its efficiency by allowing these terrible conditions to continue.  The Minister of State, when in the Department of Health, approved the extension for tender and fully supports having this work completed as a matter of urgency.  She knows at first hand the conditions at the hospital.  I am delighted to see her here this evening taking this motion on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> The chief surgeon at the hospital in Mullingar, Dr. Mina, has publicly warned that the morale of the staff at the hospital is under serious threat and that something must be done immediately. He said the water is coming through the roof of the prefabs and destroying documentation in the records section.  This shows clearly the condition of these prefabs.</P>
    <P>To recapitulate for 25 years there have been prefabs at the hospital.  This is totally unacceptable.  In 1985 the Midland Health Board decided to rationalise the hospital service in the Longford-Westmeath area and build a new general hospital in Mullingar.  The Department of Health have kept their word and given us a £10 million extension in Mullingar and the facilities there are second to none.  Now we are looking for a new admission unit to serve the 100,000 people in the catchment area.  This admission unit would cost £5.5 million which could be spread over three years.  A sum of £40 million has been allocated under this year's capital programme and it would take very little to build this facility.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister for Health to visit Mullingar and see the situation for himself. We look forward to him signing the documents of tender and getting the work started.</P>
    <P>May I give the remaining time to Senator Belton?</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Cassidy for allowing me some of his time.  As this is my first time to speak in the Seanad, it is significant that it is on the subject of the Longford-Westmeath General Hospital.</P>
      <P>I live in the Longford area.  I am acutely aware of the hardship suffered by the people of Longford when the hospitals were amalgamated.  Promises were made and a certain strategy adopted by the Midland Health Board at that time to develop Mullingar Hospital.  As Senator Cassidy said, there is a large intake of patients at the hospital; at any given time about one-third of the patients come from County Longford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> I had first hand experience of the hospital two years ago when I was a patient.  I was taken to the casualty unit and there is no doubt that the X-ray and admission units are outdated.  There are housed in extremely bad conditions.  I want to pay tribute to the staff at Longford-Westmeath General Hospital who are doing tremendous work in those conditions. I do not think that any patient complained because they received the best care and attention.  It is only right that this project should go ahead now. We have the political muscle in the area &mdash; the Taoiseach and the former Minister for Health who was vocal and helpful in pushing this project at the time.</P>
    <P>We want phase 2 of the development to be implemented now.  As Senator Cassidy pointed out there is widespread concern among the staff and everybody connected with the hospital.  I did not attend the meeting on Sunday night; the people in Longford were not notified about it.  I take this opportunity to voice our concern.  We are fully behind every effort that has been made so far.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, should come to Mullingar, but it is more important that he should give the go-ahead for the tender.  Everybody is aware of the appalling conditions at the hospital.  Time has run out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in powerful health, thank the Lord.  In my time there, that project was sent to tender.  I did not do so from a sense of parochialism but <Col N="279" /> because it is the most serious case needing attention in the country.  I wish Senators could see the condition of this hospital.</P>
      <P>As Members will be aware, phase 2 went to tender and when completed will cost £9 million.  Phase 2A will cost £5.6 million.  The figures are as clear in my mind as when we let it out to tender.  The tenders are in since last September and were cleared are noted in October.  It is one of the projects in which the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, is very interested.  So interested is he that he is coming to visit Mullingar on 22 March.  I hope all the Oireachtas Members will meet him, and also those who are interested in the project.  I accept what Senator Belton has said.  Coming will clarify the Minister's mind because he will see the conditions in which staff are working and where people are treated each week.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Penrose, Deputy McGrath, Senator Belton, Senator Cassidy and I are very keen to have this facility commenced this year.  We have the Minister's word, and the word of the officials in the Department, that a close watch is being kept on the pattern of spending this year in the capital budget.  Very often there is a slowup in a project and since it does not proceed at the rate anticipated, moneys cannot be called down at a particular time for a project.  I am aware of that since my time in the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>The capital budget is modest but it allows for movement on projects other than those mentioned in it.  A careful watch being kept on the pattern of spending on each individual project, not from a sense of curtailment as the Department of Finance would think, but to allow some unspent money to be immediately used to commence phase 2A of Mullingar Hospital.  It is the wish of the Minister for Health, the Taoiseach and myself that this be the course of action taken this year.  We will welcome the Minister for Health when he comes to Mullingar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply concerned about the future of Irish Steel.  I hope the Minister replying will be able to give a categorical assurance on the future of the plant and the position of the 560 workers employed there.</P>
      <P>The new threat to Irish Steel arises from the over-capacity for steel on the European market and the desire of the EC to achieve rationalisation and a consequent reduction in production by the closure of a number of plants. However, it must be stressed that by European standards the production capacity of Irish Steel is very small and the Haulbowline plant is not the cause of the over-capacity on the European market.  There is excess capacity of about 30 million tonnes, but the total annual production of Irish Steel is less than one-hundredth of that, at only about 250,000 tonnes.</P>
      <P>Closing Irish Steel or running it down would not make much of a contribution to solving the problems of overcapacity of steel, but it would be a crushing blow to the east Cork area.  There are now more than 30,000 people out of work in Cork city and county.  The city has lost traditional major employers like Dunlops and Fords and the east of the county has not done much better.</P>
      <P>One of the biggest employers in Cobh, the Verolme Cork dockyard, lies silent and empty, and there is a serious question mark over the position of jobs in Youghal Carpets following changes in the ownership structure of the company.  Irish Steel is virtually the last major employer in the area and its workforce contributes £13 million in wages to the local economy. The loss of Irish Steel to east Cork would be just as severe as the Digital job losses will be to Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, there are strategic arguments that Ireland should retain its capacity to produce steel.  Only Ireland and Denmark each has a single steel plant.  All the other EC countries have several plants and would be able to close one or more while still retaining the capacity to produce on their own territory. <Col N="281" /> On the other hand, if Haulbowline goes, our total capacity to produce steel will be gone.</P>
    <P>The Irish Steel plant is relatively modern, having invested in a new mill in 1974.  It has until recently been fairly profitable and its workers do not deserve to be sacrificed to meet the needs of the European steel giants.</P>
    <P>Huge sums are being touted as being available from the EC to pay the cost of redundancy payments, but this would be a form of fools gold.  The jobs lost in Haulbowline would be virtually impossible to replace.  We cannot afford to lose any more jobs in Cobh or elsewhere.  The loss of jobs has now reached such a level, that we would need to create a huge number of additional jobs simply to stand still.  The EC must be told firmly that we do not want money for lay-offs: we want money for job creation.</P>
    <P>Despite public denials from Government sources that they are interested in the offer from the EC, there is real fear and apprehension among the workers and the local population generally.  I now look forward to a categorical assurance from the Minister that the plant will remain open and existing employment levels will be retained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you Senator Sherlock, a friend from another Chamber, for raising this matter.  I can confirm the full and whole hearted commitment of the Government to the future of Irish Steel.</P>
      <P>There is no pressure from the European Community to secure the closure of the plant at Haulbowline or of any particular steel plant in Europe as part of EC plans for the rationalisation of the European steel industries.  Today at a meeting in Brussels, the EC Council of Ministers of Industry are considering a progress report from the EC Commission on their approach to secure the definition by the European steel industry before September 1993 of a precise programme for capacity reductions over the next two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential basis of this programme <Col N="282" /> will be the voluntary closure of uneconomic plants by the industry.  There is no compulsion and no intention that Irish Steel will participate in the closure programme. I am very pleased to say that categorically and to put it on the record of the House.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, is in Brussels today attending that meeting as this area forms part of his responsibilities.  I understand from telephone contact with the Department that he is dealing with it in a forthright manner.</P>
    <P>The widely publicised difficulties that have arisen in the European steel market in the past two years, a market with stagnant demand, have resulted in most steel companies being pushed into a loss making situation and Irish Steel has suffered losses since 1991.  Irish Steel currently employs over 500 people.  It is a substantial number and I share Senator Sherlock's, and all of the southern based Senators, concern about this matter.</P>
    <P>The company makes steel for the construction industry and exports over 90 per cent of its output to virtually every country in western Europe.  In the light of the worsening market situation it took a number of measures in 1992, funded from its own cash reserves, in order to improve its competitiveness.  The continuing decline in European steel prices, which have dropped 30 per cent compared to 1989, has nullified efficiency gains and there has been the currency turbulence too.</P>
    <P>After recording trading profits for the three years ended June 1991, Irish Steel had a trading loss of £1 million and is facing a substantial trading loss for the current year.  The EC Commission which acts as the high authority to the ECSC has been slow to act in response to a serious deterioration in the European steel industry but following strong pressure it has recently initiated a programme to address the current problems of the industry.  The basic problems are a substantial over-capacity, a growth in low priced imports from Eastern Europe and recent US restrictions on imports from the Community.  The US is exhibiting strong streaks of protectionism under the <Col N="283" /> new man in the White House; that is something that is going to affect us in all sorts of ways.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Industry Council being held today in Brussels is to note the progress made to date.  It seems likely the matter will be considered again in May.  The EC Commission's initiative to address the serious difficulties of the European steel sector must be welcomed. They hope to have a plan in operation for next September.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock has rightly said that with Denmark, Ireland is in a special position in being the only two countries in the Community which have no more than one steel mill.  We cannot have any reduction of capacity without a total closure, and that is not envisaged.  In other countries many companies have a number of mills, some more economic <Col N="284" /> than others, and they stand to gain considerably from rationalisation measures within their group.  This is not the case with Ireland.  This is the point we have made forcibly; this is the point we will continue to make and on which we continue to build.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to safeguarding the future of Irish Steel but that does not mean that there is room for complacency.  It means a close watch on operations, a need for efficiency, competitiveness and a range of other measures.  In answer to Senator Sherlock, the Government is committed to fighting the just cause for Irish Steel, and it is justified.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 3 March 1993.</P>
