      <P>I have notice from Senator Cotter that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that certificate examination papers are proof read with due care to ensure that they are free from error.</P>

      <P>He is rewarded for consistency.  I also received notice from Senator O'Toole of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to ensure that the Government vigorously opposes any attempts within the European Community to impose any additional duty, tax or charge on blank tapes, digital audio tapes, blank compact discs or recording equipment as is being sought by elements within the European music industry.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise <Col N="1542" /> and Employment to carry out an immediate investigation into the life-threatening explosion at Balleece Quarry in Rathdrum, County Wicklow and to suspend its operation until appropriate safety measures have been put in place.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Cotter, O'Toole and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Cotter's and O'Toole's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Ross may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Item 1, Statements on Structural Funds from now until 1 p.m.  The Minister of State has indicated that she wishes to reply to Senators' contributions; I hope we can allow time for that and restrict speeches to 15 minutes per Senator.  Item 2, the Industrial Development Bill, 1993: Committee Stage, will be taken from 2 p.m. until 6 p.m.  Item 26, Private Members' Business, will be taken from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m. and it is proposed to return to Item 2 and take Report and Remaining Stages when we have dealt with our business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On Item 2, the Industrial Development Bill, 1993, does the Leader of the House expect Committee Stage to finish by 6 p.m.?  I do not think we could agree to that.  This Bill was published at the weekend and it is one of the most important Bills which the House will consider this session.  Second Stage was taken yesterday and there are a number of substantial amendments.  We certainly could not agree to the Bill concluding today but if the House operates in its normal co-operative way our Whips will co-operate with the Government Whips to see that as much progress as possible is made.  I certainly would not agree to the Bill concluding if all sections had not been debated by that time.  I hope the Leader of the House is not <Col N="1543" /> contemplating a guillotine in a gentle fashion.  That certainly would not be acceptable to us.</P>
      <P>The situation in Aer Lingus is of enormous gravity for everybody concerned and for the country.  Nothing we do here would be designed to exacerbate the situation. Nonetheless, it is a political matter and there are political decisions to be made.  I ask the Leader of the House if he could arrange to have statements in the House at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning in respect of item 2, the Industrial Development Bill.  I am prepared to accept that the Leader did not say he was imposing a time limit, nevertheless stating that he was going to proceed to Report Stage at 8 p.m. indicated a conclusion of Committee Stage at 6 p.m. That this is a Seanad Bill is to be welcomed. It is important legislation which is central to our industrial strategy as outlined by the Culliton report, although whether or not it is in line with the Culliton report is something we could have debated yesterday.  It is not satisfactory, given the fact that there will be many amendments, that it should be dealt with in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Manning and Senator Dardis in regard to the Industrial Development Bill.  I ask the Leader if it would be possible to have a debate on Aer Lingus.  We are aware of the seriousness of the problem and we are also aware that commitments were given to Aer Lingus seven months ago which resulted in a number of us not being in the other House but being in this House.  I would like the opportunity to discuss the matter fairly and squarely.  I wonder when the Tánaiste intends to go back to the hangar and explain to the workforce what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I add my voice to whose who have spoken about the Industrial Development Bill?  A Bill which has <Col N="1544" /> been initiated in the Seanad deserves attention.  This is one of the few opportunities to ensure we have an input.  I am anxious to ensure that Committee Stage is brought to a conclusion only when all the work has been finished.  I urge the Leader of the House to ensure that we find time to cover everything that has to be covered in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support that.  There were many contributions on Second Stage so obviously there will be much to be said on Committee Stage.  In view of the fact that management at Aer Lingus has been instructed to inform the trade unions of its proposals and rightly so, when is it intended to inform the House? I read this morning that a further appointment from outside the State has been made to Aer Lingus.  Given that redundancies are being sought within Aer Lingus, this is very difficult to understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Senators, I ask them to agree that instead of taking Report Stage from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. we should continue with committee Stage after 8 p.m.  I will extend the hours of sitting to take Report Stage between 10 p.m. and 12 midnight.  There is enough time between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. and between 8 p.m. and midnight to deal with the issue.  I do not want to put a guillotine on the Bill but the Minister is extremely keen that this legislation should be dealt with before the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I have clarification from the Leader of the House? Is the Leader saying that the Committee Stage will continue until all sections have been dealt with and that we will then go straight into Report Stage?  I would prefer to deal only with Committee Stge today.  We are willing to complete the Bill either later this week or at the beginning of next week.  This would allow a little time for reflection.  Report Stage could be completed on the first day of next week if necessary or we could change tommorrow's business.  I would be happy to agree to that but I am reluctant <Col N="1545" /> to rush Committee Stage or have any guillotine imposed.  As Senator Quinn said, this is an important Seanad Bill.  We could have Report Stage tommorrow or early next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what Senator Manning is saying and maybe the Whips could meet during the day.  Committee Stage will go on until 6 p.m. and will be taken, if necessary, between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. or longer &mdash; that may be discussed later.  If we go on to Report Stage, it will finish before midnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader has indicated that he is not going to start Report Stage earlier than a certain time.  Why can it not be the case that we continue from Committee Stage into Report Stage, irrespective of the time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister. On the last occassion, I was quite critical of the consultative process that took place when the programmes for the period 1984 to 1987 were compiled.  I want to reiterate that this morning.  The consultative process is quite imperfect and, to a large degree, ill-informed.  The consultative approach was not carried out in depth in that many people who should have been included in that process were not included.  There were development associations and chambers of commerce all over Ireland whose views should have been sought.  I ask the Minister to ensure that local authorities put structures in place to enable proper consultation.  It is a shame that the ESRI report, which we received yesterday, was not available a year ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Having read it superficially, I believe that its contents could have been produced a year ago.  There was no need to delay it until now.  Had it been available, we would have had at least some empirical information to aid decision-making.  We would have had sets of data and information to inform our thinking.  There was an entirely inadequate discussion on the last tranche of funding, the £3 billion which was spent in the last set of programmes.  Why do we have this insistence on secrecy?  Why do we not have more open discussion?</P>
      <P>We have pages of history which we should have had the opportunity to read over the past 12 months.  If there had been good open discussion and debate about the last set of programmes and the spending of the £3 billion, everybody would be better informed and people would know what to expect from this second, relatively huge, tranche of spending.  Transparency is important and we will pay a price for not having it.</P>
      <P>There is a grave danger that people will see the £8 billion as a bonanza which will solve all our difficulties.  The last tranche of spending will contribute about 1 per cent to GNP, which will make a minor impact on our huge unemployment problem.  We are aware that the programme did a lot of good but it will not answer all our problems.</P>
      <P>This new tranche of funding will do a lot of good for the economy, particularly if it is wisely spent.  It is projected that it may make a contribution of 2 per cent to GNP, but we know that will not solve our problems.  It will assist in the solution but we will still be left with huge unemployment. The public should be aware of that and they should not regard this as a bonanza &mdash; I continue to use that word because it is in the public mind.  The Government has been claiming this as a great victory, suggesting that the money is there and it will solve the problems.  Of course it will not.  We must keep that firmly in our minds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1547" /> The benefits of this set of programmes will not become evident until the next century and therefore we have to wait for returns.  What criteria should we use for investment?  Many of us would be motivated by conditions in our local areas, but having listened to the Minister of State, I agree that we must get value for money. We must also get maximum return to GNP, given the terrible difficulties of our economy.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that there is an input to improving international competitiveness. We must improve our transport infrastructure and examine the sectors which are likely to give the maximum return.  We are informed that tourism will grow by about 9 per cent per year into the next century.  Prudent investment in tourism is likely to give a good return on investment, provided that it is supported by strong marketing.</P>
    <P>I also want to see an element of national cohesion in this programme. The provinces must be properly looked after; population retention and quality of life in the provinces must be one of the aims of the set of programmes.  The regions must be given an opportunity to play to their strengths.  I was disappointed by the type of consultation which occurred because regions were not given an opportunity to assess those strengths.</P>
    <P>On a parochial level, my constituency of Monaghan-Cavan is an example to the rest of the country and I can assure the Minister of State that any investment there will pay rich reward.  The best way of trying to project what will happen in the future is to read recent history.  The Minister of State is aware that Monaghan and Cavan have done an enormous amount to retain population and create natural growth and wealth on the basis of local enterprise.  Any investment which the Minister's Department will make in Monaghan and Cavan will be guaranteed to give rich reward.</P>
    <P>I will be looking for proper transport infrastructure.  We were told at a county council meeting recently that the council is out of money.  Next winter we will have dreadful problems with potholes.  This <Col N="1548" /> does not augur well for the future.  I am disappointed that I do not have more time because I wanted to say much more. We should have a wide ranging discussion on this and time limits should not apply. I am happy to have had the opportunity to say a few words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Has he not done very well?  I wish to welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I heard her on the radio yesterday and I was very impressed by her practical and balanced approach to the whole area of Structural Funds. Today I will concentrate on tourism <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Structural Funds.  It is impossible in a debate such as this to cover all aspects of developments which we hope will take place.  I will discuss the operational programmes which we have had and indicate what I would like to see for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the tourism industry experienced some externally imposed brakes on its rate of growth in the latter half of 1992, any objective review of its performance over the life of the now concluding inaugural tourism operation programme, 1989-93, must endorse the confidence in the industry by the Government. This House will be aware that the community support framework agreed between the Irish Government and the European Commission imposed a leading role on tourism in the creation of employment and the generation of income in the contribution towards the balance of payments.  This role was assigned to tourism against the background of a well documented international trend which showed that tourism worldwide would be the number one industry by the turn of the millennium.  Taken into account was the relatively untapped <Col N="1549" /> potential of Irish tourism.  Both of these factors were seen as capable of combining to produce major growth.</P>
    <P>It is correctly realised that the simple application of market forces will not on its own produce the desired results.  Those concerned with the drafting of the tourism operational programme looked honestly at Irish tourism and correctly identified that there were significant deficiencies in the range of traditional products.  New visitor facilities and services would have to be provided if the sector was to progress with the speed and depth of penetration that would be required.  The core product, Ireland, has many potential advantages over competitors given the emergence of a better educated and more discerning international tourist.  This discerning tourist is no longer content to sit on a beach at a sunny resort but prefers to visit a location with a relatively unspoiled environment, scenic attraction and a range of complementary visitor facilities.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that under the current tourism operational programme Ireland, in partnership with the EC, has targeted a range of strategic investment projects involving both the public and private sector.  Investment, rightly in my view, has been channelled to the non-accommodation sectors of tourism with a heavy concentration on visitor attractions and facilities.  It is only right that while the State takes responsibility for developing that which is in the public ownership of responsibility the private sector should show its own commitment by supporting investments in its own area of remit.  I hope that the controversy over the Office of Public Works' interpretative centres can be resolved in a way that respects appropriate procedures, takes environmental issues into account yet does not prejudice the undoubted tourism attraction of such centres.</P>
    <P>The tourism capital investment programme in visitor facilities and attractions has been a success in that the targets of doubling tourism income and the creation of 25,000 new jobs over the term of the programme will be met by the end <Col N="1550" /> of the current year.  This performance is unmatched by any other sector and the job creation figures can only be welcomed against the background of stagnating and even reducing employment in other sectors of the economy.  The industry and all involved in targeting the investment and marketing the product are to be congratulated on their efforts, as are the Government and the European Commission.</P>
    <P>There is a wide but distorted impression, in regard to the quality of jobs in tourism, that the sector offers little security and is heavily dependent on part-time and temporary staff.  Seasonal employment is certainly a feature of tourism and that will continue to be the case. Within certain limits, this need not be an issue as temporary arrangements can be convenient to both the employer and the employee.  In reality, temporary work is the exception rather than the rule in the industry.</P>
    <P>The findings of CERT's current management survey show that hotel, catering and tourism industries have a high level of permanent employment.  Unlike many other industries, growth in the tourism industry tends to result in a broadly comparable percentage growth in jobs.  In addition, tourism provides employment in an increasingly diverse range of sectors and skills areas as well as in rural or otherwise disadvantaged areas of the country.  Furthermore, because of the relatively small scale of its business establishments, it provides significant entry opportunities for entrepreneurs.</P>
    <P>A greater number of our tourists now come from Europe.  While deregulation and improved access have no doubt contributed to this growth in the European market, it is clear that a significant improvement in visitor facilities and attractions has contributed to attracting the increased numbers.  In addition, it is obvious that our increased integration into Europe has raised awareness of the Irish tourism product there.  Although the American market has a tradition of greater volatility, I am concerned lest our increased concentration on the European market distracts us from the potential <Col N="1551" /> longer haul markets, such as the United States and many other non-traditional markets.</P>
    <P>Service is an integral part of the tourism product and must match the highest international standards if the industry is to maintain and build upon the growth already achieved.  Outside factors will continue to affect tourism but the industry's ability to control its own destiny will largely depend on the quality of people in the industry.  Today, international tourism has to be developed, marketed and delivered against the yardstick of consumer preference.  Tourism businesses are learning to accept that excellence of product and service is not only desirable but is a market expectation within all sectors and across all price ranges.</P>
    <P>Management, supervisors and operatives in tourism must perform to the highest international standards and training by CERT is a critical element in achieving these objectives.  The training agency's approach to training programme development and its partnership with the Department of Education, the regional technical colleges and the tourism industry are vitally important. CERT's training programmes provided multiple opportunities for access to training for young school leavers and the unemployed as well as for managers and operatives already working in the industry. Furthermore, its business advisory service works closely with the industry establishments in their ongoing quest to raise and maintain standards.</P>
    <P>Funding by the Exchequer, the EC and from CERT's own activities have allowed CERT to increase training numbers, on a phased basis, to almost 11,000 in the current year.  The industry must view the State training apparatus as a partner in training.  Training must be a career long process if we are to keep abreast and hopefully ahead of our competitors.  I was glad to learn that, with the benefit of CERT's training for trainers programmes, a growing number of medium to large establishments in the industry are supporting CERT's efforts by carrying <Col N="1552" /> out their own in-house CERT model training.  This is a most welcome development although the small size of the average tourism business limits, to some extent, an expansion of this approach The Government and the EC are investing heavily in training through on-going training expenditure and the provision of training infrastructure, the most recent being CERT House, the new headquarters for training at Amiens Street in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The contribution of Irish tourism during the present national plan &mdash; when it has outperformed almost every other destination in world tourism &mdash; offers encouragement for the success of the next national plan.  The Programme for a Partnership Government's target of 35,000 new tourism jobs by 1999 is broadly equal to that which will be achieved under the present plan.  An infrastructural framework has been put in place which has been largely instrumental in tourism achievements in the present national plan.  However, the years to 2000 are likely to be far more competitive than in the current plan.  Many commentators feel that the competitive advantages which recently worked in Ireland's favour &mdash; for example, deregulation and improved access &mdash; will begin to taper off.  Against this background there is little time to rest on our laurels and admire our achievements to date.  To use a sporting phrase, we are only as good as our next game.  All concerned with tourism will have to work as hard if we are to maintain existing tourism levels, and to work harder still if we are to reach the targets set by the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    <P>The programme of capital investment by Government, the EC and the tourism industry began in the current national. plan, and it must continue in a cohesive manner targeting the gaps in the current tourism product.  We have achieved dramatic increases in the number of vistors and this rate of growth can be repeated. There is potential for growth in the shoulder areas of the year and this should be given prominence in our investment and marketing campaigns in the up and <Col N="1553" /> coming national plan.  Although our tourism amenities have not had as negative an impact on our environment as the tourist industry has had in more sunny destinations, State agencies, local government and the industry must work together to ensure that this remains the case.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a return to the issue of the skills of the tourism management and workforce.  During the present plan, new tourism facilities and attractions which created new types of jobs were introduced for which new skills were required, although the traditional sectors and jobs continue to provide approximately 85 per cent of employment in the industry.  I am aware that CERT has responded to these new needs by providing updated training programmes. The new national plan will create new jobs in the new skills areas that have emerged in the present plan but also by capital investment in new product areas in the years ahead.  Everybody will need funding but tourism, and the training respect of tourism provided by CERT, will need the funding and other resources necessary to provide training for a larger and more diverse range of skills.</P>
    <P>I understand the discussions about the carve up of the indicative funding under the next round of the EC Structural Funds have reached an advanced stage. Although it is hardly necessary, I remind the Minister of the importance of ensuring that adequate allocations are made for capital and human resource investment in tourism.  The arguments are more than compelling, given the sector's response to investment stimulus to date and taking into account the remaining potential for further growth.  No other sector can match the growth potential of tourism over the next national plan.</P>

      <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  Like Senator Cotter, I regret we did not have the chance of looking at the ESRI document earlier. The calibre of contributors to the report means that it deserves closer attention than we have been able to give it here.  It is a very comprehensive document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1554" /> I stress, as the authors themselves have done, that any possible approach reflects the reality that considerable uncertainty exists, concerning the quantification of rates of return.  The document also acknowledges that there are a multiplicity of objectives underlying the Community Support Framework. However scientific the projections made appear to be, we are engaged in a highly uncertain activity which is subject to a wide range of variables and unforeseeable developments.  The question of judgment will, therefore, be absolutely central, and on the question of judgment I have no reason to believe that the judgment of a politician is in any way inferior to the judgment of an expert or anyone else.  Much depends on the quality of politicians' judgment and I will simply try to contribute to the judgments which will eventually be made.</P>
    <P>I agree with the contributors to the report on the importance of human resources.  Within human resources they identify the problem of early school leavers, of responding to fundamental problems of social and economic development in this country.  The term &ldquo;early school leavers&rdquo; is simply a way of referring in large measure to the problems of poverty, unemployment rooted in families, and generational unemployment, because early school leaving is a symptom of a much deeper malaise in the social and economic structure.  There are problems of poverty everywhere throughout the country but they are heavily concentrated in a number of areas.  A fundamental problem confronting the decision makers in this area is to get the balance right between investment in sectors and investment in areas.</P>
    <P>Government and Government Departments are organised in sectoral terms. There is some suspicion that some consultants' reports &mdash; not this one &mdash; have consisted in getting Departments to find lists of desirable investment projects, dust them down and add them up to the totals they wished to submit.  This is an unacceptable way to approach investment possibilities under the Structural Funds.  I do not decry sectoral investment <Col N="1555" /> in principle.  We have just had a very effective exposition of the importance of tourism where the returns may be so clearly worthwhile that they justify thinking in sectoral terms.  Nobody lives in a sector.  We all live in areas and how to strike the proper balance between sector and area is the main conceptual and political problem confronting the decision makers.  Therefore, the early school leaver problem, the home liaison project problem, must be tackled in the areas where there is a massive concentration of these problems, whether in or outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>I deplore the distinction that is frequently drawn between Dublin and the rest of the country in terms of Structural Funds or other kinds of investment. There are problems which are common to Dublin and the rest of the country, and each region has its own individual problems, but there is massive poverty in areas of Dublin which simply must be confronted, partly through Strucural Funds.  The same type of problem confronts areas in Cork and Limerick, and doubtless other areas with which I am not as familiar.  This type of investment in areas must be thought through.  It is a continuing challenge because, as far as I know, we do not have the mechanisms in this country to take decisions of that kind.</P>
    <P>Integrated planning is a fashionable term but a difficult concept to apply in practice.  It is a learning process and we have only recently begun to learn how it works.  I hope the Structural Funds will enables us to devote time to that learning process which will continue during the expenditure of the funds and afterwards. I hope that after the expenditure of money we will have improved our decision-making capacity, whether for Structural Funds or for national funds; we should build that in as part of our objective in the use of Structural Funds. We do not know how to apply integrated planning, partly because we are not educated along those lines, partly because our structures are wholly inimical to it. We do not know how to apply it in central Government, or how to apply it between <Col N="1556" /> central Government and local government. We must identify these problems if we are going to apply this concept effectively.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem with Structural Funds is that things are done too quickly. There is a rush and decisions have to be taken before one is remotely in a position to know whether they are right or not.  I am not criticising that, it is part of the reality of life, but one ought to try to learn from this process and see how one can build in more effective decision-making.</P>
    <P>Support ought to go to those areas which have made an attempt to construct a local decision-making structure for themselves and have shown a capacity to pull together diverse local interests.  I am thinking of the north side of Cork where such attempts have been under way for some time under the aegis of Bishop Murphy, who has devoted himself to fostering local initiative.  Through his inspiration and the commitment of dedicated priests, employers, trade unionists and social workers, something is happening there which deserves support.  It does not deserve support because the area is poor, although that is a general principle in moral terms, but because of the effectiveness of return on investment.  One has to see not only what poverty there is but also what the realities are of a likely return from the degree of energy already being mobilised and the commitment to co-operation those communities are showing.  That ought to be a criterion in distributing funding of this type.  Good intentions by themselves are simply not enough.  Where that type of initiative has not yet been demonstrated one would hope that Government, at both local and national levels, would contribute towards developing it.</P>
    <P>In terms of returns over the term of the Structural Funds, one looks at what is already under way and at what stage and at what degree of initiative is already there so there can be some confidence that the people involved will be able to deliver something of the promise of the Structural Funds.  I would ask the Minister to consider the claims of the commitment, <Col N="1557" /> initiative and enterprise already shown in that area, to my own specific knowledge.</P>
    <P>I hope that, as this is a partnership Government, the capacity of partnership nationally and locally will be one of the objectives of the expenditure of Structural Funds.  All sorts of difficulties arise in these matters but the capacity for cooperation at all levels ought to be taken on board as a principle, and should be one of the criteria for supporting claims of the various departmental or community interests.</P>
    <P>Turning to the section of the report entitled &ldquo;Human Resources&rdquo;, I am taking the issues of early school-leavers and the long term unemployed together, and I note the report says that measures to tackle the enduring problem of the long term unemployed warrant a significant increase in resources.  I agree entirely with that and what I have been saying has been consonant with trying to tackle that problem.  To a disproportionate extent it is a geographical problem.  The question of integrated area developments arises also.  I am not underestimating the challenge involved because we do not know effectively how to face it and there is a learning process involved.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance has been regularly criticised, and I am not going to begin changing the habit of a lifetime by defending the Department too enthusiastically at this stage, but there is enormous ability there and it would be encouraging for the rest of the country if it felt that the Department of Finance was sometimes on its side as distinct from being against virtually everybody.  That is an unfortunate impression, and no doubt an undeserved one, which the public relations skills of the Department of Finance have not yet fully succeeded in overcoming.</P>
    <P>I would stress the point that, even though it is completely contrary to the ethos of the Department of Finance, its attitude actually fosters a dependency syndrome because it conveys the impression that the country is incapable of taking decisions without somehow <Col N="1558" /> having the Department's controlling hand saving itself from itself.  While I accept that there have to be controls on central Government as well as local government, it is unfortunate that the Department managed to convey last time &mdash; and I agree here with the complaints that have been made about inadequate discussion &mdash; a lack of discussion in terms of time and style.  Some of the Department's valuable time might well be devoted to thinking about how it can improve its own communication skills to foster independence of attitude and overcome the dependency mentality which it so regularly deplores in other respects.</P>
    <P>I am intrigued by what the section on human resources has to say about education. There is an interesting and instructive paragraph on higher education which correctly states:</P>
    <P>We are concerned with the proposal in the Green Paper on Education to expand enrolments at third level from its current level of 70,000 to 100,000 students by the end of the decade.  In recent years, while enrolment has increased, neither infrastructural capacity nor teaching staff have kept pace and the system is already overcrowded.</P>
    <P>I am not making a special plea for third level education.  It may well be that there are higher priorities elsewhere in the economy and society, and that there are higher priorities within education itself. I would be strongly attracted by the argument that a disproportionate amount of investment in education ought to go on the very early years, even starting with pre-school.  This is because by that stage much of the poverty, deprivation and many of the handicaps, which it is hoped the education system may compensate for, are already too deeply buried and are part and parcel of the personality and capacities of the pupils so that they do not have a chance later on, whatever resources are pumped in further along the scale.</P>
    <P>I take the point made in the report that the whole higher education sector and its implications for both economic growth <Col N="1559" /> and social development are grossly under-researched.  It is extraordinary how little research had been carried out on virtually every aspect of higher education, which is one of the most rapidly growing sectors in both expenditure and employment in the sense that it keeps students off the streets for another three or four years once they get in there.</P>
    <P>The report also says: &ldquo;We believe that any expansion of higher education should be linked to projected skill needs...&rdquo; There has to be a relationship between investment in higher education and needs, but I would stress that needs are not something objective.  Needs are defined subjectively, at least in part.  To take a simple example like the pupil/ teacher ratio or staff/student ratio; the number of teachers one needs five, ten or 15 yers down the line is not an objective issue, it is a question of policy.  Needs are not objective things which we identify and then see if we will satisfy.  They are what we decide needs ought to be, so decision-making is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not speak about sea ports, airports, roads, sewerage or water works, schools or even potholes.  I will make a few suggestions which might go a long way towards slowing down the number of small farmers who have to leave the land each year, which is approximately 7,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farming organiations rightly place much emphasis on headage payments.  I believe, however, that the system has many drawbacks and is definitely unfair to smaller farmers.  The ERSI report states the obvious when it points out that farmers outside the disadvantaged areas do not qualify for headage payments, although their holdings in many cases are of very poor quality and of limited size and they have many of the disadvantages that farmers have in disadvantaged areas. Because of the way the headage system works, farmers in disadvantaged areas with larger amounts of land get more resources.  The smaller farmer is restricted because the size of his holding is limited and often he has trouble raising <Col N="1560" /> finance of purchase animals.  The Minister should examine the problem.  Individual farmers not from disadvantaged areas should be eligible for headage payments. I would also support a system in the disadvantage areas to enable small farmers with limited resources to get higher payments up to a certain figure.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we had a debate on job creation.  The first 7,500 jobs to be created will imediately be cancelled out by the number of small farmers who will have to leave their holdings.  They would like to stay but they cannot.  They do not want to go on the dole or take other jobs. They want to stay on their holdings but their lack of income prevents them.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding Common Agricultural Policy and headage payments, since we joined the EC it is conservatively estimated 7,500 farmers have been forced to leave the land each year.  Rural Ireland is being depopulated.  The farmers are leaving because of insufficient income. Continuing the policy of the past 20 years will not be good enough in the future.  A different approach must be devised.  All political parties and farming organisations say their aim is to keep the maximum number of family farmers on the land.  We have failed in that aim. We are not reaching a large number of farmers.</P>
    <P>Headage payments must continue and their real value must be increased.  We must establish a system to reach beyond that to help smaller farmers in disadvantaged areas and disadvantaged farmers outside those areas.  This can only happen through a positive direct income system for smaller farmers.  It should be based on size of holding and family numbers.  One could say it would be a payment for children instead of animals.</P>
    <P>With good will, a scheme could be devised whereby farmers who opt to stay on their holdings would be assumed to be earning a notional income on an adjusted acreage basis and would also receive money depending on their family circumstances. The people to run this scheme would be Teagasc officials <Col N="1561" /> because it has offices in every county and more than one office in several.</P>
    <P>For example, one could have a 50-acre holding adjusted to 30 acres.  If the notional income for the holding is £100 per acre the family would have an income of £3,000, almost £60 per week.  If that farmer was in the PAYE sector he could receive family income supplement.  The reference figure for the FIS would be £195 per week for a married man with two children.  He would get 60 per cent of the difference between that and his income.  In this example, the farmer should receive a payment of £81 per week.  That would help keep him on his holding and give him the encouragement needed.  It would also be cost effective because if the farmer went on the dole he would get more.  The scheme should not penalise farmers for working hard to earn extra money.  The notional income of £100 would remain.</P>
    <P>The purpose of such a scheme would be to encourage farmers to stay on their holdings.  The encouragement for many years has been to leave the land.  They have been persuaded to seek jobs that were not there.  To encourage people to remain on the land, they should be exempt from tax on such income.  They should also be eligible for medical cards and grants for third level education.  They should pay PRSI on their £50 income.</P>
    <P>The £80 per week should not be paid to farmers for doing nothing.  A return should be sought.  They should be asked to carry out environmental works on their farms which would tidy up the countryside and aid tourism.  This would be done in conjunction with Teagasc advisers. Farmers with land bordering on roads could be asked to tidy ditches and open drains and to make other small improvements. It has been traditional on small family farms to help neighbours with haymaking and threshing.  The scheme could also provide that farmers clean up a local graveyard or other amenity.</P>
    <P>Such a scheme would prevent the depopulation of rural Ireland which is causing terrible problems in most of our towns and cities.  The environment would be improved because people would be <Col N="1562" /> protecting it.  The scheme would aid tourism because the countryside would be tidied.  Someone may ask how it would be financed.  If as little as 1 to 3 per cent of the £8 billion Ireland is to receive from the EC was used for this scheme it would be financed for at least ten years.</P>
    <P>As a small farmer and a member of the IFA I am glad to see members of the association in the public gallery, although they may not agree with all I have had to say.  At least they are showing interest in the subject under discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make my contribution on Structural Funds.  If one left one's home in rural Longford 25 years ago one could arrive at Longford station without going through potholes and the springs in one's car would most likely be intact.  Having boarded the train for Dublin, the chances were one would arrive on time.  Now, 25 years later, if one leaves one's house in rural Longford, by the time one arrives in Longford town the car springs will probably be damaged because of the failure of various Administrations to provide funding for the county road system. When one boards the train to Dublin one may arrive two hours late or, as happened recently, not arrive until the next day.</P>
      <P>I cite these as examples of how far this country has declined.  We must bear in mind £15 billion has come into Ireland since we joined the EC.  I am not overwhelmed by the £8 billion that is to come. Much appears to depend on what is being said at any given time in Irish politics. The manner in which previous funds have been spent must be examined.  It appears to me that the Department of Finance used all the moneys in day-to-day expenditure on schemes that the State had to provide for in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a certain proportion of the next round of Structural Funds is not invested in the county roads system, the Government will fail to provide the fundamental infrastructure.  The county roads system has now become a joke, with featues on the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo;.  The situation is serious and more is required than long-winded <Col N="1563" /> speeches by Ministers about the rural community and infrastructures.  Money must be invested in the county roads system.</P>
    <P>The present system cannot withstand the heavier traffic arising from the use of modern machinery in agriculture and from increased traffic generally.  The development of forestry is advocated, yet the increase in haulage arising from forestry is placing an unsustainable burden on the county roads.  Another example is tourism.  While Ireland has always been a tourist destination, there are not the necessary access routes to sustain the much talked of growth in tourism.  In my part of the country, there are areas along Lough Ree where there are no access roads.  The local authorities cannot undertake improvement schemes due to lack of funding.  Whilst I accept that the Minister may not have an appreciation of rural life, she must accept that the necessary infrastructural basis in the regions is the county roads network, which has been allowed to degenerate.</P>
    <P>The same is true of the railway system. The Dublin to Sligo railway line is a joke. This not the fault of Iarnród Éireann or its staff.  There can be delays of up to two hours on this train journey, with complete breakdowns not uncommon. Friday, 11 June 1993, the train broke down completely at Edgeworthstown. Schoolchildren from Donegal did not get home until the following day.</P>
    <P>Money must be provided from the next round of Structural Funds to develop, update and improve the Dublin to Sligo railway line, regardless of reports which suggest that there should be no diverting of the funds into the railways.  This line covers seven or eight counties and if there is to be an increase in tourism and investment in these areas the railways must be updated and operated to schedule. Twenty-five years ago one could travel on the county road system without damaging the car and one could get on a train and arrive on time.  That is not possible today and we are led to believe that this is progress.</P>
    <P>Funding must be provided for waste <Col N="1564" /> disposal which is a major problem for all local authorities, not least in my own county of Longford.  If a local authority endeavours to locate a land fill site there is uproar.  People do not want dumps near their homes.  Such dumps were not adequately maintained in the past.  It is only with proper funding for waste disposal that this problem will be rectified.</P>
    <P>The headage payment system should be maintained.  There has been talk recently from the Taoiseach and the farm leaders about changes required to the GATT proposals.  When these proposals were negotiated by the former EC Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, there was much praise.  This inconsistent approach to the GATT proposals is not acceptable. When we negotiate on the international stage, be it on EC Structural Funds or GATT proposals, there can be no indulgence in the game of politics.  I regret that there has been such indulgence in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is an appropriate and opportune moment to discuss the EC Regional and Structural Funds.  I have a particular interest as I am chairperson of Donegal County Council and I am involved in the sub-regional review which is underway.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fitzgerald, visited Sligo recently and met the people involved in the sub-regional review.  We exchanged many useful opinions.  I listened to the debate and depending on our regional and political motives, she was blamed for her actions. It is wrong to be negative.  I would prefer to be positive and put the case for my region to the Minister in a way she can understand.  I believe she intends to adopt a fair approach to this difficult problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is working hard to assess the thousands of proposals and submissions which have been sent to her office.  Everyone is concerned about the £8 billion we are to receive from Europe. People believe they will score a political point by saying we will not get all this money but they are doing the country a <Col N="1565" /> disservice.  I will give an example.  If a person talks about attracting an industry to a specific area, jealous people might try to entice the industrialist to their area. In this case, some people want to get more than their share of the £8 billion and they will do all in their power to get it.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for those involved in the EC negotiations to ensure that the £8 billion is allocated.  I would ask people not to challenge our negotiators.  They should be allowed to negotiate because they are as interested in getting this money for Ireland as we are.  No one person can claim to be the sole custodian of concern for the country.  These people must be trusted, even if they have different political views.</P>
    <P>We have a very serious problem in the north-west.  Admittedly there are many people unemployed in Dublin and elsewhere and it could be said that people in the country have an advantage over people living in the cities because they can fish or cut sticks to light a fire.  That is a very simplistic view.  For 20 years I have been involved in at least five major surveys, ranging from north-west regional studies, cross-Border development programmes to the conference, Developing the West Together, organised by the western bishops, etc.  Over £1 million has been given to different companies to produce study plans. However, these plans are gathering dust. Many studies have been undertaken, and I do not want to delay the Minister by giving details of reports which are out of date.  Everyone in the west cannot be wrong about the need for development. A solution must be found.  People who are serious about developing the west are pinning their hopes on the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>It is easy to discuss the farming community and the problems the small family farmer is experiencing.  The IFA use the small farmer and the problems he is experiencing as an example to obtain funding for the large farmer.  Yesterday Mr. Alan Gillis said that farming should be funded to the point where farmers would be able to sustain themselves.  As <Col N="1566" /> a farmer, I say to Mr. Alan Gillis that every farm in Ireland needs assistance not because we are competing with each other, but because the people who are receiving EC funding are no longer interested in grass, tillage or production farming.  Farming as we know it is no longer profitable.  My farm in Donegal is under tillage and each year I lose money. My neighbours are in the same situation.</P>
    <P>The IFA challenged the MacSharry plan.  Mr. MacSharry recognised that the IFA wanted to allocate 80 per cent of EC funding to 20 per cent of large factory farms and co-operatives which were receiving subsidies for their butter and milk powders.  At the same time they were producing spreads in Ireland to compete with foreign products because it was economically viable.</P>
    <P>We have a few major co-operatives which challenge each other on the Stock Exchange and buy each other out.  It is not right to support them while continuing to use the small family farms in the west in discussions and arguments. Crocodile tears are being shed about emigration by members of these farming families.  This will not cut any ice with us because we have listened to this type of argument for too long.</P>
    <P>The McSharry proposals were right. A more even distribution of European funding is needed.  The IFA cannot continue to bluff the small family farmers in the west.  I am one of them and I represent them.  It is time the IFA decided whether it represents the small or the large farmer because there are major differences between the two.</P>
    <P>Farmers in the west have fallen between two stools.  Although we have been involved in five major studies, I do not know if they have benefited us.  At a meeting on 21 October 1987 the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference initiated a study the north-west &mdash; County Donegal and the areas covered by the district councils of Derry and Strabane. We waited 15 years for this study, we worked together and expressed our hopes and aspirations.  We enjoyed our deliberations and took them seriously. Finally, the British and the Irish Governments <Col N="1567" /> recognised that the Border caused serious problems for the people in the area and that there was no simple solution. They realised that a regeneration programme was needed for that area.</P>
    <P>This happened in 1987.  Six years later, the Taoiseach, with Lord Arran, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Agriculture, opened a new cross-Border office at 16 The Diamond, Derry.  We hope this office will cater for development in the areas of Donegal, Strabane and Derry.  There are roughly 0.5 million people crossing the Border.  Most of the industries that were there have now disappeared.  The shirt-making and garment industry in Buncrana and Lifford have disappeared.  The jobs of the hundreds who worked in the factories are no longer there.  That is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>I recognise the work done by the International Fund for Ireland.  However, political pressure and the case made by public figures in the North convinced the sponsors to spend two-thirds of those funds in Northern Ireland and one third in the South.  The one-third spent in the South might be spent anywhere &mdash; on a joint UCD/UCG project or around the country.  The one-third being spent in the South has not made a major impact, although I am grateful for the funding provided for so many projects and the advantages gained from it.</P>
    <P>In the North, if a derelict site has been classified as a bomb site &mdash; for example in Strabane one developer has seven of them &mdash; £50,000 funding is available from the International Fund for Ireland. However, across the Border in a small village called Carrigans, seven miles from Strabane, a property in the main street of the village was sold for £3,000.  I do not have to spell out more clearly that if a bomb site or a derelict site in the North benefits to the extent of £50,000 and seven miles across the Border a building on the main street of a village between Lifford and Derry is sold for £3,000 at a public auction, that is a fair barometer of the devastation that has taken place in <Col N="1568" /> the Border region.  I suggest that the equivalent cannot happen anywhere else in Ireland, not even in the underprivileged and high unemployment areas of Dublin.</P>
    <P>We on the southern side of the Border which can be classed as the north-west, do not want to fall between two stools. That could easily happen because there is a high price to pay.  I do not want to see the Garda and the Army guarding van loads of money going to the north-west every week to destroy the morale of the people living there.  Those people can either stay and see nothing but destitution or leave to seek a better living in Europe.  I want a better living for the people in the north-west.</P>
    <P>I want to see our fishing industry, our tourist industry and our timber industry developed.  At present we are only growing timber for producers and manufacturers in the North of Ireland who come in with their harvesters, cut the timber and take it away; there is not £1 of added value for the South.  I have a lot of respect for the late Mr. Éamon de Valera who believed that if we developed our wasteland with timber it would help our economy, but I do not see that happening.</P>
    <P>As I see it, there is only one major opportunity open to us and that is the Structural Fund, and it must be seen to be evenly divided.  My part of the country must get its fair and honest share.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the excellent document published by the Economic and Social Research Institute yesterday only became available today. It is an interesting document which looks at the way the Structural Funds have been spent in the past and sets out guidelines how they should be spent in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The authors of this document suggest that the £3.4 billion Structural Funds spent between 1989 and 1993 was broadly successful.  It is estimated that 1 per cent will be added to GNP by the year 2000 which represents an investment of around 7 or 8 per cent.  Nearly one-third of the 1989-93 funds were spent on human resources, such as training programmes and social employment <Col N="1569" /> schemes, about one-third was spent on physical infrastructure, such as roads, while industry received 23 per cent and agriculture about 18 per cent.  The consultants say that in the next programme human resources, transport infrastructure and environmental programmes, such as sewage and water treatment, should get a major share of the Structural Funds.  If this is done, it would contribute to adding about another 2 per cent to GNP, which would be a fair return on investment.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the recommendation that water and sewage programmes should get a major share of the Structural Funds.  Dublin city and county will have to provide secondary and, if the Minister can accommodate it, tertiary treatment. I am sure other towns and cities will also have to do this so to comply with the EC directive that sewage can no longer be dumped at sea.</P>
    <P>The investment in our major road programmes is a top priority.  We must adopt measures to reduce the adverse impact of Ireland's peripheral location on economic activity by reducing the cost of internal transport.  I have to make a case for roads in areas outside the Dublin area.  Anyone who has travelled around the country on a Seanad campaign realises the bad condition of roads in rural Ireland.  This does not help economic activity there; there are areas where industries have failed because transporters were unable to use the roads due to their condition.</P>
    <P>Traffic poses a major problem in cities. We got around this in many cases by bypassing major towns but that cannot be done with cities like Dublin.  Traffic congestion results in the loss of many man hours and causes serious environmental problems.  Something must be done to relieve, this problem, especially in Dublin.  I note from the ESRI report that they are anxious the DTI studies on Dublin in relation to light rail be furthered, but I agree with that although I am not a great advocate of light rail because I see it causing problems.  The construction of a light rail system in a major city like Dublin would close certain <Col N="1570" /> roads for a certain period and cause further traffic congestion.  I agree with the study which recommended that other methods have to be examined as well. There is a great lobby abroad for light rail, not a week goes by that I do not get correspondence from some group abroad promoting light rail.</P>
    <P>The principal objective of the 1989-93 programme was the creation of employment. The ESRI in is findings say that we set ourselves a target of 20,000 jobs each year over five years and 90,000 jobs were achieved.  It was a reasonable target and a good result.</P>
    <P>In relation to Dublin's high unemployment rate &mdash; and I said this to the Minister at a social function recently &mdash; for a time it was considered that Dublin could look after itself and the rest of the country required attention.  Successive Governments located employment and major factories in rural areas but, unfortunately, Dublin was unable to look after itself.  It has fallen on very hard times in recent years.  Many of the traditional industries associated with the capital city have failed.  For example in the south inner city, which is an area I know well because I went to school there and represented it for some time, over the past ten years the docks ceased to be a major employer and two hospitals and two bakeries closed.  Dublin Glass, a major employer, and a meat processing factory also closed.  Not one factory was established in place of all these industries, which closed and caused tremendous unemployment.  I know families who have not worked for many years and they have no future employment prospects.  I ask the Minister to spend the Structural Funds in a productive way to create employment, especially in a major urban area such as Dublin.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the commitment to spend on education.  I understand that between 1989 and 1993 £2 billion was spent on education and on improving the skills of the Irish workforce and on retraining.  This commitment must be continued, expecially training for the long term unemployed.  Primary education should receive greater funding.  I <Col N="1571" /> was interested in what Senator Lee said this morning in relation to that point. While he made a case for third level education, nevertheless he was generous in pointing out that pre-school and primary education are also major factors. Education at that point of one's life is very important.</P>
    <P>I ask that when industry is being planned for an area the workforce there should be trained for that particular industry.  There is no point bringing an industry to a part of the city or county where the workforce is not trained because people from outside the area will get the employment.  This has happened time and time again.  There should be a long term programme for industrial investment and local people should be trained for particular industries.</P>
    <P>Ireland's share of EC funds is expected to be approximately £8 billion but this should not be taken for granted.  It will be like the last occasion when the Commission made the decisions.  I understand that on this occasion the Commission and the Council of Foreign Ministers will make the decisions.  Ireland faces serious competition from othe peripheral states such as Greece and Portugal.  We must fully convince the Commission and the Council of Foreign Ministers that we spent Structural Funds well over the past five years and that our programme for the next five years will show that we will spend future Structural Funds well.  If we do that we can make a good case for £8 billion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is the first time I have had the honour of doing so.  As we reach the end of the 1990s we must realise that she has one of the most difficult undertakings of any Minister in this Government or previous Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the 21st century approaches the structuring of EC funds is one of the most important items to be faced.  There are challenges in many different areas, such as improving the country's infrastructure, productivity structures and, the most important of all as far as I am concerned, <Col N="1572" /> human resources.  These must be dealt with on urban and rural bases.  I am from a rural background and if rural Ireland is to be retained we must not let this chance pass.  It is the one opportunity to ensure that there is life beyond Clondalkin, as the saying goes.  Rural parts sustained this country for many years in the past.  I ask the Minister in her deliberations to ensure that rural Ireland gets its substantial share of the funds.</P>
    <P>Although there are problems with infrastructure relating to roads and rail, etc, the highest percentage of funds must go towards improving human resources and alleviating the problems that exist in Ireland at the present time.  There are 300,000 people unemployed and we must ensure that young people are given a glimmer of hope.  In bypassing areas we run the risk of forgetting that there are people on the inside.</P>
    <P>If one examines rural development and agriculture, the population dependent on agriculture has diminished at a rapid rate in the past number of years.  Rural Ireland has been decimated as a result of the loss of employment in agriculture.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the agriculture and food sectors get their fair share of Structural Funds.  I am sure the IFA, Macra na Feirme and all the people in that sector will put their case in a manner that will ensure there will be a future for the industry.  It has been repeatedly said that the industry has a future but that will not happen if the agricultural community itself is decimated and there are only ranch farmers who control half a county instead of the existing farming community which supported everything that was good for the rural population in the past.</P>
    <P>We must also ensure that there is coordination between urban and rural development.  There must be a time frame and accountability attached to what is our last major chance to ensure growth so that we can approach the 21st century in a positive manner.  All sides of the community badly need a glimmer of hope at the present time.  The junior certificate and the leaving certificate examinations are ongoing and there are so <Col N="1573" /> many who have tried so hard, be it parents, pupils or teachers, to ensure that the future generation are of the right frame of mind.  We must not let them down at this stage.  We must ensure that proper structures are in place and that there is employment in the future.  The Structural Funds are the EC's last major input and we must ensure that all our natural resources will be put to the most effective use to ensure employment.</P>
    <P>In the past fortnight, I have visited local Bord na Móna offices and met the managing director and officers.  They wish to develop the rural regions but also seek investment &mdash; not of major proportions &mdash; to ensure that research and development will help the company to grow.  The new environmental products division, for example, could become a major factor in getting foreign markets for their products.  After speaking to the head of that division, I feel the benefits will be twofold.  Manual skills will be required.  Bord na Móna was one of the founders of the apprenticeship scheme, which ensured a continual growth in the number of tradesmen.  The technical skills of that department will bring together many of our third level graduates in the water treatment sector.  The company has recently moved into the American market, which has unlimited potential to provide finance for the company.</P>
    <P>Within the Bord na Móna structure, the horticultural sector currently exports 90 per cent of its products, which are worth approximately £30 million.  That could be expanded further by EC funding for research, development and marketing, which could help us penetrate the Dutch market &mdash; the home of horticulture &mdash; to ensure the future growth of the firm.  We must make sure the regions have a chance to develop to the same extent as other sectors.  I ask the Minister of State not to forget this sector.  Of the £28 billion made in claims to her Department, £8 billion may seem small but I am sure that, through her undoubted wisdom and ability, all parts of our community will benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the House on Structural Funds, especially when the ESRI consulants' report has been published.</P>
      <P>I agree with the comments of the Minister of State in this House on 27 May when she said that the next round of Structural Funds must ensure that the best long term return to the economy is achieved and we must try to integrate into the economic mainstream those individuals who are currently unemployed.  I share the views of the Minister of State on this, as would most speakers.  A targeted programme of local development for unemployment blackspots, as the Minister of State outlined in her speech, must be a key feature of the plan.  When we look at the amount of money we are going to get from Structural Funds &mdash; most assume it will be approximately £8 billion &mdash; all of us would accept that this is a significant cash injection into our economy.  However, if we look at the unemployment problem and the amount spent on unemployment benefit and assistance &mdash; for this year, it is almost £900,000,000 &mdash; and the period over which these Structural Funds will be spent, the same amount of money will be paid out in unemployment benefit and assistance.  The unemployed are entitled to ask what EC moneys are doing for them and what rewards they are getting. We should look both at the Structural Funds and the money currently being paid out to the unemployed to see how we can marry the two and get the best possible benefits, especially for those trapped in those blackspots who feel increasingly marginalised.  That is a great challenge to all of us and to the Minister of State.  This is one of her main concerns and she will look at it closely when she decides what projects are to be funded. The reason we are getting Structural Funds is that we are seen to be at a disadvantage compared to the rest of Europe.  We have an obligation to ensure that the most disadvantaged in our communities get a substantial share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report published yesterday looked at various areas for funding.  I wish to <Col N="1575" /> concentrate on human and natural resources and local development.  Few speakers have looked at the important area of womens' unemployment and their involvement in economic life.  The report states that investment in this resource gives a good rate of return but some areas of investment up to now may not have been the best option.  Funds that went into social employment schemes were designed to help alleviate the problem of the long term unemployed.  While these schemes provided work, there was no training, which I understood was a condition of EC funding.  We have to give the unemployed some prospect of coming back to the labour force and unless they get some sort of training or education through these schemes, it is a waste of time for them to become involved. Additional resources must be allocated for training within the social employment schemes.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, said that the integration of our tax and social welfare systems must come about. We cannot have disincentives to becoming involved in the workforce.  Our taxation system must be reviewed to ensure that the benefit obtained from EC funding is not negated by practice.  We must also look at our budget.  The Finance Act contains measures which are antiemployment. The Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, has the right idea in targeting funding at children who are leaving the school system without any qualifications.  As I come from a rural region, I would also be interested in natural resources and local development.</P>
    <P>There seems to be an impression that the ESRI consultants' report recommended an end to headage payments paid to farmers.  On my reading of the report, they did not say this.  They said that they did not consider these payments relevant to the objective of the Community support framework which is concerned with stimulating investment towards achieving sustainable employment and incomes.  The report suggested that these payments are more appropriate <Col N="1576" /> to the guarantee section of the European Agricultural Guaranteeing Guidance Fund and if they are included in the next CSF funding they should be part of a sub-programme for related rural development.  I agree with this.  The report is not saying there should be an end to these payments.  Headage payments enable small farmers stay on the land and get involved in other enterprises. We should encourage them to do so and, hopefully, these enterprises will provide an alternative source of income. We do not want small farmers to leave the land so that areas of rural Ireland will be denuded of population.  That would not be in anybody's interest.</P>
    <P>The report recognises the potential of natural resources.  The problems of under-development and low incomes in rural areas must be tackled.  These funds must be used to develop rural areas and establish alternative rural industries and services.  The report identified the potential of the forestry industry and stated that investment in this industry would promote further employment and output.  I welcome this.  I hope the suggestion to end headage payments does not prevail.</P>
    <P>Local economic development is essential, and this is an area in which women must be involved.  Most of the employment growth areas are in the services sector.  In the past, we concentrated on manufacturing industry which has always been assisted by State agencies. However, potential for growth lies in the services sector.  In other countries women are successfully involved in this area and we must encourage this at home.</P>
    <P>In recent years most service industries in the US have been set up by women. These enterprises have been successful because agencies, such as the women's business bureau, assist women setting up businesses.  The Second Commission on the Status of Women recommended similar measures.  I ask Ministers of State, Deputy E. Fitzgerald and Deputy Burton to consider this recommendation.  A small investment could yield a high return.  People believe that money can only be made in heavy industries, such as <Col N="1577" /> shipbuilding but women have potential and are becoming involved in business.</P>
    <P>I welcome the New Opportunities for Women programme which encourages women to become involved.  Pilot projects have been established throughout the country and I ask the Minister to allocate Structural Funds for this purpose.</P>
    <P>There must be accountability for this funding.  A project which will yield a high rate of return must be supported.  I agree with the Minister when she said that we do not want displacement, that new schemes must not be set up at the expense of existing schemes.  There is no point creating employment if others become unemployed as a result.  Furthermore, we must avoid deadweight.  Schemes which would have been set up regardless of the fund should not receive funding.</P>

      <P>I will be as accommodating as possible.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter and welcome the Minister to the House, particularly, in view of the ESRI report.  Regrettably, we have not had the opportunity to study this report as it was only made available this morning. To make a constructive and significant contribution to this debate, we would have needed more time to study it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been involved in this area since 1981 when the Commission set up the Mandate for Economic Development and for Convergence Policies.  In that <Col N="1578" /> mandate we proposed what one might call the forerunner to the Structural Funds.  Unfortunately, Governments failed to adopt the policies introduced in 1982 &mdash; not until the last allocation of Structural Funds four years ago.  A certain strong lady in Britain was not committed to the European Community or convergence and other Heads of Government failed to ensure that her narrow view would not determine European policy.  However, certain developments followed.</P>
    <P>Training as distinct from education received priority because there is no common education policy in the EC.  We were seen as experts in drawing down the maximum funding for training under the Structural Funds and when the Greeks, Spanish and Portuguese joined the EC, they studied how we maximised the money we got from the training fund.</P>
    <P>I have no reservations about training, but I have grave reservations about building up and strengthening the administration involved in this area.  The Government must address this issue by casting a critical eye on EC funds already received to see how much has been allocated for the creation of knowledge and knowledge based activity.  This will guarantee a base for employment in the future.  If these funds are to be used effectively we must not have FÁS conducting interviews which could be conducted by the industries concerned.</P>
    <P>The more money that is allocated to education the better.  As I said, that area was not a priority because of the absence of a common education policy.  If we are to create sustainable employment in the future, this must permeate our approach to agricultural and industrial development, and I do not distinguish between them because they both represent economic development.</P>
    <P>I am not encouraged by what I have read in the ESRI report because the authors did not seem to be aware of what had been done.  Senator Honan was correct when she said that the report did not recommend the abolition of the headage grants but the report recommended that the existing headage grants be reduced <Col N="1579" /> and discouraged.  It states that the headage payments are irrelevant to simulating investment towards achieving sustainable employment and incomes.  If they are irrelevant, there is no justification for them.  As one who has been involved in this area for five years, I must say they are very relevant.</P>
    <P>I agree with the ESRI's focus on the food industry &mdash; I like to think that I developed that industry &mdash; but how can you have one without the other?  How can one have a modern pig meat industry without basic agriculture?  We took great pains to raise our standards and they are now acceptable all around the world &mdash; up until 1987 we could not export even a crúibín to Japan &mdash; but this has been achieved on the basis of the interlink between modern and enlightened agricultural production and the food processing industry.  One cannot be dealt with independently of the other.  I am encouraged by the emphasis on the food sector.</P>
    <P>Almost 75 per cent of the country benefits from headage payments and I claim some credit for that &mdash; before I was Minister only 58 per cent benefited.  The high rate of grants for headage payments, up to 75 per cent from the EC is effectively full financing.  Are we going to throw all that aside?  Anyone who has made even a casual trip through rural Ireland has seen the difference between the quality of land in disadvantaged areas and sometimes areas beside them which are not disadvantaged.  The irony is that this is the base for the food industry.</P>
    <P>The rural development programme is not confined to farming, and I endorse what the ESRI have said in this regard. Rural development &mdash; which my party also introduced &mdash; extends to towns with populations as large as 20,000.  Are we to ignore the fact that our country towns, not only in Ireland but also in the rest of Europe, are dependent on farming?  My constituency, North Tipperary, is regarded as rural yet a litle more than 25 per cent of the population live on farms, the other 75 per cent reside in towns and villages and more than half of that 75 per <Col N="1580" /> cent are dependent directly on employment generated by farming.</P>
    <P>In Roscrea there are 600 jobs in the pig curing, bacon processing and beef industries, and I helped to attract those industries to the town.  In my hometown, Nenagh Co-operative employs more than 200 people.  All the industries there, for example, Carey Glass, Castlebrand and Anglo-Irish Meats are dependent on farming.  In Thurles beef and pig meat processing industries were established in recent years.  Are we going to ignore the fact that these industries could not operate without a healthy and sustainable agricultural sector?  I ask that a division not be introduced in this area.</P>
    <P>The Government has a difficult decision to make.  With reference to the Minister of State, I get the impression from the reports I have read that she is going to make this decision.  When I was a Minister that would not have happened; the Ministers with economic responsibilities went to Europe together and then made recommendations to the Government. The Minister of State is probably collecting data and information to present to Government.  This matter is of such importance &mdash; and I do not wish to denigrate the Minister of State &mdash; that it should not be in the hands of just one Minister or Minister of State.  It is for the Minister to collect and collate the information and the Government to then fulfil its responsibility in this regard.</P>
    <P>Private forestry has done well from FEOGA funding.  We have seen coniferous forests all over the country, not broadleaf trees which were a feature of the Irish countryside.  Private forestry groups are paying much more for land than farmers can afford.  I thought we had been too generous to private forestry and I am now convinced of it.  I suggest that the Minister remember that people are more important than conifers.  I would be enthusiastic if they were developing Ireland's traditional broadleaf species, and I hope that balance will be corrected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCashin" hpid="Mr. Cashin Mr. Cashin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cashin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I have no doubt that if she <Col N="1581" /> has the task of dispersing the Structural Funds she is more than capable of doing it.</P>
      <P>The unfortunate homeless sleeping on park seats and in doorways should be housed.  If funding can be provided for hostels we should provide it, and I hope my plea has touched the heart and purse of the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>Like my fellow Senators I believe the potential of the tourism industry has yet to be tapped.  Although Ireland is a peripheral State, our people, good food and our land are the envy of many European countries.  For the past four of five years I have been involved in bringing people from the continent.  They have openly acknowledged the friendliness of our people, our way of life and the chance to experience the slower pace here.</P>
      <P>To develop tourism we must look to our regional and minor roads which lead tourists to the hidden Ireland.</P>
      <P>West of Kanturk, in the north-west of Cork a farmer cannot grow cereal crops. Seven miles from the town is Newmarket and beyond that there is a mountain land, bogland and afforestration as far as the Kerry border.  The flight from the land must be stopped, yet, no significant effort has been made to do so despite a great deal of talk.  Many seasonal workers and farmers and their families who are on the dole will leave because they have their pride and weant to avoid the stigma of being on the dole.</P>
      <P>If the necessary infrastructure of roads was in place the farm guest house and fishing industries could be developed. Regrettably, the two rivers which flow into Kanturk are polluted, but they could be suitable for brown trout, salmon and pike which would attract tourists.  There are pollution officers to deal with pollution in our major rivers but due to a lack of men on the ground they visit the scene two and three days after the crime and cannot trace the culprit.  Recent, in my county the problem of drug smuggling has arisen and we need resources to tackle that problem also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for giving me this time.  I understand that this <Col N="1582" /> allocation of Structural Funds may be the last of this type of EC funding.  It must be used to create long term sustainable employment.  It is not good enough for funds to be allocated simply on the basis of wheeling and dealing between Ministers without reference to local authorities or communities.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to spending on main arterial roads.  In the last fortnight we have heard that £4 million is being spent on the road between Fermoy and Kilbehenny. It is outrageous to spend that kind of money while the N72 and other national secondary or primary roads are in such bad condition.  There must be more expenditure in the development of our operational programme for water and sanitary services and other local developments of that nature which are labour-intensive and provide the necessary infrastructure.  Some towns in north Cork do not have adequate water supplies to enable further development including industrial development.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make those points.  I could speak at length but I thank the Minister for giving me this opportunity to contribute to the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators.  It has been a constructive debate and it is part of the consultation process in finalising the national plan. Some 17 Senators have contributed to the debate and tomorrow the other House will follow suit in debating the Structural Funds in an all-day session.  It is important that there is a democratic input as part of the decision-making process in relation to the national plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As many of the Senators have acknowledged, this is our last chance to get increased funding on this scale and it is important to get it right.  There has been a sense of realism in the contributions. We are not going to be able to meet the <Col N="1583" /> £28 billion in demands and we are going to have to whittle it down to what we are likely to get from Brussels.  Inevitably, there will be some disappointments. Many Senators have referred to the need to get an adequate rate of return.  The idea of getting the best long term value has influenced all the work that has been done on the national plan by myself and by the Government who will be involved in the final process.  I can put Senator Kennedy's mind at rest on that issue.</P>
    <P>We are trying to achieve a balance between direct investment in productive jobs, productive infrastructure and human resources.  I also want to achieve a regional balance between urban and rural development.  While I realise there is a presidential contest going on in the IFA and sometimes things are said, I want to put it on record that I am not opposed to the farming sector or to rural development; we want to achieve a proper regional balance.  As many of the Senators have pointed out in their contributions what the ESRI report was saying in relation to headage payments was that they fit more appropriately into an income guarantee than into structural guidance type expenditure.  Senators can rest assured that headage payments will continue to form an important element in the new national plan.</P>
    <P>One of the significant points made by Senators today and by all the subregional review groups in their submissions has been the need to spend money on county roads and not just on the national primary roads.  National primary routes take 25 per cent of national traffic so it is important that we continue to invest in those areas in order to reduce the length of time of journeys and reduce costs for businesses and services moving goods and people around the country.</P>
    <P>Today we see the opening of the New-bridge by-pass which will be of benefit to anybody who travels to the south and to the south-west.  It is also important that we have a balance.  Balance will be achieved by significant investment in the county roads in the new national plan but in making that investment it is important <Col N="1584" /> that we do not just put money into filling potholes.  We are talking about 94 per cent of the national road network and resources will not be available to fill in every pothole or to do everything that people might like to do in the county roads sector.  It is important to identify the areas where we are exploiting the forests we have planted and developing our timber industry, to identify those roads which are serving our tourist industry and the local roads which are serving local jobs.</P>
    <P>It is important when putting more investment into local roads in the next round of the Structural Funds that we do not just regard this as some kind of a local slush fund.  The money should be used for those roads that are essential to the provision of jobs and that contribute, together with the investment in national primary roads, to improving our national infrastructure.  There will be more investment in public transport in the next round of the Structural Funds.  We will see a better balance between public and private transport investment.</P>
    <P>The area of local economic development is very important.  Local economic development operates at two different levels.  We are building on an existing local economic infrastructure and we are tapping into local enterprise, the local knowledge which people have of their own areas and the sense of local patriotism in building up these areas.  The new county enterprise partnership boards will be an important element of the new plan. They have a tripartite structure made up of local elected representatives, representatives of local business and economic trade union interests and representatives of local community interests.  They will tap into the local economic potential in many areas.  We also need an element in the plan which is targeted at unemployment black spots.  If we do not intervene these areas will be left behind.</P>
    <P>I welcome what Senator Lee had to say in relation to the need to invest in people who are likely to become tomorrow's long term unemployed unless we intervene at this stage.  The immediate rate of <Col N="1585" /> return in terms of investing in unemployment black spots is not going to be as attractive as, for example, an investment in eliminating a major bottleneck on a road or investing in people who are already well educated.  It is important, however, that we do not abandon any of our people and that we allocate resources to eliminate unemployment black spots and target both urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>While there are major unemployment black spots in Dublin in places which have been mentioned, there are also areas, as Senator Lee mentioned, such as north Cork, Moyross and South Hill in Limerick, areas in Galway and areas around the country that have problems. There are rural black spots that have experienced a high rate of emigration and a weakening of the economic fabric.  In a local economic development programme we are not going to be able to do everything but we will try to target and build on the experience of the existing <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> area partnerships and to target interventions to begin to tackle that most serious problem. We will try to ensure that we put heart and life back into communities and build on the fight back that is already taking place in these communities.  I would see that as being a very important element in our national plan.</P>
    <P>I would like to take up a couple of the points which have been made by Senators in the debate; it will not be possible to deal with everything.  I am glad the ESRI report has now been published.  Senator Cotter would have liked us to have published it last year but it was only commissioned in October and it was published as soon as it was ready.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn spoke about peripherality and the need for rural development, which we acknowledge. She also spoke about coastal erosion. We are not sure to what extent this will be regarded as eligible by Brussels but it is being examined.  Senator Taylor-Quinn and other Senators mentioned forestry and wood processing.  Our wood industry largely exports unprocessed wood which is the equivalent of exporting <Col N="1586" /> cattle on the hoof.  We could produce items such as fence posts and pallets.  We would see investment in wood processing as an important part of an industrial programme.</P>
    <P>Building on the work of the expert group on the food industry, investment in that industry complements what we are doing on the agricultural side.  We need to examine alternative farm enterprise and other forms of rural development to cope with the problems created by the Common Agricultural Policy ceilings on production.  I think there is a major commitment to rural Ireland.  The Border regions were raised by Senator McGowan and Senator Mooney.  We hope to see a continuation of the Interreg programme involving the Border regions to try to build economic development there and cross-Border links.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran referred to the importance of tourism, to the need to invest in attractions that will bring people here and to let the private sector provide accommodation.  I think that point is well made.  Senator Lee referred to the question of investment early in the education process.  At EC level they are anxious that we invest in education and training and I think Senator O'Kennedy made that point clear.  We will try to ensure the maximum possible flexibility in order to get the best return although we are restricted by the regulations.  In the framework of local economic development, we can intervene earlier on and we will try to do that.</P>
    <P>Senator Townsend made an interesting contribution in relation to farm income support which I think deserves wider discussion and debate.  Senator Cashin referred to hostels for the homeless.  I sympathise with that point as I served for many years on the executive of the National Campaign for the Homeless. However, the EC will not pay for housing. What we submit to Brussels must reflect what the EC and the donor countries are prepared to pay for; the investments must lie within the regulations.</P>
    <P>Senator Cotter referred to deficiencies, as he saw them, in the consultative process. Since I took office I have placed <Col N="1587" /> much emphasis on consultation.  I have met each of the seven subregional review groups that were established.  They will be incorporated into the new regional authorities which will be a slight shift of boundaries to make it more logical.  I think being part of the regional authorities will strengthen the process.  The business, trade union and farming sectors have made an important input, which will continue under the new regional authorities. I would also like to see that process strengthened by including the voluntary and community sector which, with the exception of the south-east, has been outside that process.</P>
    <P>I have met all the groups which have made submissions; the major national organisations, the social partners, and organisations such as the Council for the Status of Women, the Combat Poverty Agency, the community workers' co-op and so on.  I welcome the input of these organisations.  The best plan is one which we make as a national endeavour, based on a process of listening to what everybody has to contribute to the debate.  I hope to build on that process of consultation.</P>
    <P>Next week, we are launching the National Economic and Social Forum which will incorporate the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment and will have Seanad membership. That is a tripartite structure involving the Oireachtas Members and the traditional social partners of the employers, unions and farmers.  The third strand is comprised of the community and voluntary sector: the disadvantaged, women's groups, the unemployed, people who have been outside the mainstream consultative process up to now.  They will examine the national plan and their input in areas such as the operational programmes and human resources will be greatly valued.  These areas are not set down on tablets of stone.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Senators for their contributions.  I came here to listen and I have taken detailed notes of all the points which were made.  I found it a valuable exercise and I hope that <Col N="1588" /> together, as a community, we can submit the best possible national plan to Brussels and receive the best national return from this significant investment which our European partners are making in our future.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. a1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 27, to delete &ldquo;Forfás or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his attendance at Committee Stage.  The substance of this amendment and the related amendments &mdash; there could be many more if we were pedantic about the Bill &mdash; is to delete &ldquo;Forfás&rdquo; from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of this agency was not one of the recommendations in the Culliton report which, when it was published, received support from all parties.  Its establishment creates another unnecessary layer of bureaucracy.  The central recommendation of the Culliton report was that there would be two bodies and that there should be a new agency for the development of indigenous Irish managed industry to bring together, in a more integrated way, the development and support services provided at present on a separate basis by the IDA, ABT and <Col N="1589" /> Eolas in particular.  Such an agency would provide a new impetus and focus for promoting the development of locally based industry.  The report continues that there should be another agency formed from the present IDA to deal with internationally mobile investment.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that those aspects are dealt with in the legislation, and the Bill, in those respects, conforms with the Culliton recommendations.  However, I do not understand the need for this other agency.  The Minister, on Second Stage, talked about encouraging a dynamic spirit of enterprise.  That is to be welcomed, but I submit that the establishment of Forfás does not conform with such encouragement of a dynamic spirit of enterprise &mdash; nor do the 1 per cent levy and other taxes but they were discussed yesterday on Second Stage and I will not deal with them today.</P>
    <P>Forfás is an unnecessary appendage. We are bedevilled in this country by inter-agency rivalries that inhibit progress and development.  Some of this rivalry between agencies focuses on claiming responsibility for certain sectors. That type of rivalry has spilled over into Government where we have the establishment of the Department of Tourism and Trade.  In my view trade should more appropriately be dealt with in the former Department of Industry and Commerce; I would not object to the former Department of Labour being included in the remit of the former Department of Industry and Commerce, now the Department of Enterprise and Employment; it could even be argued that foreign trade could be dealt with by the Department of Foreign Affairs through the appointment of commercial attachés to our embassies.  The creation of a new agency is another layer of bureaucracy and another vehicle of interagency rivalry.  We should simply establish the two agencies recommended in the Culliton report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a definite number of jobs could be created by the establishment of this new <Col N="1590" /> agency it would be worthy of support. However, we are only moving the deckchairs and putting new signs over the same offices.  In this case, there will be a new board competing with the others. I support the sentiments expressed by Senator Dardis and I believe two agencies would have been appropriate for overall industrial policy.  Given the talk about a new approach I thought this Bill would have shown we meant what we said but we are not doing that when we establish Forfás.  That is why I support this amendment.</P>

It is an umbrella organisation to co-ordinate the work of the other two bodies.  I see it as having a very clear function in the whole system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me address this comment, because it is fundamental to much of the thinking in this legislation.  I regret that due to other factors I was unable to participate fully in the Second Stage debate yesterday.  I would not like Members of this House to think that I was not interested in their comments; in fact, I have appraised myself of what has been said and I intend to be present for all subsequent Stages of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that this legislation has a number of parents.  Mr. Culliton is not the sole proprietor of its recommendations. I declare a certain degree of shared parentage in this matter.  The Moriarty task force was appointed by the person who commissioned the Culliton report to recommend the best method of implementing the Culliton report.  That was not done to delay its implementation. It was recognised that while there were very eminent people on the Culliton committee, their knowledge of politics is somewhat limited and their knowledge of the practical implementation of their recommendations is even more limited. It was for that reason that a very wise <Col N="1591" /> former Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, sought to recommend that while we have these very wise recommendations, among which the agency restructuring was a minor one relative to the broad thrust of the Culliton report, the Moriarty task force was comprised primarily of people who knew the territory, and they proposed a number of recommendations as to how best the Culliton report, in the broadest sense, could be implemented.  That, therefore, forms part of the background to this agency restructuring.</P>
    <P>A second part of the background was the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, the then Taoiseach, and the incoming Tánaiste, leader of the Labour Party, who together recognised that there was a need to restructure the departmental arrangements of the Government as it was then.  In addition to that, the negotiators of the Programme for a Partnership Government &mdash; on the Fianna Fáil side they were Deputies Ahern, Cowen and Dempsey, and on the Labour side they were Deputies Taylor, Howlin and myself &mdash; negotiated over approximately four weeks an elaborate programme, within which the recommendations of the Culliton report were broadly accepted.  We accepted there was a need to implement the report in a particular way.  The entire Culliton debate in the autumn of 1992 was characterised by rows and rivalries between agencies which totally obscured the main intellectual thrust of the report.  You cannot argue with geography.  If the Rocky Mountain range is there you negotiate your way over it or round it; you do not say it does not exist.  For that reason, we came up with a formula &mdash; I am quite comfortable intellectually in standing over this &mdash; that dealt with the best way to address the two conflicting arguments clearly articulated in the autumn of 1992.</P>
    <P>The solution reached was the formation of one supra-agency for the purposes of co-ordination and lack of duplication of costs, and two separate hall doors with different labels, one for <Col N="1592" /> foreign investment, to be called IDA (Ireland), and one for indigenous manufacturing and related types of activity which would need more than the kind of services that IDA (Ireland) could provide for an already established company. What we have come up with is a tripartite triangular structure, a holding company between the Department of Enterprise and Employment and two separate agencies. There are many retail organisations in this country whose ultimate ownershp is held between two or three companies, but as far as the customer is concerned there is one body only.  There will be only one door through which foreign investment will have to pass called IDA (Ireland), and for companies establishing themselves there will only be one door, that is Forbairt.  This is clearly in line with what Culliton and Moriarty and others have frequently argued for, namely, clarity in relation to what is required, and a separation of the activities of IDA (Ireland) in attracting inward investment into this country, which is one set of tasks, and the totally separate, but under the present structure the related task of trying to help indigenous companies to prosper and grow.  That is why Forfás is to be established.</P>
    <P>At this point I can refer to why ABT is separate and related to Forfás in the manner set out.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste decided, and this was endorsed subsequently in the Oireachtas, that there would be a Department of Tourism and Trade.  The Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy and I looked at a number of ways in which we could take some of the marketing functions currently held by ABT and locate them in Forbairt.  The three essential elements of any prosperous enterprise are product, marketing and finance.  Marketing is an essential component, particularly in the globalisation of world markets.  In the domestic market with the advent of free trade, marketing is critical, even for companies which traditionally confined themselves to their own domestic market.  We looked at homw to take the domestic marketing component out of ABT and locate it in Forbairt.  We investigated several <Col N="1593" /> ways of dividing ABT, by sector, by threshold size or by the employment level of the firm involved.</P>
    <P>We investigated the possibility of transferring that section of marketing into Forbairt, to add to the different kinds of help available from Forbairt for small indigenous industry, given the structure, consisting of Forfás, IDA (Ireland) and Forbairt, given ABT, the morale of the organisation and its personnel, both Deputy McCreevy and myself decided it would be better not to split the organisation, because a contradictory system would evolve from such a split.  We also knew that the specialist group set up under the Culliton committee, the recommendation on food group, although it had not completed its final report, was going to recommend something like An Bord Bia, as it subsequently did.  Some form of co-ordination at the policy level was desirable to avoid duplication because resources are scarce.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong but I believe we have come up with the best compromise, and it is unashamedly a compromise, between what is feasible, what is desirable and what can be implemented quickly and put in place without all the energies of the people who work in these agencies being diverted into fighting new wars and new corners of career paths for themselves, and not looking after the customer.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery will be aware that I was the person who initially proposed the integration of AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency, and the National Manpower Service in a Bill that fell on the dissolution of the Dáil in 1987, and resurrected itself as FÁS.  Any customer who knows FÁS will concur when I say that for about 18 months the internal energies of that organisation were directed inwards because of the managerial uncertainty surrounding its future. We have neither the time nor the resources, and our citizens do not have the patience or the luxury, to allow that.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that this new structure is an ideal one plucked from heaven, it is not, but it is designed to recognise <Col N="1594" /> that obstacles exist and we have to get over them as quickly as possible.  It is also a structure that recognises the constraints of money and of personnel, and the terms of the employment contracts most people in those agencies have.</P>
    <P>This structure is being put into place against that background, informed by what the Moriarty task force recommended and our own practical knowledge as politicians from two parties.  It is an amalgam of all those elements being brought to bear with the expertise of the Civil Service.  Having said all that, in the context I have defined and described, I believe this is the best possible structure that will enable us to put in place quickly a revised system of assistance to industry that will maximise employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I found many parts of it convincing.  In fact, his reply has convinced me even more of the need not to have Forfás and to confine ourselves to the two other agencies.  I agree with the Minister's remarks on the scarcity of resources and the restraints on money and staffing.  That, I think, underlines my argument.  He also acknowledged the inter-agency rivalry and that, too, convinces me that the amendment is correct.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the Minister has clarified that the structure outlined in the Bill is not the structure as devised by Culliton, and that it has more to do with the Moriarty task force and the Government's response to the Culliton report.  I am pleased about that because several speakers referred yesterday to the fact that what was being implemented was a main recommendation of Culliton.  They should not have said that because it is not, and the Minister has confirmed that. From that point of view I welcome his answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he was comfortable intellectually.  When the Minister says that I get very uncomfortable and not from an intellectual point of view.  What we are establishing here is a holding company, and I accept that.  However, while I take the Minister's point that not all the proposals are from Culliton, what <Col N="1595" /> Culliton said was that &ldquo;the two industrial promotion agencies which we recommend should have inter-locking board membership&rdquo;.  The structures which are most appropriate to industry may not be the structures that are most appropriate to Government or Government agencies. Even that point was acknowledged in respect of the Culliton report when the Minister mentioned the political dimension.</P>
    <P>It is not consistent to argue that there should be a structure similar to an industrial one for a holding company, having previously said that the Culliton report did not take into account the political aspects of the issue.  Government and business do not operate in the same way, even though they should have the same thrust with Government operating in a business-like way.  However, that is not to say it should have a structure that is more appropriate to business than to Government agencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may have been more cerebrally comfortable than intellectually comfortable in the sense that it was a thought out position in which he was contextually comfortable.  That was certainly the way I heard it.</P>
      <P>I said on Second Stage yesterday that I had listened to the agruments as to whether there should be one, two or three agencies, and that this discussion had been going on for the last year.  I have not heard such certainty on two sides of an argument since the pro-life debate.  Everybody is certain of their point of view.  I could not hear precisely whether the Minister said that he and the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, abhorred or applauded the rivalry between their Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for having the grace to say he thinks this is the best proposal he can put forward.  Everybody has put forward a point of view, but nobody has come up with the answers. There is a party political agenda to which Senators on these benches do not need to subscribe.  I said last night I did not know which was the better proposal, two <Col N="1596" /> agencies or three, but the Minister has given the clearest response to a question on Committee Stage I have heard for a long time.  He has taken us right through the difficulties &mdash; warts and all.  We have all been aware of them, have read about them in the newspapers etc.  I am one of the people who has never been completely comfortable with all the Culliton proposals.  I have been consistent in that, not that consistency should be held up as a virtue.  There may be faults or flaws in either proposals and, as I said yesterday, I am prepared to support what is in the Bill, to give it a chance to see if it works.</P>
    <P>In trying to find a balance between the proposals for two or three agencies, one of my problems is that I have always had a difficulty with the IDA itself in that it did not have a continual responsibility to report to another body, although the Department was there in a sort of overseeing role.  I am attracted to the idea of Forfás being there to insist on a monthly or six-monthly report.  I would presume that the first item on the agenda at each meeting of the Forfás board would be reports from Forbairt and IDA (Ireland).  That at least creates an in-built justification, accountability and a need to explain policy.</P>
    <P>Can Forfás call the shots as envisaged by the words &ldquo;advise and co-ordinate&rdquo; in the Bill?  That seems weak, and that is where the argument would tend towards Senator Dardis' side.  The word &ldquo;co-ordinate&rdquo; suggests that each sub-agency decides what it wants to do while ensuring they are complementary and that there is no conflict between them.  I would prefer if the role was more clearly defined because, in my reading of the functions, I do not see an overriding directional role for Forfás.  I would like to know how far its functions extend.  For example, can Forfás tell one of the other agencies it is going in the wrong direction?  If that is the case, it changes the whole ball game and means that both agencies cannot be in conflict with each other chasing the same market.  That can happen because, even though the national and international areas are supposed to be separate, their sub-regions can overlap.  We <Col N="1597" /> are not even clear in this country what the nation is, so the terms &ldquo;national&rdquo; and &ldquo;international&rdquo; could create their own problems within this island.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister say whether Forfás can call the shots and decide policy direction.  It is not merely a question of giving it a job to do and saying how to do it.  We are saying this is not the context in which it should be working or the area it should be developing. If Forfás is to be established there should be a sense of accountability upwards and a sense of direction downwards. That would be the best way to develop a complementary approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am much in agreement with the comments of Senator O'Toole. I welcome the Minister's response to Senator Dardis because it helped confirm for me what I assumed was the background to this Bill.  To quote the Minister in another context, I was not intellectually convinced by this legislation but I took the view last night that the Minister was highly intelligent and I was prepared to trust his judgment as to what was the best thing to do under the circumstances.</P>
      <P>I would not go quite as far as Senator Quinn and call the Bill &ldquo;a shambles&rdquo; but it is cumbersome in many respects and what the Minister has said today has confirmed that.  I am still prepared to trust his judgment although I hope when we look at it in detail he will allow his judgment to develop over time and not wait for three years to revise issues that have begun to go wrong.</P>
      <P>I am interested in what Senator O'Toole has said about the relationship of Forfás to the other two bodies.  Section 6 (d), about Forfás, says it will &ldquo;encourage the establishment and development in the State of industrial undertakings from outside the State&rdquo;.  Section 8 (a), relating to IDA (Ireland), says virtually the same.  The two bodies seem to have identical functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no similar cross-over between sections 6 and 7, at least in textual terms. Section 7 is supposed to be concerned with indigenous industry but there is nothing in the text of the section on that <Col N="1598" /> subject.  We simply have to accept that is what it concerns.  It strikes me as being curious drafting, without wishing to reflect further.  The precise relationship between Forfás and the other two organisations is a skewed one.  I would appreciate a comment on that.</P>
    <P>There should also be a comment on what Senator Dardis has said because he has raised a valid point.  I am not convinced we should have two agencies. If we do, there must be some relationship, whether through interlocking boards or Forfás.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report is quoted and is being asked to bear a burden it should not be required to bear.  The report was a remarkable document in the time at the committee's disposal.  One should pay close attention to it on the areas where the committee members were able to speak from personal authority.  Where they were unable to pronounce from comparable personal authority matters are more open.  One should pay attention to their views but by no means should one feel constrained to follow them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to detain the House but I meant to raise a matter when I spoke earlier which I will mention now. The Minister in his reply referred to the food industry and An Bord Bia.  On Second Stage I said I was unclear as to where responsibility for this lies, whether with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Minister's Department or the Department of Trade and Tourism.  In his Second Stage speech the Minister said the Irish industry division of IDA would be responsible for food companies regardless of ownership. Forbairt is supposed to have sole responsibility for the development of the food industry.  I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>First I will return to the earlier points Senator Dardis made.  My concern is with speed of implementation. I also wish to avoid not just duplication but the diversion of energy and effort into areas that do not look after the customer, if one wishes to use that word, or <Col N="1599" /> the unemployed, but are more concerned with the internal requirements of the organisation.  The Bill is somewhat vague and non-specific in order to allow us options.  Senators on all sides have identified that and I shall give reasons why it was done.</P>
      <P>Given the requirements of the IDA and Eolas, we are not yet clear what the precise allocation of staff should be and how many should be in one organisation or the other.  All the current assets, holdings, obligations and responsibilities, including staff of both Eolas and the IDA, will be vested under this Bill in Forfás.  There will be flexibility in our ability to allocate staff.  Alternatively, we would not do that and establish two separate organisations on the splitting up of the IDA and Eolas.  Before we could bring in the regulations to commission these bodies, we would have to deal with those matters.  Officials in the Department of Enterprise and Employment have already had exploratory meetings at the requst of the unions.  They sought to find out the implications of this legislation for them and their members.  Senator O'Toole would readily appreciate that.</P>
      <P>There are two other areas of potential diversion of energy and attention.  How would one deal with the existing IDA land bank and arbitrate between what was needed for domestic industry and what was needed for inward investment? By vesting the ownership of all this land in Forfás, if an inward investment company wishes to come to Ireland and we want to use a corner of an industrial estate because it suits, we have the flexibility to allocate it to that company.  On the other hand, if we did not do that and local geography determined property should be assigned for local development under Forbairt, we would have the added complication of transferring ownership from Forbairt to the IDA.  Land transactions would be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third legitimate reason for a holding company is the vexed question of pensions and pension funds.  At present the matter is complex.  The IDA has a pension fund garnered in the normal way. <Col N="1600" /> Eolas does not have such an arrangement. How would one divide that?  What we are doing here is different from what was done on the establishment of FAS. There three organisations were joined, two of which had pension funds, the YEA and AnCO.  One of those was hopelessly under-funded at the time.  Civil servants were also included in that organisation. These issues bring any sort of organisation to an immediate standstill, especially one in the public sector.  It can do little for anyone else if it feels threatened in its own conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>I concur with what Senator Lee has said about the competence of the Culliton committee.  When they spoke from direct experience of the areas with which they had contact they spoke with great wisdom.  They made specific recommendations about agency structures.  I spoke to Mr. Jim Culliton about this because I wanted to satisfy myself as to the intent of that body.  I respect the commitment and thrust of the recommendations given, as Senator Lee said, the report was concluded within six months.</P>
    <P>I hope I quote Mr. Culliton accurately but it is open to him to correct me.  He said the committee in the latter part of its six month deliberations was in consultation with industrialists.  They found great confusion and frustration with being required by different State agencies to go from one body to another.  That was bad enough.  In addition, the industrialists were required by the different agencies to produce slightly different sets of statistics or the same statistics with additional information in a different format.  In the view of the industrialists questioned much administrative work and paperwork was unnecessarily asked of them.  They wanted clarity in that task. That happened to domestic entrepreneurs who wished to either start a new enterprise or expand an existing one.  The same difficulty does not exist for foreign inward investment.  Statistics show the attraction of inward investment is where the IDA has been most successful.</P>
    <P>To address Senator O'Toole's second <Col N="1601" /> point, Forfás will be able to call the shots in terms of co-ordinating policy. However, policy will originate within the Department of Enterprise and Employment as recommended by the Culliton report and the Moriarty task force report. The Department is deficient in formulating policy because that branch of the Department, previously Industry and Commerce and now Employment and Enterprise, was allowed to decline.  In a manner similar to many State Departments over the past ten to 15 years, the intellectual centre of gravity was allowed to shift out from the Department and into the commercial State-sponsored bodies such as Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, the ESB and the IDA.  Therefore the IDA, which was an executive agency, on the basis of its knowledge of the real world was able to dictate, if not formulate, policy in the Department.</P>
    <P>That process was adopted by the entire political establishment during successive Governments.  It is a process I regret and which must be reversed.  Therefore, I state unequivocally that political and accountable policy will originate in the Department.  Forfás will be used as a body to develop that policy function and to advise on its implementation.  This will be combined with the co-ordination of how that policy is delivered on the ground at the level of the two executive agencies, Forbairt and IDA (Ireland).</P>
    <P>To achieve that co-ordination, the membership of the board of Forfás will include, in an <i>ex-officio</i> capacity, the chief executives of Forfás itself, IDA (Ireland), Forbairt, An Bord Tráchtála and FÁS.  These five chief executives will meet on a monthly basis with the chairperson of Forfás and, also in an <i>ex-officio</i> capacity, the Secretary of the Department of Employment and Enterprise. These people will have executive responsibility to ensure that the various bodies for which they are responsible interact and co-ordinate their activities together.  I believe that would be a powerful way of ensuring co-ordination and of avoiding the kind of things unearthed by Culliton in the course of his discussions with industrialists.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1602" /> It is necessary to explain what is meant by co-ordination.  By way of example, the format of information required, the type of data required and the manner of its presentation, in so far as one can be so prescriptive, would be co-ordinated.  This would ensure that the same kind of documentary profile of a particular prospectus, company or proposal would be valid for different agencies without the necessity for re-design.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for the mastery of his brief.  Unlike other debates we are making progress in so far as the issues are being addressed.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would remind his colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen of his remarks to this House on the subject of telephone charges when he said the Government would implement all the recommendations of the Culliton report.</P>
      <P>There is one point which I ask the Minister to clarify.  I accept his statement on the departmental policy function and Forfás.  The Culliton report made a recommendation about an advisory board on industrial policy which should be established and attached to the relevant Government Department.  Will Forfás fulfil this function and, if so, will there be a need for this board?</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 11 (c) to section 9 of the Bill reverts to the point made earlier on the need for two agencies.  The amendment refers to powers and functions of Eolas being vested in Forfás.  Will the Minister explain why this is necessary as opposed to vesting them in Forbairt or IDA (Ireland) or Forbairt and IDA (Ireland)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the recommendation of the Culliton report on the advisory board.  I wish to have the functions of such a board integrated in the Department as a line function.  In that role in the Department it should take upon itself inputs from outside and I would envisage Forfás informing that in some way.  It is also envisaged that the planning function currently held by the <Col N="1603" /> IDA would be transferred to Forfás and that there would be some degree of interaction. There is insufficient lateral movement between industry and the public sector in this country.  The French are, I believe, the best exponents of this.  We are too compartmentalised, with insufficient information.  I hope this answers the Senator's first question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding his second question, there could be indefinite debate on which section of Eolas should transfer to IDA (Ireland), which section should transfer to Forbairt, which section has to be transferred to the new Environment Protection <Col N="1604" /> Agency and which section is to be retained for the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  The most expeditious way to proceed on this, and I am seeking the authority of this House to do this, is in the first instance to vest all the functions, property and liabilities of Eolas in Forfás as a holding company. As policy evolves it should then be decided on the disbursement of activities. We do not have all the answers at present but we do not have the luxury of waiting for these answers.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> In page 4, subsection (1) (a), line 31, after &ldquo;State&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in order to achieve the highest possible level of sustainable employment through maximising net job creation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I tabled this amendment to indicate that, as far as I can see, there is no specific reference to the ultimate purpose of the legislation which is, I take it we all agree, to foster employment.  That should be specifically included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The amendment goes beyond that.  As the Minister said in his recent statements to this House and in his statement yesterday, there is a huge problem with job losses as well as with job creation, and much, if not almost all, of the emphasis of the IDA hitherto has been on job creation.  The last IDA annual report which I can obtain is for 1991 and it does not have any information about job losses.  It presents its achievement in contributing to job creation in a positive light, but what it presents in its report seems far removed from what many people on the ground are experiencing. For that reason I have made the reference to &ldquo;net job creation&rdquo; in the amendment.</P>
    <P>If the culture of these new agencies is to change from that of the agency they are succeeding, they must consider the concept of net, as opposed to gross, job creation, and they must be as concerned about saving jobs as bringing them onstream.  That involves such a shift in perspective, in attitude and in the concept of incentives in the agencies that it is necessary to have it included in the legislation and not to allow slippage to occur in those respects.  These were my main objectives in proposing this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage yesterday I mentioned the problem this amendment addresses.  Consider the figures the Minister gave whereby over a period of six years from 1987 to 1992, 118,000 jobs were created and 108,000 were lost.  This amendment would strenghten the Minister's hand to ensure that there is an emphasis on saving jobs <Col N="1606" /> when difficulties arise.  We are all aware that if help was available or decisions were made by Government agencies, for example in granting moratoriums on tax collection, to give a breathing space to companies who find themselves in difficulties, jobs might be saved.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister is involved with companies at present to ensure the protection of existing jobs.  I also mentioned a major company in my own constituency which is on a three day week.  It is not up to them whether they will close.  It will be the decision of the parent company in the UK whether they will be prepared to ensure the long term viability of the plant.  Anything that can be done to insert in this legislation a provision of a small organisation to deal with these problems is welcome.  This is as important as having agencies looking for new jobs since every job saved is two earned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having been in business for over 40 years I feel that the preservation of jobs should be as vital as the creation of jobs.  It costs ten times as much to create a job as to preserve it. When one looks at the IDA bringing jobs into Ireland it must cost about £40,000 per job.  If one gave from State funds the present average industrial wage to those at work that would be creating jobs in the sense of not losing them.  There are industry-creating enterprise boards who carry out the task of attracting new jobs to the country but once those jobs are here they are forgotten about.  They can be lost after 15, ten or even five years.</P>
      <P>The indigenous industries have been set up by people who are enterprising and are prepared to work for themselves. They put their energy and resources into the economy but they get no help.  When they find themselves in trouble there are demands for PAYE and PRSI payments but when foreign companies go they are said to have left with irretrievable losses to the State.  These losses are irretrievable because the companies cannot be contacted.  I will not go along with the amendment but I agree with the principle behind it.</P>

      <P>The Senator can adjust the record but he cannot correct it. Senator O'Toole said yesterday that every job in this country should be recycled after ten years.  I would like him to get up at an INTO conference and say that every teacher should be recycled after ten years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>May I correct the record? In supporting the amendment of Senator Lee I particularly point to the words which underline my point; they are &ldquo;sustainable employment&rdquo;.  There is no problem creating employment if, as I said yesterday, it is not sustainable employment. If we ignore the advance of technology, and if we have four people doing the work of one person as was done in eastern Europe for years, there is no problem maintaining a net number of jobs, What I said yesterday was that there are very few jobs that can continue beyond ten years without change.  We need a flexible and well educated work-force <Col N="1608" /> and that applies to all levels of work including teaching.  I said that in the past and I will continue to say it.  A teacher can no more stand still in the face of a changing world than any other group. The recent Green Paper on education was entitled <i>Education for a Changing World.</i>  In my response to that I made exactly the same point as I made last night, that no job can continue immutably beyond ten years.  It needs to change and be flexible and take account of changes in technology, work practices, needs and responses.</P>
      <P>Ten years ago AIDS education was not an issue and drugs education was only becoming an issue.  Ten years ago the Stay Safe programme relating to sex education and child sexual abuse was not considered important in the area of education. I give those as examples to stress to Senator Lanigan, and I hope he takes the point correctly on this occasion, that nothing is without change, including education. I have no difficulty standing up at INTO conferences &mdash; I have done it before &mdash; and saying to teachers that the last thing they should oppose is change, that no job can stay the same, that we must all be prepared to change.  This legislation should create the proper context in which change can take place.  As Senator Lee outlined, the objective should be to hold sustainable jobs, to recognise that there are some jobs which are not sustainable in their present form and that energy must be directed in another way.  It is not to say that no worker has ten years.  It is a job, not a worker, because a worker can do four different jobs in a career.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two issues here.  One is the text of the amendment as proposed by Senator Lee and the other is the thrust behind it which is essentially the concern about net employment at the end of the year.  I share that view and I explicitly referred to it on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to accept Senator Lee's amendment No. 24 which states in relation to the reports that &ldquo;... every such annual report shall specifically comment on both job creation and job <Col N="1609" /> losses&rdquo;.  The reason is twofold.  First, if I were to accept Senator Lee's explanation as to why the first function of Forfás is so qualified, where the function is stated and then the reason for the function is given, there would be a certain imbalance in respect of every other stated function because similar reasons are not given.  I refer to a previous job that I once had and that was design, albeit of a physical rather than a literal kind.  There would be an imbalance in the wording of this section and for that reason I will not accept this amendment because every other stated function would need to be qualified and an explanation given.</P>
    <P>I will accept amendment No. 24 to the First Schedule for the following reasons. First we are kidding ourselves as we kidded ourselves in the mid-1980s about migration in this country.  We kept talking about net migration being quite small and I was Minister for Labour at the time. The figures for net migration were 2,000 or 3,000 but the outflow was 30,000 for people who were forced to leave, who had problems with this country.  The inflows were of people retiring and returning home who had no problem whatsoever.  By saying the net figure for migration was only 3,000 or 4,000, we were diminishing what was a problem of a 30,000 dimension.  Likewise if we do not examine job losses, if we do not talk about job creation, we are not recognising the causes of job losses.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Enterprise and Employment I want &mdash; and I want my successors also &mdash; to be told officially by bodies that we are losing jobs in certain areas, that some of the reasons for that are those over which we have control, be they uncompetitive costs in terms of salaries, practices or legislative requirements that we have chosen to put upon ourselves.  As an Oireachtas we should be told that these things are happening. How we wish to deal with them is a matter for ourselves but the annual report of an agency which is charged with the responsibility for promoting industrial activity should address this matter.</P>
    <P>The second reason I am rejecting the amendment is more fundamental but it is <Col N="1610" /> related.  There seems to be an increasing link, and the Senator's historical studies will confirm this, between wealth creation in developed economies and a diminishing employment base.  We can produce more with fewer people.  Historically it was done 120 years ago with agriculture, starting in the United States of America where over 50 per cent of the working population was involved in primary agricultural production.  It is now down to approximately 2 or 3 per cent and they are producing approximately ten to 15 times more.  If one takes out science and technology application of fertilisers they are still, with mechanisation alone, producing far more now in terms of output with less imputs of labour content or jobs.  There is clear evidence, from Japan to here, that robotisation, automation and other factors will enable factories and firms in manufacturing and related activities to produce and create more wealth with fewer jobs.</P>
    <P>We may very well want to make the choice between promoting industrial development, which is wealth creation, because it is the right thing to do, in the clear knowledge that it is not necessarily producing additional jobs but the wealth which we would retain from that kind of industrial activity could, if the Oireachtas so chooses, be used for employment in other areas.  The traditional linkage between employment creation and wealth creation in the industrial sphere is being loosened or stretched.  If it was a one-to-one relationship before with one unit of wealth for one job created, it now seems to be one unit of wealth created for perhaps a half or a third or a quarter of a job created because of the productivity factors I referred to earlier.  That is a deeper argument.</P>
    <P>I will accept amendment No. 24 for the reasons I stated.  I am not accepting the amendment in relation to stated functions because all the other stated functions would have to be qualified in section 6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has disarmed me by expressing his willingness to accept my amendment No. 24.  Otherwise <Col N="1611" /> I would have entered into a more prolonged exchange with him.</P>
      <P>I take the point the Minister made about job and wealth creation, but my amendment is carefully phrased and could be accommodated even within that process because sustainable employment can be interpreted to mean sustainable employment in the economy as a whole and how one achieves the optimum level is a matter for further contention.  The points the Minister raised are important and require more research into their implications for Ireland because while it is true that there can be, and has been historically, intensive technological unemployment, this would be the first time in history where technological unemployment would exceed technologically generated employment, if we are now reaching that stage in world economic history.  Without lingering over that point I would have sustained the discussion with the Minister on the grounds that it is premature, in the context of our knowledge of the economy at this stage, to pursue that line as if it were evident as distinct from a possibility.</P>
      <P>On the other issue, I am sorry that my inexperience led me to put it there rather than under the functions of An Bord Forfás.  It is strange, excepting the Minister's generous acceptance of amendment No. 24, in a Bill of this type that there should be only one fleeting specific reference to jobs of any type.  It almost reinforces what one fears is the self-image of all institutions &mdash; that they exist only for themselves and that what is out there is a residual by-product of their existence. I am also concerned that &mdash; even though amendment No. 24 may cover it &mdash; unless there is a specific commitment to the concept of net job creation, whether within the context of industry or the economy as a whole, it will be possible to fudge and to blur, in terms of reports, the performance of these agencies over the next three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 13, the Minister undertakes to have prepared a review of national industrial performance in respect of the previous three years, but what are the <Col N="1612" /> criteria of national industrial performance in that context unless there is a specific commitment to net job creation as at least one key factor, if not, as I would argue, the key factor?  Everything else seems to be a means to an end; that is the end.</P>
    <P>There should be at least a section in either or both of these agencies concerned with job protection and job saving and it must go beyond there being a section.  The culture and philosophy of the agencies must be permeated by the importance of saving jobs, and that must not be hived off to one section marginalised within the totality of the agencies unless there is a mechanism for insisting on its centrality in the way they approach matters.</P>
    <P>A major problem of industrial development in this country is growing companies.  Enormous emphasis is laid on establishing companies and we talk about the lack of an enterprise culture because not enough firms are set up.  It is not clear that we lack this type of culture in as dramatic a way as many would assume, because the statistics used are vague.  What is striking about our statistics is not the number of companies being established, but the number that collapse within the first three or four years.  It is possible that some of them did not have a hope of surviving, but a number of them may have been founded with good prospects and on interesting and intelligent ideas by people with energy and commitment, but due to circumstances beyond their control they floundered.  We have on balance, small indigenous companies and we are asking them to compete, domestically and internationally, at an early stage of their development.  I cannot think of any other country in the industrialised world which expects this. It may be that many of the companies could be saved by considerate and sympathetic treatment at an early stage in terms of job saving and could go on to become developed and bigger companies who could be job creators in their own right.</P>
    <P>While I will not press this amendment to a vote &mdash; although my instinct was to <Col N="1613" /> do so &mdash; I hope the thrust of what I said will find its way into the approach of these agencies and that when the Minister is considering the evolving situation, he will find mechanisms by which this type of thinking, which I know he partly shares, will be incorporated into the policy forming functions of the Department and the implementation function of the agencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that the amendment is not being pressed but we should reinforce the arguments made.  In this Bill, there is a suggestion that job and wealth creation go together.  Those who have worked to create jobs in this country have not become wealthy.  Those who have become wealthy have been supported by various Governments.  Senator Quinn never got a job creation subsidy but he has created sustainable jobs. There should be a relationship between job creation and wealth creation.  When someone sets up a business to many people he suddenly becomes a leper, and this view is shared by the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue.  The attitude that job creation becomes wealth creation should not be entertained and I sincerely hope the mentality in Forfás, IDA (Ireland) and Forbairt will be to create sustainable jobs and will not be taxed or run out of existence because of the many bureaucratic layers laid down by State agencies.  These agencies will require that if a man wants to provide a job for someone else, he must prove he does not need money from the State.</P>
      <P>Some 90 per cent of our entrepreneurs are leaving because they cannot create jobs and are being stifled by bureaucracy, and the Minister knows what I am talking about.  The Minister was involved in the architecture industry and he knows what has happened in that profession over the last ten years.  How many have been forced out because of Government action or inaction?  I suggest there were 20 people forced out because of Government action rather than inaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise the amendment is being withdrawn, but the sentiments expressed by Senator Lee must be considered if we are <Col N="1614" /> to have a reasonable chance of creating sustainable jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that Senator Lee is not pressing the amendment but may I respond to some of the points he made?</P>
      <P>First, we should all understand that this is compact legislation &mdash; 21 sections and two Schedules; it does not purport to be the only legislative framework in the economic industrial job creation strategy. In many respects, it is incorporating the remit and the constraints of existing legislation in so far as it operates to the IDA.  As both Senator Lee and this House are aware, the IDA is confined to manufacturing activities in internationally traded services.  Many sustainable jobs, including those referred to by Senator Lanigan on behalf of Senator Quinn, would not come under the definition of responsibility of the IDA as described by this House.  We must bear in mind that this is part of a family of legislation and it might be useful to consider the consolidation of this legislation on a wider basis in the future.  We are engaged in part of a family of legislation, we are not rewriting that corpus of legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan and Senator Lee mentioned job protection and how it is easier, in terms of costs, to maintain an existing job rather than create a new job.  Fóir Teoranta was the ambulance, the emergency service for companies.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>People have mixed views on this.  The absence of Fóir Teoranta&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it was a disaster. However, the absence of Fóir Teoranta inhibits companies experiencing financial problems from receiving equity capital, which would enable them to trade out of their difficulties.  We have taken that constraint upon ourselves.  There is an additional constraint, that is, the European <Col N="1615" /> Community and its laws in relation to competition.  These debates are closely monitored in the embassies of larger countries located in this country, and it is no secret that the introduction of the Market Development Fund by the previous Administration in response to the turbulance of the currency crisis was hotly contested by EC member states and the European Commission.  This fund attempted to provide on a short term basis, financial assistance to companies experiencing difficulties.  Jobs, in which good conditions of employment were negotiated over time as part of the overall structure of the company, were at risk because of currency fluctation and related interest charges.</P>
      <P>The absence of Fóir Teoranta and the EC constraints in relation to competition prevent us from doing now what we traditionally did.  For example, these constraints prevent me from providing Irish Steel with additional equity because of the surplus of steel in the EC.  There is urgent need to address the issue of job losses and to exercise control over market forces.  However, we must understand the situation, and this is the thrust of amendment No. 24.</P>
      <P>Regarding the reason companies fail, evidence suggests that entrepreneurs who move from middle management because they have good marketing, innovative skills, etc., are not always qualified or prepared for the difficulties in starting up a business.  Evidence from FÁS and the innovation centre in Plassey, County Limerick, suggests that if entrepreneur training programmes are run in tandem with the start up of a business, the failure rate will be reduced.  This is an area which is under consideration.  With a little input these people could avoid making mistakes which novices make.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Lee for not pressing this amendment.</P>

      <Col N="1616" /> In page 5, subsection (2), line 3, after &ldquo;given&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in writing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to formalise instructions given by a Minister to the chairman of a board.  It is proper that a Minister should give instructions on occasion to boards.  However, danger arises when these instructions are not given in writing.  I suggest that all instructions be given in writing.  I was chairman of a semi-State company for a number of years and I did not experience problems.  However, I am aware that, in the past, problems arose about telephone calls from Ministers to board members or chief executives of State companies.  If the Minister wishes to give instructions to a company, he should do so in writing. The sole purpose of this amendment is to formalise arrangements.  This is a more businesslike approach.</P>

      <P>After the activities in Dublin Castle, anything by way of instruction should be carved in stone.  I do not want to accept this amendment because every Member must be aware that the legislation we enact goes to a third House of the Oireachtas, the President, who will sign it and it will then be open to the courts to interpret it.  Lawyers will interpret it in a legalistic manner, as they are required to do.</P>
      <P>As a former chairman of An Post, the Senator will be familiar with situations where requests are conveyed in various ways.  If a request is of sufficient importance, the Minister and/or the chairman will ensure that it is recorded in a proper manner so that it can be referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inclusion of this amendment would be an unnecessary constraint.  If every instruction is given in writing, it may hamper the working relationship between a Minister and a chairman.  How often do those of us who run organisations issue instructions to management? If the person receiving the <Col N="1617" /> instruction has reservations about the instruction he may ask that it be confirmed in writing.  Legal requirements would demand that every instruction from a Minister to a chairman be in writing. This amendment, if accepted, would introduce an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. F. Quinn Mr. F. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy with the Minister's reply because he addressed this amendment in terms of one manager to another.  The State has established companies, passed legislation and appointed boards with the authority to operate effectively.  If a future Minister wishes to issue instructions, it should be done formally.  The Minister should not address this amendment in terms of one manager issuing instructions to another. It is the shareholder speaking to the company. Shareholders only speak to a company in a formal manner.  It is something which should be done occasionally and formally.  I will not press this amendment, but it is one which should be considered.</P>

      <P>In page 5, to delete line 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to sound pedantic in dealing with this although I freely admit these amendments are somewhat pedantic. <Col N="1618" /> Section 7 states: &ldquo;The functions of Forbairt shall be, as an agency of Forfás, to develop industry and technology in the State&rdquo;&mdash; that is just one function. Senator Lee referred earlier to the fact that Forbairt does not have to do anything in the State.  He is incorrect in one respect because that is stated at the start of this section, but this is not followed through in the list of how Forbairt should operate.  The way in which these are presented is somewhat confusing.</P>
    <P>I admit I have made a mistake in my drafting and I will deal with that in a moment.  I want paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) to be the functions of Forfás and I believe that is what the Minister intended.</P>

      <P>The functions, therefore, will be to strengthen the technological base, to provide services to make investments and to carry out other functions in order to develop industry and technology within the State.  I have phrased the last part incorrectly; it should have said that the functions of Forfás, in order to develop industry and technology within the State, shall be paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d).  I concede that my amendments as drafted do not do that and I ask the Minister to take account of my point on Report Stage.  I know the rewriting involved is minimal, but I believe that the intended functions are not clear.  I do not want to labour the point.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(a)  strengthening the marketing capability of industry&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of this amendment is to highlight the importance of improving <Col N="1619" /> the marketing capability of Irish companies. I believe marketing is extremely important.  Capability in technology has been singled out as an important factor but we should also recognise marketing capability because it is as important as technology.  If we are going to single out technology we should also single out marketing. The need to strengthen the marketing capability of Irish industry is the purpose of this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this amendment.  I speak from a family viewpoint and also having seen marketing to the forefront in the development of jobs in Ireland and abroad.  Although there may be over-emphasis on marketing in universities rather than on entrepreneurial skills, marketing should be recognised in the Bill.  Marketing has become the buzz word in recent years but it is of little use without entrepreneurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In an earlier response the Minister referred to the Plassey enterprise in Limerick and in an off-the-cuff comment, changed Government policy on entrepreneurship when he made the clear distinction between training entrepreneurs and trying to create them. There are people who believe you can make entrepreneurs of people from an early age.  That is off the wall and bears no relation to the real world.</P>
      <P>The idea, however, of creating a resource for people who have shown an innate entrepreneurial talent is very important.  I agree with Senator Quinn to the extent that creating a marketing capability, recognising that people have something to give and giving them outlets for it, is more sensible than trying to devise an educational system to create entrepreneurs, because that does not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The education system is designed to develop people's innate talents.  Those skills and talents are the <i>sine qua non</i> of a successful entrepreneurial approach to life.  Some people will have such a talent and others will be successful in different areas of life.  That needs to be recognised <Col N="1620" /> in a broad education.  If somebody has an idea that can create employment and a profit for themselves, how do they bring their idea to fruition?  That is where I believe educational support for entrepreneurial instinct is important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment.  I have experience of two companies searching for markets abroad. It is an incredibly tough business.  Until now companies have had a little grant aid from An Bord Tráchtála.  The return on the work involved in getting one's product on a stand at a two to four day show is extremely small.</P>
      <P>I often cite the example of Bailey's Cream Liqueur which has been highly successful.  They spent £150 million on finding markets and advertising over a few years but there are many small companies without the resources to find markets. In supporting this amendment we are recognising a need to develop marketing. The markets gained by small companies can maintain existing jobs.  This can only be done by amalgamating resources and this legislation should emphasise the importance of helping such companies to find markets.</P>

      <P>I strongly support the amendment.  It is self-evident that marketing is important.  Technology is highly important for industry but each goes far beyond the other.  The specific introduction of marketing to some extent takes account of the key requirements for industry.</P>
      <P>I do not want to repeat what Senator Lanigan and Senator O'Toole have said, but what I see as missing from section 7 is any specific reference to indigenous industry.  Section 7 refers to developing industry and technology in the State but the phrase &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; is used throughout the Bill to mean everything within the State.  It is used for overseas and multinational industries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is nothing <Col N="1621" /> specifically referring to indigenous industry. I presume that what Senator Quinn had in mind in his amendment was the marketing of Irish industry and strengthening the marketing capability of Irish industry because we invite multinationals in precisely because we assume they already have strong marketing capabilities. That is the major reason for bringing them in.  What exactly are we talking about?  Is this about indigenous industry?  Has the word been unwittingly left out, or are we involved in some other agenda here?  Section 7 (a) could apply to indigenous or overseas industry; it is unclear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will recall the genesis of this body.  We have decided on balance to take the entire marketing function and keep it in ABT for the following reasons.  We examined the possibility of assigning some marketing functions to Forbairt.  I referred to this earlier by saying it be up to a certain threshold or a certain size or in certain activities.  The experience on the ground is that companies in our open economy very quickly and, indeed, in some cases from day one get into export marketing. We looked at the possibility of having a marketing function specifically for the domestic market and involving ABT when people started to export and, frankly, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and I were looking at a bureaucratic nightmare.  We decided that we had been given a decision, we had a separate Department of Tourism and Trade and a separate ABT and that there was enough to do in terms of integrating what exists at present.  We decided to keep the marketing function in legislative and legal terms exclusively under the umbrella of ABT but to ensure that the ABT people worked hand in glove with the Forbairt people, in many cases out of the same building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I accepted Senator Quinn's amendment, I would effectively introduce a hornet's nest from a bureaucratic point of view because I would reintroduce the possibility that Forbairt could start to introduce marketing programmes which <Col N="1622" /> would compete with the current marketing programmes at ABT.  This is the reason I cannot accept the amendment even though there is some strength in the argument.  This is an attempt to bring together certain components that already exist in the most efficient and effective manner and I think we found the best way of doing that.  Senators refered to providing support for entrepreneurs. Increasingly it will be the policy that applications for grant assistance for setting up companies will only be available if, in some cases, the person who wishes to set up the company has completed a start your own business type course.  The statistical evidence seems to suggest that the survival rate of a person who has participated in such a course is higher than a person who has not, regardless of how good their idea is or how enthusiastic they may be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the Minister's final point.  In a number of cases, the entrepreneurs who have been successful have not participated in courses of any description but they know where to find expertise.  There is no point suggesting that half the entrepreneurs in this country would have benefited from a course run by people who were never in business but who supposedly have marketing skills and degrees.  That does not happen.</P>
      <P>Senator Hillery has been involved in post-graduate business studies in UCD. The UCD marketing practice course has been enormously successful.  Entrepreneurs, not all of whom went to college, gave the lectures.  Jobs were provided for people from the College of Commerce, financed by the State and by the entrepreneurs.  Malachy McCluskey is considered to be a tough person in business.</P>

      <P>He brings in expertise where he can.  He has been successful because he uses the expertise of the universities, <Col N="1623" /> the only university he attended was the university of life.  The Minister should not try to stultify people who want to get into business by saying they must do a course especially if they want a grant from the Government.  About 90 per cent of people who want to set up in business will fail but FÁS courses do not produce entrepreneurs.  Such a suggestion is ludicrous.</P>

      <P>I take the point that it is not a precondition of entrepreneurial success that one has been formally trained and there are many examples of that.  Nevertheless I do not think attending such course can do any harm, and it may add to a person's entrepreneurial flair.</P>
      <P>The amendment relates to a point we discussed in detail earlier.  The Minister said that when he spoke with the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, it was decided there would be a bureaucratic nightmare if a proposal of this nature was visited upon us.  The point is that the bureaucratic nightmare would not arise but for the original decision to compartmentalise the functions in two Departments when they more appropriately lie within one Department.  I do not suppose we can solve that problem within the scope of the Bill.</P>

The difficulty has arisen because of the first error and it is not right to say that this cannot be rectified because of the first error.

The fundamental point still stands that the marketing function should be promoted and helped through the legislation, and that is what we are attempting to do.</P>

The point is a fundamental one and I admit that in proposing the amendment I was of the opinion that marketing was being downgraded.  It clearly has been thought through by the Minister.  The fact is an Bord Tráchtála continues to exist and its function has been recognised.  The Minister used the terms &ldquo;the hornet's nest&rdquo; and the &ldquo;bureaucratic nightmare&rdquo;.  I do not know what happens when hornets have nightmares but it would be horrific.  I agree to withdraw the amendment on those grounds.</P>

      <P>I must respond to what Senator Lanigan said in relation to the need for training. There are two important points in this respect.  I have never yet met a graduate from the university of life who did not want their children to attend university full-time.

      <P>In page 5, lines 12 and 13, to delete paragraph (d) and substitute the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d)  establishing regional boards.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment concerns the establishment of regional boards under the Forbairt structure.  When I tabled these amendments, I had the problem already referred to by Senator Lee, concerning which body dealt with the Irish and which dealt with the international part of the equation.  I am not suggesting that every word of every sentence in the Culliton report should be written on tablets of stone and fully reflected within the ambit of the Bill.  However, there is a recommendation that the new agency for industrial development should operate through a system of regional boards appointed by the agency.  There is an even more pressing need for that now than when Culliton wrote the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the proposed establishment of the county partnership enterprise boards, I could envisage a situation where one board would grant assistance to an enterprise and that a similar enterprise, five miles away in another county, could be grant-aided by its board.  This could result in an unsatisfactory competitive environment, <Col N="1626" /> where it is conceivable that one or even both developments could fail. While I am, in principle, opposed to extra layers of bureaucracy, which is why I put down the earlier amendments about Forfás, I accept the point.  The Minister already referred to the need for co-ordination and if that co-ordination is to be effective a regional structure is needed, which is why the amendment was tabled.</P>

We do not know how the county enterprise boards will work.  An easy solution would be for the county managers to meet and discuss the issue and come to a decision but that is not what Senator Dardis or I have in mind.  I would like to think that we will have a level playing pitch with regard to co-ordination. Yesterday Senator Mooney mentioned the proposal for a special tax free zone along the Shannon.

      <P>The amendment refers to regional boards.  I wish to ask the Minister about a matter which is concerning me in relation to this discussion.  I was not here for the Minister's reply last evening, for which I apologise.  I am not sure if he dealt with a query which greatly concerned me, and which I raised on Second Stage.  Will the Minister outline where, what could be described as existing regional boards, will fit into the proposed structure?</P>
      <P>I know that sections 7 and 8 at least impact on this but how, for example, do the functions of Údarás na Gaeltachta and Shannon development fit into this scenario?  Neither of these bodies was referred to in the Minister's speech on Second Stage or in the legislation but they exist and in many cases perform a worthwhile function.  However, they have a system of operation which will impinge to a degree on what is proposed here.  I am sure there is a master plan within which everything dovetails but, for the sake of clarification and ease of mind, will the Minister indicate how they fit into the proposed arrangements?</P>
      <P>To take this further &mdash; I raised this on Second Stage &mdash; where will the county partnership enterprise boards fit into this?  It cannot be ignored that the boards set up under the Leader programme also have a function.  I do not want to say that it conflicts but it must fit into this arrangement somewhwere.  For my own peace of mind and for clarification purposes, I would appreciate if the Minister could deal with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what these boards will do.  With respect to Senator <Col N="1628" /> Dardis, the proposal to establish the regional boards in the context of section 7 would mean hoping that the redrafted section will take on board Senator Lee's point that it would be for indigenous industry, that these regional boards would then only have the capacity to deal with indigenous industry as required under section 7 and would have no hand, act or part in dealing with any development of industry coming from outside the State.  That is illogical.</P>
      <P>If there is a case for regional boards&mdash; and I am not convinced of that because the country is too small &mdash; they should deal with both aspects of development. If these were established under the aegis of Forfás or one of the other agencies, how could that be achieved?  Would they be responsible for Forbairt or Forfás?  I am not conviced that it would have a function.  If the proposal had been included in section 6, which deals with the functions of Forfás, it would have been logical and the argument would be whether we needed a regional authority to deal with the boards.  Its inclusion in section 7 means they will be constrained to deal only with indigenous industry, for which Forbairt is responsible.  I am not sure that would fulfil the purpose outlined by Senator Dardis in his proposal.</P>

There is no specific reference to SFADCo or to Údarás na Gaeltachta so I would like to hear the Minster's response to our concern.  The Minister said earlier that we are dealing with existing agencies and certainly SFADCo has been an affective body in the past.</P>

      <P>I am a strong supporter of regional development and, if necessary, of regional boards.  I do not think, contrary to Senator O'Toole, that we are too small for such boards although sometimes <Col N="1629" /> there are reasons for not setting them up.</P>
      <P>I have a problem with the specific proposal because the function of regional boards should not be to do locally what is done effectively at national level.  The persective ought to be different.  Senator O'Toole referred to the possible relationship between Forbairt and IDA functions locally.  In so far as there is any chance of that pious aspiration of integrated planning then the function of regional organisations should be to try to bring an integrated perspective to bear from a local or regional viewpoint.  There is perhaps a better chance of doing so at local level than at national leve where there is a sectoral allocation of responsibility. As the Minister said, these agencies cover only part of economic activity.</P>
      <P>We do not know how to devise regional boards which try to integrate assistance to inspire regional development.  Maybe nobody in any country knows how to do it.  It is a serious conceptual and practical challenge with a host of political and other problems.  It is something well worth trying.  We must try to achieve it but replicating, at a regional level, the proposed national organisations will not necessarily advance it, it may well impede it.</P>

I realise that the county enterprise boards comprise a structure which might be appropriate to this function.</P>

      <P>No, but at least there is a proposal in that regard.  It will deal with local enterprise.  The other agency is primarily seeking large international investment where the issue is whether the investor will locate in this country or elsewhere. The regional aspect does not have the same degree of importance.  We could broaden the subject to a wider argument about EC regional policy and whether <Col N="1630" /> Ireland is appropriately one region or several sub-regions.  However, that is a debate for another day although it is a related matter.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to a number of points.  The IDA currently has the power to establish regional bodies and to operate on a regional basis.  We are taking the current powers of the IDA which we have the power to do under previous legislation.  I have no problem in accepting the thrust of the amendment to section 10 on which Senator Farrelly spoke.  At the bottom of page 5, subsection (2) reads: &ldquo;Forfás and either Agency may, as it thinks proper, from time to time constitute committees or other bodies (including regional bodies)...&rdquo;.  If the Senator wishes to make &ldquo;regional bodies&rdquo; explicit in the legislation I do not have a difficulty as it does not change the thrust of the section.</P>
      <P>Some points in this context were raised by Senator Howard.  SFADCo has been uniquely responsible for some remarkable achievements in the Limerick region and in Limerick city.  I was in Limerick last Friday and I saw, with a certain degree of envy, the flexibility with which the Limerick city manager could deal with problems experienced by every city and town.</P>
      <P>I have a great regard for the integrated developmental capability of SFADCo and, as the Senator will be aware, that organisation is responsible to my Department. That body will remain intact as the operational regional development authority for that area and will continue its current work.  Therefore, it will not duplicate the work of Forbairt and Forbairt will not encroach on SFADCo's territory. The international dimension that will be undertaken by IDA (Ireland) and which is not currently the remit of SFADCo will be done by the IDA working closely with SFADCo.  The same will apply in principle to Údarás na Gaeltchta although I do not have the same degree of ministerial responsibility and I cannot be explicit in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can be explicit about regional co-ordination. The county enterprise partnership <Col N="1631" /> boards are, by definition, county based and delineated by the boundary of the county.  The new regional authorities, recently agreed to by the Cabinet on the proposal of the Minister for the Environment, are amalgams of counties.  They do not breach county boundaries and, to that extent, are integral.</P>
    <P>I am happy to accept the proposal from Senator Farrelly that any regional structure established by Forfás or Forbairt &mdash; it will effectively be Forbairt &mdash; will respect regional boundaries.  Members of the House will be familiar with the voluminous writings of Professor Barrington which date from about 1972 on the harmonisation of different regional boundaries.  I undertake that, in so far as the Department of Enterprise and Employment has responsibility for the regional boundaries of Forfás and for the new regional boundaries that may be established under Forbairt, the boundaries will be the same.  We will align existing regions to those structures as closely as possible to achieve the required harmonisation. Other Government Ministers have also decided in principle to try to align their regional operations in that way, on the understanding that the establishment of a regional structure, as Senator Lee pointed out, is only of value if it can do something innovative at local level that cannot and is not being done at national level.</P>

      <P>This was a symbiotic arrangement rather than a deeper association. The Minister accepts that the regional boundaries for all these agencies should be coincidental and this is important. He also accepts that our boundaries are very confusing.  It is also important <Col N="1632" /> to keep the county boundaries intact. County Offaly, for instance, is divided in two, which does not make sense.  From that point of view we are making some progress and the Minister's reply goes some way towards reassuring me on the matter.</P>

      <P>We have already discussed the main thrust of this amendment and I indicated I had misplaced it.  It deals with the reordering of section 7, which the Minister has indicated he will deal with on Report Stage.  I will leave it to the Minister's officials to bring this amendment forward. I am happy the Minister accepted the principle behind it and I fully appreciate the generosity with which he has approached the matter.</P>
      <P>I wish to make one further point, one that has been made by Senator Lee, that it should be very clear that indigenous industry is what is referred to in section 7.  The phrase &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; could be taken to mean indigenous but, as Senator Lee has pointed out, the phrase &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; is used in other sections as well. Some distinguishing feature is needed in section 7 to indicate that that section deals with indigenous industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is broad agreement on what we are trying to do here, and I am happy to withdraw amendments Nos. 10 and 11. The point has been made and the Minister has accepted that it will be redrafted. I am confident the redrafting will encompass all the points raised here and I ask that it might also cover the points raised by Senator Lee, which are not there by way of amendment, that it <Col N="1633" /> should clearly indicate that the section is to do with indigenous industry within the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators will know, the IDA legislation is confined to certain categories of economic activity.  Section 7 is to be rewritten because of the reasonable observations made by Senator O'Toole, but Senators should look at section 8 (a) and contrast it with section 7 (a).  The critical difference is to establish development in the State under Forbairt, and under Forfás or under the IDA to &ldquo;establish development in the State&rdquo;, and then it goes on, &ldquo;of industrial undertakings from outside the State&rdquo;.  That is where the distinction is made.  We are leaving ourselves open to the promotion of industry by Forbairt within the State, subject to the constraints of this legislation, and the distinction is made between indigenous industry and inward investment from outside the State as set out in section 8.  I am advised by the parliamentary draftsmen that if we try to make more detailed provision for this we begin to complicate things.</P>
      <P>The distinction is very clear.  Forbairt has responsibility for the promotion and development of industry within the State, and there is a clear distinction between that activity and the promotion of industry brought to Ireland by undertakings outside the State.  We are not making any distinction between indigenous companies and foreign owned companies which have already set up here.  If a company is here five or 10 years, for example a company like Semperit, which is here 20 years, and if they wanted to diversify or carry out a development work, I would regard that as being Forbairt's responsibility because they are already here, and they will be talking to people already here.  It is a foreign owned company; I am not sure if it is a publicly quoted company.  It is ultimately owned by Continental, the Germany company. That is why we are making that distinction, and I request the House to leave it that way.</P>

      <P>The Minister has dealt with some of these matters in his earlier reply and I take his point that section 8 (a) deals with industrial undertakings from outside the State but I had the same difficulty as Senator Lee had in being clear in my mind when I was putting down amendments as to which was which; that Forbairt would relate to indigenous industry and that IDA would relate to industry outside the State.  I am prepared to accept that under section 8 (a) the Bill refers to industrial undertakings from outside the State, but there was a certain amount of confusion about it.  The amendment was put down to clarify the situation and to ensure that it would deal specifically with promoting overseas investment in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I had some difficulty in following precisely how the amendment was to be integrated into the text.  We are stating that the main function of the IDA shall be as an agency of Forfás to promote the establishment and development in the State of industrial undertakings from outside the State.  The suggestion in this amendment is to include the promotion of overseas investment in Ireland.  These are two different things.  Let us take the example of a British or American property company taking on the ownership of an existing office block.  Not a million miles from here is an office block that was owned by British miners pension fund &mdash; I am referring to the Setanta building across the road.  Is that the function the Senator is suggesting when he suggests promoting overseas investment?  I would not be in a position to agree to the inclusion of the promotion of overseas investment in this Bill, even if I agreed with the Senator, because that is a much wider remit.  I would have to go back to my Cabinet colleagues to get agreement for that as it would cut across the responsibilities of other Departments whereas the promotion of industrial undertakings from outside the State in the State is clearly within the remit of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I looked at section 8 following the explanations the Minister gave in response to some of the points raised yesterday and today and there are a couple of questions that must be answered.  IDA (Ireland) deals with foreign industry.  When IDA (Ireland) is successful in convincing people to come to Ireland, who decides what sites will be used?  Who in Ireland will direct foreign businesses to what parts of the country? <Col N="1636" /> Will Forbairt have any say in the matter? How will Ireland as a suitable place to locate be sold?</P>
      <P>I have had the opportunity of visiting a number of our agencies' offices in Europe, America and Taiwan.  ABT sells Ireland as a tourist destination as well as promoting the sale of Irish products abroad.  I thought the new legislation would amalgamate all the agencies selling Ireland as an industrial base or a tourist destination or selling our products abroad.  Even though the Minister mentioned there had been amalgamation in some areas, I am sorry to say that on the basis of the information provided IDA (Ireland) is on the seventh or eighth floor of a building in New York and the Tourist Board is located in a different building on the seventh or eighth storey as well. There is no co-ordination.  If we pool our limited resources for selling Ireland &mdash; and we are all aware of the reductions in funds available to the different agencies over the last five or six years &mdash; we would be able to have a greater presence and a more effective team working on behalf of the State.</P>
      <P>I am opposing this section because these agencies should be brought together at some suitable date, for example, as and from 1 January 1994. The Minister said these boards have different arrangements for pensions, etc., and I accept that because each organisation does different things at different times it can cause problems when amalgamations take place.  I wonder if the Minister, or Ministers because there are two Ministers involved, have had any conversations about making better use of the limited resources available to do a better job of selling Ireland.  Let us be honest about it when you visit other countries and see the little offices provided for Bord Fáilte or the Trade Board, you realise we are only a small dot in a huge market.  The one thing that always struck me was that we were so small we appeared to be insignificant in real terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel strongly that when we were introducing legislation, especially when it dealt with policy on what is happening <Col N="1637" /> outside the State, we should have put these agencies together in order to make the little dot bigger thus having a greater presence and being more effective in the way we do our business.  I still believe that, and I do not think we are dealing with the problem here.  I know that the Minister and Minister McCreevy spent many long hours deciding what should happen but I feel that the opportunity to do a better long term job was missed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator raised a number of points and let me deal with them as he introduced them.  First, he asked how will things function in the new regime.  Not much differently in terms of selecting where an inward investment may wish to locate.  At present, the IDA has a regional structure which is run by a regional manager of principal officer rank, and two people of AP rank, one responsible for indigenous industry, the other for overseas industry.  Essentially the Forbairt network would remain intact, taking over the IDA network, and the IDA inward investment person &mdash; depending on the nature of the product, commodity or activity &mdash; would bring prospective investors to those parts of the country they would like to look at from the point of view of maximising efficiency, their location and their return.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the IDA can encourage industry&mdash;and did so by offering slighlty higher grants when there was a policy of discrimination, for example, against Dublin &mdash; to other parts of the country.  This, in my view, happened due to the erroneous perception that Dublin was doing all right.  There were higher levels of grant and support of that kind, but the IDA did not have the power to compel a company to come here on condition that it located in a particular area.  It did that at its peril because companies could then say if that was the IDA's choice they would leave, and ultimately the IDA had to back off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to reveal the nature of the companies involved, but I know that at present a couple of companies are seeking to locate in location A and the IDA, for a variety of regional development <Col N="1638" /> reasons would prefer them to locate somewhere else.  The IDA realises, however, that these companies are free to choose because there is open competition and they are responsible for their own economic success.</P>
    <P>With regard to what is currently happening abroad and the integration of the various activities, there are a number of ways this can be done, and I have had experience of this.  We now have in London a body called Ireland House where ABT, the IDA and Bord Fáilte are located under the one roof and working closely together.  I was in London three or four weeks ago with Ministers of State O'Rourke and Brennan and a number of officials from the Department.  At the end of the evening we met with representatives of the IDA and ABT &mdash; the person from Bord Fáilte, through no fault of her own, was not available at that time &mdash; and they spoke of the close co-operation between their organisations. The IDA person mentioned a company that had chosen to locate in Ireland which he had approached on foot of information given to him by the Bord Fáilte representative whose work in the field introduced her to this company because, as Senator Farrelly said, this is a very big market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put on the record the fact that this achievement was crowned by the active co-operation of our ambassador who was openly working in close co-operation with the three agencies and made the embassy available as a promotional tool for their efforts. The ambassador agreed a programme of targeted, promotional dinners for different industrial sectors which had been identified by ABT or the IDA, and where the cost of the dinner was shared or wholly paid out of the promotional budget of the relevant agency.  That is the kind of co-operation that comes about through policy at national level and by personality and collaboration at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument against integrating ABT <Col N="1639" /> into a single body is that one then begins to interfere to a certain extent with the career paths of different people.  There are people who specialise in marketing, such as those in ABT.  They are abroad in external markets finding locations for those working at home.  While that is selling Ireland it is doing so in a totally different way from someone locating companies that might want to invest in Ireland.  One of the bureaucratic problems envisaged was that if an integrated structure was developed between IDA and Eolas, people would move from one side to the other and skills would be lost in the process.  A similar effect can be achieved by co-ordinating their activities more closely.</P>
    <P>The promotional structure within and between Departments changed when the Top Level Appointments Committee system, or TLAC, was introduced about 1984.  Prior to that at senior level vertical, stand-alone pyramids of promotion existed in the various Government Departments.  TLAC introduced lateral movement so people could move between different Departments.  That has allowed greater movement in the system and improved it.</P>
    <P>Excluded from that arrangement was the Department of Foreign Affairs.  As a result of the recommendations in the Culliton report, and more specifically in the Moriarty report, the Department of Foreign Affairs is now opening its internal promotion at assistant principal and principal officer level, or first secretary and counsellor level as that Department call them, to other parts of the Civil Service.  That should introduce commercial awareness and lateral flexibility. It should also make our embassies more commercially-oriented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the success of bringing the agencies in England together under one roof in Ireland House.  I was aware that was about to take place but I did not know it had actually happened.  What is the possibility of similar structures developing in other capitals?  This should be <Col N="1640" /> pursued because it can lead to progress. I will not press for a vote on the section.</P>
      <P>We should do that and I hope as the Minister says that officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs begin to look at matters differently.  The full potential has not been tapped.  Collective responsibility and pooling of resources can result in more people being interested. Through conversations one may hear of a development and ask if it can be checked.  It is amazing what can happen. I welcome the response but I hope what has happened in London will be the beginning of what could happen in capitals around the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. Therefore, it is appropriate to re-examine them.  I have an incident in mind.  The Oireachtas Members involved are not here to defend themselves so I will not name them.  I have reprimanded Senator Daly for mentioning people who are not here to defend themselves so it is consistent that I not do so either.</P>
      <P>In his reply to an Adjournment debate last night, the Minister said we should not seek by political means to intrude or undermine ongoing negotiations between the AID and an investor.  I agree with that.  I know he said it in respect of an individual.  I could apply it to the other person involved in the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment intends to remove the possibility that projects coming into the country be damaged, endangered or <Col N="1642" /> withdrawn by virtue of someone going to the local press and saying a project is coming to his or her area.  A sum of £2,500,000 is a large amount of money but it is not an especially large investment in an industrial context.  It would be better to allow the agency to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister last night also said an agreement between the Government and this particular company would follow an agreement arrived at with the IDA.  Does this mean the Government make the agreement with the investor rather than the IDA?  To be consistent with what has been said on Second Stage of this Bill and subsequently, it would be better to let the agency deal with the matter up to quite significant levels, such as £5 million, rather than having to refer it to Government. There are many dangers inherent in that, although there may be advantages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Senator's intention to be to give some flexibility and to avoid adverse publicity which could affect the safe negotiation of a project.  It is a well-meaning intention but I do not necessarily think raising the threshold to £5 million will achieve that objective.  The origins of this, as I indicated in my intervention, are in the Industrial Development Act, 1986.  It says anything above that sum must be brought to the Government for approval. It is a second chance to examine a proposal, largely because taxpayers' money is involved.  It is not venture capital being freely offered by the IDA as if it was its own money or indeed depositors' money given to it for that purpose.  This figure has been negotiated and agreed by the Department of Finance and I do not have the authority to acceed to proposals to raise the threshold.  It is a substantial amount of money over which the IDA can exercise autonomy.  Where it is proposed to spend any sum above £2.5 million by way of grants, such proposals should be presented to Government for clearance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To answer the Senator's specific question, the agreement, for the sake of a <Col N="1643" /> contractual agreement, is between the IDA and the inward investor.  This is in so far as there is a written agreement which is now usual.  It is a conditional agreement.  The money is drawn down on condition that agreed job targets are met. If they are not met, then the <i>pro rata</i> amount of money is not paid.  The Government gives its approval to the IDA to enter into such an agreement above £2.5 million, the threshold figure.</P>
    <P>Referring to the Adjournment debate in the Dáil last night which I had to attend, there have been occasions recently when, because of the wide numbers of people involved in these negotiations, information has circulated from different sources.  Senator Farrelly referred to the situation were, when a site is visited, people develop an interest and quickly acquire information.  Therefore, the suggestion by Senator Dardis, that in raising the level to £5 million this situation will be avoided, does not equate with our experience.  In addition, given that it is taxpayers' money, £2.5 million is a substantial figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

      <P>It is not my intention to cause a heated debate on the subject. Perhaps the Minister accepts it is desirable to limit the number of persons to whom information of a sensitive nature is available and that &mdash; as in the case of the Cabinet &mdash; there would be restrictions on such persons as to what they may do with this information.  That is the purpose of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 31, to delete &ldquo;prepare a&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;commission an independent&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If amendments Nos. 13, 14 and 15 are accepted, section 13 would read as follows:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall, within three years from the passing of this Act, and in every third year thereafter, commission an independent review of national industrial performance in the previous three years and shall prepare a review of national industrial policy and shall cause both reviews and the conclusions arising therefrom to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to allow the Department of Enterprise and Employment to concentrate on reviewing policy and to hive off the review of performance to an independent company which, I believe, could undertake the task more cost effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, if the review of performance is undertaken independently it will give reviews of policy more authority and greater credibility.  The review policy will be on independently based facts and there will be no suspicion that facts would <Col N="1645" /> be selected to support a particular policy approach.</P>
    <P>I make this proposal in the light of the reviews of industrial performance in the past where those have read them agree that the task would have been better executed outside the relevant Government Department.  Therefore, in line with the Culliton report, the focus of the Department should be kept on policy formulation while an outside body should review performance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  The text of the relevant part of the section reads: &ldquo;The Minister shall, within three years from the passing of this Act, and in every third year thereafter, prepare a review of national industrial performance ...&rdquo;.  I stress &ldquo;performance&rdquo;, not policy.  In effect I wish to bring back policy formulation to the centre of the Department of Employment and Enterprise, as I stated earlier. Policy is formulated initially within the Department and then within the Cabinet and from there through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is then given to Forfás and the two executive agencies to implement.</P>
      <P>The performance of the implementation of that policy is a legitimate matter for those involved in its formulation.  I have no difficulty with an independent review or commission operating simultaneously. An example is the evaluation by the ESRI of the benefits obtained from spending the previous allocation of EC Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, if it was required that an analysis and review of performance should be undertaken, not by the Department but by independent bodies, two main objections arise.  First, it would not be cheaper as we will have to commission people and pay fees as distinct from having our own people, who are already on the pay roll.  Secondly, those already employed in the Department should be intimately involved in reviewing how their policies are implemented because they will learn how relevant and practical they are when formulated in Kildare <Col N="1646" /> Street as distinct from having to be implemented in the real world.</P>
    <P>The Senator's amendment would remove this central plank of the new Department of Employment and Enterprise, which I am sure is not his intention. They will not be good policy makers if they do not understand the constraints involved.  Collectively, the Minister and the policy formulators in the Department should be obliged to monitor the effectiveness of that policy as implemented and learn the necessary lessons.</P>
    <P>This is not to deny a role for independent commissions.  However, I am unable to accept the Senator's amendment in the circumstances.  It would be a strategic mistake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. F. Quinn Mr. F. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's point and I accept that the Department must review the performance of the bodies it controls.  However, it would be beneficial if that review was undertaken by a body other than those formulating policy.  I urge the Minister to consider this as there should be an independent examination of performance other than by the controlling Government Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Senator is purporting to do.  However, I suggest that the Houses of the Oireachtas are the appropriate bodies to make an independent analysis where required.  If the reform of the Oireachtas structures currently being implemented proceeds and committees of both Houses are established, I and my successors will be required, under section 13, to publish a review.  The annual reports of the three bodies will provide statistical information.  The normal statistical data will be available to Members and to the public.  A triennial review will be published by the Department of Enterprise and Employment, under the Minister's signature, which must be brought before these Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From cost-effective, political and independent points of view and the array of expertise available, this group of people <Col N="1647" /> are now in a better position, as a result of the reform of the Oireachtas, to critically analyse the implementation of policy.  If these committees decide that an in-depth analysis is needed to ascertain the reason this did not work, but they do not have the time or expertise to carry out this study, then there is no reason as Members of the Oireachtas, they cannot propose that the ESRI or an independent commission do it instead.</P>
    <P>I must repeat the words of the former chairperson of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Gay Mitchell, who said that if there had been a more investigative committee structure in this House, we would not have had to set up an expensive inquiry in another part of this city.  It should have taken place in this building.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about this matter because the Minister has inherited an unsatisfactory situation.  He is trying to improve it by means which he candidly &mdash; and to me reassuringly &mdash; accepts are not ideal because we are living in the real world.  We adapt to changing circumstances but we should not have to wait three years to publicly review policies, although I accept there is no ideal time to do this.</P>
      <P>A three year review was carried out in December 1990 by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  This was a good review because it was detached from the self-image of the IDA.  At that stage the Department was aware that policy making had moved to the IDA.  Therefore, it was commenting on the IDA as an independent observer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that the policy making function of the Department of Enterprise and Employment has been enormously strengthened, it is asking it to review its own performance.  Given that this is coming in the aftermath of a Bill which the Minister introduced, it is demanding a capacity for self-criticism which is unreasonable.  It would be different if a new Minister was appointed.  However, one hopes that there will be stability and continuity for the period involved <Col N="1648" /> because it would be unfortunate if there was chopping and changing of Ministers at this time.</P>
    <P>We are asking the Department to review not only the performance of the three agencies, but also its own performance. There is no point in saying that policy is its performance.  I do not know if outsiders will do a better job, but one should not leave matters to accumulate for three years and then produce a report. There should be an ongoing process of evaluation, both of itself and of the agencies being established.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, what type of evaluation process will be in place?  There will be the annual reports of the three agencies.  However, what will they consist of?  People always present the best case for themselves.  Each of these three agencies will present the best case for itself. It will be difficult for these agencies, especially Forfás which have overall responsibility, to say that one is performing better than the other.  It is not part of human nature to set up criteria of relative performance.  I suspect that the annual report of the three bodies for the next three years will be singularly unhelpful for serious evaluation.</P>
    <P>The three year review is the only document which might have a degree of independence. However, as a result of the increasing importance attached to the Department of Enterprise and Employment, it will make it more difficult to be independent.  The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke, said last night that if things went wrong Ministers would have no difficulty beating their breasts.  I wonder what the Minister thinks about that because I do not believe that Ministers should beat their breasts.  If this happens, matters will have deteriorated considerably.  Mechanisms should come into play to avoid reaching this stage.</P>
    <P>I presume that the three year review, which would presumably have taken place under the previous legislation, will not take place this December.  This means that there will be no review in the Department from December 1990 until December 1996.  Given the importance <Col N="1649" /> of monitoring and evaluating the ongoing developments and the evolving relationships, some mechanism should be devised which allows one to pass an informed judgment at an earlier stage.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Lee. I wish to comment on the Minister's reference to the Oireachtas sub-committees. I do not have a lot of experience, but it seems to me that they have not worked satisfactorily and that there is, to a certain extent, a hope they will work in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is dangerous to rely on this hope.  There is a need for independent assessment and for an outside body, other than the Department of Enterprise and Employment, to examine the Department.  It is difficult to be one's own jduge and jury.  I urge the Minister to reconsider this matter in the light of the argument that it is not right for someone to examine their own performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the argument because I am not convinced of it.  I will explain the reason.  First, I wish to mention the frequency of evaluation and review to which Senator Lee referred.  The three bodies will publish annual reports.  Forfás will have a one-step removed evaluation of the performance and the delivery of policy by the two executive agencies on the ground.  It is my policy, and I introduced it on a previous occasion in the old Department of Labour, to have an annual report of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  I hope we will be able to introduce this coterminous with the day the Department will be fully established, which will be the end of January 1994.  That is my aspiration; I am not making an explicit commitment. However, I am making a commitment that there will be an annual report of the Department of Enterprise and Employment. This will cover the entire range of <Col N="1650" /> activities of that Department.  I hope it will be completed in the first 12 months.</P>
      <P>Part of the overall report of that Department must have regard for industrial performance.  The triennial review will then be prepared by people in the Department, working with a Minister whose signatures must appear on the review.  The review must be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas and how they choose to deal with it is a matter for them.</P>
      <P>The select committees in the Houses of Commons, for example, are elaborate congressional type hearings and are not comparable in parliamentary terms, as the Executive has a different relationship with the House of Commons from that of our Executive with the Oireachtas. Nevertheless, the principle is similar.</P>
      <P>The people who prepare a review and the Minister who signs it do so in the knowledge that it will go before a body of expertise and manifest independence who are opposed to the Minister from a party point of view and in some cases, from an ideological point of view.  This combination will remove the temptation to write a glossy cover-up type document and will meet the Senator's requirements for objectivity and independence in a cost-effective way.  The other way is not cost-effective.  It is an additional cost.</P>
      <P>Returning to the first point I made, I want those developing and promoting policy &mdash; there was a policy vacuum created over time in the Department &mdash; and who are not yet all in place as we have not yet completed the internal restructuring of the Department of Enterprise and Employment, to be involved in reviewing how effective their policy was in terms of performance on the ground, and to be open, through the political accountable process, to hearing the criticisms and no more vociferous criticism will be made than by this body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make a final point which one could make about all consultants, and I have been in that category myself.  The independence of a body commissioned by a Department, who is paying the fees, is somewhat questionable on occasions. There is no guarantee that simply <Col N="1651" /> because one pays an outside body a substantial fee one will get an independent and, by implication, critical review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Forfás, being one step removed precisely because it does not have executive responsibility, will be able to stand back and criticise as appropriate, but we will have to see how that works in practice.</P>
      <P>I strongly favour the Minister's intention to publish an annual report.  I have found the annual reports of the Department of Labour extremely valuable. There could be real value in ensuring that time would be allocated by the Government to have these reports from the three agencies debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>For several years I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies and the existence of the committee acted as a discipline for the various bodies in that they had to account for themselves in public to the committee and some valuable work was done there.  My complaint however is that far too little opportunity was given to debate those reports in the Houses of the Oireachtas under successive Governments &mdash; that was particularly true in the Dáil.  If the reports came before the Houses of the Oireachtas as a mater of regular practice we, collectively, could act as a review body on those reports and the relevant time in the Houses or in Special Committees could be allocated as a further check on the performance of the Department.</P>

      <P>In page 8, paragraph 2 (5), line 7, to delete &ldquo;Minister for Finance&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Government&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to put the responsibility where it should be, with the Government and not with the Minister for Finance.  I do not understand why the Minister for Finance should have to approve the appointment of board members.  That should have nothing to do with the Department of Finance, except from a money point of view, and that is dealt with in another section.  I may seem to be a little paranoid about the mandarins of Merrion Street but this is a clear case of their getting involved where, I suggest, they have no business being involved.  The procedure should be that the relevant Minister makes a selection of board members and puts them to the Government for approval.  I suggest we keep the Department of Finance out of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is an office holder in this or any previous Administration who would not agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Quinn.  However, let me explain why it is there is the first instance.  Every organisation needs a credit controller or financial director and, in a sense, the Minister for Finance is included in paragraph 2 (7) of this Schedule in so far as the clause &ldquo;on such terms and conditions&rdquo; covers the level of remuneration.  Paragraph 2 (7) reads:</P>
      <P>The Chairperson and other members of Forfás and of each Agency shall hold office [that is clearly a function in terms of the selection of the office holders for the Minister, in consultation with the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, which is the practice in Coalition Governments] on such terms and conditions (including remuneration) as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, shall determine.</P>
      <P>For a while there was a separation of the functions of public service from the Department of Finance and a Department of the Public Service was set up for a period of about ten years, but for one period only.  There was a Minister for the Public Service, a former Senator, Mr. John Boland from 1982 to 1986, prior to that responsibility for the public service was taken from the Department of Finance and given to the Department of Labour.  It was brought back to the Department of Finance in 1987 under a new Administration.  Setting terms and conditions is a personnel function and have to be set by somebody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;With the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo; is a standard provision in and the reason it is inserted here is that different Ministers would set different terms of remuneration for different boards and an unholy mess might arise as a result. The Minister for Finance has no say in the composition of the board or in the terms of the personalities involved other than in his or her capacity as a member of the Government.  Setting the terms <Col N="1654" /> and conditions is a personnel function, effectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. F. Quinn Mr. F. Quinn">

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.  (1)  The Minister shall, in appointing members to each Board, ensure adequate representation of both genders.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister shall, in appointing members to the Boards of Forfás and Forbairt, ensure that the experience and expertise of small companies and service companies are adequately represented.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to set in stone certain key guidelines for the selection of board members by future Ministers.  The first point about ensuring adequate representation of people of both sexes does not need arguing, but the way I have phrased it is aspirational.  It does not lay down a specific number of members of each sex.  It is merely a reminder to a future Minister &mdash; I am sure there is no need to remind this Minister &mdash; to take this factor into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is different.  I am seeking to build on expertise and experience of particular kinds.  The Minister will agree that when boards were put together in the past, the two groups I mentioned, small business and the service industry, tended to be overlooked. The boards of Forfás and Forbairt need to have the experience of small business represented because it must play a vital role in our future development.  If we want jobs we cannot continue to ignore the potential of small businesses, such as family businesses or business that is created by one person.  The experience of small business and its needs and problems are quite different from the needs of other enterprises.  This particular perspective should be represented at board level in those agencies.  As I stated already, this is more to remind future <Col N="1655" /> Ministers rather than necessarily the present Minister.</P>
    <P>It is similar in the case of service businesses. We have been bedeviled in this country with a fixation about manufacturing industry, despite all the evidence that should tell us that is not where future jobs will be held or created.  Future jobs will not necessarily be created only in manufacturing industries but throughout the world jobs are being created in the service industry.  Again, the needs and problems of service industries are different from those of manufacturing industries and that perspective should be reflected at board level.</P>
    <P>If we do not put these requirements into the legislation these two important areas will be overlooked when the boards are being put together, perhaps not this time but at some point in the future.  I suggest that will cost us jobs in the long term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I have no problem at all with the first point and I intend to deal with the second.  If one examines the composition of the majority of the boards appointed by Governments in the past, high powered names always feature because of their experience of large companies.  If any progress is to be made on reducing unemployment the experience of indigenous industries and small businesses in this country must be included. There are many excellent people who have created small businesses but who do not want to increase the size of their operation because if it gets any bigger they will have to put a management structure in place.  I support this amendment because it is very important.  As Senator Quinn said, small businesses may be overlooked in the future and if it is decided to include the wording in the Bill it must be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we had details of the total number of people employed in service industries in Ireland, as opposed to manufacturing industry, it would be endent that many more were employed in service industries. However, that sector has always <Col N="1656" /> been forgotten.  It exists but there has not been much effort to ensure that the views of the people involved are represented. The growth of small companies in Ireland is in the service industry area but it has not received much attention.  Many of the people who started such industries were enterprising and that is why I would like a place for them, and the large number of people employed in that area, and their views to be taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>Given my lack of success to date with having amendments accepted, I am conscious of the fact that by supporting Senator Quinn's amendment I may be conferring upon it the kiss of death.  However, I support the amendment.  The Minister is aware that in regard to the county enterprise partnership boards county managers have been given a direction that they must strive for at least 40 per cent representation of men and 40 per cent representation of women.  To be consistent with that, the first part of the amendment should be accepted.</P>
      <P>I also support the view that people who have experience of small companies could provide a very valuable service.  I have some difficulties defining &ldquo;small&rdquo;, what is the legal definition of &ldquo;small&rdquo; and whether it should be small companies and small service companies as well.  That is a peripheral point but the central thrust of the argument is valid.  People with this experience can be of benefit to the State and the boards and they should be included.</P>

      <P>The question of board representation and the knowledge and skills that people have is clearly an important area.  In relation to small companies and service companies, I have no difficulty with the spirit of what is intended.  Senator Dardis has touched on one important point and that relates to definition.  How is it defined?  Secondly, we must remember that we are dealing with legislation.  It is as near as one can get to tablets of stone and it could be too restrictive to build it into legislation. <Col N="1657" /> However, making the point in the presence of the Minister is important and he should be constantly mindful of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment.  It is not necessary for me to outline why I support the first point.  It is obvious and we are all in agreement with it.  In relation to the second point about the necessity to ensure that membership of the boards will include people who have experience and expertise of small companies and service industries, the establishment of these boards, and what is expected of them is crucial.  It is possibly the last chance we may get as a nation to tackle the very serious situation that faces us.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that a high proportion of the board members will be people of proven initiative and enterprise. On boards and in companies where there is a chief executive who possesses much energy and enthusiasm there is often a tendency to put people on these boards whose main function appears to be just to watch and slow him down. There is a serious danger that this would inhibit the very necessary risks that will have to be taken both at executive and at board level.  There are people in the categories that Senator Quinn outlined who have the capacity to do what he is seeking and I am also anxious to have them included.  I do not for a moment question the sincerity of this Minister and many other Ministers who would accept the point but, unfortunately, Ministers change from time to time and their successors often do not feel bound by the sentiments expressed by their predecessors. There is only one way to ensure that something is taken on board and that is to include it in legislation.</P>

The vast majority of indigenous Irish firms are relatively small and the expertise of people in these firms shall be available to the boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is some connection between the <Col N="1658" /> two amendments in that women who have started their own businesses, which have generally been small service industries&mdash; I presume we are legislating in favour of women rather than men in the present circumstances &mdash; have proved to be successful. I do not know if there has been any study conducted on this but one may find that the success of women in this area, in terms of the number who have set up industries, has outnumbered those of men.</P>

      <P>There is an increasing difficulty in getting members of the public to serve on boards.  The media, for example, think that anyone who serves on a board is obviously in someone else's pocket.  For small industries and small companies, including service companies &mdash; to take the example to which Senator Farrelly referred &mdash; frequently the person providing the free consultancy service cannot give all the time needed.  It must be acknowledged that time given on most of these boards is not a net cost, in real terms, to the person involved, for which they get free abuse.  Given the tightening up in competitive terms which we would welcome at one level, companies have had to reduce their overheads drastically. For example, the spare time those in business or small industry can give to public life is limited.  To restrict the representation to the boards in legislative terms would be an impediment for my successors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy with the spread of representation I believe I will announce in due course.  However we have a problem in this country in that the pursuit of politics in the elected form is being increasingly denigrated by people who are paid <Col N="1659" /> in multiples of salaries Deputies and Senators receive.  That is not confined to people seeking elective office it is affecting those who want to become actively involved in any political party.  Everyone involved in politics, be they Independents or members of political parties, recognise that.</P>
    <P>Once there was a culture that one put party supporters on the various boards, and some Administrations have fallen into that trap.  Later, those who were politically supportive but expert in a certain area and had a contribution to make were appointed to these boards.  There is a need to have people who are politically in tune on State boards.  In the last six months, I have found that many people appointed by other Ministers, including some of an opposite political persuasion, a delight to deal with because they understood the political constraints upon a Minister.  Senator Quinn may recognise from serving different Ministers that the chairperson or member of a board has to understand, although they may not agree with them, the political contracts within which Administrations, who are ultimately accountable to the electorate through the ballot box, have to operate. We are currently dealing with a problem of this kind in Aer Lingus.  I cannot accept an amemdment which would impose a legislative constraint on the representation on State boards.</P>
    <P>It is Government policy that at least 40 per cent of the boards should have female representation.  Until we get this right gender balance effectively means positive discrimination in favour of women.  My party has benefited considerably by introducing such a policy of positive discrimination. There are constraints in this area.  I am in favour of positive discrimination provided qualified people can be found.  I would like to introduce that policy in my own Department.  At present there are 22 or 23 principal officers there, but only one is a woman and in the recent round of promotions, there were no female candidates that met the objective criteria and no woman, especially a feminist, wants a woman promoted <Col N="1660" /> simply because she is a woman. There has to be a balance of eligibility and qualifications.  We will not get a consensus society to gender equality if it is perceived in certain areas, especially where career paths are concerned, that someone is being promoted purely on these grounds.  I fully accept the spirit of the amendment but I am afraid I cannot accept it.</P>

      <P>The intention of the amendment was aspirational, to stitch into the record the intention of getting a balance.  Senator Hillery and the Minister referred to the need to get the best person for the job, and that is by far the most important criterion.  On that basis and of the Minister's words in this case, I hope that my aspiration of having both genders represented on boards will come about in future years.  I withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 17 and 18, to delete sub-paragraph (10).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same principle is involved in both amendments.  The first occasion I was confronted with a similar section in a Bill was shortly after my election to this House and I was taken aback by being requested to support a measure that indicated that I and my colleagues, because <Col N="1661" /> we were elected public representatives, were unfit to serve on State boards.  I objected to it at the time, but because the Minister was of my own political persuasion and I was a relative newcomer to the House, I did not pursue the issue.  I will always recall the reason advanced to me and I hope I do not hear it repeated today, namely that it has always been the practice; in other words, that we should continue to be prisoners of the past, irrespective of the implications.  The inclusion of this section in the Bill and I endorse the comments made by the Minister in this regard, undermines the profession of politics.  It is ludicrous to adopt a course of action which supports that practice.  I have no hesitation in saying I am proud of my profession.</P>
    <P>Members of local authorities, the Oireachtas and the European Parliament are disqualified from participation on State boards.  The exclusion of elected representatives from participation on State boards implies that they are incapable of discharging the required functions.  Furthermore, it implies that elected representatives are more open to corruption than non-elected members.  It is unacceptable to disqualify elected representative on these grounds.  I have tabled these amendments so as to exclude these offensive sections from the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not believe an elected representative would go to the expense of challenging the constitutionality of these provisions.  However, it would be interesting to speculate the outcome of such a challenge.  I take grave exception to the inclusion of these sections in the Bill, as I have done in the past.</P>
    <P>Professor T.J. Barrington, a former director of the IPA, who was quoted today, spoke about the democratic deficit at a recent SIPTU conference.  He said we have an intensely centralised political system that relies on bureaucracy rather than democracy, a reliance that has borne bitter fruit.  According to Professor Barrington, Ireland's ratio of elected councillors to population was 1:2,100, compared to 1:1111 in France.  He also said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1662" /> Ireland has 112 local authorities and 1,633 elected local councillors, substantially fewer than the appointed representatives on the boards of State agencies, but it has long been held that the progress of democracy involved the move from appointed representatives to elected ones.</P>
    <P>He spoke about a glaring deficit in decision-making and too little progress. We should not persist with this objectionable condemnation of ourselves and those who elected us.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hear the excuse that these sections are included because it has been the practice to do so.  They must be removed.  Those who criticise and undermine politicians must remember we are the only section of the population who answers to the public.  We are rejected or accepted by the people.  Nobody is allowed to simply walk through the doors of either Chamber just because we want to, and the same is true of the council chambers throughout the country.  If we are to be fair to our colleagues, Members of the European Parliament and councillor members, these sections must be removed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I also tabled a similar amendment and Senator Howard and I have discussed this matter.  I am happy to raise this issue with the Minister because I am aware of his views on this matter. Appointments to State boards should be made on the basis of objective criteria, ensuring that appointees are representative and competent.  Having decided on the criteria by which we appointed an individual and having chosen that individual, he or she may be excluded if he or she is a Member of the Oireachtas, a local authority or the European Parliament.  That is a contradiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I differ slightly from what Senator Howard said.  There are certain occasions when there would be a sense of double jeopardy in appointing a Member of the Oireachtas to the board of a State agency that was accountable to the elected assemblies for State funds.  However, <Col N="1663" /> that is not the case on this occasion.  This cannot and should not apply to members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>There is a crisis in participation in the democratic process.  People do not want to stand for election, they do not see politics as an option.  The number of post primary student who list politics as a preferred profession is minimal.  I have mentioned this on many occasions and received criticism from Members of the Oireachtas in relation to this point.  The profession is perceived by young people as the last refuge of scoundrels and we are to blame for much of that.</P>
    <P>There is an element of invidious discrimination in excluding elected representatives from State boards that could be questioned on the ground of constitutionality. Elected representatives such as Senator Dardis and Senator Quinn who have expertise in the retail and agri-industries respectively, could be prevented from offering their expertise to a board who might be interested in hearing their views.  Yet, companies assisted by these agencies may appoint board members from any area.  This is the only area where elected representatives are excluded from membership. They may be appointed to the boards of any service industry, manufacturing industry, etc.; they are simply being discriminated against in this instance.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister agrees with Senator Howard when he said that these measures reinforce people's cynical attitude towards politicians.  It feeds the prejudice against politicians, that they cannot be trusted or relied upon to do anything and are a useless group of people.  On the other hand a case could be made that allowing elected representatives to become members of these boards involves jobs for the boys and girls.  It is right that elected representatives, including Government Ministers, should be answerable to such a charge.  The simple way of dealing with this is the same way that those of us who are employers deal with recruiting staff. Although I am a trade union representative <Col N="1664" /> I also employ many people. We have all been questioned about appointments we have made, we have had to set up objective criteria and give reasons for appointments.  It does not make any sense to exclude Members of the Oireachtas and other elected people. Without asking the Minister to breach Cabinet confidentiality I wish to refer to a point made by Senator Howard.  Such provisions are automatically included in legislation by the parliamentary draftsman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is standard practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is standard in some ways but it should not be standard practice. If there is a clear, understandable case for excluding Members of the Oireachtas and other elected representatives, whether they are Members of the European Parliament or of local authorities, they should be excluded.  I am not blaming the draftsman or the Minister for the inclusion of this provision. Such provisions appear in legislation, but we are not trying to change Government policy, neither the Government nor the Department would have made a decision to exclude elected representatives but it happened.  I raised this matter time and time again since I was elected to this House six years ago and always find it objectionable.</P>
      <P>Sometimes there is a very clear line of accountability which should exclude Members of the Oireachtas.  At other times there is a line of accountability which might exclude all elected public representatives.  However, there is no case for excluding local authority members who have a proven commitment to their local areas.  It could be said that the salary, however meagre, attracts people to become a Member of this House but no salary is paid to local authority members, who have shown a commitment to their local areas and experience all the disadvantages of being elected representatives.  I see no reason for excluding them.  On this occasion I see no reason either for excluding Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1665" /> There is need for a national consensus in this area, this is coming across in every discussion.  There should be no exclusivity about our access to talent, expertise and experience in approaching this problem. It is often argued that people who are successful in industry should take an interest in politics; on the other hand we do not want people who take an interest in politics to take an interest in the development of industry.  I feel very strongly about this issue, it contributes to the bad public impression of politicians. It needs a very serious response from the Minister and I know he will give such a response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the two previous speakers.  In addition to this legislation we are setting up county enterprise partnership boards.  A decision has been made by the Government and the Minister that four members from each local authority shall sit on each of these boards.  The mould has been broken.  Last Monday the local authority of which I am a Member appointed its four representatives. The majority of the Members of this House, who are also members of local authorities, should not be in a position where, as a result of passing legislation, they are eligible to be members of county enterprise partnership boards because of the Government has permitted them to be, but are not eligible to be members of other boards because of their membership of local authorities of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister of State pointed out that in 1986 a Fine Gael Minister introduced similar provisions, it is quite obvious that this has been the practice over the years.  Senator Quinn, if he does not mind me using his name, was chairman of a State board but because he is now a Member of the Oireachtas he can no longer become a member of, or be reappointed to, a State board.  It is time that we, as elected members to the Houses of the Oireachtas, did ourselves justice by dealing with this anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We talk about &mdash; the Minister mentioned it ten minutes ago &mdash; the way we <Col N="1666" /> are portrayed in the media.  We have no one to blame but ourselves.  We are not prepared to stand up to the realities of life.  If we are prepared to go before the general public for election to office we should not be afraid of ensuring that elected people with talent and capabilities are available to serve on boards, this may benefit large numbers of people. We now have a golden opportunity, with a new Government in office, to change the practices of the past and amend this proposal, The fear that the appointment of some people to boards may result in a conflict of interest can be dealt with by regulation, therefore this worry should not arise.  Let us stand up for ourselves and for democracy.  We see how difficult it is for people all over Eastern Europe to create and develop democracies.  As people who are prepared to stand for election we are not prepared to allow the Government to deem us to be ineligible to sit on these boards.  I support these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this debate will be adjourned at 6 p.m. and I will, therefore, not be able to reply in full to a very substantial point.  Let us suppose that during the previous administration Deputy Harney was appointed to the board of Aer Lingus.  Would Members like to speculate on the pressure under which we could have come?  The natural inclination of Governments would be to appoint Members of the Oireachtas from their own parties to boards.  After a change of Government a Member of the Oireachtas who was appointed to the board of Aer Lingus when his or her party was in Government might be in possession of a plan agreed by the board and submitted to the Government.  What pressure would that person come under and where would his or her interest and loyalty lie?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may continue to use the example of Deputy Harney, because she is very able and has a strong, forceful political personality, would her responsibility be to the board, which has made a collective decision, or to the Minister?  The Minister, in his or her incorporeal capacity, <Col N="1667" /> would have appointed the Deputy to the board, the person holding the office of Minister may change but the loyalty of board members is to the Minister of the day.  Senator Quinn loyally served as Chairman of An Post during the term of office of at least three or four Ministers, in each case he extended the same degree of loyalty and service to the officeholder of the Minister.  In such circumstances enormous strain would be put on individual Members of the Oireachtas whether they are Members of the Dáil or Seanad.</P>
    <P>We gave an example last night of a member of a local authority becoming a member of the board of Forfás or of the IDA as it is at present constituted and a proposal coming before the board.  There is a two-tiered decision-making process in the IDA, the executive evaluates proposals and frequently turns down projects on the basis that the cost is too high.</P>

    <Title>Report of Law Reform Commission on Defamation: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the failure of the Government to respond to the issues raised in the report of the Law Reform Commission on Defamation through legislative proposals as was promised by the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. The law on defamation should protect and vindicate, as far as possible, the right of the individual to his or her good name and the right to freedom of expression. Both these rights are expressly guaranteed by the Constitution.  The law as it stands does not provide a satisfactory framework for ensuring that they are adequately protected in modern times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is 30 years since the law was altered in this area and reform is overdue.  The Government has ignored the obvious <Col N="1668" /> need to reform the law and I now ask Seanad Éireann to condemn its failure to respond to the issues outlined in two reports of the Law Reform Commission, the last of which was published over two years ago.  Nine months earlier, in March 1991, the Law Reform Commission published a consultation paper.</P>
    <P>Despite repeated calls from this side of the House, there was no debate on that consultation paper and &mdash; until now &mdash; on the report itself.  I believe that the views of this House on the issue should have been expressed at the time of consultation. They could then have been considered when the Law Reform Commission was writing its final report.</P>
    <P>The law on defamation needs to be changed because it is archaic.  The right of the media to expose shortcomings in all areas of society must be protected. Smaller media, such as local newspapers and radio have to keep looking over their shoulders to be sure they are not presented with a writ which would wipe out their business.  The purpose of the law should be to ensure that there is a balance between the preservation of the individual's good name and reputation and the right to free speech.  It is a prerequisite in a democracy that the public know what is going on.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a discernible shift from the public's need to know, on the one hand, and individual's rights on the other.  This can stymie publication of information on issues of important public interest.  The Government should respond positively and introduce legislation as outlined in the report of the Law Reform Commission, published in December 1991.</P>
    <P>There were 13 key recommendations in the report to update the law for the 1990s. The recommendations ensure that an individual's good name and reputation is preserved.  The European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedom rightly imposes a number of requirements in the context of any defamation law.  Any changes in our law must, of course, conform to this Convention.</P>
    <P>The distinction between libel and slander <Col N="1669" /> in our civil law on defamation should be abolished.  It is an ancient distinction and does not have a logical or rational justification.  It is also inaccurate in the context of modern communications.  It was formerly said that libel consisted of written statement while scandal was oral. The traditional view that the written statement involves more premeditation or malice than a transient oral statement is now incorrect.  The problems of the distinction between libel and slander have been compounded by modern, electronic means of communication &mdash; radio, television and so on.</P>
    <P>The common law with regard to radio broadcasting suggests, that broadcasting from a script could be libellous which an extemporary broadcast could only be slanderous.  However, since 1961 all broadcasts are deemed to be libellous if the law is broken even though they are oral.  The practical difference between libel and slander is that proof of damage is not required to prove libel while slander is actionable only on proof of damage.  The legal situation has become very unclear over the years and it should be cleared by legislation.</P>
    <P>Another distinction is that libel is a crime as well as a tort while slander is not in itself a crime, although in four distinct areas the spoken word may breach criminal law.  The abolition of the distinction to which I referred was first proposed in 1843 in a report on the law of defamation issued by a select committee of the House of Lords.</P>
    <P>I also believe the law should be changed to allow defendants in defamation actions to make payments into court without admitting liability.  The present situation is unsatisfactory as it prevents settlements without full court hearings.  In civil actions making of payments into a court by a defendant does not involve an admission of liability and it encourages early and less costly resolutions to actions taken.  If there is no settlement after a lodgment in court the defendant is not deemed to have admitted liability and this lodgment does not prejudice his defence if subsequently the case goes to a jury.  However, this is <Col N="1670" /> not the case in defamation actions where payment into a court is deemed an admission of liability.  I believe this should be changed.</P>
    <P>Mistakes will be made and it is impossible to provide for a situation where defamation will be eliminated.  Every encouragement should be given to ensure a quick and full apology.  Under present law the fact that a defendant made or offered an apology is construed as an admission of liability.  This should be changed.  The offering of or the making of an apology should not be construed as an admission of liability and jury in a subsequent trial should be directed that it is not an admission of liability. Furthermore, it should be lawful for the defendant to give evidence in mitiation of damage that he or she made or offered an apology as soon as he or she could do so.  It is important that we encourage the defence of apology.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the Law Reform Commission's position on privilege and I would like the Minister to comment on it, especially in relation to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The report says:</P>
    <P>We therefore recommend a statutory provision stating that the Members of each House of the Oireachtas shall not, in respect of the contents of any communication, whether written, oral or otherwise, in either House of the Oireachtas, be amenable to any court or any authority other than the House itself.</P>
    <P>It also states:</P>
    <P>We accordingly recommend a statutory provision that official reports of communications in either House of the Oireachtas, whether written, oral or otherwise, shall be absolutely privileged and that reports in newspapers and on television or radio of such communications, whether written, oral or otherwise, shall enjoy the same privilege as is at present extended to reports or oral statements in either House.</P>
    <P>With regard to defamatory communications between spouses the present position <Col N="1671" /> is that communications between spouses about a third party, however defamatory, are not actionable in court as defamation.  The courts have invoked the legal unity of spouses to determine that there was no publication.  The Law Reform Commission suggests that this should be changed to allow inter-personal communications between spouses to be dealt with under the general law of defamation.</P>
    <P>Care must be taken in this area however.  I do not believe the law should intrude into the privacy of communications between spouses.  There will always, of course, be a problem of proof of communication in such cases.  I would welcome the Minister's view on the report which suggests that the law should be changed in this area.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission also deals with the area of communications between lawyers and their clients.  The Minister will, I am sure, have some personal views on this.  The Law Reform Commission suggests that absolute legal professional privilege should be abolished. I do not feel sufficiently qualified to give a strong view on that area, but there are some legal people in the House and I would welcome their views.</P>
    <P>The issue of damages has been the subject of much discussion in Ireland. Irish insurance rates are many times that of neighbouring countries.  The level of awards given by Irish courts is given as an excuse for the high level of insurance. A recent survey of awards of damages in all areas bear out the fact that Ireland has one of the highest award rates among European countries.  In forming the new legislation on defamation judges should be allowed to determine the amount of damages to be awarded after a jury has indicated that such damages should be awarded.  The jury should give guidelines to the judge as to the category of damages which would fall into one of three areas &mdash; nominal, compensatory or punitive &mdash; which are outlined by the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>At present there is no provision for redress where defamation of the dead <Col N="1672" /> takes place.  This should be changed. There should be a provision for defamatory statements about a person who is dead at the time of publication.  Defamatory statements can be hurtful and distressful for the bereaved and there is no control in the area at present.  As soon as a person dies, anything can be said and no action can be taken.  There should be a right to institute proceedings in the case of defamation of the dead.  This right should be vested solely in the personal representative of the deceased who should consult with members of the family.  It is important that the legal system should afford some redress where a person's reputation is destroyed by defamatory statements as soon as he is dead.  The approach should be, however, to restore the person's good name and not to award damages to the family.  The Law Reform Commission recommends a three year limitation period from the time of death within which proceedings must be instituted.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission also provides that distributors and printers should be immune from defamation actions.  The provision that the distributor, whether it be the local shop or the boy selling the papers, or the printer who does not see the contents of the article should be liable should be changed.  Modern technology means that everything is done through computers. The publisher communicates with the printer by computer and the publication is printed without the publisher ever seeing the contents.  It is unfair that the printer who, because of modern technology, does not see the contents should be liable.  The person who sells the publication can be enjoined in a defamation action.  This too should be changed.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity <Col N="1673" /> to tell the House about my position in relation to the updating of the civil law of defamation.  As Minister for Equality and Law Reform it is my responsibility to bring forward legislative proposals for reforms in relation to civil law generally as well as in relation to equality matters. My responsibilities in that context are very wide ranging and this is reflected in the law reform measures which are set out for implementation in the Programme for a Partnership Government. It is inevitable in advancing any legislative programme that decisions have to be made about the priority to be given to the proposals within that programme. Since my appointment as Minister I have, as I must, set about deciding on priorities. A major part of my priority programme concerns family law.  I shall deal later with specific aspects of that programme as well as my programme on equality matters.  Most Senators, I think, would agree with those priorities.</P>
      <P>No doubt, Senators would wish to see the Law Reform Commission's report on defamation implemented quickly.  While that may be a desirable aim, it would not be feasible at this stage as it would necessatate the reallocation of staff away from existing high priority projects.  In stating that I do not wish to appear to detract from the importance of updating the law of defamation.  The fact is that the Government's programme contains a commitment to update the law in this area and that commitment will be honoured in due course when the other important legislative matters for which I also have responsibility can be disposed of.</P>
      <P>I am indebted to the Law Reform Commission for the major work it has carried out on the law of defamation. Following a request from the Attorney General in 1989 to examine the law of defamation and formulate proposals for its reform, the commission published two consultation papers &mdash; one on the civil aspects and and the other on the criminal aspects.  Both papers contained the commission's provisional recommendations on the subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1991 the commission <Col N="1674" /> published two separate reports: the report on the Civil Law of Defamation falls within my area of responsibility and the other, the report on the Crime of Libel, falls within the area of responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  I shall be confining my remarks to the report on the civil aspects of defamation.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, divergent views on the various recommendations contained in the report.  Taken together, the changes recommended would seem to amount to quite substantial changes in the law which need to be reflected on from various points of view.  Inevitably, that will take time.  In that regard, while reports such as these make recommendations which are undoubtedly of value in reaching the best decisions, they do not produce instant legislation &mdash; even if a draft Bill accompanies the report which, as it happens, is not the case here.</P>
    <P>It is my responsibility to see if the recommendations in the report, as in other reports, stand up in principle and are workable in practice before bringing the matter to Government.  Accordingly, the report is being examined by my Department and when that exercise is completed questions of policy are teased out fully and my policy is formulated, I shall be in a position to bring forward proposals for legislation to the Government on this subject.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the purpose of the law of defamation is to protect and vindicate, as far as possible, the right of the individual to his or her good name with due regard to the right of freedom of expression others.  Both of these rights are expressly guaranteed by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is the view of the commission that the law of defamation, which has remained unaltered by the Legislature for over 30 years, requires a more satisfactory legislative framework to meet the needs of modern society.  The existing law comprises common law rules, the provisions under the Defamation Act, 1961 and the fundamental rights which are enshrined in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>The media, in particular, have expressed concern at the scale of awards <Col N="1675" /> by the courts in cases of defamation.  In their view the current position is that their ability to pass comment and report in an independent manner is threatened. They point out that in difficult trading times, with competition from foreign newspapers and the broadcast media, the financial burden placed upon them as a result of libel awards or settlements is unacceptable.  I am aware of those concerns. I have met with representatives of the National Newspapers of Ireland and I have noted carefully what they had to say.</P>
    <P>The commission's report contains over 50 recommendations covering a wide area and, while a number of the recommendations may be regarded as merely technical, there are some which appear to involve a shift in the balance between, for example, the rights of the individual and the right of the press to pass comment.</P>
    <P>The report recommends among other matters, abolition of the distinction between libel and slander; a new definition of defamation; new provisions regarding the making of an applogy; removal of the uncertainty surrounding the use of the word &ldquo;utterances&rdquo; in Article 15.13 of the Constitution as regards Oireachtas privilege; extension of absolute privilege to witnesses appearing before Oireachtas Committees; downgrading of executive privilege from absolute immunity to qualified immunity; delineation of the extent of judicial privilege; clarification of the extent of courtroom and other privilege and downgrading of lawyer privilege from absolute immunity to qualified immunity.</P>
    <P>Of note also are recommendations that defendants may make payments into court without admission of liability; the downgrading of the immunity of the press when reporting parliamentary statements from absolute to qualified privilege; allowing the defence to succeed in cases where the defendant does not communicate with the correct person but reasonably thinks he did; requiring the plaintiff to carry the burden of proof on <Col N="1676" /> falsity issues and provision that judges, rather than juries, should determine the amount of damages to be awarded.</P>
    <P>The recommendations in the report, therefore, have implications not just for the media but for the rights of citizens generally.  The proposals in this area must be subject to careful analysis from constitutional and legal points of view in ensuring that the balance which exists between the freedom of information enjoyed by the media in the interest of democracy, and the right of citizens to their good name, is fair and equitable. These are issues which cannot be dealt with on the basis of quick-fix solutions: they are fundamental issues which must be addressed in a careful and measured way which is how I am proceeding on this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with certain of the issues addressed in the report, namely, the questions of the role of the jury, fair comment, and the issue of reasonable care.</P>
    <P>The jury in cases of defamation has traditionally been seen as having a particular role.  An indication of this can be seen from remarks made by Judge Brian Walsh in the case of Quigley <i>v.</i> Creation Ltd., where he said that: &ldquo;when a jury has found that there has been a libel, this court would be more slow to set aside such a verdict that in other types of actions&rdquo;.  Indeed, the policy, it appears, under the Courts Act, 1988 which abolished juries in personal injury cases was not to exclude defamation cases from jury trials.</P>
    <P>The commission stops short of recommending abolition of juries in cases of defamation but recommends that the role of assessing the level of damages be taken from them.  The function of juries would be to decide on issues of fact and the commission's expectation is that the function of assessing damages would be best left to judges and that this presumably should lead to a reduction in the level of awards.  The judges would, however, ask juries to decide whether the damages should be nominal, compensatory or punitive.</P>
    <P>This is a recommendation which needs <Col N="1677" /> to be considered carefully.  There is a view that the abolition of juries in personal injury cases under the 1988 Act has not led to any significant reductions in the level of damages awarded by the courts and if that view is correct the question arises as to whether the answer to the problem, as some see it, of large-scale awards in defamation cases is to take the function of determining the level of awards away from juries.</P>
    <P>The commission's view as regards the question of payments into court in defamation cases, is that it should be possible for defendants to do that without admission of liability.  This is a matter which appears to be determined at present by rules of court, although there is another view that it may be more a matter of the substance of the law.  Nevertheless, following submissions made to me by the National Newspapers of Ireland, I have taken up the matter with the Superior Courts Rules Committee to see if anything can be done in this particular area without the need, perhaps, for legislation.</P>
    <P>It is a defence in cases of defamation if the defendant can show that his statement was an opinion, not an assertion of fact; that it was substantially fair comment on a matter of public interest; and that it was not malicious.  The defence of fair comment is used, for example, in connection with cases involving reviews of books.</P>
    <P>The commission recommends the abolition of the common law rule that &ldquo;malice&rdquo; defeats the defence of fair comment if it can be ensured that the plaintiff's position is otherwise reasonably protected.  The commission's proposal attempt to remove the difficulty involved in distinguishing clearly between fact and comment.  Acknowledging that there will always be grey areas as to what might be regarded as comment or fact, the commission states that there would seem to be no way to avoid this difficulty completely if the interests of plaintiffs, defendants and the public generally have to be taken on board.  On the face of it, the commission's aims in this respect may for clarity in the law seem laudable but I <Col N="1678" /> would raise the question as to whether legislation on this point is really necessary and whether it would have the desired effect of clarity in the law.</P>
    <P>A proposal put forward by the commission which might affect the present balance between the plaintiff's and the defendant's rights, relates to the recommendation that, in effect, defamation should no longer be a tort of strict liability. It would mean that liability would no longer arise where there was no fault on the part of the defendant.  Yet another important recommendation is that the defence of reasonable care, as it applies in cases of negligence, should apply.  The commission's view is that the defence of reasonable care should be available in cases of claims for general damages and where financial loss has arisen which is clearly linked with the publication of the defamatory material.  These two recommendations, which need to be studied in the context of certain other recommendations in the commission's report, would seem, nevertheless, to represent a significant departure from existing rules of law.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation which the commission makes in the context of damages is that the Supreme Court in appeal cases should be allowed to assess damages. This has implications also for the relevance of the jury system in defamation cases and would state that there would seem to be no way to avoid this difficulty completely if the interests of plaintiffs, defendants and the public generally have to be taken on board.  On the face of it the commission's aims in this respect may, for clarity in the law, seem laudable but I would raise the question whether legislation on this point is really necessary and whether legislation would have the desired effect of clarity in the law.</P>

    <P>I think the House will appreciate, having regard to some of the issues I have outlined, that great care is necessary in determining the approach to adopt in framing legislation in these fundamental areas which have been highlighted in the commission's report.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer briefly to the proposals for legislative reform to which the Government has given priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the area of family law and indeed commercial law, Senators will recall that I initiated my first Bill, the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Bill in the Seanad.  The Bill has since been enacted into law.  It will make Irish judgments, including maintenance orders, enforceable in a wider number of EC countries than heretofore and in EFTA countries.  The judgments of the courts of those countries will also be enforceable here as a result of the legislation.  The legislation enables this country to become party to two international conventions in this area and arrangements are now being made to have those conventions ratified.</P>
      <P>Publication of the Matrimonial Home Bill giving each spouse equal rights of ownership of the family home and household contents is imminent.  Senators will, in due course, have the opportunity to discuss this important measure which has been expected for some time by many interested groups and which has been supported by the Second Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
      <P>A Family Law Reform Bill based on the No. 1 Bill in the White Paper on Marital Breakdown is in the course of being drafted and will be published later this year.  It will provide for important reforms of the law in relation to maintenance of spouses and children, nullity of marriage, recognition of foreign divorces and declarations of status of marriage.  A Civil Legal Aid Bill putting the scheme of civil legal aid and advice on a statutory footing is also being prepared and that measure will be published as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Family Law (Recovery of Maintenance) Bill to ensure better and more centralised arrangements among EC countries for the enforcement of foreign maintenance orders is being prepared.  It will involve setting up a central authority in the State to co-ordinate applications coming into and going out of the State for maintenance.  It will operate on similar lines to the central authority which <Col N="1681" /> already operates successfully in my Department under provisions in certain international conventions to deal with the problem of abductions of children across international frontiers.</P>
    <P>These are all important measures which I aim to ensure will be in legislative form by the time the referendum on divorce is held in 1994.  This is an action programme which is in line with the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  I have already made clear, on a number of occasions recently that I intend to publish before the referendum the details of the legislation which would follow in the event that the people were to vote in favour of divorce.  That legislation will spell out the details on all the main issues including maintenance of dependent parties and children, custody of children, the family home and other property, succession rights, pension rights and so on.  Moreover, the administrative and other arrangements which other Departments, such as the Department of Social Welfare, intend to bring forward as required, will also be made known.</P>
    <P>Other legislative matters are also receiving attention in my Department. I shall, as soon as possible, introduce proposals for amending legislation on occupier's liability to the Government in consultation with the Law Reform Commission and taking into account reaction from the farming organisations and other interested groups to their paper.</P>
    <P>A Bill is being drafted at present to provide an entitlement to adoptive leave for working mothers.  My Department is also developing proposals for future legislation in relation to employment equality, equal status in the non-employment areas, updating the law regarding registration of births, marriages and deaths and national law to implement an EC directive on pregnant workers.</P>
    <P>The Private Members' motion before the House refers to the failure of the Government to respond to the issues raised in the report of the Law Reform Commission on defamation.  Given the extent of the legislative programme which I am in the course of implementing, <Col N="1682" /> I think the House will agree that the motion is totally inappropriate in the present context.  I am sure also that, in view of the very positive start I have already made on the delivery of the legislative commitments in the programme, the House will have confidence that my commitments in relation to reforms of the law will be honoured in due course.</P>
    <P>I hope I have said enough to convince the House that many important reforms of the civil law and equality matters which need to be dealt with are being dealt with as part of a very considered and wide ranging programme of reform.  As I have said, the programme includes updating the civil law of defamation and I look forward in due course, when other important matters are disposed of, to debating in this House my legislative proposals in this area.  I will be happy then to discuss at length with Senator Neville and others the arguments for and against the varied provisions in the commission's report on defamation.  I have formed personal views on many of those issues but I do not wish, at this time, to prejudge a more detailed consideration and examination of those provisions.  They will be examined in detail and I will keep an open mind when discussing those provisions in the Seanad.  I will listen sympathetically to amendments proposed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  We have been colleagues for a long time and I wish him well in his new and exciting portfolio.</P>
      <P>I hope the substance of the reforms he has outlined will be more significant than his approach to this measure.  The Minister concluded by telling us that this motion is not appropriate.  It is appropriate because less than a year ago the Minister of State, now the Minister's partner in Government, gave this House a firm undertaking that there would be a firm legislative proposal on this issue within a year.  I realise that politics is an ordering of priorities, but there is a firm commitment to this in the Programme for Partnership Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to the Minister, I could <Col N="1683" /> only regret that the Irish rugby team is currently in a settled phase.  The Minister kicked so successfully for touch that he would challenge very strongly for a place on that team.  Every issue this evening was given the long kick into touch.</P>
    <P>The commission report is, as the Minister acknowledged, an impressive and important document.  Unfortunately, that report does not carry any political imperative.  There is little political will to change the law on defamation.  This may be because there is, and there should be, a nomal tension between politics and the media.  All of us, in different ways, carry the scars of encounters with the media where we felt we had been unfairly treated.  The Minister's party in recent times has suffered from media criticism, some deserved, some not.  All politicians have that tension in our relationship with the media.  Nonetheless, the issues addressed in this report are fundamental to a society that wishes to be open and believes in a strong vibrant democracy.  I am sorry the Minister has told us that they will be dealt with at the end of this Administration, if at all.</P>
    <P>We live in an age where the mass media has enormous, unprecedented and unparalleled influence.  Frequently, especially in the UK, we have seen this influence used by unscrupulous avaricious media moguls for their own narrow ends.  It has been used to destroy the careers of people like Neil Kinnock.  We saw the treatment of Norman Lamont and at a different level the treatment given to the manager of the English football team.  In a situation where the media has such power, it is vitally important that the rules governing the use and abuse of that power be as clear and updated as possible.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission report on defamation is not a one way street; it imposes rules and guidelines within which the media must operate.  The biggest lack in the area at present is the absence of any developed jurisprudence in the area of defamation.  It seems as though cases are tried on a case by case basis, without proper precedent build up, <Col N="1684" /> or the certainty which is so important in good law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Every case is different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows from his own experience that there is a degree of precedent.  It is not the Minister's fault that there is lack of jurisprudence, I appreciate that, but it is one of the factors which contribute to the absence of certainty at present.</P>
      <P>We live in an age where the technology of the media is changing at a very rapid rate, where the comprehensiveness of what is covered and the speed with which it is covered is something we could not have anticipated 25 years ago.  There has, in turn, been a change in the sort of society we are.  There is virtually no area of Irish life today which is not subject to media scrutiny, and nobody here would say that we are not the better for all of that.  However, the very speed under which the media operates, its very comprehensiveness, can lead to genuine mistakes being made.</P>
      <P>One of the areas which the report tries to tackle is the question of apologies and lodgments, and the Minister referred to both of them.  It is in the area of apologies that an immediate and effective change could be made.  Where a newspaper genuinely admits that a mistake has been honestly made, where it is prepared to give equal prominance in fair language to the apology, this should not then be accepted as an admission of malice or guilt.  That that is one area which could be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of other issues were covered. I agree with the Minister's stance in regard to juries.  I do not support the case being made by the National Newspapers Association of Ireland for the abolition of juries.  The Minister is quite right to point to the fact that we were told that when juries were abolished in insurance cases that the level of costs would drop dramatically.  That has not been the case; indeed, I suspect the level of awards has gone up.  In some cases I would prefer to have that matter adjudicated <Col N="1685" /> on by a jury, rather than by one of our less eccentric judges.</P>
    <P>The Minister also spoke of payment into court in defamation cases.  It should be possible to do this without admission of liability, which would be an immediate improvement.  The other sources of concern to those in the media centre frequently around the question of fair comment.  What is fair comment?  Our media has changed beyond recognition, but Senator Lee would agree with me were I to say that on the question of fair comment we are, to an extent, back to where we were about 100 years ago, because fair comment 100 years ago was frequently outrageous.  People could say things about their opponents which today would land them behind prison bars or find them subject to enormous costs. How do we regulate the question of fair comment in an age like ours, where virtually every issue is open to comment and where a healthy democracy depends upon as wide a range of different points of view as possible, where a columnist, commentator, journalist, in a sense will be read because of the vigour with which they express their views?</P>
    <P>The difficulty which the report addresses is that of defining fair comment. It probably does not have to be fair.  I could attack Senator Gallagher, were I so ungracious.  There is the question of how fair it has to be, and we have seen in recent times where people will sue where the comment may have been truthful but was hard-hitting.  Is that in itself a case for legal action?  I am disappointed that the Minister is not moving more quickly, because there are only about six major issues addressed in this report.  There is the question of comment, which I have mentioned, there is the question of how apologies should be treated, whether they should be regarded as an admission of liability or whether it should be possible for them to be accepted as a genuine recompense for a mistake that was honestly made.</P>
    <P>There is the question of libelling the dead, and here I do not agree with the National Newspaper Association of Ireland.  References to the dead, as <Col N="1686" /> Senator Neville has said, can be very hurtful.  On the other hand, if one is writing about the late and unlamented Mr. Robert Maxwell, what can one say? Is one expected to write well of him, when all the evidence points to the contrary? It is something that arises very rarely.  Nonetheless, when does someone who is dead become a historical figure? When do the normal canons of historical judgment and objectivity apply?  This is another issue which needs to be resolved. I favour a specific time limit there, two or three years, and after that, maybe five or six years, when comment can be less inhibited.  I am talking largely about public figures, what they did, their actions and so forth.</P>
    <P>While I understand that the Minister has a range of genuinely serious issues on his agenda, he should not let the issues raised by this Commission fall too far behind.  It might very well be the case that this issue could be examined by one of the various Oireachtas committees in existence at present, because this issue is more important than the Minister has indicated in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;welcomes the commitment in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> to update the law of defamation as part of the Government's wide-ranging programme of legislative reform of the civil law&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I am glad to have the opportunity to participate in this debate on the whole area of defamation.  It is a subject that has aroused considerable interest and controversy in recent times.  However, at times this debate has been overly simplistic and a variety of nuances are not taken into account.  It is important that we have a full and open debate on the subject of defamation, before introducing any changes to the law in this regard, as recommended by the commission. <Col N="1687" /> We need to look at all the facts at our disposal, we need to hear all sides of the argument and, most importantly, we need to rigorously analyse the effects of any changes of proposed legislation. In particular, we should examine the defamation models in other countries and see how they work or, in most cases possibly, do not work.  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits this Government to updating the law on defamation and contempt.  This commitment will be dealt with in time.  To my mind it does not have the same urgency as other pressing issues of legal reform.  Therefore, we have the necessary time for the required period of debate and analysis.  I hope that the debate in this House will contribute positively to the overall debate.</P>
    <P>In starting off in this area, I would like to quote George Bernard Shaw who said that liberty means responsibility and that is why most men dread it.  I think that sums up the whole issue of defamation and the different areas and rights concerned with it.  No one disputes the right of freedom of expression.  It is an absolute prerequisite in an open and democratic society.  It is a right that cannot be taken for granted.  It is one that must be zealously guarded.  However, this right must be complemented by another equally fundamental right: that of the individual to protect their own good name and reputation.</P>
    <P>Defamation can be considered as the law's response to the two above-mentioned rights &mdash; the right to free speech and the right of the individual to preserve his or her reputation from unjust attack.  Defamation is the publication without lawful justification to a third party of matter defamatory of the plaintiff.  It is a libel where the publication is in permanent form and a slander where the publication is in transient form.  For the purposes of the law of defamation, a publication is anyone who makes a statement, who distributes or disseminates a statement, or who repeats a statement to a third person, or publishes that statement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1688" /> Our law of defamation is based, in the main, on the English common law as it evolved over four centuries.  Many questions have been raised about our current legislation.  Some of these questions are valid.  For example, does our present law lay undue stress on damages as a remedy? Should there be changes in how we assess these damages?  Should the families of deceased persons have a right to sue for defamation?  Should a public figure have to establish that the words complained of were not only defamatory but also published maliciously as is the case in the United States?  These and many other questions must be considered in the debate on the matter.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that a rather simplistic view prevails regarding reform of the law of defamation; that the law at present is overly restrictive, limits freedom of expression and must be radically overhauled. I believe that to follow this path is a mistake.  I understand the point of view of our newspapers and other media but I think in some ways it is a selfish one.  It is a point of view that sees the pursuit of news as more important than the reputations and indeed, feelings of citizens.  I do not share this point of view; I believe the citizen has a fundamental right to have their integrity and reputation protected to the utmost.</P>
    <P>For me the key word is protection. Protection from insult, smears and lies. False accusations are not to be taken lightly.  They can ruin careers, reputations and even lives.  It is absolutely vital that people have a right of redress in such cases.  Indeed, this right and protection is mentioned in our Constitution and in the European Convention on Human Rights which, in Article 10 (2), states:</P>
    <P>The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions, or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interest of national security, territorial integrity of public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, <Col N="1689" /> for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.</P>
    <P>The protection of a person's reputation and freedom of expression is thus enshrined in the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Some have tried to belittle the pain and hurt that defamation can cause and have even tried to portray actions for defamation as a means of gaining money. I find this point of view unacceptable. To anyone who has been defamed, the matter is a serious one.  It is not a matter to be dismissed lightly even when it may not always seem so to an outsider observer.  It is not always necessary to even name the person in order to defame them.  I recall an old case where the plaintiff &mdash; an antique dealer &mdash; while unnamed in a book, was referred to as being more interested &ldquo;in young mistresses than old masters&rdquo;.  However, in an affidavit, the young Samuel Beckett said that reference in the text led him to recognise who the plaintiff was and the defamation was upheld.</P>
    <P>I have observed the activities of the print media in the UK with some concern and a great deal of incredulity in recent years.  The tabloids in particular, though by no means exclusively, have transgressed every rule of privacy and common decency.  They have lied, distorted and mounted hate campaigns.  They have long since abdicated any claim to impartial reporting.  Examples of this are legion.  I recall one particularly grotesque episode where a tabloid newspaper manufactured an interview with the widow of a soldier who had been killed in the Falklands, complete with tearful text and accompanying photos.  The entire article was a repulsive fraud.  There are many more such examples of this kind of journalism in Britain.  Recent comments made in English newspapers regarding the Guildford Four were equally distasteful, carrying as they did the taint of anti-Irish sentiment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1690" /> Looking further at these newspapers we have to ask ourselves what constitutes news these days?  Much of the British print media seems to subsist on a diet of bingo games, lurid exposés and cheap titillation.  The traditional vocation to inform and educate has fallen by the wayside in the ever ruthless quest to succeed in the circulation wars.  In such a climate the personal integrity of an individual is simply grist to the mill of sensation hungry editors.  If a sensational or cruel claim or comment will sell more newspapers, then so be it.</P>
    <P>I believe it is absolutely essential in such a climate that the individual has a legal framework on which they can rely when they have been libelled or slandered. It is important to remember that it is not merely the rich and famous who are attacked by the press; it is ordinary people also.  These people have as much right to defend their good name as anyone else.  There is a moral obligation on a democratic state to ensure that this right exists.  If we tamper with this framework we run the risk of weakening or watering down this inalienable right.</P>
    <P>I think representatives of our newspapers will say there is no real comparison between Irish and British newspapers.  At present this is probably the case but the recent Casey affair, with its surreptitious recordings and its cruel pursuit of Bishop Casey, does not bode well for the future development of journalism and newspapers in this country. Our newspapers have not yet fallen into the habits of their British counterparts but, in truth, there is nothing to stop them doing so if they so wish, apart from the principles and convictions of our own journalists and editors.  Unlike the UK, we do not even have a Press Council to adjudicate on or monitor harmful and cruel stories.  Without sounding unduly pessimistic, I can envisage a future where our newspapers, faced with falling circulations and competition from the electronic media, might adopt the habits of their British counterparts.  This may be unlikely but it cannot be ruled out.</P>
    <P>Both at present and in the event of a deterioration in media standards, it is <Col N="1691" /> important that the right to defend and preserve one's good name is protected. For that reason I believe that we tamper with current legislation at our own risk. If anything, we should be thinking of ways to bolster the protection we afford to the individual in this regard.  For example, do we need new measures, such as a declaration restoring the plaintiff's reputation or an order directing the defendant to publish a correction?  This begs the question that when a newspaper does have to make an apology, why is the apology almost unnoticeable inside the newspaper.  This is a very grudging response and seems to be an insult in itself.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> recently published a summary of remarks by Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty on the constitutional area governing the right to freedom of expression.  He examined the constitutional provisions governing freedom of expression and the right to protect one's integrity and good name.  I recommend the article to everyone.  I will not read the relevant extracts now because it would take too long.  He mentioned one decision with which I agree which has been followed by the Irish Supreme Court.  A famous judge, Lord Atkin, &ldquo;the son of a Corkman&rdquo; as Mr. Justice O'Flaherty says, was quoted in the case of Ambard <i>v.</i> Attorney General for Trinidad and Tobago, decided in 1936:</P>
    <P>Justice is not a cloistered virtue.  She must be allowed to suffer the scrutiny and respectful, even though outspoken, comments of ordinary men.</P>
    <P>This dictum has been approved by our Supreme Court with the slight qualification that &ldquo;in his private personal character a judge should receive no more protection from the law than any other member of the community at large&rdquo;.  This means we should all be treated equally but also that it should not be only people who can afford to take expensive actions in the Supreme Court who can defend libels or defamations against them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to delay enactment of the Law Reform <Col N="1692" /> Commission's report and to have more debate on the matter from all interested parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I would be the last person to criticise priorities in his law reform because I am extremely glad to see reforms in family law and equality legislation.</P>
      <P>However, there should not be too great a delay in changing this legislation.  The need for change in the civil law on defamation is recognised by a large number of people and the Minister would have all party support for changes.</P>
      <P>There are three conflicting interests in this arena.  The individual has a right to a good name, the media has a right to freedom of expression and, perhaps, the most important third element, the freedom of information which is essential in the public interest.</P>
      <P>At present none of these is well served. Private or public individuals may be defamed and may have to wait a long time before the alleged defamation is retracted.  The media feel their comments are constrained because they fear libel action and the public are too often denied information which may be vital for decision-making in the common good.</P>
      <P>The commission recommended that the plaintiff should have to prove that the words published or uttered were untrue. I have always thought it incredible that a court case starts on the presumption that what was written was true and numerous witnesses had to be called to show it was untrue if it was patently obvious it was untrue from the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission also recommended consideration should be given to the fact that the newspaper &mdash; which I am using to cover all the media &mdash; has made a reasonable effort to get all the facts in a case because a case can be taken at the moment even if a person has avoided giving the facts to a reporter.  It is possible to avoid taking telephone calls and replying to letters and faxes.  When the case comes to court the plaintiff can say he or she was not given a chance to present his or her side of the case.  If a reporter or a <Col N="1693" /> newspaper can show they made reasonable efforts to ascertain the facts on the other side of the case it should be taken into consideration.  Records will have to be produced but it is important that such consideration is given.</P>
    <P>A couple of weeks ago a Sunday newspaper said that Senator O'Toole, Senator Norris and I were not in favour of Mother Teresa speaking in the House.  I cannot speak for the other two Senators but the reporter had not interviewed me or asked my opinion on this matter.  No one had. The only view I had volunteered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will not.  I think I am the only Member of the Seanad to have met Mother Teresa, at a medical meeting in the Philippines.  I also met President Marcos there but I did not meet Imelda because she was in America shopping.</P>

      <P>I met the reporter in question some days later and I asked why that had been written about me when I had not said a word on the subject.  He looked suitably shaken and asked if I wanted clarification.  I did not reply.  If he had written a clarification in the next issue to say I had never said what was attributed to me that should have been sufficient and I should not be in the position &mdash; in which apparently I am &mdash; to take a court case and seek damages because my reputation had been damaged.  An immediate clarification should be enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>One can say worse things about people than that they did not want Mother Teresa to speak in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I would have privately communicated with Mother Teresa if I felt she thought I had said anything nasty about her.  If the person feels his or her reputation has been damaged immediate clarification is the most important remedy but this is not the case <Col N="1694" /> at present.  There is a two to three year waiting list for court cases in defamation.</P>
      <P>There is also dreadful discrimination concerning money.  This is a rich person's area as it is virtually impossible for the poor to take such cases.  The reputation of an ordinary person is just as important as that of a well-off person or a public figure.  It may be even more important because if an employee is defamed his employer may believe the defamation and dismiss him.  The employee will have little recourse to justice for several years.</P>
      <P>The rights of the poor &mdash; as well as those of the rich &mdash; must be vindicated but at the moment the system is heavily biased in favour of those with money to employ legal representatives.  This is an extraordinarily expensive area.  Unless one can obtain solicitors on a &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; basis, it is almost impossible to take a case.  One recommendation was that civil legal aid should be extended to such cases, I support that.  The rich are most unlikely to apply for civil legal aid because it is so difficult to qualify for it.</P>
      <P>The effect of the dealy on those who feel they have been defamed should not be underestimated.  Medical negligence was discussed earlier.  People experience dreadful problems waiting for injury cases to come to court, their lives revolve around it.  The delay also has tremendous effect on the defendant doctors who, while sure they will not be found negligent in a case, nonetheless suffer considerable stress.</P>
      <P>It is not exactly the same in defamation allegations.  Emphasis must be put on getting immediate redress for the defamation, not on financial recompense, which is the case at present.  Senator Crowley said he would like to see all people treated equally.  At the moment poor are definitely treated differently from the rich, who have a strong advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clarifications or apologies are usually printed in the same place as the defamation. However, the major problem is that if one publishes an apology it can be taken as an admission of liability.  This should be changed as rapidly as possible. Any measure which would avoid these <Col N="1695" /> expensive cases, while not being taken as damaging the defendant's case, would be welcome.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a friend of mine, Stephen Hilliard, was tragically killed. Appallingly, a defamatory aricle was published on him and his widow had no proper recourse to defend his good name. In cases like this, where there is immediate publication of defamatory material, the personal representatives of the deceased, usually relatives, should be in a position to take corrective action.</P>
    <P>I accept that there should be a mechanism whereby vexatious cases cannot be taken in regard to those who have been dead for many years and that there should be no financial reward.  In addition, the reduction of the time limit from six to three years is essential as I cannot understand how it would take six years for someone to decide he had been defamed.</P>
    <P>Democracy depends on the free flow of information.  I have been on the receiving end of critical comment &mdash; I cannot understand it &mdash; but while it is very annoying, a degree of criticism is justifiable if it is in the interests of democracy, particularly if it is fair comment based on facts.</P>
    <P>The reform of the malice element is important, especially for book publishers. Newspapers are in a better position on this issue as they have a close liaison with the reporter.  However, an author who submits a book to the publisher may be the only person who can deal with the problem.  The contents of the book may be foreign territory to the publisher but if sufficient editorial effort is made to ensure factual accuracy, I do not believe it should be possible to take action in regard to a small error.  The context of the error is important.  A small error in a large book is very different from the same error on the front page of one of the mass tabloid newspapers.  If this is not taken into consideration there could be a dearth of books with any political, social or cultural comment.</P>

      <P>Legal advice is very expensive and it is important to ensure that publishers do not go out of business because of fear of litigation.  In this respect I am delighted that printers are exempt, as Senator Neville pointed out, modern technology made that provision obsolete.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased at the suggestion that booksellers should be exempt as sometimes they are enjoined in cases because they are the best financial target when it is obvious that the author, the printer and the publisher do not have financial resources.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out in regard to compensation injuries that the size of awards did not diminish when decisions were transferred from jury to judge, they are now larger than ever.  Juries should at least be given scales.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
      <P>The amendment to the motion is that the House should delay consideration of the position relating to the report of the Law Reform Commission on the law of defamation.  I am very interested in law, it has been one of my pet subjects for a long time.</P>
      <P>This report is impressive and detailed. There are approximately 50 recommendations, on two of which I will comment. Does &ldquo;apology&rdquo; mean an admission of liability?  What is the agreed definition of &ldquo;defamation&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>On these two areas alone as on all other aspects, there are many underlying issues and much analysis is required. Therefore, legislation should not be rushed on this matter.  In addition, as a lay person I believe more time is required to enable the public to become familiar with and knowledgeable on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the underlying assumptions, how does defamation of a person arise?  Is the psychological hurt or the <Col N="1697" /> personal hurt considered?  Lawyers will formulate a judgment based on common sense, but what is common sense?  The Law Reform Commission was not happy with the recommendations submitted on this aspect.  In view of that, will the Minister analyse &ldquo;defamation&rdquo; on the basis of the psychological &mdash; as against the common sense &mdash; assessment of each case?</P>
    <P>Defamation affects not only the individual but also the family.  In this respect it is necessary to measure in some way the hurt caused by defamation in relation to a legal remedy and in terms of damages. If money is awarded, is it in compensation for the personal or the psychological hurt?  Are successful cases of defamation publicised on the basis that the litigant was psychologically hurt?</P>
    <P>I pose these questions to illustrate the complexity of the situation.  Unless the issues are examined in some depth and a balance struck, there is a danger that every headline will be construed as hurtful and, therefore, defamatory.</P>
    <P>The power of the media is extensive, for example, I am apprehensive when talking to the media that my remarks will be misinterpreted.  This can become a maze of conflicting perceptions.  There must be clarity between perception and fact to avoid ambiguity and vulnerability in people on this issue.</P>
    <P>The media has a role in informing the public.  This is especially the case in respect of media headlines, which are all that many people in today's busy world have time to read.  However, the headline conveys a message which may be contradicted in the report which often goes unnoticed.</P>
    <P>It is the role of public representatives, journalists and the media generally to impart accurate information.  There must be a balance and I am concerned that people go to court for the wrong reasons in these situations.  The adversarial setting can induce an unhealthy atmosphere where action is couched in terms of putting the other party down and demanding compensation.</P>
    <P>We are talking about high standards.  I support honesty, integrity and high standards, <Col N="1698" /> which can be found in all walks of life.  I hate to say it but the standards adopted by our media have slipped.  The reason for this may have been the competition between newspapers and television. Newspapers use attractive headlines to highlight a story; yet they are often careless about the truth.  One line in an article can defame a person. We must be aware of the damage caused by personal hurt and psychological hurt.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed legislation in relation to family law reform and I hope it will be introduced in the near future.  I look forward to a more detailed analysis of the issues which have been raised here today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the law of defamation and I thank the Minister for his enlightened contribution.</P>
      <P>The original motion sought to chastise the Government for allegedly failing to deal with the measures raised in the report of the Law Reform Commission on defamation.  I am aware of the work which has been undertaken by the Minister, Deputy Taylor, and his Department. Members and the public regard certain matters of social reform and general law reform as priority issues and these should be considered.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made it clear that he is committed to law reform.  The fact that the laws of defamation are not listed in the Programme for a Partnership Government shows it is a matter of priority.  The complications of social legislation need consideration because they affect everyone.  Legislation should not be rushed through the Houses just to facilitate other interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dealing specifically with the law of defamation, I agree it needs reform.  At present, we have common law, which is mostly outdated, the Defamation Act, 1961 and the fundamental rights under the Constitution.  Article 40.3 of the Constitution provides that the State must protect the personal rights of the citizen and ensure that each citizen is protected from unjust attack.  Article 40.6 guarantees freedom of expression.  We must balance <Col N="1699" /> these two rights when considering the law of defamation. which is a complicated area, and ensure we get it right.</P>
    <P>I take issue with Senator Manning who said that six areas recommended in the report needed to be considered and that it was simply a matter of pushing them through&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>There are approximately 69 recommendations in the report, more than was quoted.  Each recommendation needs consideration.  I would not like to see the Minister making hasty decisions and I would welcome an opportunity for another debate.</P>
      <P>One of the recommendations in the report is that defamation should be redefined. This is a good start.  This anomaly has existed for some time and it needs to be changed.  The report also recommended that certain cases could be heard in the Circuit Court.  This was changed some years ago and it will be subject to assessment with regard to damages.  This is a practical move because it allows one to protect one's good name in a cost effective way, rather than taking a costly High Court action which often deters people from defending themselves.</P>
      <P>Certain matters were raised about the defence of apology.  It is not sufficient to state in one sentence that the original statement was incorrect.  This does not rectify the problem.  While it should be considered in mitigation of damages, it should not be a defence.</P>
      <P>Members will be pleased to see that the report did not recommend any changes regarding absolute privilege.  We are still free to argue with each other.  Qualified privilege in relation to solicitors' clients was mentioned by Senator Neville.  I am concerned about this, although I do not yet have a definite opinion on it.  This is an area which needs further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the defence of opinion on fair report I understand that in the US there is freedom to express one's opinion and the offended party cannot get redress.  We must be very careful about <Col N="1700" /> allowing such situations to occur in Ireland.  This is part of an ongoing problem. When does opinion become fact, and how does one differentiate between various circumstances?  This is a difficult area and I do not envy the Minister trying to find a balance.</P>
    <P>Other areas are affected by laws introduced to reform the law of defamation, including contempt of court, the criminal aspects of defamation and the right to privacy.  These issues should also be considered. I look forward to hearing the Minister's views.</P>
    <P>There are many problems regarding the law of defamation.  Defamation should no longer be a tort of strict liability. In other words, an individual should only be able to take a case if the person who issued the publication is in the wrong.  This is an important point because in areas of innocent publication one should not be able to claim large amounts of damages through the courts, if the offence was not intended.  The role of juries in these cases has been mentioned. It is a sad reflection on our courts that we have the highest awards in Europe.  This matter must be redressed.</P>
    <P>As regards the burden of proof, it should be up to the plaintiffs to prove the falsity of a statement.  I would favour that but there would have to be a balance. The survival of the causes of action following the death of the defamer or the victim is important and I would welcome that provision in the law.  I note the media's concern about insurance and high awards.  I would be in favour of seeking a balance between the British tabloid press and the cases I have outlined in the United States, yet allowing freedom of expression by the media.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has the Civil Legal Aid Board on his agenda, I hope one would link with the other because there is no point in having rights if one cannot defend them or cannot afford to defend them.  The report also recommends that legal aid be provided for such actions and I hope that will be considered.  There are many issues that require greater consideration and I do not envy the Minister his task, but I am happy to have the <Col N="1701" /> Department consider the report and I look forward to it coming back to this House for further consideration in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who contributed to the debate.  The outcome seems to be that this report and its recommendations are being put on the long finger and that we will not see the implementation of this report in the lifetime of this Government.  One will always have priorities and something will always be more important than what one is doing today, but this report is important.  We will not miss democracy until it is gone, and the media have an important role in our democratic system.  The media are concerned about this matter.</P>
      <P>Consultations have been taking place since 1989 when the Law Reform Commission commenced its investigation of this issue.  A consultation report on defamation was published two years ago and all interested parties were invited to make submissions.  Now that the final report has been submitted, the time for consultation has concluded and the Government should make up its mind on the recommendations.  While there are 60 recommendations, there are 13 key recommendations which must be looked at.  I do not agree that there should be further consultation because that can be used to postpone a decision to introduce legislation.  Consultation papers are published to allow people to give their views. A final report is the views of the commission, and now Government must make up its mind whether it accepts or rejects that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The openness of society and how society has changed has been referred to throughout the debate.  Society has become more open and we should do everything to avoid, and legislation must avoid, our media becoming like the British gutter press.  We agree with Senator Crowley on that point.  That is not the purpose of this report nor is it the purpose of this side of the House to prompt the Government to bring in legislation. Hopefully, we will never see the day when the Irish media go down the road <Col N="1702" /> of the British tabloid press, and long may that remain the case.</P>
    <P>People have freely supported two areas of the report.  The first is the payment into court of moneys without admitting liability.  This would allow cases to be settled with little cost and it would allow the media to settle cases without admitting liability.  At present the placing of moneys in court is an admission of liability and is a prompt to the plaintiff to go to court since they believe they are already halfway towards winning the case.  The other issue highlighted by several Senators was the writing and publishing of apologies.  Apologies should be written and published without admitting liability.  This is the fastest way of correcting damage done to a person's reputation. Everything should be done to facilitate early correction by the media if they have defamed somebody.  This should not be held as an admission of liability if the case goes to court at a later stage.</P>
    <P>As Senator Gallagher said, there are serious problems in this area which should be addressed.  However, we will not see them addressed in the lifetime of this Government, at least that is what I interpret from what has been said. Senator Henry alone commented on defamation of the dead.  This too is an important issue.  A certain period should elapse before publications of a defamatory kind could be made, and the suggestion in the report of three years is a fair balance, that is, three years from the time the person died, not three years after the defamation.</P>
    <P>As we are discussing the media, and we have been crictical of them from time to time, I would like to compliment them for their fairness in the way they handle many social issues and the debates in this and the other House.  I regret we will not see the laudable work of the Law Reform Commission, the many hours of work that have gone into two reports and the hundreds of consultations, become legislation in the lifetime of this Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was explaining why this provision is here.  It is not here simply because it has been practised over the years and it is not a legislative building block that is automatically put in by the parliamentary draftsman.  There are very good reasons for its inclusion.  The net point is that a Member of the Oireachtas, be it a Senator or a Deputy, would otherwise be able to be a member of a State agency and a Member of the Oireachtas simultaneously and that would cause inevitable conflicts.  One could perhaps argue that our expertise in law making and in the evaluation of laws qualifies as simultaneously to be judges and law makers. There is something akin in contrasting and comparing the two because in the interpretation of the law, as ultimately the Supreme Court or even the High Court has to do, they could argue that they are Members of the Oireachtas, that they remembered a particular debate and they knew what was meant by the legislators when they were putting something through because they are still Members of the Oireachtas.  There is a clear division of function and of responsibilities between the two.  There are just over 220 Oireachtas Members.  I know Senator Howard feels very strongly about this matter but we are not denying Deputies or Senators their political rights or opportunities <Col N="1704" /> by asking them to forego this chance to become a member of a semi-State body.  I genuinely believe there are real conflicts in interest.</P>
      <P>For example, let us take the example of a person who is a member of the IDA, as it will be constituted, and where a proposal for an industry which is about to locate in a town the person happens to be from or which is located in his or her constituency, is brought before them. Perhaps the executive body of the IDA states that it has evaluated the project and does not propose to grant aid it because the costs are simply too high. That frequently happens and there are many projects which the IDA does not ultimately fund because the cost is too high or in some cases the cost has been gazumped either by Scottish, Welsh or French competing agencies.  If a person is from a constituency in which an industry is to locate and it would be known that that was the preferred location of that industry, there is a potential conflict of interest.  How does the person resolve the situation?  Which is the superior loyalty? Is it to the elected members of the local authority of which he or she is a member or is it to the citizens of that constituency who chose to vote for him or her?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The competitive nature of the larger political parties is another example.  A councillor who is not a Member of either House knows that a party colleague is on the IDA board by virtue of their membership of the Seanad or the Dáil.  The councillor knows that a member could with their vote ensure that an industry is located in a area but the member chooses not to do so.  That person is vulnerable to that kind of pressure.  I used the example earlier of somebody who may have been appointed by the outgoing Administration as a member of the board of Aer Lingus.  Where would that person be this evening in the context of answering questions in this House or explaining the position to their constituency if they were a Member for north county Dublin, Clare or Limerick?  The person was appointed to a particular board by the Minister but he or she was elected to this <Col N="1705" /> House or the other House and they would be torn in those directions.  That is one aspect of the conflict.  Another aspect of the conflict is, for example, a row between a Minister giving directions to a board to do something and a member of that board refusing to accept that and taking the row into the Dáil.  This matter is fraught with all sorts of difficulty but I believe the pursuit of politics is an honourable profession.  It is a vital profession in a democracy and people should be encouraged and respected for taking up politics.  Politicians should be subject to full public scrutiny and we are in a way that very few other professions or groups are subject.  Accountants and solicitors are not subject to that kind of scrutiny. Professors hold their positions for life, as do bishops.  Politicians are in a position where we are open to scrutiny and we face the ballot box on average every three or four years.  Therefore, having put ourselves in that position we should not downgrade ourselves.  In the past we have allowed ourselves to be denigrated by a minority of people in different parties who were elected.  It is not a party political matter.</P>
    <P>On the broad principle, it is not just a mindless inclusion of a provision or putting it in because that is the way boards are constituted.  There are very sound reasons as to why it is not the case. Why is it that I am allowing members of the local authority to be on the board of the county enterprise partnership boards?</P>
    <P>First, the relationship between members of a county council and the executive, i.e. the manager, is totally different from that of a Member of the Oireachtas and the Executive.  One must be a Member of either House to be a member of the Government whereas, by definition, a county manager cannot.  Secondly, territorial constituency conflict does not exist.  In a county enterprise partnership board, all members are equally committed to the county and it is not big enough to have the constituency rivalries one may have, for example, between Shannon and Dublin or Cork and Waterford, in terms of a location or <Col N="1706" /> venue for an industry preference. Thirdly, county councillors have a positive role to play in local enterprise boards and this is one of the reasons that convinced me I should change the original proposal that the <i>ex officio</i> chairperson automatically becomes a member.  Councillors at local level work on a part-time basis and have a wider spread of interest and involvement than is the case here and are closer to the action on the ground.</P>
    <P>I worked in the housing architects' department of Dublin Corporation for nearly three years and served on the local authority as an elected member.  I am a great admirer of the local authority system with one caveat &mdash; there is no commitment to job creation or employment in it.  Therefore, my deliberate intent in broadening the participation from one up to four of 12, as distinct from one out of approximately 18, was to give local authority and elected members a sense of responsibility, so that they would consider every decision coming before them, whether it is the purchase of an incinerator essential for the disposal of industrial waste, which will have to be dealt with in the next three to four years, or looking at every planning application from the point of view of not only how it impacts on the environment and tourism but on employment.  Responsibility for employment at local level among councillors has never been part of their agenda and by having this number of members on the local authority, in as broad a political representation as possible, their consciousness of the need to preserve existing jobs and to create new ones will be enhanced.</P>
    <P>I have taken some time to explain this because I know it is not the first time Senator Howard raised it &mdash; Senator Taylor-Quinn also expressed her concerns about it last night.  The embargo is not a slight on politicians; they would be put in an impossible position if they were members of State boards, they would be forced to choose and would ultimately take the easier option of going against those who did not elect them to be reelected by those who did.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the Minister's response, he is the first Minister I can recall who has gone to reasonable lengths in putting the other side of the argument.  The usual response was to tell the House that this was standard practice which would be retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not fully accept the Minister's arguments.  For example, I know that in Germany &mdash; I cannot speak for other EC countries &mdash; there is no embargo on politicians serving on State boards.  I have met politicians there who are members of state boards and chambers of commerce and involved in the business sector.  With regard to the Minister's point about politicians being put under considerable pressure because they may have to make a decision on matters in their constituencies, there is a provision in the Bill for a declaration of interests which could also be adjusted to take account of constituency pressures, where they may arise.  I do not think it is constitutionally right &mdash; even though politicians are involved &mdash; to disqualify a group of people from fulfilling any other role on <Col N="1708" /> behalf of the State.  I do not know if anyone will challenge this constitutionally, but it is wrong not to allow politicians to sit on State boards.</P>
    <P>Whatever the argument for this disqualification &mdash; I do not accept it in relation to Members of the Oireachtas &mdash; including members of local authorities is stretching it too far because it does not apply to them in regard to State boards in other legislation that has gone through this House.  As a member of these boards they would not be subjected to greater pressure than they would under the local enterprise teams.  I have had a lengthy association with politics and politicians on all sides, here and in council chambers, and their level of integrity is higher than that of many others in society.  The Minister's fears are ill-founded, but I acknowledge and appreciate the lengths to which he went in arguing the case and that he did not give me the standard glib response.</P>

      <P>I requested and support the publication of the annual report within three months of the end of the financial year to which it refers.  Three months is a reasonable period, if we left it open-ended there would be no urgency in publishing the report.  The Minister is asking us to accept an amendment providing for a time limit of six months. However, I will not force a division on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Procedurally we should probably take amendment No. 21a in conjunction with amendment Nos. 22 and 23.  We examined this issue when the Committee Stage amendments were being tabled.  The problem with early publication of annual reports in not the unwillingness of either the Department or the agencies to produce them but the constraints on the Comptroller and Auditor General in regard to verifying and certifying the accounts.  The alternative is to hire expensive accountants which I do not want to do.  There have been totally unacceptable delays in the publication of annual reports in the past.  A legislative sword of Damocles hanging over agencies would compel them to publish their reports within the specified time, they will then get priority in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I am advised that six months is a realistic period at which we can reasonably aim, not three months as proposed by Senator Quinn and Senator Farrelly. That is as far as I can go.</P>

      <P>I did not realise this is <Col N="1711" /> a Government amendment.  It goes a long way towards accepting the spirit of what I was hoping to achieve.  However, I have one problem with this issue and I want to confirm that my view is correct.  One of my criticisms of State companies is that they have often issued reports to their own Departments who often delayed publication.  I wish to clarify that we are talking about the onus being on the organisation to publish the report within six months.  May I confirm that it is the publication that is intended, not just reporting to the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Senator's point, that is certainly my intention, we can examine on Report Stage how this can be achieved.  Although I know what we are legislating for the future and that practices may very well alter, the practice of the current administration and of previous administrations, as far as I recall from my experience of them, is that when a Department receives a report a summary of it is prepared by way of <i>aide memoire</i> which is brought to the Government in the normal time period, this process takes a week or a fortnight.  Such reports are generally accepted by the Cabinet, I can only recall one instance where we were unhappy with the inadequacy of one report and we conveyed this in the critique we prepared of the <i>aide memoire</i> from the Department.  We cannot change the annual report of a body but we criticise inadequate editing that has been brought forward to the <i>aide memoire</i> from the sponsoring Department. The reports themselves are published unchanged.  It is normal that there are two or three annual reports on the agenda of almost every meeting of the Government.  My intention is that reports would be published and laid before this House within six months, on Report Stage we can spell out how this can be made explicit.</P>

      <P>Before I call Senator Lee, I wish to point out a typing error in amendment No. 24.  &ldquo;Every&rdquo; should have a capital E and there should be a full stop after &ldquo;losses&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 9, paragraph 7 (1), line 32, after &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;every such annual report shall specifically comment on both job creation and job losses&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am new to the procedures of the House. I am grateful that the Minister accepted the principle of this amendment earlier. My amendment still remains, although in a much weaker form, compared with my original amendment.  However, this amendment, if accepted, would be the only reference in the Bill to any criterion of the evaluation of performance.  My amendments states that job creation and job losses should be commented on.  I would have put in stronger phraseology if I had realised the way things would work out, but I meant it to be equated with &ldquo;analyse&rdquo; in a significant rather than a stylistic way.  It is intended to focus the attention of the agencies on net job creation as at least one major criterion, if not the only one, by which their performance should be evaluated.  That is the spirit in which this amendment is intended and I hope the spirit in which it will be interpreted when it is implemented.</P>
      <P>I was reassured to hear the Minister say there will be annual reports from the Department, which will at least refer to some of the matters arising here. Ongoing evaluation of what is happening must be built into this process; to allow things to continue for three years would permit an accumulation of developments which would almost inevitably lead to a defensive posture about what happened. It is much easier to adjust along the line if there is some evaluation even if not as detailed as that intended at three year intervals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume the phrase on page 9 in line 28: &ldquo;shall submit, in such form as the <Col N="1713" /> Minister may direct&rdquo; is standard.  I would like the Minister, although not necessarily today, to ponder carefully what form he may direct, because there are problems confronting the drafters of the annual reports of these agencies.  It was mentioned earlier that Forfás will be detached from Forbairt and the IDA.  Is that realistic?  It will be very difficult for reports that are not effectively synchronised to emerge from these agencies.</P>
    <P>If we look at the functions of Forfás, Forbairt and the IDA there is certainly an overlap between Forfás and the IDA: both are to encourage the development of industry and technology in the State, etc.  The expectation of two different emphases in the reports from these agencies given the close personal relationship that will inevitably exist between them is asking more than can be delivered.</P>
    <P>All the functions of Forfás are really advisory, whereas the others can focus on what they have done in terms of making investments and providing support which are at the core of their activity.  How will Forfás provide a report on advising and encouraging which contributes to understanding what is going on?</P>
    <P>Much thought must go into the form, format and orientation of the Forfás report if it is to add significantly to those of the other two.  If there is to be regular evaluation these reports must have some bite.  If they are fluff they will inevitably lead to suspicion about the adequacy of the agencies' work and that suspicion will effect the Department to a much greater extent than previously when they were perceived as detached.  It is putting it far too dramatically to say that the Minister's reputation is at stake but I believe the manner in which these reports must be presented is an integral part of the process and not simply a formality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the thrust of what the Seantor said.  I imagine for the first year or so the reports will be dominated by commentary as distinct from the factual reportage of the normal matters that are statutorily required.  They will be dominated by the process of establishing <Col N="1714" /> the three bodies as that will be high on their agendas.</P>
      <P>The value of reports &mdash; sine they are required to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; should be to inform the Oireachtas, in a beneficial way, of what they have learned while spending moneys allocated to them by the Oireachtas &mdash; the closing of the loop.  I have no immediate answers to the Senator's queries other than saying he is concerned in saying that we can prescribe the format.  The format should be set out wisely, because there is no point in wasting precious time writing material of little or no value.</P>
      <P>The Senator questioned what Forfás, as distinct from the other two bodies, will write about.  To start at the coalface the other two bodies will describe in the commentary side of their reports their experiences in trying to implement policy in relation to attracting inward investment, promoting new industry or consolidating indigenous industry.  Forfás will, among other things, have to talk about the policy initiatives it looked at, the new areas it started to examine, the research it may have commissioned and the reasons for deciding to go in a particular direction.</P>
      <P>A legitimate matter for concern would be any exploration of a new vein of wealth and job creation and coming to certain conclusions.  A specific example to which we referred earlier is the enormous potential for this country to become the prime centre for telemarketing in a single integrated European market.  We are ahead of everybody else and, as with many ideas, we partly analysed it and partly stumbled upon it.  The IDA is now actively investigating that process and the cost infrastructure required.  A massive reduction in the cost of 1800 number calls into Ireland was a deliberate link to secure our objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA cannot attract that volume of work until the cost structure for 1800 numbers is put in place, but it would never have been able to convince Telecom Éireann to change the cost structure without showing it the substantial market within the integrated EC.  I see the report process evolving in a similar way, but <Col N="1715" /> I am thinking aloud rather than giving specific undertakings to the Senator.</P>
    <P>I repeat that it is my intention that the new Department of Enterprise and Employment will produce an annual report.  I hope &mdash; and I stress the word &ldquo;hope&rdquo;&mdash; that it will be published close to the completion of the Department's first 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 25 is vitally important.  I am disappointed that it is out of order because of a tiny cost constraint.  I proposed a similar amendment to the Roads Bill, 1991, recently and it was accepted in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle behind amendment No. 25 was that right around the world in private enterprise, public stock exchange companies, it is no longer acceptable to report solely on the finances of the past year.  A company is also expected to report on how well it has done its job; to provide a quality audit on how it has performed.  I am not suggesting that this is required every year, but it is in the State's interest to set a standard, it is not sufficient to just balance the books if the service is poor.  It is, therefore, disappointing that the amendment was ruled out of order.  I am confident, however, the Minister will take into account the spirit of what is required.  I believe that in years to come we will look back and ask if there was a time when there were not quality audits alongside financial audits.  I would suggest one every three years as a first step but I believe that in years to come it will not be acceptable to only have financial audits.  To measure any organisation solely on finance will <Col N="1716" /> no longer guarantee the survival of that organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer briefly to what Senator Quinn said.  There is much more merit in his proposal than at first sight.  One of the problems we have faced over the years is that financial reports <i>per se</i> are capable of a varity of things.  Money being invested can appear to be extremely reasonable.  It strikes me, having had a briefing from Deputy Cowen on Aer Lingus, that their financial reports over the last five or six years should have shown a horrific picture but it looked fine on paper.  If we had had quality reports we would have sacked people at the top a long time ago.  There is a great deal of merit in Senator Quinn's suggestion.</P>
      <P>The prohibition on accepting an amendment because it has a cost implication should be examined.  If something has a minor cost and a major benefit why should it be automatically ruled out? That is something which should be examined in the long term.</P>

      <P>I am still learning procedure. I have yet to meet anybody who has learnt all they need to know in this area.  The Bills Office decides whether an amendment is in order; it is not a matter for the sponsoring Minister.</P>
      <P>I accept the thrust of what Senator Quinn is saying on two fronts, the concepts of an energy audit is being brought into the operation of companies &mdash; it is cost related but it is ultimately quality related &mdash; and we have the concept of an environmental impact assessment which is essentially broadening the narrow financial base.  I have said in public, and I will put on the record of this House, that after presenting my third or fourth ISO 9000 award, I began to wonder why we could not start presenting them to Departments or, more to the point why Departments could not earn them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have another idea &mdash; would it not be lovely to present an ISO 9000 award to the maintenance department of Dublin Corporation?  This is an area which has caused a great deal of frustration for <Col N="1717" /> locked in, no choice customers who are not allowed go anywhere else because of a structure of decision making, from the top right down to the shop floor, and where quality and quality of service are the last things that come to mind.  By fortuitous coincidence, within Eolas there is the National Standards Authority of Ireland which has responsibility for, in part, ISO 9000 awards and I am more than open to the concept, not because it seems to be a gimmicky idea but because of the evidence.</P>
    <P>I am currently trying to read the strategic business plan for the year 2010 for the Republic of Singapore where they identify that quality and the provision of quality in services will be a key competitive factor in what will be a global market by that time, if not sooner.  This State is going to have to trade on quality as the Swiss, for example have learned over many years.  The Oireachtas and people who are accountable in it have to start with our own public authorities.  We all know &mdash; certainly any of us who know Dublin's local authorities &mdash; that the quality of service leaves much to be desired.</P>
    <P>We see the integrity of our public service as if it was the norm when right across Europe it is not the norm.  Since the foundation of the State we have been blessed with a non-corrupt public service, with very few exceptions.  One could count the exceptions on the fingers of one hand, unlike what we have seen across the water where there have been single party dominated councils over years and one does not have to go very far in any direction to find that presumption of normality is simply not there.  However, we pay the price for that, and the price is an obsessive concern with the accuracy of figures and a total disregard for the quality of the service.  I would be anxious that in improving the quality of the service we would not lose the commitment at central and local authority levels to integrity in professional terms.  We have been well served in that respect but we do need to move on to the question of quality.</P>
    <P>On a much broader level, I will be trying to introduce the idea of an ISO <Col N="1718" /> 9000 standard for quality of service. There are many ways one could measure it.  How long, for example, does it take to reply to inquiries from the public? How accurate is the information?  If we take it that the citizen is the customer, we can begin to measure quality in that way.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to something I think could potentially cause problems.  It is a drafting matter he might look at between now and when the debate on the Bill is taken in the Dáil.  In the First Schedule, paragraph 4 (1) it says &ldquo;The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, remove a Board member from office&rdquo;.  I am sure the Minister is aware that in the preceding paragraphs the Bill mentions &ldquo;each Board&rdquo; and that in paragraph 5 (1) &ldquo;Forfás and each Agency&rdquo; is mentioned.  There is a potential for confusion here where &ldquo;a Board&rdquo; is mentioned and in paragraph 4 (3) &ldquo;the Board&rdquo; is mentioned.  I take that to mean any of the three boards and that the Minister could remove a member from not just one of the boards, but all three.  It is possible that one could get into a legal quagmire as to which board was involved. It is a small point but it could be significant. It is not something of which I want to make a major issue but it should be examined.</P>
      <P>May I mention the words &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; in that paragraph 4 (4)?  The Minister is to be commended for the fact that there is a marked improvement in this legislation compared to the other legislation to which we referred as they were going through the House.

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following sub-paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Provided that it makes all such appointments either by public open competition or by open competition within Forfás and the Agencies, and provided further that it does not in making any appointment discriminate between candidates on the basis of their age, sex, martial status or sexual orientation.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to signal the obvious.  State bodies should be examplars as equal opportunity employers.  As drafted, it seems that the boards can do whatever they like when employing people.  The intention was presumably to establish the bodies' independence in making their appointments. However, in this day and age, I believe <Col N="1720" /> it is up to Government agencies to meet a proviso such as the one I am proposing to remind State bodies that they should give a lead in the matter of equal opportunities. It is not just a matter of conforming to any general law of the land. Some State bodies such as Aer Rianta are already leaders in this field.  We should bring all State bodies up to the same level as that of Aer Rianta.  If they are seen to give this lead the rest of the country will follow.</P>

      <P>I have no problem with the sense of this amendment and I commend the Senator for highlighting it. However, I wish to say that I am not accepting it for the following reasonable reason which is similar to the reference to the terms and conditions of appointments being agreed by the Minister for Finance. The Employment Equality Act, 1977, prohibits discrimination, including at recruitment, on the grounds of sex or marital status.  It does not cover sexual orientation but we have all moved on since then.</P>
      <P>Legislation is being brought in by my colleague, the Minister for Law Reform and Equality, to cover that point which will apply to every board and area with the same degree of force and clarity.  It is a question of doing it once as an intervention which goes right across the system.  The danger of doing it in this manner is that the wording and the interpretation could be slightly different and could lead to different interpretations.  It is not to say that we do not accept the sense of what is involved but we are going to do it in a different way which will have the same legislative effect.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinn had the legislation on employment equality amended to include age, and the Minister has brought in the question of sexual orientation, so those points are covered. <Col N="1721" /> It is important to note from an equality point of view that the recommendation from the Equal Opportunities Commission in Northern Ireland, and I think from the Employment Equality Agency here in the South which is being examined by the Department of Equality and Law Reform, is that boards, industries, companies and State agencies should adopt and publish an equality statement. This would be part of the operation of an organisation and would apply to all levels of appointment.  This should be encouraged by the Government; it is developing in other European countries and in the North of Ireland where equality has been an issue for a long time.</P>
      <P>The issues raised here are critically important and perhaps they could be dealt with by encouraging the agency to publish an equality statement covering those areas.  There is no doubt that such progressive measures must be implemented in one form or another, if not in the legislation then in a statement of equality by the company or agency.</P>

While the equality legislation will be brought in by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, I have no problems &mdash; because I can give directives in writing to the board &mdash; with requiring as a policy that they would meet the points raised by Senator O'Toole.  All permanent appointments, and also many of the contracts through the agencies, are made on the basis of open competition, <Col N="1722" /> which is the policy.  The two chief executives of the two boards will be appointed by open competition or by competition from those people currently employed by the company.  Therefore, Senator Sherlock's point has been covered.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister says in relation to the latter part of this amendment, that it is all included in the Employment Equality Act, 1977, except for the part dealing with sexual orientation which will be dealt with in forthcoming legislation by the Minister, Deputy Taylor.  I suggest to the Minister that the first part of the amendment, which refers to open competition, provides a real opportunity to put this into legislation.  I think the Minister should at least consider accepting the first part of the amendment as far as the word &ldquo;agencies&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is a danger that not accepting it will be interpreted as another case of jobs for the boys and that lads, or ladies as the case may be, can be thrown into jobs without going through the necessary interview system and open competition which should apply to all State and semi-State jobs.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At structural level, the chief executive of An Bord Tráchtála will be an <i>ex officio</i> member of the board of Forfás.  At local level, at present members of ABT and the IDA share accommodation in some, but not all, of the locations around the country.  We would like to encourage such integration so that it will be a one-stop-shop in the sense that a person can deal with people in relation to developing a product, receiving financial assistance for an industry and marketing in the one building, instead of having to go to different towns in a region or different offices in the same town.  That is a management policy arrangement and we will attempt to have people working together.</P>
      <P>I accept that Senator Sherlock had to be elsewhere but earlier in response to a question posed by Senator Farrelly we discussed the concept of Ireland House abroad, where different agencies ranging from Bord Fáilte, ABT and currently the IDA, are housed under the same roof, share information and support each other.  I will try and ensure that will happen on an informal basis, because it will not be structured.  Hence the reference to the obligation of Forfás to coordinate the activities of the various bodies.  That is the kind of co-ordination which we have in mind.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26a:</P>
      <P>In page 11, lines 14 to 16, to delete paragraph 4 (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to delete paragraph <Col N="1724" /> 4 (1), lines 14 to 16 on page 11, which states that:</P>
    <P>Forfás and either Agency shall not, without the consent of the Minister, disclose any document in its custody or under its control, production of which is sought in relation to any legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>I tabled this amendment because I am extremely concerned that putting this into legislation would be seen as an attempt to thwart the course of justice, particularly preventing the disclosure of documents in relation to legal proceedings. Given the current climate where we have a tribunal and where cases have been taken to the Supreme Court to secure documentation, it would be most unfortunate if this House allowed such a section to go through in this Bill.  It would be most unwise and nobody, whether it is a Minister or anybody else, should be exempt from the full rigours of the courts. While the Minister currently has certain privileges and is exempt in certain circumstances, the Bill should not convey that privilege to a semi-State agency and remove responsibilities from the chairman, chief executive and members of the board.  Legislation that would transfer that responsibility to the Minister would be extremely unwise.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.  It is in the interest of justice and in the interest of the Minister and his Department to ensure that justice is seen to be done equally and that there are no exemptions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. It must be a new departure to include such a proposal in legislation.  As a result of this proposal the Minister of the day is entitled to withhold whatever information he or she may wish in the event of a legal investigation or inquiry. If this legislation is passed the inquiry would thus be pointless as the information required to arrive at a final decision could be withheld.  That is not open government or the way forward. With hindsight an amendment to remove paragraph 4 should also have been proposed. <Col N="1725" /> If this Bill is passed the Minister of the day in any Department may refuse to give information during an investigation thus rendering the investigation useless.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not interpret the section in the same way as Senator Taylor-Quinn and Senator Farrelly.  I would like the Minister to make the interpretation clear.</P>
      <P>My understanding of that paragraph is that somebody involved in court proceedings who seeks information can be denied that information.  I presume such documentation would be subject to discovery by the courts like any other document. The Minister should control documentation within the agencies.  In my own role as chief executive, people often seek documentation in order to proceed with court actions.  I have a rule for such instances: I never make documents available until there is a court order to do so.  Our litigious society encourages that approach.</P>
      <P>I would support Senator Taylor-Quinn's view if the paragraph means that the Government could keep documentation and the courts could not seek discovery.  If that is its intention, I would consider it a negative provision.  My understanding is that it simply makes the Minister the person with the authority to disclose documents and in court proceedings the Minister would be the named person to whom discovery of documentation would be directed.  If it meant anything else I would be worried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This provision was in the 1969 and 1986 legislation.  It is not a standard provision although it has been there for a long time.  Its intent is as Senator O'Toole described it.  The board of the agency is ultimately responsible to the Minister and the Minister is responsible to this House.  If documents are sought for legal purposes &mdash; and legal purposes are referred to specifically &mdash; the Minister ultimately decides whether to comply with the request from the court for documentation.  If the Minister chooses not to comply, and this is subject <Col N="1726" /> to correction, the court may direct that the documents be released.  I suspect that by that time there would be a special notice question on the floor of the other House, if not a motion on the Adjournment here, and Members could question the Minister why a decision was made to refuse to release information.</P>
      <P>That provision is there to protect various people.  It ensures accountability by indicating a line of command in which the Minister ultimately takes the responsibility and is accountable to this House and maybe directly to the court. We are all subject to the law.  I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy with that explanation.  I urge Senator Taylor-Quinn to understand that this is a protection. The Minister, as the political head, is accountable.  Without that provision we could have the unacceptable situation where the board of an agency might refuse to make documentation available and would not be accountable for the decision.  I would have supported Senator Taylor-Quinn if the Minister's explanation had been different.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy with the explanation because, as the Minister said, this is not a standard provision. It is included in previous legislation but it is not in all legislation.  All Ministers do not have this provision written into legislation.  I am concerned that the Minister believes it must be included. He said that if the court directs that documents be released the Minister may decide if he will release them.  This section gives the Minister an immunity from the courts which is not necessarily in the best interest of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen examples of this within the past year in relation to the beef tribunal. The Minister must appreciate this as his party sought the establishment of the tribunal.  I am sure he will agree it is important that every piece of documentation that can be provided should be provided.  This section would hinder any investigation because in the course of court procedures another case can be <Col N="1727" /> taken by the Minister, as a delaying tactic, to seek affirmation of protection under this section.  If the provision is not standard, why include it?  I see no reason for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced by Senator Taylor-Quinn's argument.  The provision derives from existing IDA legislation.  The IDA is engaged in transactions, many of which could be the subject of litigation, for example, people may go to court about the buying and selling of land.  In this area, where there may be demands for the disclosure of documents, it is a protection for the board.  The Minister is immediately accountable in either House of the Oireachtas if he or she refuses to release this documentation.  If this protection is removed from the board, Senators cannot raise the matter on the Adjournment because the Minister would not be accountable in this area; it would be the responsibility of the board.  I have been the victim of this lack of accountability on occasion and I have at times hidden behind it in that I have been able to say the matter was the function of the semi-State body.</P>
      <P>This provision is very clear.  This is documentation sought for legal purposes. Where there is a request to make documentation available the board in question can only do so at the request of the Minister. Most boards would be delighted to send that request to the Minister, and most Ministers would immediately comply with that request.  If the Minister did not, he or she would immediately have to explain why the documents would not be released.</P>
      <P>The Senator's argument has not convinced me.  The democratic responsibility is very clear.  Every Member of this House can publicly question the action of a Minister who has refused to make documents of this nature available.</P>

      <P>This provision is a two-edged sword.  I partly agree with what the Minister is saying but if a tribunal of investigation into matters relating to the <Col N="1728" /> activities of these boards sought a document from the Minister, is the Minister under a legal obligation to produce that document or could he or she refuse?</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's argument that members of local authorities and Members of the Oireachtas should not be on the boards of these agencies because of a potential conflict of interest. The Minister could equally be subjected to the same sort of pressure.  How can he reassure us that those pressures will not impinge upon the decisions provided for in these two paragraphs?</P>

      <P>We have strayed into an area not covered by the Bill and which is not within the competence of this legislation or of the Department.  The answer to the question of whether the Minister can refuse information sought by a tribunal is very simple.  It depends on the powers vested in that tribunal by the authority which establishes it.  There was a classic example of this six months ago when the beef tribunal sought discovery of documentation of Cabinet proceedings. The Government decided that to breach Cabinet confidentiality would be a breach of the Constitution and the Supreme Court was asked to decide on this.  The Minister cannot answer that question tonight.  It is unanswerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel as responsible for this legislation <Col N="1729" /> as anybody else here.  I want the political head to be answerable in this situation.  I have consistently said it is important that the Minister, rather than the board, should have that power.  I do not want the board to hold documentation or to be responsible for disclosure or otherwise of documentation.  I want the elected political head of the Department to be accountable.  I see this as protection.  The political responsibility lies at the top of the tree.</P>

      <P>The whole question of accountability to these Houses has been referred to here.  Unfortunately, matters are often raised on the Adjournment in these Houses where, for various reasons, the Minister gives half baked answers or no answer at all.  The level of accountability is negligible in many instances and, for that reason, all Members must question what the Minister says.  Perhaps the Minister is prepared while he is Minister to give us full detailed and accurate accounts, but he is fully aware of how he is often unable to give full details to the House.  I would like some reassurance from the Minister in this regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1731" /> In page 11, line 21, to insert the following sub-paragraph:</P>
    <P>(1)  In this paragraph, &lsquo;information&rsquo; shall mean confidential information relating to the business of a company receiving support from Forfás or the Agencies.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to cut down to size what I would call the truly draconian measure, paragraph 5, on information disclosure.  As it is currently drafted people would be breaking the law if they gave the telephone number of a colleague.  It would make it illegal for anyone in any of these bodies to make a public speech, to issue a press release or even to write a business letter.  The paragraph is hopelessly overdrawn in terms of scope, and I suggest it is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>In my view, the only kind of information that needs protection by law is the confidential information the bodies may acquire about their clients' business. My amendment restricts the scope of the paragraph to that information.  There may be other ways of restricting the scope of this paragraph, and I am not hung up about the way of doing it, but we cannot leave it as it is at the moment.  There is a whiff, if I may suggest, of the police state about it that is most upsetting.  Our whole thrust should be towards more openness in public administration not less.

We had the famous case of Clive Ponting in the United Kingdom where it could be argued that he was performing a citizen's duty, if in fact he was a citizen but regrettably for him he is a mere subject.  It is not yet a place in which citizens are treated as such in that sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Industrial Development Act, <Col N="1732" /> 1986, the fine was £800, and this was increased to £1,000 in line with the Trade and Marketing Promotion Act, 1991.  The intent is, quite clearly, confidential information, and I know that Senator Quinn is not disputing that.  The point is where do you draw the line?  I have been formally advised on this in writing by the IDA because it was consulted in this matter and was anxious that there would not be any change.  Senator Quinn's suggestion that a board member could not even disclose a telephone number is dealt with in paragraph 5 (3) which states:</P>
    <P>Nothing in subparagraph (1) shall prevent&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  disclosure of information in a report made to Forfás or either Agency (or on behalf of Forfás or either Agency) to the Minister</P>
    <P>(b)  disclosure of information by Forfás or either Agency or by a member of Forfás or either Agency or of any committee or other body established under this Act for the purpose of a scheme of research and development or a scheme of acquisition of product and process technology.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>A distinction is being made about different kinds of information.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to accept the amendment.  I do not have that authority because I would have to go back and consult with my Cabinet colleagues on it. I am concerned about the &ldquo;whiff of the police state&rdquo; Senator Quinn referred to, and I will look at it without any commitment whatsoever about coming back to this House.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any prosecution that has taken place or difficulty that has arisen in relation to it.  I take the point the Senator is making and I will consult with the relevant Ministers and the IDA and, if needs be; I will come back to the Seanad.  However, I would be misleading you if I did not say that that is most unlikely.  I take the points that have been made but the Bill will stay as it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is surely an error. <Col N="1733" /> There is no doubt that paragraph 5 (3) to which the Minister referred does not deal with casual information.  The legislation is specific, and I challenge the people in the IDA who say otherwise.  Paragraph 5 (1) states that: &ldquo;Subject to subparagraph (3), a person shall not disclose any information...&rdquo;. There is no qualification on the word &ldquo;information&rdquo; except that outlined in subparagraph (3).  Sub-paragraph (2) is specific and says that: &ldquo;A person who contravenes sub-paragraph (1) shall be guilty of an offence ...&rdquo;.  The legislation we are about to pass says that &mdash; to take a ridiculous example &mdash; a person would be guilty of an offence if they give out the telephone number of a company they learned while acting as a member of the board.  I am not saying anybody will be pursued for that, but any legislation which is either unenforceable or will not be enforced is bad legislation.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding any information received by the IDA, surely a concession could be made by inserting the qualification &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;information&rdquo; in Senator Quinn's amendment.  Then at least somebody would have to interpret the word &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; in court.  That is the easiest way to deal with it.  This issue has been dealt with by other organisations in many ways, the normal way being that at the end of each meeting the board would determine what information was confidential. That procedure is written into the rules and regulations of primary school boards of management.  It is something about which I have a lot of information and it works adequately.  Under those rules someone can be dismissed from board membership for disclosing confidential information and it is up to the board to decide what is and is not confidential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A gesture should be made which would not change the advice given by the IDA and other people to the Minister by simply putting &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;information&rdquo;.  Then at least somebody <Col N="1734" /> would have to interpret what &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; meant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the point.  I have been advised that it would be difficult for the courts to determine what constitutes confidentiality.  That is the problem.  All I can say is that I note, understand and share the legitimate concerns expressed.  I will look at this again and if we can find a formula and can get it debated and out of this House quickly, then I will do so.</P>
      <P>With respect to the boards of management of national schools, they are not dealing with the same level of confidentiality or sensitive material.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a point on paragraph 2 (5), covering the situation following the election of a person to the Oireachtas or the European Parliament, which states:</P>
      <P>...that person shall thereupon stand seconded from the employment of Forfás and shall not be paid by, or be entitled to receive from, Forfás, any remuneration or allowances in respect of the period commencing...</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister's assurance that that would not include arrangements for a person to continue to pay into a pension fund of either agency.  I ask the Minister to assure me the phrase &ldquo;remuneration and allowances&rdquo; has nothing to do with superannuation arrangements dealt with in the paragraphs following.</P>

      <P>There are five Government amendments.  They will be dealt with in four debates.  Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 will be discussed together. Senators may speak only once on Report Stage on each debate.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 4 to 13 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>7.&mdash;The functions of Forbairt shall be, as an agency of Forfás&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to develop industry in the State,</P>
      <P>(b)  to strengthen the technological base and the capacity of industry to innovate.</P>
      <P>(c)  to provide services which support such development,</P>
      <P>(d)  to make investments in and provide supports to industrial undertakings which comply with the requirements of the enactments for the time being in force, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e)  to carry out such other functions as may from time to time be <Col N="1736" /> assigned to it by Forfás with the consent of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a textual improvement suggested by Senator O'Toole.  Section 7 has been redrafted and a new section substituted.  It states more clearly the functions of Forbairt as an agency of Forfás.  I understand there have been consultations with the Seanad about this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment says the function of Forbairt as an agency of Forfás shall be to develop industry within the State.  What relationship, if any, will exist between the enterprise boards and Forbairt?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A structural relationship will exist between Forbairt and the county enterprise boards in that a representative of Forbairt will be on the evaluation committee set up by each county enterprise board.  The representative will know and understand the structure and nature of grants and will be able to advise where projects could be better dealt with by Forbairt at local level rather than the county enterprise board. Therefore, there is a structured relationship between Forbairt and the county enterprise board in a specific person. There will be working co-operation also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County managers will have received correspondence from me on the composition of the evaluation committee of the county enterprise boards.  That will be separate from the membership of the board itself which will comprise 12 people.  The five person evaluation committee will have a representative each from Forbairt, the banks, the accountancy profession and the business community and another to be decided by the <Col N="1737" /> county enterprise board.  The board will nominate all the members but they will be chosen as representatives.  Therefore, there will be a Forbairt representative at that level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What size of grant aid will be available to businesses and what size will the business have to be?  Will there be a maximum amount that can be allocated to an industry?  Will the business that is benefiting be allowed employ up to, say, five people?  What is the cutoff point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements have not been finalised but I will tell the Senator what has been decided.  Forbairt can only deal with proposals for job creation within the remit of IDA legislation, that is, manufacturing related activities and internationally traded services. We have suggested any project proposing to employ ten persons or more in that category be dealt with by Forbairt. Any project in that sector with an employment threshold of less than ten could be funded by the county enterprise boards.  At present the IDA does not deal with small-scale operations.  The figure is an arbitrary one.  We will have to see if it works but I think it will.</P>
      <P>The county enterprise boards will be entitled to deal with many other types of projects currently ineligible for grant assistance from the IDA.  Those would be in tourism, services and service provision. The boards will have to make their own decisions about grant-aiding such projects on the basis they do not displace existing ones.  We must remember that taxpayers' money is involved.  If there are two barber's shops in a town and someone proposes to set up another using taxpayers' money that would not make sense.  The question of displacement would have to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No decision has been taken as to the amount of grant a county enterprise board could give to an individual project. A certain amount of money is available <Col N="1738" /> for all the boards and that will be divided on a <i>pro rata</i> basis or using some set of objective criteria.  It will then be up to the boards to make their own decisions. It is unlikely a board would give all its money to one project.</P>

    <P>The moneys currently being distributed through the operational programmes remain the responsibility of the relevant Ministers; in the agricultural <Col N="1739" /> context that is the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.

      <P>As a member of a local CERT committee which has dealt with the IDA for some time, I can testify that there is already a multiplicity of schemes.

      <P>(1)  The functions of Forfás shall be&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to advise the Minister on matters relating to the development of industry in the State,</P>
      <P>(b)  to advise on the development and co-ordination of policy for Forbairt, IDA, An Bord Tráchtála and such other bodies as the Minister may designate...</P>
      <P>(2)  Forfás and each Agency shall comply with such general directives relating to the policy to be followed by it in the exercise of its functions as may be given by the Minister.</P>
      <P>As An Bord Tráchtála is under the aegis of the Minister for Tourism and Trade, which Minister will be responsible for it under section 6 of the Bill?</P>

    <P>Part II, Section 6 (1) (b) states: &ldquo;to <Col N="1742" /> advise on the development and co-ordi nation of policy for Forbairt, IDA, An Bord Tráchtála and such other bodies...&rdquo;.  This provides the legal framework to ensure that the body accountable to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, and through the Minister to this House has the legal power to co-ordinate policy between An Bord Tráchtála and the agencies as set out in this legislation.  Notwithstanding this, the board of An Bord Tráchtála is appointed by the Minister for Tourism and Trade and is accountable to that Minister for the purposes of Estimates and the disbursal of moneys.</P>
    <P>The intention of this is to ensure co-ordination of policy.  For example, the board of Forfás could direct that a given policy of An Bord Tráchtála be co-ordinated with other policies being pursued.</P>

The first is that there is such a level of comfort and sophistication with the first official language that it is possible to make a play on words from two languages and have an unambiguous pronunciation in the word &ldquo;Forfás&rdquo;.  The second is to take a strictly lingual approach.  In this respect I am advised by the chief translator of this House that it is grammatically incorrect to use the word &ldquo;Forfás&rdquo;.  The correct Gaelic word is &ldquo;Forfhas&rdquo; which would be equivalent to the word &ldquo;forás&rdquo;. However, in the interests of ease of use it was decided to maintain the word &ldquo;Forfás&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I wish to put on record my thanks to the Members of this House for their co-operation. I attempted to reciprocate in accepting as many amendments as possible and being as forthcoming as possible in those areas where I was unable to accept amendments.  Normally the conventions of this House prevent us from doing so, but I wish to say that the legislation would not have been possible had it not been for the extraordinary dedication of three people in my Department, the Assistant Secretary Mr. Michael McKenna, Principal Officer, Mr. Paul Cullen and Assistant Principal Mr. Ned Costello.</P>

      <P>On behalf of this side of the House and on my own behalf, I thank the Minster for the way he has dealt with this debate and for introducing the legislation in this House.  I must say to the Minister, without being condescending, that he has shown a refreshing attitude by engaging in meaningful debate rather than simply going through the motions of accepting or rejecting amendments.  My woe at not being able to attend the opening of the Newbridge bypass this afternoon was compounded by his inability to <Col N="1745" /> accept any of my amendments, and it was further compounded by his ability to accept amendments from other Members of the House.  I hope this legislation will improve the atmosphere for enterprise and lead to extra jobs.  I thank the Minister for having attended so diligently during the debate.</P>

      <P>I support the comments made.  One of the criteria for ministerial office should be service in the Seanad. This would ensure co-operation of the kind the Minister, Deputy R. Quinn, has shown since this Government was formed.  I thank him on behalf of my colleagues for initiating the Bill in the Seanad and for the open manner in which he met the arguments put forward, as is his style.  I also like the idea that the &ldquo;faceless&rdquo; civil servants are named when they perform such a service for the State, and we recognise their abilities.  We spoke earlier about the quality of the public service and it is good to acknowledge that in this House.  When we had a debate on the meaning of Forfás I noticed that Senator Lee did not intervene, I suppose that was based on the mistake earlier this evening.  It shows how humble Cork professors are.</P>

I have not been thanking Ministers for initiating legislation in this House because we should not have to do that.  I hope Ministers would initiate legislation here on a regular basis.  There is no reason they should not do so rather than wait for the Dáil to finish the debate.  We are part of the Oireachtas and legislation should be coming on stream here as in the Dáil.  The Leader of the House has at all times been trying to ensure that we are kept as busy as possible.  As a former Member of this House the Minister respects it more than others who were not <Col N="1746" /> Members of this House; perhaps there is a lesson there.  If we have achieved nothing else perhaps we have made other Ministers aware that if they initiate legislation here, they might not have to spend as much time in the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  I welcome the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, to the House.  I wanted to give the Minister an opportunity to speak on this matter since there was widespread reporting of it in the newspapers and the Minister should have an opportunity to address the criticisms that may have been inherent in what was reported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The examination papers for the leaving certificate and the conduct of the examinations have always been of a high standard and this year is no exception.  The Department of Education has done a good job, as it always does.  Human nature being what it is we can expect that <Col N="1747" /> there will be an occasional error, and there were not many this year.  There were, however, a few that were brought to my attention.</P>
    <P>I want to detail those to the Minister and I suggest that, in the interests of maintaining the status of the leaving certificate, it is important that she makes a statement to assuage the fears of students and, perhaps more so, the fears of parents. In many cases the parents are more uptight at leaving certificate time than the students.  We must ensure that people understand fully what is involved, how corrections are carried out, and that the Department will take these issues into account and ensure that all students get value in the examination, despite having made a mess as a result of an error in the question.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business yesterday the Cathaoirleach refused to do question 4 (a) on the maths paper when I asked him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite right too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he was right as we did not have a blackboard or chalk and it would have taken too much time to organise it.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the error in question 4 (a).  It is quite minor but having talked to some students I know it confused them.  Question 4 (a) is central to the mathematics of algebra and involves graphing a function, which is defined and students were asked to complete a table.  The person who set the question was very kind because he or she produced quite a large part of the table and gave the students directions as to how they should proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The X values are given as -3, -2, -1, 0, 1 and 1.5 and the function values with one exception are blank.  It is a pity there was an error in the calculation used to arrive at the functional value of X = 1.5 but humans make errors and one can understand how it happened.  Instead of the correct value of 8.125, 7.825 appears as the function value at 1.5.  Many <Col N="1748" /> students would not have noticed it because all they had to do was to fill in the blanks and get the function values at -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, using 7.825.  The graph would have been a little uneven at that stage and some students would have been perceptive enough to realise that the smoothness was missing and that something was wrong.  It might have confused them because they would have calculated the correct value for 1.5 and then wondered whether their calculations for the rest of the points were correct.  It could have destabilised them and I know that because I used to be a maths teacher.</P>
    <P>It is very serious because, in the heat of an examination, if a student discovers this kind of thing it can be very disturbing. The Minister knows exactly what I mean because her background gives her insight into this matter.  I am suggesting to the Minister that there could have been difficulties.  It could have upset students, not just on that question but possibly in relation to the rest of the paper.  The Minister has the ability to deal with this through her Department without creating any fuss and to ensure that students get the marks they deserve.  I am sure that will happen but I want the Minister to make a statement to that effect in the House because newspapers carried stories suggesting that students were hard done by and would not receive their correct results.  That was the first mistake that came to my attention.</P>
    <P>Another matter also came to my notice which was not really an error.  It concerned the Irish paper, I do not know if the Minister was made aware of it as I imagine many people did not view it as an error.  The word &ldquo;corn&rdquo;&mdash; which we are used to because we play for corns &mdash; cups &mdash; in football matches appeared as if it was &ldquo;com&rdquo; because of the lettering. However, I do not think many students who looked at the context of the word would have taken it to be &ldquo;com&rdquo;.  It was mentioned five times in a paragraph and students would have realised it was &ldquo;corn&rdquo;.  It was not a serious error.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1749" /> However, the matter of the French aural test disturbs me.  It is hard to control because during the course of the aural test in French the tape is produced, the machine turned on and the students listen to it.  The Minister has no control over the quality of the machine.  Some schools have more money than others, in some cases they have wonderful machinery but in other cases they have old, basic machines.  I have received reports that some schools had difficulty in hearing the tape, perhaps because the acoustics in a room were not good or for other reasons. I am sure the Minister is already aware of the difficulty but I would like her to examine the situation for next year and see if there is a way to ensure the equality of the aural test for all students.  I do not know how that could be achieved.  One might have to check the acoustics of every room but perhaps the machinery could be standardised.</P>
    <P>I have been told by some people who supervised examinations in the past that rooms in big schools are often like studios.  The machinery is set up in such a way that even if the tape is of poor quality, everybody can hear it perfectly. In other classrooms it is set up centrally but because the quality of the machine is poor, there is a difficulty.  There is inequality in that system.  I do not know how the Minister will handle it but I want her to be aware of it and perhaps examine how it can be resolved.</P>
    <P>There was another problem with the French paper regarding a question about an individual in a comprehension piece where the individual's name was not mentioned.  It would have confused students.  I asked a French teacher today for her opinion and she said people who were sharp might have picked it up but that it might have confused them.  It asked a question about Henri although he had not been mentioned in the original piece.  I know the Minister will deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister make a statement which, if she wishes, can be given to the <Col N="1750" /> press?  This will clearly signal to people that there were a few minor errors but the Department will deal with them and students will get full value for their leaving certificates as they have done in the past.  The Minister, her Department and all of us can be proud of the fact that the leaving certificate is a very well run examination.  The papers and their content are always of a very high standard. I am not attempting to question the way the examination was handled.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Cotter for giving me this opportunity to respond to the hiccups he described.  Of course such errors should not occur but human beings are fallible.  The Senator mentioned &ldquo;corn&rdquo;, I was not aware of that but I was aware of the problems in the maths paper and in the French examination regarding Henri.  By raising this matter the Senator has allowed me an opportunity to respond to it and to reassure students who did the examinations that the Minister and the Department will ensure that those sort of errors, which are ultimately the responsibility of the Department, will not militate against them.</P>
      <P>It is interesting what one finds out when somebody puts down a question like this.  The work of setting the questions papers takes months from draft stage to final printing.  The draft is carefully checked in the first place to see that the questions are a fair test of the candidates' knowledge of the course.  In the case of the leaving certificate the draft is also examined by the nominees of the Universities.</P>

      <P>Following this consideration, the draft is amended where necessary and passed for press.  Before approval for printing is given, the proofs of the drafts paper will have been read at least twice and in many cases three times. Following printing, the final printed version <Col N="1751" /> of the paper is further scrutinised. Any errors which come to light at this stage are included in a list given to superintendents for reading to the candidates concerned prior to the start of the relevant examination.</P>
      <P>A total of 336 separate question papers, including Irish versions, must be printed for the purposes of all levels of the leaving and junior certificate examinations. Notwithstanding the great care taken at all stages of the process a very small number of errors persisted uncorrected through to the final paper.  It is a matter of great regret.  I feared there would be a mistake in the mathematics paper and I did not want to be proved correct.  The brighter student would probably have noticed the uneven proportions of the graph in the question while the weaker one may have taken it at face value.</P>
      <P>I know some students were upset but excessive publicty is not helpful.  They should take one day at a time and treat each exam in its own right &mdash; I said this before.  I assure Senator Cotter and particularly the students sitting the examinations that, where an error comes to light, examiners will be notified of the difficulties experienced by candidates and account of these difficulties will be taken in the marking.  The Department of Education sets examinations to test what the candidate knows, rather than what they do not know, but this is easy for an adult to say.  I wish to thank this House for letting me make these points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>What I propose fully respects the intellectual property of artists in the music industry and I am not concerned with breaches of copyright here.  The European music industry is trying to force the EC to impose a new tax on blank audio and video cassettes and other forms of recording such as DATs and compact discs, this proposal is before the EC at the moment.  I feel that I am pushing an open door with the Government because the previous Administration was positive in its opposition to this measure, but I am seeking reassurance tonight that this Government will continue in the same vein.</P>
      <P>There should be exemption from this tax for the blind and partially sighted and for students requiring cassettes, not only for normal communications, but also for education.  It would be an unprecedented European tax on education at all levels; students, boards, schools and teachers use cassettes all the time.  Educational broadcasting available in this country, with some minor exceptions, comes from the BBC and ITV and they have an agreement with schools which allows them to copy from their broadcasts, provided they do not retain them for longer than five years in the school.  However, if this levy is enacted, it would be grossly unfair in the normal operation of taping.  I have a compact disc player at home but not in my car&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is regrettable. This would, in effect, tax those who wish to copy the material on a compact disc they have bought for the purposes of playing it in a car.  It would also be an unfair and unwarranted imposition on education.  It would penalise those whose use of tapes does not infringe copyright &mdash; I want to make this clear because there was a debate on that matter in this House <Col N="1753" /> recently, and I supported the idea of artists being paid a proper amount for their work.  My argument does not conflict with that line.</P>
      <P>Surveys on the levels of off-air taping and recording for home use have made it clear that, despite what the European music industry says &mdash; I hope Senator Cassidy will confirm this &mdash; sales of compact discs have blossomed over the last ten years.  I have figures that prove that, rather than being harmed by home taping, the recording industry has gone from strength to strength.</P>
      <P>World album sales, including vinyl and compact discs, have increased from 1.6 billion units in 1981 to almost double that figure in 1988 and European album sales increased by 36 per cent, from 1986 to 1990; the compact disc market has grown by 400 per cent.  Even though technology makes home taping easier than ever, it has encouraged rather then impeded sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister raise this issue with the EC Commission to ensure it does not implement the draft proposal brought to them in December 1992?  The record of the previous Government has been impeccable in this regard and there is no reason this Government should be different.  These proposals are totally unacceptable but I recognise that, although a number of EC member states are opposed to them, there is a <i>laissezfaire</i> attitude in others &mdash; the Netherlands have already introduced such a levy &mdash; and it may be introduced through the back door.  It will be a tax on education and on those who wish to use blank audio or video cassettes.  It should be condemned and it should also be raised at the Council of Ministers &mdash; I ask the Minister to do this &mdash; and in the European Parliament.  We should use our influence to ensure that this measure is not put into operation.  We should condemn the proposal, urge the EC Commission to withdraw it, oppose the principle of levies, draw attention to the extensive use of tapes in education and <Col N="1754" /> stress that huge educational programmes depend on this.  It will become more important when RTE introduces Teilifís Scoile on a wider scale in the next couple of years.  This is not in conflict with artists' rights but is being pushed by the music industry at a time &mdash; I am sure Senator Cassidy will support me on this &mdash; when we are paying considerable sums of money for recorded music.  Compact discs cost more in Europe than anywhere else.</P>
    <P>It is an industry which has a monopoly and it is important that the authorities prevent further levies.  I ask the Minister to ensure that this matter is raised with the EC Commission, the Council of Ministers and at the European Parliament and that the Government will prevent the implementation of this draft directive.</P>

      <P>I would support Senator O'Toole's views on education but this matter relates to the music industry. There is wholesale pirating taking place and sales of blank tapes in relation to the pre-recorded and duplicated product is approximately 7:1, and this figure continues to increase.  The manufacture of vinyl records is on the decline.  I do not know any shop which sells vinyl records, and I do not know where Senator O'Toole obtained the figures he mentioned. In 1988 the number of CDs sold did not even reach 100,000.  It is easy to have growth of 400 per cent in this area given the quality of CDs.  There is a need to protect jobs in this area, particularly those of Irish artists and musicians.</P>
      <P>However, the industry faces this difficulty: how do you impose a levy on those duplicating and buying blank tapes and, at the same time, protect the spoken word in the education system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decline in sales is affecting writers, <Col N="1755" /> artists and publishers.  This is the view of those involved in the music industry, including artists, publishers, writers, and record companies who receive their profit margins, regardless.  The Irish Government and other EC Governments face difficulties in attempting to prevent this massive duplication.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether to reply or to sing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious matter and I want to put on the record a considered note that has been prepared by the Patents Office which is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Enterprise and Employment. <Col N="1756" /> The EC Commission has for some time been examining the question of a directive on home copying of audio and video tapes.  The Commission has a major work programme on copyright which has the objective of harmonising the laws of member states in order to achieve the proper function of the Internal Market in the area of copyright.  A number of EC countries have, or propose to have, a levy on blank tapes and recording equipment and the Commission is considering whether a harmonisation measure is appropriate.  A levy, in such circumstances, is designed to fund cultural activities in those countries.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, the power of initiative in these matters rests with the Commission but it has not to date proposed such a directive.  If it does, any such proposal will be considered on its merits by the Council of Ministers and I will take into account the points made here tonight.  It should be clear, however, the legal basis for such a directive would include Article 100 (A) of the EC Treaty which provides for the adoption of measures by qualified majority voting. No country on its own can block an EC measure of this nature, a qualified majority of members would be required. If we were opposed to it we would need a sufficient number of allies to prevent it from being endorsed.  If the Commission were to make such proposals, I would examine them with an open mind but I remain to be convinced on the merits of such a levy.</P>
    <P>I accept that home copying of sound recordings may result in a loss of sales on recordings to some extent.  However, sales may also benefit from home copying. An individual may, for example, buy a CD and tape a copy for use in their car.  This greater utility of the CD may increase sales.  However, many blank audio tapes are only used for non-copying purposes, to record home or local events or to send messages.  I am concerned that tapes used by the blind should not be subject to this levy.</P>

      <P>In the case of video tapes, my information is that the greatest use for such tapes is for time shifting of television programmes; in other words, people record their favourite programme while absent from home or viewing another channel.  Home copying of videos and any unfair loss of the video industry does not appear to be significant.</P>
      <P>We have high standards of copyright protection and are party to the most important copyright conventions and we are committed, under recent EC measures, to further extend and improve that protection.  Composers, songwriters, performing artists, producers and others involved in the music industry should receive a just return for their efforts.  We can be proud of the success of Irish artists and that the international remuneration they receive is underpinned by the copyright laws of other countries.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the losses to such right owners arising from the unfair copying of their recordings.  This problem has been changed radically by the development of new digital recording and reproduction technology.  This allows for a serial recording of great clarity which is not lost on repeated copies.  The best way to tackle this problem is to prohibit serial recordings by technical means.  These technical systems have already been developed and while they allow a first generation digital copy of a recording, that copy cannot be further recorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue of home copying will be discussed later this year at the World Intellectual Property Organisation, the UN agency which deals with international treaties in this area.  Proposals have been made by that organisation for a new international agreement on the protection of the rights of performers and producers of phonograms.  The Irish delegation at that <Col N="1758" /> meeting will take part in a detailed examination of all the issues involved.  The results of that international discussion will be of considerable assistance in assessing all the implications which arise.</P>
    <P>The losses caused to the music and film industry from copying derive in a considerable part from the illegal piracy of recordings and videos on a commercial scale.  Our priority for action should be in this area and that we should not too easily accept the need for additional payments by the law abiding consumer.</P>
    <P>New enforcement measures against piracy are also included in the proposed new international agreement and are part of the current discussions in the Uruguay Round of the GATT.  I intend to ensure that we support such measures in the relevant international discussions.</P>
    <P>Shortly, I will carry out a comprehensive review of the Copyright Act, 1963, and I intend to include in the new legislation increased anti-piracy measures and tougher penalties for commercial infringers.  In short, I intend to focus on the criminal rather than the consumer.</P>
    <P>The general principles of international law in respect of copying are that it must not conflict with the normal exploitation of the work and it must not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right owners.  Home copying does not infringe the first criteria.  In respect of the second criterion, we should concentrate initially on technical means to limit excessive and repeated copying of recordings.  I will examine ways in which we can reinforce this by legislation.</P>
    <P>I intend to pursue a fair and equitable solution to the issues which are now made more urgent by rapidly changing digital technology.  I am under no illusion, however, about the complexity of the legal, economic, technical and international problems which must be carefully assessed and dealt with.  I am also aware of the problems which have been raised in this House of the collection of performance rights and the repatriation <Col N="1759" /> to the UK of moneys so collected and not necessarily passed on to Irish artists and performers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1760" /> The Seanad adjourned at 10.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 17 June 1992.</P>
