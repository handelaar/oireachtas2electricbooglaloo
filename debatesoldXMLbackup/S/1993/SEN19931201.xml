      <P>I have notice from Senator McDonagh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide funds through the regional co-ordinating committee with flexibility to allow the John Paul Centre in Galway and other such centres in Galway city and county to develop urgently needed additional services.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGowan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide funding for an extension to St. Columba's College, Stranorlar, County Donegal, which was built for 500 students but now has 1,200 in very overcrowded conditions.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Maloney of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> The need for the Minister for Education to carry out an investigation into the administration of Letterkenny regional technical college, County Donegal, and if she is satisfied that the affairs of the college are in order.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators McDonagh and McGowan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule the matter raised by Senator Maloney as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment as it relates to a matter that is <i>sub judice.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business will be Item 1, Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Bill, 1993, taking all Stages today.  We will take Item 1 until 6 p.m. and after 8 p.m. we will conclude the Bill.  We will take Item 34 from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m.  The Adjournment Matters will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree to facilitate the Government on Item 1.  I suggest that there be a short break between Second and Committee Stages because there may be a number of amendments tabled. There will be no need for a guillotine on this measure, I think it will go through in the time available.</P>
      <P>When is it proposed to take Item 8 again &mdash; statements on Northern Ireland? He will be aware a number of people on both sides would like to contribute.  As I said last week, it is not necessary for the Tánaiste to be present for the debate to go ahead, although it would be desirable.</P>
      <P>Since there are three full weeks until the end of the session, perhaps the Leader could give us his programme for legislation today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>At present major discussions are taking place about the good value or otherwise given by the public service to the State.  It would be appropriate to discuss this matter in the House <Col N="939" /> before Christmas.  I ask for a debate on that wide issue.</P>
      <P>On a related matter, I have distributed a survey on the state of school buildings in Ireland.  People at primary, post-primary and third levels have complained about this.  The fabric of the places of learning is disgraceful.  We need to examine this matter seriously and to ask how we can invest in the future if we are educating people in decrepit and shabby buildings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of Item 1, I note the Leader has not mentioned a time to conclude the debate on the Bill this evening.  I accept it is likely to be disposed of easily but I assume we will not be in the Seanad Chamber overnight, which could be taken from the way he ordered business.</P>
      <P>Last week we agreed to the Order of Business on the basis that the Northern Ireland debate would be resumed at an early date.  Given the balanced and constructive manner in which that debate was conducted, it would be desirable if we could return to it at an early date. Given the way that debate was conducted last week and its balanced and constructive manner, it would be desirable for us to return to it at an early stage; if not tomorrow, then next week.  We have something to contribute that may be of help and I am sure the Leader will accept that.</P>
      <P>I understood from a radio programme today &mdash; I may be wrong &mdash; that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy M. Higgins, has plans to raise Armada wrecks.  Is this where he proposes to find the money that is missing from the Structural Funds?</P>

      <P>Would the Leader of the House raise with the Minister for Justice the activities of certain illegal furniture dealers who have been organising sales in various areas?  Apparently, they are English based, but they have defrauded many in my constituency out of thousands of pounds.  This matter must be dealt with as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the House to express its support and solidarity with the Taoiseach in his negotiations with the British Prime Minister?  We are all looking forward to successful negotiations and it is important to give him our support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Leader that it was in this House that we had the first debate on AIDS.  Since today is World AIDS Day, it should be marked in some way.  I have not put anything on the Order Paper because the two debates on AIDS we had so far have come as a result of motions I put down and it is inappropriate that only I should be raising this issue.  I would welcome interest from the Government side being expressed in this area particularly at this time, so that we could pay tribute to the wonderful work done by voluntary organisations such as Aidswise and Comfort AIDS.  On this day, it is important that we at least mention it because we are still at a point where the spread of the infection in this country can be contained if we are wise enough and if we <Col N="941" /> put the resources and energy into it.  I ask the Leader if he will consider providing time, as soon as possible, for a non-controversial discussion on this matter, with the intention of being helpful to the Government.</P>
      <P>May I join with Senator Manning in his further calls for a continuing debate on the North of Ireland.  I know we have had discussions in this area, but matters are moving so rapidly that it would be appropriate that we continue to examine and highlight these issues.  We should welcome the historic advances being made partly, I believe, as a result of the galvanising of both parties by a series of leaks.  It was only a short while ago when we were told there would be a period of five to ten years before Sinn Féin or the IRA could be included in negotiations; this has been reduced to two and a half months.  This is their opportunity.  We should be in a position to appeal to the IRA, now that they have a real chance. They have what they were looking for; let them take it.  There should not be one further bullet or bomb.  I am delighted that the British Government, and possibly the Irish Government, had contacts with these groups.  I hope they have further contacts with those on the other side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to a comment made by Senator Dardis, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has evolved a project involving the Greek and Spanish Governments which will not cost the State a penny and will be probably one of the most exciting tourist developments in the history of our country. I suggest that Senator Dardis wait before he jumps in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second and more serious matter relates to a point I raised in this House when Senator Neville put forward the Suicide Bill.  I said I deplored the fact that we could not accept it because of precedent in the House, and the reluctance of all Governments to accept necessary, important and welcome legislation from the Opposition benches.  I was glad to note in the Dáil last night that a Second Reading of Deputy Shatter's Bill was accepted by the Government and will be <Col N="942" /> debated in Committee.  I sincerely hope that we will be more adult in the new series of Dáil reforms and that we will accept legislation not only from the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not make any apology for underlining the request to discuss Northern Ireland again as soon as possible. I found last week's two hours moving almost to the point of tears if only because not a word was said with which even the most hardline unionist could find fault.  I found sympathy and an understanding for the unionist and Protestant tradition in Northern Ireland in every word that was said in this House. Another hour or two's debate as soon as possible on a situation that is changing day to day could only be for good.</P>

    <Title>Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Bill, 1993: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I am taking this Bill for the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy O'Sullivan, who is unwell.  I know the House will join with me in wishing him a speedy recovery to full health.</P>
      <P>In June 1990 the Government authorised the Minister for Foreign Affairs to arrange for signature, subject to ratification, of the International Convention on Salvage, 1989.  This required that new domestic legislation be enacted to give effect to the convention.  This offered an ideal opportunity to carry out a thorough review of existing legislation in respect of salvage and wreck and to address, in particular, the question of the removal of wrecks which constitute an obstruction to navigation or a blight on the environment. It was also decided to avail of the opportunity to strengthen and formalise the powers and duties of persons authorised to take charge of attempts to rescue vessels in distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Marine casualties in Community waters in recent years culminating in the <i>Braer</i> incident off the Scottish coast last January provided the impetus for the European Community to identify and act on measures to minimise the risk of further such catastrophes and resultant ecological damage.  The Commission document, <i>A Common Policy on Safe Seas</i>, lays down the policy objectives for the elimination of substandard vessels, operators and crew from Community waters.  A number of measures were targeted for priority action when the Council of Transport Ministers endorsed these <Col N="946" /> objectives last June.  I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, because he has done a lot to strengthen resolve of the European Union in that area.</P>
    <P>Priority measures include setting up a ship traffic control system at Community and national level; the creation of environmentally senstive areas from which high-risk shipping must be excluded; the need for shipowners to contribute to the costs of management, prevention and intervention where accidents occur; more intensive port State control inspections of foreign ships entering Community ports; comprehensive reporting systems for ships carrying dangerous or polluting goods into or out of Community ports as well as transiting along European coasts.</P>
    <P>Ireland is actively involved in the Community work programmes to translate these measures as quickly as possible into concrete action.  I welcome this Community action to minimise the risks of marine pollution and to improve safety. Ireland has already taken steps to improve its capability in this regard. Slanú, the Irish Marine Emergency Service, or IMES, was established by the Government as a division of the Department of the Marine in May 1991 with responsibility for the operational control and co-ordination of all types of marine emergency response, including search and rescue, sea and coastal pollution, shipwreck and casualty response.  The establishment of IMES reflects the Government's commitment to provide the necessary resources to ensure, in so far as it is possible, the safety of life at sea.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a new statutory framework for dealing with marine emergencies and their aftermath.  Marine casualties can have three phases: a ship can be in danger or distress due to a technical failure or heavy weather; the ship is subsequently wrecked, abandoned or stranded; and the ensuing wreck may pose a threat to navigation, public health or the environment.  The Bill fundamentally strengtens the powers of relevant authorities in these situations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="947" /> A number of the provisions in this Bill are designed to enable the Irish Marine Emergency Service to discharge its functions even more effectively.  Part II enables the Minister for the Marine to appoint authorised officers, who will normally be drawn from IMES, to save lives and to assist vessels in distress.  The authorised officer is given a general power to take such steps as he or she thinks fit to save the lives of persons on board the vessel at risk, the vessel itself and its cargo which, together with the specific powers proposed, will ensure flexibility and prompt response in order to deal with the specific circumstances of unpredictable emergencies as they arise.  The specific powers available include the requisition of vehicles, ships and aircraft, the use of adjoining lands and the enlisting of relevant persons to assist with the rescue operation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of the use of existing or adjoining lands, it is interesting to note that an amendment moved by Deputy Barrett in the Lower House was accepted and, for the first time, precludes the owner of the land from any liability for anybody coming onto the land, except where there was malicious intent on the part of the owner in relation to that individual.  That is an interesting development which I would like to think would be known from now on as the Barrett Development.  It may introduce a totally new law in other areas related to that particular problem that would require amendment.</P>
    <P>If the vessel in distress is located in a harbour the Bill provides for the harbourmaster to assume the functions of the authorised officer.  The Bill also gives the Garda Síochana powers to search and detain persons suspected of plundering a vessel in distress or its cargo.  I regret to say that experience has shown that unscrupulous individuals may try to take advantage of an emergency by looting a stricken ship.  The State must protect as far as possible shipowners and crew against such an eventuality.</P>
    <P>This enhanced ability of the rescue services and other agencies to intervene will <Col N="948" /> help to ensure that most incidents do not progress beyond the distress stage.  In the event, however, that the vessel becomes stranded, abandoned or wrecked, a salvage operation may be attempted.  The existing law on salvage requires to be updated to ensure that salvage operations are encouraged and undertaken in a responsible manner.  The Bill will, therefore, give effect in Irish law to the provisions of the International Convention on Salvage, which prescribes the internationally accepted duties of shipowners, shipmasters and salvors during and after salvage operations.  It also places on all concerned a clear responsibility to prevent or minimise damage to the environment.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I would like to address Senators briefly on the underlying approach to salvage.  Salvors have traditionally worked in a high risk business with large rewards for those who conclude successful salvage operations, but nothing for those who fail.  There is a great deal to be said for this approach as it would be unreasonable for an owner of a stranded vessel or its cargo to pay a salvor who fails to rescue any of the endangered property.</P>
    <P>However, the International Convention on Salvage makes one critically important change to the traditional principle of no cure, no pay or no foal, no fee.  Under existing law, there is no incentive for a salvor to protect the environment when undertaking a salvage operation.  The salvor's reward comes purely from saving the ship, crew and its cargo.  Under the provisions of the Bill owners will be required to compensate salvors who have taken steps to minimise damage to the environment.  This a very practical and proper step.  One might describe it as being ecologically correct. That provision will apply even where the salvage operation itself has been unsuccessful. In view of the number of serious marine pollution incidents and threats to which Ireland has been exposed in the past and our increased awareness of the need to protect the marine environment, this represents a timely and vital change in the law of salvage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="949" /> The Bill provides for the making of contracts to undertake salvage operations and lays down the criteria for deciding the amount of reward to be paid for the successful undertaking of a salvage operation.  These criteria will also apply to compensation to be made for minimising or preventing damage to the environment.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that payment to the salvor by the owner for the saving of life will take priority over claims for payment in respect of property.  The Bill also reiterates the general duty of a master of any ship to come to the assistance of any person in danger of being lost at sea.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill comprehensively addresses the question of wreck removal. The existing law on wrecks, which is contained in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, is being updated and strengthened. Receivers of wrecks, appointed by the Minister for the Marine, have usually been officers of the Customs and Excise Service.  Other persons may also be so appointed, where necessary.  Under the Bill, receivers of wrecks will retain their function as &ldquo;honest broker&rdquo; between the owner and the salvor of wrecks.</P>
    <P>The first duty of a receiver is to take possession of a wreck whose ownership has not been established.  The Bill provides that anybody, other than the owner, finding or recovering a wreck must deliver it into the possession of the receiver.</P>
    <P>The receiver must then give notice of taking possession of the wreck, with a view to establishing ownership and ultimately handing it over to its rightful owner, provided of course that security for any salvage fees has been forthcoming from the said owner.  In the event of no owner being found, the Bill provides that the Director of the National Museum, on behalf of the State, may claim the wreck if it is of archaeological, historical or artistic merit.  While the National Monuments Act, 1987, is the principal legislation covering the safeguard of wrecks of historic importance, I am proposing this <Col N="950" /> provision to further strengthen our powers to protect our national heritage.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Bill will firmly place the onus on the owner to remove the wreck if it constitutes a hindrance to navigation, or a threat to coastal communities or the marine environment.  We are all familiar with the phenomenon of unsightly wrecks around the coastline and the Bill will help us to ensure against this in future.</P>
    <P>Provision is also being made to deal with circumstances where an owner refuses to remove such wreck within a reasonable timescale.  In such circumstances, harbour authorities, local authorities or the Commissioners of Irish Lights are empowered to remove wrecks or otherwise render them harmless and, most importantly, to recover the expenditure incurred by them from the owner.</P>
    <P>I am also taking the opportunity to safeguard property on board a wrecked or stranded vessel by making it an offence. for an unauthorised person to board such vessel without the permission of the master or owner.</P>
    <P>Finally, the burial of human remains at sea is addressed in Part V of the Bill. Unauthorised burials at sea can pose a risk to public health or cause a navigational hazard, and can also give rise to personal distress in the event of a body being washed ashore.  Accordingly, the Bill provides for an enabling power to make regulations for a suitable regime under which burials at sea may take place.</P>
    <P>Section 66 of the Bill deals with burial at sea.  This is an interesting provision. There are five or six applications annually for such burial.  Unauthorised burial at sea is addressed in the Bill for the first time.  Grief and concern is experienced by the relatives of persons whose bodies are buried at sea in an unauthorised or unacceptable way.  The corpses of the remains become a threat or, alternatively, are washed up on the foreshore. Section 66 is being introduced to prevent this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the section for Senator Magner, burial at sea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill I am providing for a maximum level of fine of up to £10 million or five years' imprisonment, or both, for conviction on indictment. This is in the event of pollution and other matters.  When I saw this fine for the first time I raised my eyebrows and wondered from where it was coming. I believe it is a carryover from a section of the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, where offences with potential catastrophic environmental consequences are similarly dealt with.  In the circumstances it is not all that outrageous.  The financial penalty for such offences must be commensurate with the enormity of the environmental threat which they can pose.</P>
      <P>The Bill underlines my commitment, that of the Minister of State and the Government, to protect our valuable coastline and marine environment and will enable us to put in place and to enforce a comprehensive legal framework to underpin the practical contingency arrangements necessary for that purpose.  I will conclude, Sir, by thanking you for your kind good wishes to me and I respectfully commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I wish the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, well.  He showed great strength and I have no doubt that he will pull through this serious illness and be back to us in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but it contains a few inadequacies.  If we table amendments on Committee Stage, perhaps the Minister might accept them.  There are a number of areas which I may expand on at a later stage.  The first is the protection of our coasts; second, the power of local authorities to remove wreck and, third, that adequate facilities should be provided at our ports to control and try to eliminate dumping at sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated he will be imposing severe fines of £10 million and five years' imprisonment.  We will table an amendment that the imprisonment sentence should be changed to community work <Col N="952" /> because our prisons are seriously overcrowded and designed for hardened criminals.</P>
    <P>In relation to the removal of wrecks by local authorities, where the removal, salvage and disposal of the assets do not fully meet the required costs, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Marine should make up the shortfall to the local authorities.  On several occasions, involving Departments other than the Department of the Marine, local authorities have been left with a number of shortfalls in various areas.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this legislation is to give effect to the International Convention on Salvage and to strengthen the law on the removal of wrecks which constitute a threat or harm to the marine environment or a hazard to navigation. Nobody could disagree with that.  It is important that authorised officers have the necessary powers to deal with cases of vessels in distress.  I welcome the provision in the legislation which extends the protection to wrecks of historical, archaeological or artistic importance. This is a measure which our party supports.</P>
    <P>The people who engage in search and rescue operations, the Irish Marine Emergency Service, the RNLI, the Naval Service or the Air Corps are engaged in dangerous work and must be congratulated. There are times when they are greatly supported by other organisations and the public at large and they too must be congratulated for doing a tremendous job.  We must also congratulate countries who are willing and able to assist each other in the line of rescue.  Great co-operation exists between Britain and Ireland when it comes to assisting each other when it comes to helping vessels in distress at sea.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the legislation which renders the owner of a vessel liable for expenses incurred in a rescue operation.  It is unfortunate that it is necessary to give the Garda Síochána powers to search a person suspected of plundering a vessel in distress.  Unfortunately, people will use any occasion to get what they can for themselves and it <Col N="953" /> is necessary to extend these powers to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for accepting the Fine Gael amendment, which he says will be known as the Barrett amendment and dealt with occupier's liability. It is only right that landowners should not incur liability when allowing people on to their property to carry out services required under this Bill.  We are all aware of occupier's liability and the Government should have a serious look at this area.  The Minister also accepted the Fine Gael amendment dealing with burial at sea.  This too is welcome.</P>
    <P>In the area of penalties, the Bill provides for the imposition of prison sentences. The prison sentence should be changed to community service work.  Prisons are designed for people who commit crimes.  Our prisons are overcrowded, and should be kept for criminals.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are empowered under this legislation to remove a wreck if there are reasonable grounds for believing it constitutes a threat to the marine environment or related interests. This is a wise decision.  I hope that when giving powers to local authorities, we will give them adequate resources to carry out the functions assigned to them.  It is important that local authorities be given the power to remove wrecks if they pose a threat to the marine environment, endanger life or affect our tourism industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that the biggest industry along the western seaboard is tourism and must not be harmed in any way.  I would honestly say that the only area for growth along the western seaboard is the tourism industry.  I do not see any reason the local authority should not have the power to remove shipwrecks from waters around our coasts if they are causing damage or are likely to cause any damage to the coasts but if they are to carry out these functions, they will have to be provided with adequate resources.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also aware that where the Department grants moneys to local authorities for the restoration of piers in certain areas, most local authorities have to raise 25 per cent of the cost.  This <Col N="954" /> places an enormous burden on some local authorities.  Local authorities will have to be provided with the resources necessary to enable them to carry out their functions under this legislation.</P>
    <P>We have road traffic regulations and laws governing the use of vehicles on our roads.  We also have air safety regulations. It is time the European Community addressed the need to deal with substandard vessels at sea.  The fact that a substandard vessel is allowed go to sea endangering lives and damaging the environment should be tackled urgently. We should also seek measures to improve the effectiveness of State port control, introduce preventive measures in relation to routing of ships and improve research facilities, vessel traffic services and the training of seafarers to recognise the need to implement improved standards.</P>
    <P>Very often the problems we face are caused by the non-implementation of existing rules.  We need the assistance of EC member states and international organisations to bring about necessary change, to ensure safety at sea and to avoid pollution.  We must seek improved data interchange on vessels on a worldwide basis and the provision of resources to ensure that sufficient numbers of inspectors are trained to similarly high standards throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>The EC must use its economic and political strength to encourage Third World countries with inadequate arrangements to rectify that position. Many of the problems which arise as a result of disasters at sea unfortunately originate in countries which do not apply the same standards as are applied throughout Europe.  Ireland should support the European Community shipowners' association's suggestion that vessel traffic services should have an enhanced role in avoiding accidents in congested waters and that action in the areas of policy planning and promoting standards for qualification of personnel should be taken in the context of such vessel traffic services system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="955" /> We need to provide adequate waste reception facilities in ports.  Regrettably, this is a matter which has been totally neglected in many circumstances.  It is important that member states fulfil their obligations in this regard.  As a result of the lack of proper facilities at ports, much dumping is taking place in our seas.  This can be seen from pollution on our beaches and we, along the western coast, have a great number of beaches of which we are very proud, which have been awarded the blue flag.  We are proud that we have nine blue flag beaches in Mayo.</P>
    <P>It is a recognised fact that much of the pollution caused along our coast comes from indiscriminate dumping at sea and that this is a result of lack of proper facilities at ports.  If facilities at ports are not provided then rubbish will continue to be dumped at sea.  Every opportunity must be taken to strengthen legislation to encourage and promote greater environmental awareness and to protect our seas.</P>
    <P>We all have seen the tragic consequences of accidents at sea and I welcome this Bill because it puts in place a streamlined package to ensure that rescue and salvage are carried out in a structured and legal manner under clear guidelines.  One of the worrying aspects of the international shipping sector is the number of oil spillages.  Vast areas of natural beauty and valuable fish stocks have been damaged by pollution as a result of shipwrecks.  It is only fair and proper that the owners of such ships are obliged to pay the clean up costs.  I welcome the provision where those engaged in salvage operations and who pay special attention to preventing pollution will be rewarded.</P>
    <P>Ferries are getting bigger and carrying more passengers.  Many ferries, including ferries from other countries, are unsuitable to carry large numbers of passengers. Very often one would not be too sure of the number of people on board a ferry, especially during peak periods. Many trucks can overturn while on ferries thus causing major problems.  Consideration needs to be given to the <Col N="956" /> number of vehicles which can be carried by ferries and also to safety precautions and the language used by the ferry companies. It is important that we look at legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for setting in train some very important developments in regard to air, sea and marine rescue services based on the west coast.  With the aid of the Structural Funds over the next four years we hope to see more developments along our western coast.  In the event of a major oil spillage the major accident or emergency plans which county councils and local authorities are supposed to implement would be capable of dealing with the vast amount of oil and chemical spillage which would invade the beaches along the west coast.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about developing tourism in areas that have been left on the sidelines because of our peripherality where some counties have up to ten blue flag beaches, the Minister must not alone see that more stringent safety precautions are put in train to eliminate the possibility of accidents that would destroy these beaches but he must provide adequate resources to our local authorities so that they can carry out their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I note from the Dáil Official Report that the Minister said he was on board a ship off the south coast and that they brought aboard a substantial herring catch, a species of fish that is more common in the Celtic Sea.  The herring fishing season is from October to 1 February. There is great anxiety among fishermen along the west coast that under the reclassification they may no longer be able to fish for herring.  I ask the Minister to look into that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation which is timely and important and I compliment the Minister for the Marine on the expeditious way he has brought it forward.  This complex legislation gives effect to an international convention and to certain aspects of maritime law going back over a hundred years.  This legislation, giving powers of interventions and other powers, is necessary for our maritime industry in view of the developing <Col N="957" /> pattern of maritime business especially around the Irish coastline.  I join with the Minister in wishing a speedy recovery to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, who has been working with the Minister on this complex issue.</P>
      <P>We need to be vigilant in this area, especially in relation to developments within the EC and developments which will take place in the future regarding non-member states of the EC.  I would stress the necessity and urgency of putting in place a legislative framework which will deal with shipping registered outside the EC and under flags of convenience. We have had difficulties with these ships over the last few years and with ships from EC countries also.</P>
      <P>Given that we are situated on some of the major shipping routes, it is necessary that we have a system of legislation capable of effectively dealing with the problems that may arise as the pattern of trade develops.  It is useful and worthwhile that this legislation has been brought before us now and I encourage the Minister to continue to ensure that legislation dealing with maritime affairs is brought into line with the developments in the EC. We should have in place a framework of legislation which will enable us to deal effectively and speedily with problems that will most likely arise in the coming years.</P>
      <P>This has not been the case up to now due to the absence of specifically defined authorised personnel to deal with emergencies and its having been unclear where the lines of ministerial responsibility lay. We had the tragic case of the <i>Kowloon Bridge,</i> where the ship was allowed to run out of control for two or three days and eventually almost caused a horrific pollution problem in one of our most lucrative fishing areas of the south-west and one of our most scenic areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Were it not for the fact that a new Department of the Marine had been recently established and was able to put emergency arrangements in place quickly to remove the oil from the <i>Kowloon Bridge,</i> we would have been faced with a pollution disaster.  Even to the present day it is unclear whether insurance settlements <Col N="958" /> have been reached in that case and whether the State has been reimbursed for the expense it incurred in the clearing up operation.  It is vital that we have legislation in place which would put a system in operation to deal with such events.  I compliment the Minister for doing that through this complex and detailed legislation which is both necessary and timely.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation it is likely that a number of orders and regulations will have to be made.  Sometimes we find that when legislation is passed there is often a delay in issuing orders and regulations to give effect to that legislation.  Therefore, when this legislation is passed, there should be no undue delay in issuing the specific regulations and orders which will be necessary to give effect to some of the decisions which are covered in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Doherty Review Committee which was set up to review the Air/Sea Rescue Service.  One of its first decisions was to relocate the search and rescue helicopter to Shannon.  This has been an outstanding success.  Only today this move was complimented by no less a personality than Mr. Murrin of the Killybegs fishermen who, although never a great friend of mine, agrees with me on the necessity of having an effective Air/Sea Rescue Service on the west coast. Since its establishment the service has already saved about 200 lives.  An indication of the success of the Doherty Review Committee is that it further recommended the establishment of a marine emergency service and that service has been put in place.</P>
    <P>It will be important in the future to have co-operation between all the agencies and Departments involved in this important area.  While we compliment the Air Corps, the Naval Service, the RNLI, the Commissioners of Irish Lights and all those involved, it is vitally important that people at local level would also be involved in this operation.  This is where co-ordination is vitally important. I saw it at first hand when an incident occurred off Ballyvaughan.  The local authority, Clare County Council, with <Col N="959" /> the Marine Service and the Air/Sea Rescue Service at Shannon effected an efficient emergency service within a very short time of a ship getting into difficulty. People were rescued off the ship, the danger of pollution on the coastline was eliminated and what could have a been a major tragedy both in loss of human life and in damage to the environment was averted because of the speedy and efficient way the rescue services operated. I put on record our appreciation for the magnificent response from the local authorities, the State agencies involved and the Ministries with responsibility in that area for a very effective operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has set down clearly in the legislation how he proposes to deal with such emergencies.  It is important that specific officers would be authorised to take certain action when the need arises, especially in the early stages when it is not clear what will be the final outcome of the emergency.  There may be heavy gales off the west coast, a ship may be in difficulty and there may be navigation problems and it may be necessary to take immediate action, such as calling out a naval vessel or a helicopter. It is important that specific people are delegated to do certain tasks.  While the overall responsibility must and will ultimately rest with the Minister, in these situations it is important to clearly identify who is responsible for taking what action: who calls in a helicopter, who calls in the medical services, who calls the oil pollution control people?  There should be a mobilisation team in place to give effect to these decisions.</P>
    <P>I compliment those competent and capable people who work in the Department of the Marine.  I dealt with them during my time in the Department.  Their competence was shown during various emergencies around the coastline.</P>
    <P>In relation to assistance and the power to enlist further help, it is important to establish specific detailed orders so that necessary action is taken without the need to approach the Minister or anyone else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> I am happy this legislation has been introduced, although it is long overdue. This legislation is before us because of the diligence and competence of the present Minister.  I wish him every success in his complex, detailed and painstaking work, which is invaluable to this country.  I hope we will not need the emergency services or the pollution control measures mentioned in this Bill, but accidents will happen and unforeseen situations will arise as a result of bad weather, etc.  For the first time in many years we have a legal framework which will enable us to deal effectively and speedily with these situations.  I want to put on the record our appreciation for the Minister who put this legislation in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Andrews, to the House and convey my good wishes to the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy O'Sullivan, who did a good job.  I hope we see him in the House in the near future.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill before the House. As the Minister stated, we are putting an international convention on salvage and wrecks into legislation.  It is important to bring such legislation before the House, but I am concerned about the methods of implementing it.  We introduced a Sea Pollution Act in 1991.  Will the Minister outline how effective we have been in implementing that extensive legislation? The thrust of the Bill is good and well intentioned and it would be successful if it was put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the interpretation section, the Bill mentions &ldquo;distress&rdquo; in relation to a vessel &mdash;&ldquo;includes a vessel in distress which is a wrecked or stranded vessel&rdquo;.  Will the Minister clarify &ldquo;distress&rdquo; in this case because a &ldquo;vessel in distress&rdquo; could be a vessel listing, drifting, drifting and listing, in difficulty in a storm or a combination of other factors. Will the Minister, his Department or the officers he may authorise to take action in certain circumstances be limited by the confined interpretation of &ldquo;distress&rdquo; in this section?  I would appreciate if the Minister would answer this query <Col N="961" /> because I am concerned about the interpretation of this section.</P>
    <P>Over the years we have been subjected to many pollution threats because of our geographic location in north-west Europe and the fact we are an island country.  I welcome the fact that this Bill, in conjunction with the European Community, is introducing specific powers for the monitoring and control of vessels in our waters and near our country.  How will we implement this legislation and what structures will be in place to ascertain what vessels are 200 or 300 miles from our coasts, what they are carrying and from where they are coming?</P>
    <P>I want to raise a question about flags of convenience.  We all know about inferior, substandard vessels from countries outside the European Community which are registered in the Community and are operating in European and Irish waters under flags of convenience.  An international law of the sea governs this area and international conventions have been agreed; however, it is one thing to sign conventions, it is another to implement and obey them.  Many countries are slack and are operating Third World type vessels in our waters.  We need to be more vigilant.</P>
    <P>The Minister specifically outlined what the Department of the Marine and the European Community are doing about eliminating these problems and difficulties. What structures are we setting up to monitor this situation and to obtain advice about the type of ships which are 200 or 300 miles off our coasts, what they are carrying, from where they are coming and where they are going?</P>
    <P>The transportation of nuclear waste from Japan to Sellafield is a serious problem for the south-east coast and the Irish Sea.  This waste is stored in concrete containers and dumped 400 or 500 miles off the south west coast of Ireland.  We should be concerned about this and we should not allow it to happen.  We know the power of the sea and the erosive power of salt water and difficulties will arise for future generations when cracks appear in the concrete and leakages occur.  This will result in serious pollution <Col N="962" /> problems for us because we will close to this situation.  As part of the European Community we should ensure that this practice does not continue.  It is ridiculous that nuclear waste should come from Japan across the Pacific Ocean to be dealt with in Sellafield and dumped off our coasts.  We should protest louder about this and ensure that it is stopped.  Aside from the health report, it is unacceptable from an environmental point of view.</P>
    <P>What type of examination is done on ships flying flags of convenience?  What is the procedure in relation to the registration of these ships in the European Community?  What type of monitoring is done by respective member states about where it goes, what it does and what cargo it carries?  We need answers to these questions.  Some member states have ships which operate on a nuclear basis around our coasts.  What type of monitoring takes place to determine when these ships travel along our coasts? I am speaking of French ships which are nuclear operated and Russian ships which travel around our north-west coast.</P>
    <P>We are not in a position to monitor what is going on.  We are doing the best we can with the limited resources available to us.  I take this opportunity to compliment the Department, the IMES, the RNLI, the Irish Navy and the various organisations involved in marine activity for the fine job they are doing with limited resources.  There is a case for the Minister to put to the EC that, because of our location, we are in an ideal position to have the headquarters of a European anti-pollution service in relation to rescue and marine anti pollution squad services which should be established, separate from the IMES.  There is an opportunity at present, where the Government has presented the case for Structural Funds, to establish a clear anti-pollution sea facility.  There is a need for greater resources and the Minister must be aware of applications and submissions by private individuals in relation to furthering the cause of preventing sea pollution, especially in regard to ships that get into distress and difficulty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="963" /> Over the years we have been subject to pollution, especially from oil tankers. In some instances there were leakages and damage to the coastline and sea life which, often, was minimised by the effective action of the marine services and the Department of the Marine.  However, we need greater protection and I believe the Minister is in a position to canvass for support in Europe on this issue.</P>
    <P>Another matter dealt with under the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, and not dealt with in this Bill, is dumping at sea, especially the dumping of plastics.  Perhaps the Minister would give some information on how this Act has been implemented, what effective action has resulted from it and if there have been prosecutions under it.  Perhaps there is not sufficient personnel to monitor and effect a prosecution.</P>
    <P>Many wrecks around the coast are rotting and rusting and are an eyesore, it is surprising that so few have been removed.  Has the Minister any plans in relation to removing those which have been embedded on our coastline for many years?</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions dealing with salvage, the salvor and receiver.  In the past there were a number of instances where there were questionable activities by various personnel around the coastline in relation to vessels in distress.  Prior to this it was a case of no foal, no fee, if the salvor did not salvage the ship there was no fee.  Therefore, I especially welcome the section in the Bill that includes compensation to a salvor who effectively reduces any environmental difficulties, I compliment the Minister for including this provision in the Bill because it is a major breakthrough.  While the other issues of saving life, cargo and the vessel were a priority, protecting the environment must be seen as a major priority and it is dealt with effectively in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are many details, most of them dealing with the fine issues of legal application, in relation to the various functions, roles and powers of the different persons involved in dealing with wrecked and stranded vessels.  I welcome this, but <Col N="964" /> I ask for a response from the Minister in relation to the matters I raised.</P>
    <P>Section 66 gives the Minister power to introduce regulations regarding burial of human remains at sea.  Will he give an indication of the kind of regulations he has in mind because, increasingly, people seem to be anxious to be buried at sea? As the Minister rightly said, the usual process is the shaking of ashes on the water off a part of the coast.  That is fine but we must consider the reality of human remains, and as the Minister said earlier, the difficulties in relation to weights and depth and so on.  I am sure the Minister, with his fine legal mind, will be in a position to outline the type of regulation he will introduce in relation to this issue. At a time when the Government appears to be in difficulties in relation to providing local authorities with money to acquire properties for graveyards, perhaps the Minister for Local Government might be passing the buck to the Minister for Defence and the Minister for the Marine in relation to this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I preface my remarks on the Bill by welcoming the Minister, Deputy Andrews, to the House and thank him for his typically generous remarks towards his Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, my close friend of 30 years' standing.  To use naval parlance, I press-ganged Gerry into politics many years ago, I subsequently acted as his director of elections through the years and will act again in that capacity.  I was with him last night and he asked me to pass on to this House his gratitude for the comments made on all sides, not least by Senator Burke, Senator Taylor-Quinn and Senator Daly.  It is fitting also to say that Bina, the wife of the Minister of State commended the courteous and <Col N="965" /> caring way in which Deputy Andrews has looked after the family since Gerry went into hospital.  It is much appreciated.</P>
      <P>I anticipate that this Bill will have an expeditious passage through the House because its provisions are needed, it is crafted intelligently and fills gaps that were blatant when dealing with an island nation.  The way in which the international community now acts in consort is also comforting because this Bill is to incorporate the International Convention on salvage and in that respect small countries like Ireland, in common with other nations, are in a better position to protect themselves than they would be in isolation.</P>
      <P>The Bill confers important powers such as the appointment of a receiver, the provision for access to private land and the commandeering of private crafts such as planes, boats and vessels of other descriptions.  The section to allow local authorities to recoup the cost of salvage and pollution control will be welcomed, as Senator Taylor-Quinn mentioned earlier, by local authority harbour boards, councils and so on, who in the past have been at risk in relation to spending money on such wrecks.</P>
      <P>It is not easy to recover money in many cases from the owners of ships that have been wrecked, and I sure this will be addressed on Committee Stage.  I have had an interest in this area all my life. I have been at sea in small boats and supertankers and I have had the pleasure of sailing from the Minister's port &mdash; Dún Laoghaire &mdash; on many occasions.  It has been my experience that a substantial majority of ships which get into difficulty are tramp steamers and it is almost impossible to identify the owner.  The ship may be flying a Panamanian flag, on charter to a Greek company and operated by another company while tramping round the world.  They are difficult to pin down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill says the State can recoup costs.  This can, of course, be done where shipping lines are identifiable and the place of origin can be found but in many cases ships which get into difficulty are old and it is almost impossible to trace <Col N="966" /> the owner.  One could be in litigation until old age.  That is one problem the Department will face.</P>
    <P>There is a section on environmental protection which provides for a £10 million fine, as the Minister said.  It may sound horrifically large but that amount would have cleared only a small section of the Alaskan coast after the <i>Exxon Valdez</i> spill.  In that case about $1 billion was spent to clean up the environment. The fine is not excessive and if the section is invoked the full rigour of the law should apply.  Especially in areas such as this, where we have seen the enormous damage done to the environment of small countries, the fines provided for should be imposed.  The courts should not take the easy option; we must pursue those people who by accident, design or carelessness pollute our coasts and waters or use ships which have not been properly maintained on the waters of the State.</P>
    <P>The most important function in this area is the saving of human life.  In that regard I welcome the section of the Bill dealing with the rescue service.  Like the Minister I pay tribute to those involved in the Irish Marine Emergency Services. I commend him and his Minister of State for taking account, as the Bill proceeded through the other House, of the special position of the lifeboat service.  The initial idea was that the receiver could direct the RNLI to take part in a specific operation, in common with other agencies, Government or private.  The Minister has now excluded the Lifeboat Institute which is welcome.  The RNLI has a long and honourable tradition of acting in the best interests of those at sea.  It occupies a special position in the hearts of all seafarers and from the public support it receives in its flag days, etc., we can see it occupies a special place in the hearts of all the people of this island nation.  This change has also been welcomed by the RNLI.</P>

      <P>It was an important, welcome amendment to the Bill.</P>
      <P>To pay tribute to the rescue service the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, held a function in Cork to mark the decommissioning of the RAF station at Brawdy in Wales.  To people from Cork and the rest of Munster Brawdy is an honoured name in the rescue services for people who get into difficulty off the south coast.  One remembers the part that station played in the Air India and Fastnet disasters.  The 202 Squadron played a pivotal role at Fastnet in rescuing people and bringing them safely to shore.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State made a presentation of a replica of the Fastnet Rock to Squadron Leader English at Cork Airport some months ago.  It was a highly appropriate presentation.  On that occasion Deputy O'Sullivan quoted the old maritime phrase: &ldquo;The sea shall not have them&rdquo;.  He thanked Squadron Leader English and all the RAF personnel who have given assistance off our coast for their dedicated commitment and courage in living up to that phrase at all times.  This House should also pay tribute to the Brawdy personnel who made an enormous contribution to saving the lives of seamen and women.</P>
      <P>There is no reason the Bill should not get an expeditious passage through this House.  I commend the Minister for this intelligent legislation which will be welcomed by all.  It is fitting that a country like Ireland, with a great tradition of seafaring, should have the best in terms of equipment and legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for this fine Bill. The junior Minister, Deputy O'Sullivan, was responsible for the legislation and held long discussions in the select committee on the Bill and with Members of both Houses.  He put a good deal of work into it and listened closely to proposals from all sides, taking some of them on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister for his concern for Deputy O'Sullivan in his illness.  I know the two men worked well together <Col N="968" /> and Deputy O'Sullivan spoke highly of Deputy Andrews.  I thank the Minister and his officials for taking over Deputy O'Sullivan's duties.  I understand he is doing well after yesterday's operation but, unfortunately, he still has much to go through.  He is a neighbour of mine, and I have known him for many years. We entered the council together and come from the same parish.</P>
    <P>I come from the south coast, like Senator Magner, and am well aware of the damage caused over the years by wrecks, especially in the south-west.  The Bill shows the Minister is conscious of this but he seems aware it does not provide all the answers.  Are EC regulations the reason for this?  Bills come before us to keep us up to date with developments in Europe.  However, one might be worried about Ireland's position as an island as it leaves us vulnerable to those involved in shipping on a massive scale.</P>
    <P>One issue in particular concerns me and also worries the Minister, the Minister of State, and other Members of both Houses.  To what extent are we responsible for shipping coming near our shores or how can we ensure that others take that responsibility?  Can it be done at EC level or is there any way we can regulate the matter?  Perhaps we can get a commitment from the Minister's EC counterparts to keep the ships further from our shores.  A 20 mile or 25 mile limit might not be the correct answer but we have seen the damage done to the south and south-west coasts by ships who can speedily disassociate themselves from a wreck. Senator Magner raised this issue and it also worries me.</P>
    <P>In one instance in Bantry Bay we were lucky that a ship, laden with crude oil, docked after becoming badly damaged by heavy storms off the west coast.  It would be irresponsible to say that this legislation should not be allowed to go through, but should we not have a certain port on the west coast for such ships to dock, rather than letting them come into Foynes, Bantry Bay or Cork harbour? We were lucky to have expertly trained people to repair the damage, otherwise <Col N="969" /> severe pollution damage could have been done to Bantry Bay, which we would be cleaning up for many years.</P>
    <P>I am also worried about the effects of Sellafield on the Irish Sea.  Ships going to or from Sellafield must sail on this sea. There is a danger &mdash; I know the Minister is conscious of it &mdash; of a major accident there and we would suffer most.  What protection do we have from the EC?  At the end of the day, no amount of funding could repair many lifetimes' worth of damage.  I am conscious that ships going to Sellafield with their cargo, from continental Europe in particular, can experience dangerous conditions on the Irish Sea, even in moderate weather.  Indeed, many incidents occurred which might have been more dangerous for us if the tide had been high or the wind blowing the wrong way.</P>
    <P>We are lucky that, in comparison to other countries, we are influenced by a south-westerly wind.  There is a lot of shipping going to Sellafield or other refineries which comes near to the Cork coast in particular.  We often do not know who owns these ships or appreciate the damage they can cause.</P>
    <P>I will be asking questions on Committee Stage.  I am conscious of the provisions of the Bill but they are not the remedy.  The lack of responsibility for a number of wrecks lying around our coastline is an example of this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I am pleased he introduced this important legislation.  I join other Senators in sending my good wishes to the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy O'Sullivan, for a speedy recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a special interest in this legislation, as I have in all legislation relating to the areas of our coastline that depend on the sea for their livelihood.  At one time, Governments did not put enough emphasis on this area and I am pleased that the Department of the Marine is now recognised as a strong Department. I come from County Donegal, which has the largest coastline in the country and it must be recognised that it is important for <Col N="970" /> such counties to have a sea management policy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the five priority measures referred to in the Minister's speech.  The first is the setting up of a ship traffic control system at Community and national level.  While I welcome the legislation and know that we are capable of managing rescue, pollution and other aspects of sea management, the main controls must be put on shipping coming from outside and this will make it difficult to implement the legislation.</P>
    <P>The second measure is the creation of environmentally sensitive areas from which high-risk shipping must be excluded.  I was privileged to attend a Community peripheral maritime regions conference in France in October, which the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy O'Sullivan, addressed.  He said it was his hope and aspiration that legislation would be introduced to limit the offshore distance from which ships carrying dangerous cargoes could be excluded.  The well attended conference welcomed this announcement as a highly important statement because they all realised that such legislation is overdue.  It will have to be done on a European and international basis and legislation to limit the offshore distance for ships carrying dangerous cargoes will have to be given a high priority.  I would welcome the Minister's comments on that aspect.</P>
    <P>The third measure is the need for ship-owners to contribute to the costs of the management, provision and intervention where accidents occur.  This measure is necessary but, as previously stated, it is hard to put structures in place to implement this kind of legislation.  How does one force, I hope the Minister will comment on this, the management involved to contribute towards compensation if they use low value chartered ships, which are barely seaworthy, for high risk cargo?  It is recognised in the shipping industry that the quality of the ship is poor if it is carrying dangerous cargoes.  Very often these problems exist.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> On the recent disaster off the Scottish coast, the north west coast of Ireland would have suffered severely if it had not been for the extreme weather conditions at the time.  People near the accident realised that the bad weather was a blessing in disguise and dispersed the very serious pollution.  We must continue to support the Minister for the Marine, the officials and all the Department's structures because they are of vital importance. At one time we may not have focused as much attention on the marine life around our coast but we now recognise its importance.  Dumping at sea by multinationals, dangerous wrecks or other matters constitute major pollution. The ordinary citizen who lives on the coast is aware of this and looks to Government and to the Department of the Marine to implement legislation and police it thereafter.  It is not an easy task and is very costly.  The desired legislation can be in place but its implementation is another matter because most of the problems occur during severe weather conditions.  The implementation of structures is of paramount importance.  I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  I know that the Minister's determination and strength is behind it and I strongly urge him to appreciate that the livelihoods of people living along our coastline are at stake.  Their concern is great and I hope that the European Community is encouraged and made to pay substantially towards the coast protection policy which is so important to that part of the island.</P>

      <P>I very much appreciate all the contributions.  I specifically refer to the first contribution of Senator Burke; he is right in stating that Third World countries present a difficulty and that organisations such as the European Community Vessel Owners' Association should be supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of indiscriminate dumping at sea was also raised by Senator Burke and in that context he is pushing an open door.  It is environmentally unacceptable by any standards to see the various <Col N="972" /> objects of ships passing in the night ending up on our coastlines.  Whether it is plastic bottles or all the other <i>dechets</i> or rubbish of passing vessels&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is a tragedy.  I strongly support the Senator and I congratulate him and his county &mdash; Mayo &mdash; in having nine blue flags.  It is a beautiful county and has marvellous beaches.  It is a sign of the times literally that beaches in County Mayo have blue flags in the sense that there is a county and a community anxious to attract tourists to the area.  This is a significant achievement on the part of the communities who can produce blue flags on their beaches.  It does not come as any great surprise to me.  I have a particular interest in County Mayo as I am a founder member of the Lough Mask Trout Anglers' Association. I fish beautiful Lough Mask as often and as regularly as I possibly can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Senator Burke.  I know the county well and I appreciate the Senator's pride in it.  He also questions the matter of facilities at ports.  That situation, to counter the environmental threat, is dealt with under the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, and by an international maritime organisation called MARPOL.  The Senator will be glad to hear that Ireland will ratify the MARPOL regulations within the next number of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator also raised the question of Ireland's participation in the Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control.  I understand we participate in that memorandum with 15 other European countries.  Inspections of vessels visiting our waters are co-ordinated to ensure compliance by flag states with the international regulations, about which the Senator quite properly raised concerns. Ships which have deficiencies are detained and the aim is the elimination of substandard vessels from our waters. <Col N="973" /> A view which has found wide currency during the various contributions of Senators is that they are anxious we do not go down the road of &ldquo;rust bucketry&rdquo;. We do not seem to support those vessels which, to say the least, are not fit to float and I strongly support the Senators' views in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Senator also raised the question of ferries which are subject to standards set by the International Maritime Organisation, the IMO, for construction, stability and safe operation.  Ireland's laws give full effect to these standards on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Department of the Marine and the removal of wrecks, the Bill places the onus firmly on the owner of the wreck to remove it.  If he or she does not remove the wreck powers have been given to the Commissioners of Irish Lights, the harbour authorities and the local authorities, as I understand it, to compel the owner to pay for the cost of the removal.  It would be unwise to build in a provision requiring the State to remove a wreck as it could serve to diminish the responsibility placed on the owner to remove it.  He could hide behind the State and in some way wriggle his way out of his responsibilities in relation to the wreck in question.  That is the reason it would be unwise to build in a provision requiring the State to remove a wreck.  It would dilute the responsibility of the owner.</P>
    <P>The Senator raised a very interesting point relating to the section dealing with the £10 million fine, the conviction on indictment and the penalties arising from it in the context of imprisonment.  He suggests the substitution of &ldquo;community order&rdquo; for &ldquo;imprisonment&rdquo;.  It is a very humane point of view and something that might be examined.  Frankly it is not a matter for the Minister for the Marine but I have great sympathy with the Senator's point of view.  I understand that the policy in relation to community service orders is a matter for the Minister for Justice and has been dealt with in the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983. Section 3 of that Act allows the courts to make community service orders in <Col N="974" /> respect of convicted offenders.  Accordingly, the decision to impose a community service order is properly a matter for the courts and they decide how to dispose of an individual or case in that regard.  It is a discretionary matter and I do not think for one moment that the Senator's point is being diluted.  It is a good point &mdash; I do not say that in a patronising way &mdash; and it should be considered. I have no doubt the courts and those advising the courts would be anxious to take account of the Senator's views and the views of other Members of the Oireachtas on this and other matters, but specifically on the matter raised by Senator Burke.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly, a former Minister at the Department of the Marine, had a distinguished career there.  He said the Doherty Review Committee on sea and air rescue should be commended, and I support that.  I would like to think that people like the former Garda Commissioner would not merge into the backwater of oblivion and that his services might be used again by the Department of the Marine or by other Departments. It is my intention to use him in a particular area in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly mentioned the Sikorsky and the Shannon sea/air rescue operation. The Sikorsky helicopter operates from Shannon and a contract worth approximately £5 million per annum, or £25 million over five years, is in place. There is an argument as to whether it should be operated by Irish Helicopters or by the Air Corps.  However, that is an argument and a resolution for another day.  I pay tribute to the operators of the Irish Helicopter Service, they do an excellent job.  I understand the Sikorsky helicopter can go 250 miles out to sea, a significant distance by any standards. Pilots operating these helicopters are brave people who go out in appalling weather conditions.</P>
    <P>I join with Senator Magner in paying tribute to the Royal Air Force for the assistance it gave us over the years.  Now the Sikorsky is in place, I am glad to say that assistance is no longer required.  It is important to note that when it was <Col N="975" /> required, we accepted those services.  I understand that, from time to time, the roles are reversed and we go to their assistance; in a sense, we are returning the favour.</P>
    <P>The Sikorsky covers the west coast, but it can also go over land and assist people in difficulty along the east, south-west, south and north coasts.  As Senators said, to date it has rescued approximately 200 people.  That is quite an achievement; the rescue of one person is an achievement let alone 200.  I believe the exact figure is 167.</P>
    <P>I also pay tribute to the Air Corps at Finner Camp who make a significant contribution to that part of the coast.  For many years, it had operated a sea and air rescue service and its pilots go out in appalling weather conditions.  Furthermore, I pay tribute to the Naval Service. Recently I sailed on the <i>LE Ciara</i> off the Old Head of Kinsale.  We went to the natural gas platforms located 27 miles south-west of the Old Head of Kinsale in the most appalling weather conditions.  I saw at first hand how the Air Corps and naval vessels operate in bad weather.  I want to pay tribute to those services.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge Senator Daly's concern about possible delays in introducing the regulations and orders necessary to give effect to this legislation.  I take a personal interest in the expeditious passage of this legislation today and the co-operation of the House is appreciated.  I assure Senators that when the Bill is enacted there will be no undue delay and it will be enforced to the fullest possible extent. As Senator Daly said, the legislation will give extensive powers to authorised officers to take immediate and complete charge of rescue operations and to call on all ancillary services deemed necessary. He also referred to co-operation between agencies.  I am conscious of the need for co-operation between rescue agencies and public authorities.  I have no doubt the excellent co-operation which exists at present will continue and strengthen and I am aware of the need to support this objective.  Co-operation is a matter for regular review and this Bill <Col N="976" /> strengthens the spirit of co-operation evident in sea rescue.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn made a number of important points.  She referred to the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, and matters relating to vessels in distress, to flags of convenience, the type of cargo carried by vessels and the distance vessels operate from the coastline.  I have seen this at first hand.  Marine oriented Senators will be aware of advances in technology which can pinpoint the placement of vessels in any part of the ocean.  Ground, vessel and satellite based technology have led to extraordinary advances in this regard. That technology can almost reveal what is on board a particular vessel and almost everything about the vessel.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Taylor-Quinn's point about the transportation and dumping of nuclear waste at sea.  Dumping at sea is an act of criminal folly, regardless of the substance, but particularly in the case of nuclear waste.  It is outrageous that nuclear waste is dumped at sea under any circumstances, at any time or at any location.  I feel strongly about that.  We are creating problems not for this or even the next generation, but as the saying goes, for generations yet unborn.  I strongly support the Senator's view in this regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn also referred to the definition of vessels in distress. Section 2 deals with that definition.  It states that a vessel in distress is a wrecked or stranded vessel.  The Senator was concerned about the narrowness of the definition.  However, it has a global reference. It is broad and flexible enough to embrace any of the situations to which she referred, including listing, drifting and other difficulties which may arise.  I assure the Senator this point is covered by that definition although it does not spell it out.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn also raised a number of questions about the enforcement of the Sea Pollution Act.  I would be happy to ask the Department to furnish her with statistical data relating to prosecutions.  I share her concern about the transportation of hazardous goods and I can assure the House that Ireland is <Col N="977" /> playing a strong role on the international stage to ensure the strictest régime of monitoring and control of such movements. However, I must point out that this legislation is not appropriate for dealing with this area.</P>
    <P>I have also dealt with the issue of flags of convenience and it is important to realise that these ships undergo the full rigours of State control inspections in Irish ports.  I would also point out to Senator Taylor-Quinn that if existing wrecks are a threat to navigation or enforcement, the owners can be required to remove the wrecks or render them harmless, failing which local authorities may do so and recoup the costs from the owner.</P>
    <P>The regulations for burial at sea, a matter also raised by Senator Taylor-Quinn, have yet to be finalised.  Matters to be addressed will include suitably constructed and weighted coffins and their disposal in a sufficient depth of water at an appropriate location.  These are matters that will be dealt with by regulation and I can assure the Senator that they will be dealt with sensitively in order not to place an additional burden of grief on the already overburdened bereaved.</P>
    <P>Senator Magner mentioned a number of areas which are significant and relevant, including IMES and the RAF to whom he paid tribute.  I agree with the Senator's concerns about lengthy search and litigation procedures to find and recoup costs from what he calls obscure shipowners.  The provisions of the Bill, however, will give us a strong hand in relation to the inspection of normal shipping which must be our main target.  I would like to add my voice to Senator Magner's tribute to the excellent assistance given by the RAF over the years in saving lives around our coasts.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan made a valuable contribution from his own perspective as a long-serving Member of this House and having regard to the fact that he comes from the significant maritime community of Donegal.  I have addressed many of his concerns in my contribution under headings raised by other Senators.  I agree with his comments on dangerous <Col N="978" /> substances and the fact that such substances may be dumped at sea.  I find that unacceptable and condemn it.  I am grateful for Senator McGowan's contribution which comes from years of experience and understanding of this subject. I will look carefully at his contribution.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Cregan that the Bill does not have all the answers, no Bill can.  I take his point and am not being facetious by responding to him in this fashion.  Of course the Bill does not have all the answers but it certainly tries to address the issues; we do the best we can, within our competence, to address them.</P>
    <P>Another question raised was that of monitoring vessels off the coast that might be categorised as rust buckets carrying hazadrous cargoes.  This matter was addressed capably and competently by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, at the June meeting of the EC Transport Council.  I have no doubt that when Deputy O'Sullivan gets better, as I am sure he will, he will continue to pay vigorous attention to it.  I am grateful to Senator Cregan for his remarks about the Minister of State as well as for his appreciation of what the Minister of State has been doing and will continue to do.</P>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned Sellafield. A public relations campaign is being undertaken on behalf of Sellafield which is an assault on one's intelligence.  Sellafield is a danger to this country and, by any definition, we should continue to remark and monitor its danger to the Irish Sea and to Ireland generally.  We must not forget Sellafield.  I welcome Senator Cregan's remarks.  As he said, it depends on which way the wind is blowing at any particular time.  To a great degree we have been protected by the south westerly winds but some time that wind will shift direction and we might find ourselves in serious difficulty.  I take the Senator's point, however, and I appreciate his contribution.</P>

      <P>This amendment is necessary to exclude inland waterways from the provisions of the Bill dealing with salvage. I understand representations have been made in this regard.  Current hire operators on inland waterways have asked that the existing non-application of salvage law to such waters be continued. The Irish Boat Rental Association has indicated that on inland waters there is an informal voluntary system of co-operation among river users in the event of mishaps and it is practical to accept their point of view.  They wish this system to continue to avoid the intrusion of financial risks arising from salvage claims. In general, large scale salvage operations would not arise on non-tidal inland waterways.  The International Salvage Convention, 1989, permits the exclusion <Col N="980" /> of inland waterways from the scope of the convention.  I respectfully suggest that this amendment be accepted, given the views of the Irish Boat Rental Association expressed through the Irish Maritime Law Association.</P>

Is there any danger of a similar situation to that which occurred in Bantry where the ship had to enter the harbour because of heavy seas?  Will an authorised officer decide whether ships should be allowed into our harbours?

      <P>I take the Senator's point which is fairly well covered by section 3 but I am not certain.  I can deal with it on a later occasion by way of contact with the Senator.  In relation to the question of how far into deep waters the remit of the authorised officer extends, an authorised officer appointed under the section will normally be a member of the Department's Irish Marine Emergency Services, a harbour master or a surveyor from the Department's Marine Survey Office.  The authorised officer's job will be to take control of emergencies.  This might allay the Senator's fears.  Section 7 gives the officers powers to board vessels, require assistance from relevant persons and demand the use of vessels, vehicles and aircraft.  Each authorised officer will hold a warrant of appointment which may be inspected by the persons affected.  I take the Senator's point and will correspond <Col N="981" /> with him on the matter, if that is to his satisfaction.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Minister said.  He spoke about information available which can pinpoint shipping even on small points on international seas.  Is it possible for authorised officers to obtain, through an EC information bureau, information about ships before they enter Irish shipping lanes, so that we can protect our waters by preventing them entering.</P>

      <P>When ships enter Irish waters or Irish ports, and, therefore, Irish jurisdiction, we have advance notice, in the ordinary way, of the vessel and its type and manifest.  This is important from the Senator's point of view and I can allay his fears in this regard.  I make the point, in response to his question and the points he raised on Second Stage, that modern technology could almost tell what one had for breakfast.  Port state control systems advise us, by computerised systems, of vessels coming from other ports.  The technological hardware is in place to enable the details of a boat coming, say, from France to Ireland to be entered on the same computer system.  It is impossible for a boat not to have its port <i>persona</i> known from one port to another.  This is how advanced we are in that regard.  The port state control system takes care of this matter in a general way and in a global context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>We have established that it is the 12 mile limit.  A vessel in distress would not automatically mean that life is at risk but a dangerous cargo could have shifted.  Is there provision in this section for an exclusion order in regard to a vessel?  It can proceed to its flag port, which could be Great Britain, France or <Col N="984" /> wherever, but it cannot come in here and subject this State to the threat of perhaps massive pollution.  Can an exclusion order be made by the authorised officer?</P>
      <P>The second point goes back to one Senator Burke made and I made earlier &mdash; who pays for this at the end of the day? We are conferring enormous powers on this authorised officer, customs officer or whoever.  A person can have an expensive yacht which is their pride and joy costing £100,000 and somebody commandeers to rescue another ship.  Ideally, one would recover the costs from the owners of the ship.</P>

      <P>If it is the sort of ship I described on Second Stage whose owner is unknown, which may have been registered in Greece, subsequently went to Panama and other parts of the world where there is no possibility of the person recouping any money, we need to know who pays.  Subsection (4) states: &ldquo;be liable to pay to the Minister the expenses&rdquo;.  I am assuming &mdash; I am sure the Minister will correct me &mdash; that in the event of a defaulting owner the Minister pays the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Minister does not pay the local authorities. I think I already made that clear to Senator Burke.  In relation to refusing the entry of or excluding a ship from a port, the law of the sea and the question of <i>force majeure</i> applies.  If, as I say, a ship is <i>in extremis</i>, regardless of the type of cargo it is carrying, international law demands it be admitted, for a number of reasons, mainly to save life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I would have thought, and I think I am right in this regard, that if a ship is not in distress, for example, and there is known to be a dangerous substance on board, the port authority would <Col N="985" /> have no problems about not welcoming it into port.  It could, in those circumstances, issue an exclusion order.  I have no doubt that can be done. However, this only applies in exceptional circumstances such as where there is a serious problem in relation to the ship staying afloat on the one hand and the possibility of loss of life on the other.  In those circumstances it would be difficult on humanitarian grounds, apart from whatever laws apply, to exclude it from the port to which it seeks to gain entry.</P>
    <P>The other case mentioned by Senator Burke, the matter of a ship going to the rescue of another and subsequently getting into difficulties itself, is an extreme one and I hope it will never happen. However, I take the Senator's point.  It is not covered in the Bill but I would look at such a case if the circumstances arose. All I would do is go into the area of &ldquo;happy thoughtism&ldquo;and wish and hope that it would not arise.</P>

      <P>I remember tugs based in Cobh which were privately owned, small one or two person crafts.  If they were commandeered to go to the assistance of a vessel in distress on the rocks, which could take a fortnight, it would be an enormous expense.  If they had to involve themselves in ruinous litigation they would probably go under, the company could not financially survive it.  It seems that if we want to protect our coastline and effect a proper service to shipping we should not ask people to help if they are unable to bear the costs.  The State has responsibility there.  If an officer acting under the Minister's remit commandeers my boat and sends it out to effect a rescue, help with cargo or whatever he decides I should do, then the least I should be guaranteed is a refund of any expenses I incur.  I think that is fair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>This creates a dilemma. It has always been a tradition for ships in the vicinity to go immediately to the assistance of a vessel in distress.  We should not create a situation where, if an authorised officer asks for assistance for a vessel in distress, people have to consider the cost of going to sea for maybe three days without any possibility of recouping their expenses.  I am not asking what we pay for damage to the vessel as that will be covered by insurance but I do not want people on shore deciding not to use their vessels because they will not recoup even their expenses.  We should not legislate for this because when something is incorporated <Col N="987" /> into legislation it is very easy for officials to say no.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

      <P>It has been accepted on all sides that the Minister has been up front in relation to the Bill but it is defective in this area and I would simply ask the Minister to take on board what we say.  It is not the end of the world; we have to do our business here and now.</P>
      <P>I will tell of an incident I witnessed.  I served on a coasting ship and on one occasion when we entered the Humber I happened to be on the bridge with the captain and the third mate who had command of the ship at the time.  We saw a dead body in the water which had obviously been there for some time.  The third officer moved the telegraph to stop and the captain pushed it forward again. In the ensuing row it became clear that the skipper was not prepared to take a dead body on board and be held up in Hull for two and a half days.</P>
      <P>That is the sort of pressure that was put on skippers in the fifties and it is probably worse now.  Unless there is an element of compensation for effort and time, very few people will get involved. As Senator Cregan said, one would be inclined to pretend one did not own the boat if it was to be commandeered.  This is an area the Minister and his officials should examine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand and accept what the Senator said about the row between the ship's captain and third officer about the captain's refusal to stop to pick up the unfortunate remains.  I find it difficult to believe that he would not stop regardless of the cost to him. However, that sort of human condition is not provided for and cannot be provided for in legislation.  That does not <Col N="988" /> cover the Senator's point in its entirety but it certainly is something at which I will have a serious look arising from what Senator Magner, Senator Burke and Senator Cregan have said.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 11, lines 22 to 24, to delete subsection (3).</P>
      <P>There was a problem on Report Stage in the Dáil where two amendments were proposed to ensure that no liability would attach to a landowner whose lands might be used during a rescue operation.  One amendment was proposed by Deputy Barrett and an alternative by myself.  I called this amendment the Barrett amendment in the Dáil and here I am effectively accepting Deputy Barrett's amendment with an addition.</P>
      <P>Due to a procedural error both amendments were accepted by the Dáil.  It is now necessary to delete one of the sections and I have Deputy Barrett's permission to delete his section.  The Dáil Official Report stated that the proposer of the amendment to be deleted &mdash; that is Deputy Barrett &mdash; was in complete agreement with the Minister's alternative amendment and I have Deputy Barrett's permission to delete his amendment in the Seanad.  Effectively it is his amendment with an additional requirement I inserted arising from comments at the original Select Committee where the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, said he would look very seriously at Deputy Barrett's amendment.</P>
      <P>Nearly all of Deputy Barrett's amendment is there but it introduces a new concept which might be examined.  The landowner, in the context of what this Bill seeks to achieve, no longer has a liability and that is not a bad thing.  This has been a matter of concern to landowners over the years.</P>
      <P>This is a very important amendment and it may set a precedent for future amendments.  I ask the House to accept the amendment as proposed by myself taking account of the fact that it enmeshes Deputy Barrett's suggestion.</P>

      <P>This section is particularly relevant to people in County Clare and County Wicklow where many farmers are <Col N="990" /> annoyed by what has been happening. Under this section a person shall have the power to pass over adjoining lands, unless there is a public road equally convenient, without being subject to interruption by the owner or occupier; any damage sustained by the owner or occupier as a consequence of the rights given by this section shall be a charge on the vessel, cargo or articles in respect of which damage is occasioned.  When and how do we decide that the responsibility no longer lies with us, with the person in charge of the cargo or the authorised officer or officers?  A person might have to travel up to three miles to the nearest road.  Naturally we would look for the shortest route but how do we define that? I agree with the Minister and Deputy Barrett that we must be seen at all times to be taking every action possible to ensure that landowners are not held responsible if there is an accident.  Let us take the example of the bad rail crash that happened down in County Kildare some time ago.  That was very serious but we were lucky it happened near a public road.  Many people sustained injuries trying to get to the trains to help the passengers.  How do we define the distance between the site of the accident or the cargo coming ashore and when we are no longer on the farmer's land?</P>

      <P>There is an assumption there that farmland will be involved.  That is not necessarily the case.  A vessel can be in distress against a quay wall and cargo may have to be carried through warehouses etc.  I said this on Second Stage.  This is a very intelligent provision. Common sense would apply this provision as it applies to fire brigades when they have to go from one premises to another.  The more important thing is that we have a debate on the environment and people's right to walk the countryside and the liability that imposes on farmers. I am not talking about people hunting live animals, I am talking about people going for a stroll on Sundays.  It seemed to be an insoluble problem, yet the Department of the Marine seems to have come up with a provision that quite rightly <Col N="991" /> absolves people who co-operate with the authorities in the saving of life or of cargo.  It is a very good provision, but we are not necessarily talking about farm land; we could be talking about the docks.</P>

      <P>I would like a definition in the regulations to make it clear that as far as possible, where goods are carried across private land, they will be brought not to the nearest point on a public road but to the most suitable point.  In other words, if there is an accident at Roche's Point, it would be necessary to get to the nearest public road as fast as possible but the nearest point on that road is not necessarily the most appropriate.  If the regulations say the nearest point, the best point might be ignored and if a person met with an accident trying to get to the nearest point, the farmer would not be covered.  I do not worry too much about farmers but I can see their point in this regard.  I wish to make sure that not alone the nearest point but the best and most appropriate point of public access would be mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>This section sets out the sort of information the authorised officer would be seeking from a vessel in distress. I presume port control in Dublin is the first contact body off the coast of Dublin.  Does it automatically pass on that information?  Is it obliged to pass on information if a vessel calls on Dublin Port with a particular problem, for instance with a dangerous, pollutant, cargo shifting?  Who should the ship contact? Was it always the harbourmaster in Dublin, an authorised officer or someone else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In this instance the authorised officer would be the harbourmaster. The question of notification presumably to other port authorities would be within the remit of the authorised officer and he would pass on that information to his counterpart at the vessel's next port of call.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking about all the regulations which could be made. We were talking earlier about exclusion authority.  I accept that one renders assitance when possible from a humanitarian point of view but where a ship has a dangerous cargo, but no threat to life, is there an automatic transfer of the information that is in the Bill &mdash; such as the nature of the cargo, the nature of the damage etc. &mdash; to authorised officers so that one may be in a position to deny access to the port, to ask the ship to proceed on to Southampton or wherever it is supposed to go?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>They can board ships, question witnesses and require relevant documentation to be produced.  If that documentation is not kosher, or the cargo is unacceptable, bar <i>force majeure</i>, I would have thought that the ship would be sent on its way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am probably not making my point clearly.  No documentation will be involved because it is a ship to shore communication.  There is an oral transmission which says that the vessel has a problem and describes that problem.  Where it is potentially a hazardous vessel, although not in terms of loss of life, is there an obligation or will there be an obligation on Dublin Port control or Cork Port control to inform the relevant authorised officer that there is a problem so that the authorised officer can refuse permission for that particular vessel to enter?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  Section 11 (1) states: &ldquo;Where any vessel is or has been in distress in the State, an authorised officer may question any person...&rdquo; What is the definition of in &ldquo;the State&rdquo; here?  If there is a problem in the Irish Sea and the nearest land is 22 miles away, how do we define whether it is a problem within our State or a foreign State?  For example, an accident happened in Scotland in January this year and north-westerly winds could have done a lot of damage to the northern part of Ireland and the Dublin Port and Wicklow areas.  The accident happened in Scotland by chance.  How do we decide that was not Ireland's problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to think that our jurisdiction would extend to the 12 mile limit and no further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a danger there and I think the Minister can see it clearer than I can.  A person in charge of a ship might find it easier to be seen within the 12 mile limit of the Republic of Ireland rather than within the 12 mile limit of another country &mdash; in this case Britain. Is there a danger there?  Do we have the same regulations and laws?  Are ours tougher or weaker?</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 12.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 13, lines 39 and 40, to delete &ldquo;in navigable waters or in any other water whatsoever&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;in navigable tidal waters or in any harbour&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Cruiser hire operators on inland waterways have asked that the existing non-application of salvage law to our inland waterways be continued.  The Irish Boat Rental Association indicated that on inland waterways there is an informal voluntary system of co-operation among river users in the event of mishaps.  It wishes this system to continue to avoid the intrusion and financial risks arising from salvage claims.  In general, large scale salvage operations would not arise on non-tidal inland waterways so we could rely on existing arrangements.  The International Salvage Convention, 1989, permits the exclusion of inland waterways from the scope of the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an eminently sensible proposal.  I am familiar with the cruiser hire industry on the Shannon Estuary and cruisers run aground every day.  People collect them, it is their first time sailing a boat and, from time to time, they run ashore.  If the concept of salvage as we are discussing it came into operation, Emerald Star would go to the wall next season as they would be pulling boats out all over the place.  This is a sensible provision and I welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This arises from the same philosophy and thinking behind the amendment to section 2 and meets a reasonable point of view expressed by the Irish Boat Rental Association through the Irish Maritime Law Association. <Col N="995" /> I am grateful to the Senator for his support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision relating to fixed or floating platforms is strange. There are two off the south coast, the Marathon gas platforms, Alpha and Bravo which are privately owned and taking gas from the sea bed in a private enterprise operation &mdash; and a profitable one at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks also to Marathon which is charged with maintaining those platforms, not just their superstructure but the anchorage &mdash; it is important it stays fixed on the spot.  Nonetheless, as we have seen off the Norwegian coast and in the North Sea, rigs have broken their moorings on more than one occasion and created havoc.  I do not know why they are excluded as they are privately owned platforms and the same sort of penalties should apply to those people as to ship owners.  I do not know why we make a distinction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 3 of the International Maritime Convention makes this provision and we are just transmitting it.

      <P>The protection of our coastline is very important and Senator Burke made that point on Second Stage. Is the Minister satisfied that this section will do the job we want it to do?  The way we are talking about ships in the night, as the Minister put it, passing so near our coast makes a laugh of this section.  I am worried about that. Is the Minister aware that no matter what we say we can be heavily polluted because of EC regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator made a relevant point.  All I can do is express the will of the State and the people in legislation, in statutory form, as this will become a statute or an Act of the Oireachtas in due course.  I cannot legislate for human perfidy or weakness or any other human foibles which do not necessarily comply with what we might want in legislation.  Subject to that, this will conform with the strictest possible regime in relation to the practicality of protecting our coastline in the context of legislation.  As for the weaknesses of human kind and other actions it may take outside our legislation, I cannot control that in law.  As far as the law of the land can be controlled in relation to the protection of our coastline, section 22 does that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister complimented County Mayo for having so many blue flag beaches.  County Cork also has blue flags and we want to have more as do other counties.  It is hard for counties on the east coast to try to get blue flags when there is pollution from areas for which we cannot regulate.  Is that true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect Senator, it is not true.  We have the legislation but, as the Senator pointed out, our coast is <Col N="997" /> protected to a large degree by the southwesterly wind.  As for what people might do and how they might act on the high seas, if they throw material overboard passing a country's coastline, and are caught in the act, only then can they be prosecuted or brought to account.  I take the Senator's point but the law is doing what it can.</P>

      <P>In page 29, between lines 17 and 18 to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) or if there is no such person or the Company is in liquidation or insolvent that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Marine reimburse the shortfall to the appropriate Authority&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister may be able to help us in this regard.  I draw his attention to paragraph (a).  We are referring only to the local authority or the harbour boards. This amendment should be accepted.  As the Minister is aware, great burdens have been imposed on local authorities and they should be able to reclaim any cost over and above the cost of carrying out their duties under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the intention of the amendment but I cannot accept it.  I respectfully suggest that this is the &ldquo;bottomless pit&rdquo; principle, that the State has a full purse.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The spirit of the Bill places the onus on the owner to remove the wreck if it is a threat to navigation in the marine environment.  I adverted to this on Second Stage.  This is a significant <Col N="998" /> improvement on existing legislation.  If the owner fails to do what is required the local authority is empowered by this Bill to remove such wreck and recoup the cost from the owner.  It would be inappropriate to enshrine in legislation a provision that the State, in the form of the Minister for Finance or the Minister for the Marine, should make good any shortfall on such operations.  It would send the wrong signal to owners of wrecks who would be less inclined to bear the cost of removal if the alternative was for the State to do so.</P>
    <P>An emergency or exceptional situation of calamitous proportions may arise in the future where the State may have to consider financial or practical assistance in the circumstances.  Therefore, it is not entirely ruled out.  I would like to think that the amendment will be taken into account but I cannot accept it in the context of previous sections related to it and my responsibility for ministerial expenses.  I would not like to bind the State or the Ministers mentioned in the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Burke made a fair point.  Wrecks are lying off the coast of west Cork, they do not contribute to the beauty of the area.  Nobody is taking responsibility.  The wreck is usually handed over to a salvage company.</P>
      <P>Many of us are familiar with the wreck off Castletownbere.  In low tide it is very ugly and the high part of the mast can be seen during high tides.  We are saying here that nobody, if they do not have the money, should ultimately have the responsibility of removing it.  That wreck was loaded with ore when it ran aground in heavy seas.  The salvage company with responsibility for the wreck removed the heavy tonnage of ore, made a lot of money from that cargo but did nothing about the wreck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the owners are not prepared to remove the wreck it is very hard to put the responsibility on a local authority. Local authorities are responsible for what happens on land and harbour commissioners are responsible for shipping lanes and other services.  However, we <Col N="999" /> do not do a good job removing wrecks. It is not a usual occurrence.  The wrecks on our coasts are usually small fishing vessels lost at sea.  Sometimes lives are lost which is much more important than the wreck.  The wreck breaks up and may spill 100 gallons of diesel but that is the end of it.  However, in this case we are discussing heavy tonnage left on our shores.  It could cost millions of pounds to move such wrecks yet we are saying that nobody should take responsibility for them if the local authority does not have the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

If the Senator withdraws the amendment I will look at the possibility of doing something about it although I do not know if I can.  It has been there for some time and I will be exhausted trying to explain to Deputy Sheehan why I cannot remove it.  I am sure his patience <Col N="1000" /> with my answers is running out.

      <P>The situation regarding public liability and third party claims is as serious a deterrent to employment as PRSI and the other impediments to enterprise.  Furthermore, we believe there has been enough talk on this matter.  We have had reports, inter-ministerial group meetings and so on, but the time has come to do something about the situation which confronts us.  We debated a similar motion in June and another one prior to that date.  This topic arises on a regular basis and the time has now come to move on it.  There has been some agreement in this House on the content of the motion and we ask the Government to bring forward new laws in the next session which will deal effectively with the problems encompassed by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1006" /> When we last discussed a motion related to this one, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke, underlined the cost to society of insurance claims.  She told us that motor and liability claims in 1991 amounted to £661 million or 2.7 per cent of GNP and that employers' liability costs totalled 2.2 per cent of pay roll costs, more than twice the figure for the rest of Europe.  These figures show the significance of claims and the fact that these claims are a big drain on the national economy.  The time has come to deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Honan, has some practical suggestions to make on how we should deal with fraudulent claims which appear to be prevalent at every level in society.  We appear to have arrived at the point where falling over in a golf club or falling off a bar stool after a few pints, have become the subject of litigation.  It has got to the point where it is almost laughable.  There is widespread concern about this.</P>
    <P>Regarding the local authorities and their responsibilities, we have almost reached the point where there is a demand that nearly every footpath be like a billiard table and when it is, and somebody slips on it, that is used as grounds for making a claim.  In County Kildare, where we adopted the estimates in the past few weeks, it emerged from an examination of the estimates for 1994 that public liability insurance costs to County Kildare is £525,000 and in addition, approximately £100,000 or more has been imposed on the county because the first £5,000 of each claim must be met by the county.  The effect of these two figures puts approximately £4 on the commercial rate in County Kildare, which is substantially more than 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>That is the practical situation and it brings home the point that society and the taxpayer pays.  The money has to be found.  This begs the question I raised when we were discussing the estimates: should the county be its own insurance company and carry its own risk?  The amount premium is so astonishingly high that the county could recover the cost <Col N="1007" /> quite easily over a short period if it were to carry its own risk.</P>
    <P>The county manager, in his preamble to the estimates, said that County Kildare had one of the highest claims records in the country.  Some people appear to expect a pavement or a footpath will be in a better state of repair than the footpath to their front door.  If they fell on the path in front of their front door on claim would arise, but if they fell on the public footpath they would make a claim. That does not make sense.  I believe the county should not be liable for some of the claims made against it.  In a curious way, if we were to leave things as they are, there might not be a liability, but if we undertake improvements and they were not completed to what some people would regard as an acceptable standard, there is a liability.  That does not appear to make sense.</P>
    <P>As regards soft tissue injuries and what arises thereform, there should be specific legislation to cut back awards in those areas.  I understand the normal award for whiplash is in the area of £10,000 to £20,000.  Admittedly some people have been severely injured but in other cases I believe the condition is more a figment of the imagination rather than a physical complaint.</P>
    <P>On the question of voluntary bodies, there are many voluntary agencies around the country which want to work on behalf of their community and to this end they organise events, such as field days, agricultural shows and even walks. The first item to be discussed at the initial meeting to organise these events is the cost of insurance and sometimes the cost is so high that these worthy activities cannot be undertaken.  That is not right.</P>
    <P>I am a trustee of two sporting organisations and every year I go to the annual general meeting and ask one question; what is the status of our insurance policy? I ask this because the trustees are liable under law if there is a claim and, if I remember correctly, there was one famous incident in County Offaly where the trustees were liable.</P>
    <P>The RDS Spring Show has disappeared for a number of reasons connected with agricultural society and developments in <Col N="1008" /> society generally, but, one of the reasons is the cost of insurance.  There was one large claim where, I understand an animal got loose at the Spring Show and somebody was injured and this had a knock on effect on shows all over the country.  It came to the point where a local community decided to put furniture into a public park for children to play on but, suddenly, the park had to close because of the possibility of a claim.</P>
    <P>These matters should be addressed by law and there should be immunity unless it can be shown that there was gross negligence. If it can be shown that a reasonable standard of care was taken there should be immunity from liability because, as I pointed out earlier, somebody has to pay the premium.</P>
    <P>As regards landowners, this is a serious matter.  People entering land, that is trespassers, can make a claim against the landowner.  It should be the case that people enter land at their own risk and if they are involved in an accident unless it can be shown that there was gross negligence on the part of the landowner, no liability should accure.  Would a husband sue his wife or a wife sue her husband if an accident happened on the farm, say, somebody fell over a plough?  They would not, but if a trespasser falls he makes a claim.  The landowner can be liable if people cross his land to get to national monuments.  We are allegedly encouraging tourism, but a landowner or occupier can be liable if they allow people access across their land to visit national monuments.  In this context I commend the Dáil amendment to the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Bill, 1993, which ensures that landowners who allow their land to be crossed when people go to salvage wrecks will not be liable in the event of an accident.  More of that kind of legislation is required.</P>
    <P>On the issue of employers and their liability, people complain about a back injury which is almost like the whiplash and is difficult to define.  This should be the subject of special rules and the law needs to be changed.  People who lift things have a duty to do so carefully, and that duty should be on their shoulders and not on their employers.  Where an employee drops a hammer from a ladder <Col N="1009" /> on top of their colleagues, we must again consider whether the employer should be liable or if there should be a contingent liability on the employee on the basis of reasonable care being taken.</P>
    <P>In the event of serious injuries, which could result in paralysis, where a fund is established to provide that person with a reasonable quality of life, if it could be so described, if a large award is made and within a short period the beneficiary of the award dies, there should be some way of returning a certain amount of the award to the person who paid it.  This appears to me to be sensible.  Another person should not be the beneficiary.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies are not philantrophic institutions; they assess the risk, they base their premiums on what they are paying out.  There is a margin between about which we could argue but those of us who pay premia suffer the costs as private individuals or local authority taxpayers.  This problem has become a serious impediment to employment and having a damaging effect on economic growth.  Something must be done about it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  Irish civil actions for injury account for the largest number of claims and the highest settlement figures in Europe.  They pose a formidable problem for businesses and employers in this country.  IBEC recently conducted a survey of its members to count the cost of such actions and the survey highlighted worrying trends in both the nature and extent of civil claims for injury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why are professional indeminity, public liability and employer accident insurance so prohibitively expensive in Ireland?  Is it because we have all suddenly become careless, that more people are falling and being injured?  I do not believe it is.  Standards of safety in the workplace have never been higher.  One of the most important findings in the IBEC survey was that, despite the importance placed on good health and safety practices, they did not necessarily protect employers from excessive claims. The survey showed that 88 per cent of all companies surveyed had detailed safety <Col N="1010" /> statements and specific safety training is provided in 60 per cent of them.</P>
    <P>The average rate of claims is 12.2 per 1,000 per year.  These claims are worrying and should be of great concern to all.  Not only is the number of claims increasing, the amounts awarded are also being increased.  The hidden effects on employment include absence, disruption in the workplace and the litigious attitude successful claims may engender.</P>
    <P>The IBEC survey also showed the average cost of settlement in 1990 was £12,400 when the claim was heard in court and the legal costs amounted to 19 per cent of total costs.  When a claim was settled out of court the average settlement was £11,668 with legal costs amounting to 17 per cent of that figure.  The average employer liability premium paid by those surveyed amounted to 2.2 per cent of the annual payroll.  While IBEC accepted certain types of industry were heavily loaded for insurance premia, the level of premia was generally affected by the claims record of the individual company.  Therefore, a history of claims has significant effect on the cost of insurance to business.</P>
    <P>In recent years the underwriting loss on employer liability premia was large and is increasing.  In 1990 the average underwriting loss was 29 per cent but, by 1991, this had increased to 40 per cent. We must accept there is a great obligation on employers at common law to take care for their employees' safety.  Employees are entitled to seek redress when they have suffered injury as a result of an employer's negligence.  It is up to the employer to take reasonable care and precautions in relation to their employees and if they are shown to have done so they should not have to accept liability and compensate their employees.</P>
    <P>Certain actions are needed to redress this damaging trend.  All claimants for personal injury should be required at an early stage to swear an affidavit setting out all pertinent facts relating to the circumstances of their injury, the loss suffered, the nature of their injuries and the names of witnesses known to them at the time of swearing the affidavit.  Every plaintiff in a personal injuries claim should, unless the court excuses him or <Col N="1011" /> her from doing so, be required to give details of all claims he or she made for personal injury in the previous 15 years, whether or not those claims have come to court or proceedings have commenced.</P>
    <P>In this context it is worth nothing that approximately 27 per cent of all claims relate to falls, tripping or slipping and that they were settled at an average cost of £10,500.  Manual handling accidents, particularly back injury, was responsible for 12 per cent of claims in the workplace. These were settled at an average cost of £13,000.  As my colleagues said, back injury and lifting claims should be subject to special rules.  The duty to lift an object carefully should be the responsibility of employees.</P>
    <P>A consultative body of the Judiciary should be set up to give advisory directives to achieve uniformity in awards and devise a common policy for personal injury claims.  The Judiciary must realise the fund for paying these awards is not a bottomless pit.  Huge increases in insurance costs for employers constitute a tax on employment and is as anti-work as the 1 per cent levy.  Premia must be paid and come from the profits of businesses.</P>
    <P>In this week's <i>Irish Medical News</i> there is an article by Dr. Andrew Rynne.  He says: &ldquo;So you thought the country was being run by the Oireachtas and the Civil Service, did you?  Wrong.&rdquo;  He believes that to a large extent the country is run by the legal profession and the Judiciary. He says if one were to set up a small manufacturing plant employing ten people, making plastic clothes pegs, one would receive assistance and support from the IDA in the form of feasability study grants and perhaps free premises. Despite that, one would run into problems with public liability and workers' compensation insurance.  He believes it is no wonder there is unemployment as it is so expensive to employ people.  Those who consider setting up enterprises would have them fully automated, because machines could not bring actions against them.  I agree this is a terrible pity.</P>
    <P>Dr. Rynne believes it is now almost a liability to be insured because if it is believed a company is not insured, a <Col N="1012" /> potential claimant will realise blood cannot be got from a stone and the employer will be left alone.  He also believes the high cost of insurance is destroying enterprise and employment and encouraging the black economy.</P>
    <P>Legislation on this issue has been promised for a long time and we were told things would change.  However, the time for change has now come.  The Ministers, Deputy Brennan and his predecessor Deputy O'Rourke, have at various stages said they are examining this matter.  The unemployment problem is so serious that we should do something about it urgently.</P>
    <P>Some of the measures I propose have already been mentioned by my colleague so I will not repeat them.  One further recommendations is that counsel for the plaintiff and for the defendant should be able to address the court on the amount of damages each believes should be paid. At present this is not possible.  We also believe that, in relation to lodgements in court, solvent defendants such as insurance companies should be permitted to engage in a system of sealed offers. They should not be required to lodge the cash in court at the commencement of the case.</P>
    <P>We are all familiar with cases taken on a &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; basis.  Many of these cases are unreasonable.  Where such a case is thrown out of court the solicitor should be liable for the costs of a defendant. If this happened many unreasonable cases would not come before the courts. Will the Minister consider bringing some of the measures we asked for into this House before the end of January?  He too must realise the serious consequence this has for employment in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in supporting the broad thrust of this motion and what it attempts to achieve. I have even less difficulty in supporting the general concern it expresses in relation to the escalation of costs in law cases.  However, I have some reservations on particular aspects, which I will mention before I get to the main body of my statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have reservations with that element of the motion which refers to the capacity <Col N="1013" /> of local authorities and voluntary bodies &mdash; I do not associate the two &mdash; to discharge their duties in that court decrees are meant to somehow undermine their capacity.  In 1961, the Oireachtas passed the Civil Liability Act, which made local authorities liable for non-feasance, in addition to misfeasance; misfeasance being where there was an active intervention on the part of the local authority, non-feasance being when there was a failure on the local authority to take necessary actions, as a consequence of which there was injury.  That section was passed and was to come into effect when the Minister of the day made the appropriate order.  Some 32 years later, we are still waiting for that ministerial order.  We should not start operating on the basis that where local authorities, particularly as a statutory body, fail to do what they should or are guilty of negligence &mdash; there are many such cases &mdash; we should try to protect them against the consequences of their own failure.  I would not be a party to that kind of action.</P>
    <P>Sometimes, simplistic solutions are presented to reduce the costs of various insurance claims.  We have heard about them and some have already been put in place.  The insurance companies lobbied strongly and consistently for the abolition of juries on the grounds that juries who make the decisions are spending other people's moneys.  I was in Government when the leader of the party moving this motion abolished juries.  It did not have the effect that those who proposed the abolition of juries envisaged because other, more basic matters, had to be taken into account.  Other simplistic proposals are now being suggested which are equally inadequate and unsuitable. One might as well say that the press have a good case when they call for a restriction on the right to damages after being brought before a jury for libel or slander.  The level of compensation is higher than most people would reasonably agree it should be.  We should put out of the reckoning comparisions with other countries where conditions are different, especially places like Spain, Portugal and Greece, &mdash; ask any Irish tourists who have been unfortunate enough to have been injured there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> There are two elements in damages in every case.  First, there is the element of general damages for pain and suffering. That is, of course, a subject of measurement. I agree that one judge's view may vary from that of another.  Now that I am back in that trade myself, I admit that my own judgment of the valuation of a case will vary from that of other counsels from time to time.  I have been away from the profession for a while, so obviously I am not up-to-date with current valuations, but I am picking them up quickly.  Counsel can disagree, so can judges.  There is a need to set certain guidelines, but not, with due deference and respect to the Minister, the kind of approach which he has been heard to suggest recently of putting a cap on awards.  Without wearing my other hat as a lawyer, I would say that would run a grave risk of being unconstitutional.  I imagine that everyone involved should consider and consult wisely and fully before any such cap was introduced.  The role of the court is to administer justice between citizen and citizen and between citizen and the State.  It appears, without going into it in great detail, that this approach would run a great risk &mdash; if I were advising in law, I would say in all probability &mdash; of being struck down as unconstitutional.  That said, however, this need still remains.  I will suggest some areas that can and should be looked at.</P>
    <P>If someone receives a serious injury, compensation is payable for general damages for pain and suffering for the past and future &mdash; two different elements are added &mdash; and special damages, what we call out of pocket expenses.  Out of pocket expenses have to be repaid, but the general damages will include damages for the future in the expectation that the plaintiff will survive for a normal span of life.  It often happens that plaintiffs may, through accidents or natural causes, die much earlier than anticipated by the court giving the award.  What are the consequences?  People who have no claim for damages for injury for pain or suffering&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;get the benefit of the major award to the plaintiff who would have been entitled to it if they had survived.  There is one practical way in which that amount can be reduced and I cannot understand why it has not been done.  One should measure, on an annualised basis, compensation payable to the plaintiff to include pain and suffering and special damages or loss of income capacity.  I cannot understand why insurance companies do not demand this. I feel it is because it would involve them in actuarial calculations that might be a nuisance for them but it would certainly reduce the overall liability, funding and cost to the citizen.</P>
      <P>In every case we are introducing statutory provisions for certain elements of contributory negligence.  This has been one of the major changes in court since I last practised six years ago.  If one gets into a car with a driver who obviously has taken drink more than likely the court will either hold that this will disentitle one to compensation or substantially reduce one's level of damages for contributory negligence.  Since one ignored the old maxim of the law of <i>volenti non fit injuria,</i> a person cannot complain about the consequences of their own willing action, a person who is willing cannot complain about injury.  If I get into a car with a drunken driver, I cannot complain afterwards if I suffer the natural consequences of that action.  That should be put into statutory effect.  It is significant that most of the major injuries in accidents occur through excessive rates of speed or reckless driving while under the influence of drink.  That is my second point.</P>
      <P>My final point relates to employers' liability, and particularly occupiers' liability. I have great sympathy with farmers in this instance.  A culture has grown up that if one comes on to a farmer's land for whatever reason, the farmer is at risk. The law in that area, as established in common law, was clear and secure from the occupier's or owner's point of view when I left practice in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed to hear that some judicial or jury decisions in the meantime sought to put an onus on people for things they could not have been aware of and for which they should not have been liable.  I <Col N="1016" /> see no reason we cannot introduce statute law here to leave it beyond doubt that a person can only be liable, particularly an owner occupier, for what he or she could be reasonably held to foresee as being a natural consequences of their failure.  That would protect farmers and occupiers generally for something that could not be the reasonable and natural consequence of their failure.</P>
    <P>I have only touched on the issue and I hope I have taken a balanced approach. I saw Senator Cosgrave shudder, as I imagine Deputy O'Malley would have in his time when he was a practising solicitor, regarding the principle Senator Dardis suggested &mdash; if a solicitor takes on a case on a no foal no fee basis and the case is lost, the solicitor be held liable for the defendant's costs.  I do not think the Senator's former leader would have been very enthusiastic about that.</P>

      <P>I have taken fully on board what Senator Dardis said about land owners. I understand his point.  Senator Honan talked about previous claims, that these should be transparent in a court case and very much on the floor of the court.  That makes sense and I will look at it.  The duty to take care is obviously something we must also take a close look at.  Regarding uniformity of awards, I had little difficulty with what Senator Honan said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Kennedy that this is not a simplistic matter; it is very complicated and sensitive.  His point <Col N="1017" /> about for life only awards is interesting and one we should examine.  It makes sense.  His example about drink driving is also a point I have no difficulty in accepting.  He also made a suggestion that legislation should deal with owner occupiers to the extent that one can foresee the damage.</P>
    <P>All the suggestions made demonstrate the complexity of the issue.  I thank the Senators who have already spoken and those who will speak.  I will look closely at every suggestion to see if we can give them effect.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the present level of motor, employers and public liability insurance costs are now seriously damaging the Irish economy, particularly in terms of employment.  My Department estimates that insurance costs to business are now running at about £400 million annually.  Another £300 million can be added to that in terms of the rest of society.  The cost now of insurance in this small economy is running at about £700 million per annum.  That is approximately the amount of premia paid but it is also approximately the amount of awards paid out.  This is a figure I would like the opportunity to check and recheck before I go any further, but in so far as I can check it at the moment, if the EC average applied in this country today that £700 million figure would be £300 million.</P>
    <P>I take Senator O'Kennedy's warning about countries such as Greece and Portugal. Against that, this is an Internal Market, a Community, and we must compete in it.  Am I to ask Irish business to carry additional costs over and above what other countries have to carry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Senator's point but it is a matter of what the economy can afford.  In comparative terms the fact that insurance costs in Ireland are considerably higher than in other <Col N="1018" /> member states does affect Irish firms and our ability to create employment.  It moves those jobs elsewhere.  The present level of insurance awards makes it much more difficult to tackle the area of unemployment.</P>
      <P>Analysis of data available to my Department from a variety of sources indicates that the pain and suffering element of personal injury compensation represents a major component of insurance costs.  For example, I note in the material published every year that in 1991 the average cost of public liability was £5,757.  Ten years ago, adjusting for inflation to bring the figure up to today, that figure would have been £2,900. There has been a 98 per cent increase in public liability costs in ten years.</P>
      <P>I have received thousands of letters since this issue gained prominence but I had a letter this morning from a small firm in Dublin which employs 60 people and has a turnover of £3 million.  They wrote to me in despair telling me they had just received a letter from their brokers regarding their public liability and employers liability bill, which was £40,000 last year, but this year they would like a cheque for £80,000.  That firm has appealed to me to look at its case but it is not an isolated case.  It is repeated over and over again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am seriously concerned about how companies in this economy will manage next year.  My desk is piled high with letters from small Irish companies which tell me straight out that they simply cannot get public liability insurance.  We tackle the insurance companies and they say they quoted them, but the figure was so exorbitant as to keep them out of the market.  I would not mind if insurance companies were making money but from the formal data we have it is clear that they are losing money hand over fist.  I am no apologist for insurance companies. I deal with the figures as I find them.  The figures this year show that the underwriting losses are £57 million; that is the difference between what insurance companies take in and what they pay out. Ten years ago that figure was less than £19 million.  It is not that the insurance companies are filling their coffers.  From what I can see &mdash; and I am very objective <Col N="1019" /> about insurance companies &mdash; the only way they will stay afloat is by their investment income, lodging the premium long enough to get a few bob in interest and taking it from there.</P>
    <P>I would not like anyone to be in doubt about the size of the problem.  Motor premia are 98 per cent higher in this country than in the European Community. That information is published by the motor advisory group.  I do not invent these statistics, I take them as I find them, but motor claims in this economy are 160 per cent higher than the EC average.  I take Senator O'Kennedy's warning, privately and publicly, about taking other economies into account.  I have to deal with the European averages because that is our market place now.  We are the only country that is paying out more than we are taking in; we are paying out £115 for every £100 we take in.</P>
    <P>Another firm came to see me recently and showed me their profit and loss account.  They are paying 50 per cent of their payroll in employers' liability and public liability.  In other words, if they were paying £100,000 in wages, they were paying £50,000 in employers and public liability insurance.  That was a steel company which has particularly high risks.  It is an unusual example but it shows the nature of the problem.</P>
    <P>An examination of 1,600 High Court cases showed that compensation for pain and suffering amounted to 75 per cent of the total compensation awarded.  A recent survey of 385 personal injury claims by the Irish Brokers Association revealed that compensation for pain and suffering comprised 80 per cent of the total compensation paid in respect of these claims.  Personal injury compensation in total represents 67 per cent of the claims payout in motor insurance and almost all the claims payout for employers' and public liability insurance.  In summary, pain and suffering compensation represents a total penalty on employment of £300 million annually.</P>
    <P>The Government is aware of the problems created for employment costs and for the private motorist by a level of insurance costs which policyholders find <Col N="1020" /> difficult to pay.  Measures identified by the inter-ministerial group on insurance aimed at reducing the frequency of accidents and claims and the administrative, including legal, costs of settling claims, have either been implemented or are being pursued.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied these measures, although beneficial, will not result in insurance costs being reduced to levels closer to those in competing economies.  The insurance reform unit which I recently established in my Department is examining ways and means of reducing the levels of pain and suffering compensation which, as I have demonstrated, represents a high cost element in the economy.</P>
    <P>By its nature, pain and suffering compensation is difficult to quantify.  We rely on the courts and court procedures to make awards which are fair and equitable to the plaintiff in the circumstances of each case.  It is, however, difficult to accept that the value placed on pain and suffering in this jurisdiction should be consistently higher than the value placed on such compensation in neighbouring jurisdictions, irrespective of their legal systems.  I do not agree with Senator O'Kennedy when he points to other economies.  This is the community in which we operate and we must take it as we find it.</P>
    <P>It would make sense economically and socially if levels of compensation were related to the ability of the economy and society to pay.  In recent months lawyers have asked me not to place a cap on awards because they are fair.  I have said they may be fair, but can we afford them? This is an entirely different equation. This small economy can only do what it can afford to do.  What is fair is a subjective matter and is a separate issue.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies do not fund the current level of awards but rather insurance policyholders.  That point has not been made loudly enough.  Insurance companies do not pay awards, the public pay them.  They simply pass on costs in a tax collection process.  It is not possible to recover all the cost, or even a substantial proportion of the cost, of compensation from those who are judged at fault for personal injuries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> The present level of pain and suffering compensation is borne mainly by society at large, including employers, motorists and consumers where business passes its insurance costs on to its customers.  The cost is also borne by those who do not have jobs; they might have them if our insurance costs were more in line with those in competing economies.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we need to broaden our definition of what is fair and equitable pain and suffering compensation in order to draw a better balance between the common good of society and the legitimate rights of those injured in accidents.</P>
    <P>To put it bluntly, pain and suffering compensation should be fair and equitable to those who receive it and to those who fund it.  That is a side of the equation which is not often addressed.  I am looking at measures to ensure that pain and suffering compensation is related to the extent of the injury, that it is as consistent as possible, that it is paid to third parties with minimum administrative costs, that it is transparent and seen to be fair, that it is reasonably close to European Union figures and that it is capable of adjustment. The achievement of a compensation system which meets the above considerations requires an initiative by Government and the Legislature which would demonstrate that measures introduced are in the common interest and can come close to competing economies.</P>
    <P>I suggested publicly on many occasions, and I would like to do so again this evening, that the development of proposals to achieve the objectives I outlined require the Legislature and Government to consider the possibility of introducing a range of measures.  I agree with Senator O'Kennedy that this is a complicated issue and that no one measure will deal with the situation but rather that a range of measures is required.  These measures might include a schedule of awards incorporating maximum quantums of pain and injury suffering compensation relating to the extent of the injury sustained.  I accept Senator O'Kennedy's concerns in this regard, but a number of pieces of legislation set parameters on what judges may do.  I will take the best advice from the Office of the Attorney General in regard <Col N="1022" /> to constitutional difficulties which may arise.  This matter must be seriously considered as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>A penalty should be imposed for a deliberate or conscious effort to falsify the size of a personal injury claim.  We must redraw the duties of care applicable to occupiers so there will be an extra duty on people to take care.  A provision to eliminate apparent double compensation in certain circumstances should be implemented.  There should be a facility to settle certain personal claims by means of a periodic payment of compensation &mdash; this was mentioned by Senator O'Kennedy. In addition, we must look at some solicitors' advertisements in the Golden Pages.  These advertisements state: &ldquo;No foal, no fee&rdquo;, &ldquo;I can get you as much as I can if you get here quickly&rdquo; and &ldquo;No appointment necessary&rdquo;.  I do not believe the legal profession want to be part of that Golden Pages type of operation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. I will take note of what is said throughout the debate.  This is a critical situation and evidence available to me confirms this.  Although initially it will be a decision for Government, the public will have to consider its options in this regard.  Does the public want pay £400 million more than the European average? Is the public happy to load these costs on young drivers and small companies which could affect employment or does the public want to stand by what may be its constitutional right and say the courts are the courts, we cannot interfere with them and tell judges what to award. They must be free to give out what they want.  That is their right.  It is a choice for society, not only for Ministers.  I am not minimising the extent of that choice.  If we put an upper limit on what the courts can do, the public will be asked to accept <Col N="1023" /> a limitation on their rights for the common good.  That is the equation. There are many areas where we accept a curtailment of our individual rights for the common good.  This debate will take us into that area.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Dardis and Senator Honan for tabling this motion, it is timely and I will take account of what Senators have said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael, I support the thrust of the motion.  A compensation-claim mentality has developed in this country.  At one time if a person slipped in a restaurant, a public house or a shopping centre he or she would get up immediately and hope nobody had seen them.  Today people ask how much is this worth?  When the issues of compensation and accident claims are being looked at, a differentiation must be made between minor claims and relatively minor injuries and more serious claims.  It is difficult to equate something like a relatively minor whiplash or sprained ankle with a much more serious injury like the loss of an eye or limb.</P>
      <P>The growth in fraudulent claims must be examined.  One judge recently commented on a family, ten or 12 members of which seemed to have experienced bad luck and accidents in one area.  The judge expressed concern and said that a certain street should be named after the family in recognition of their difficulties.</P>
      <P>One of the most important points in this motion is in regard to not alone discouraging fraudulent claims but pursuing them.  How many such claims have been investigated by the Garda fraud squad? One individual alleged to have been involved will not be able to claim for a while, unless it is against the governor of Mountjoy, because he recently received a custodial sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of claims and how we deal with them must be looked at.  As Senator Dardis said, even getting insurance cover for a field day or a bring-and-buy sale has grown out of all proportion. Various bodies now have to examine ways of running certain events. <Col N="1024" /> The way local authorities conduct their business must also be looked at.  Some local authorities have toughened up their attitude and are now defending many claims which has resulted in a surprising change of results.</P>
    <P>The Minister should investigate the efficiency of insurance companies and how the industry polices itself.  It was said some years ago when insurance discs were introduced for cars that the incidence of uninsured cars would fall, but, from what one reads in the papers, many people are still driving uninsured cars. What is being done about it?  It is estimated to cost the country at least £25 million a year.  We could impound uninsured cars, which was a recommendation in the MacLiam report some years ago.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of occupiers' liability.  A Bill was introduced in the other House last year by Deputy Deenihan which, although not accepted, was recognised by the Minister as having merit.  The Minister should look at it again and I would like to know what timescale he envisages for introducing the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>A compensation mentality has crept into Irish life.  Various people can be blamed for it and the legal profession may have some case to answer, although in specific rather than general cases, as Senator O'Kennedy indicated.  I would be reluctant to introduce the statutory capping of awards for serious injuries such as the loss of an eye or a limb. Senator O'Kennedy indicated that such capping could, and possibly would, prove unconstitutional.  There are areas where a balanced approach is required for a uniformity of awards.  There are obvious difficulties and there will be differences of opinion among judges.  Some lawyers and doctors make a bigger impression than others on a judge or jury.  Some years ago the abolition of juries for such cases was heralded as the panacea for all ills but it was not and the Minister's Department was wrong.</P>
    <P>One must examine the possibility of properly structured compensation payments in paraplegic cases to provide an income for the rest of their lives.  Such <Col N="1025" /> payments would keep the paraplegic in a reasonable manner and allow improvements or changes to be made to a house. Instead of paying a massive amount, an income should be paid for the duration of that person's life with a top-up at the beginning to enable initial expenses to be met.  In a case where someone is awarded a massive amount, and dies a few years later, the relatives come out of the woodwork to share the proceeds.  Unfortunately, that is the case so certain structural income awards should be looked at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>And the relatives suffered no pain at all, is that not right? Only a lot of pleasure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>They are certainly compensated in some way.</P>
      <P>The administration of cases by the courts must also be looked at.  Senator O'Kennedy is aware that many cases take years to come to court.  Some aspects can be improved and speeded up.  At times cases can be speeded up by agreeing on reports.  At the moment, doctors on stand-by command a fee although they may never appear as a witness in a court case.  These matters must be looked at.  I am not denying that doctors, no more than any other profession, must earn a living, but certain aspects of the administration of cases must be examined.</P>
      <P>Insurance companies could look more seriously into settling cases at an earlier stage.  If there is a meeting of minds, cases can be agreed which would bring about substantial savings.  Will the Minister take a hard look at this question and take on board what Senators said?  I agree with Senator Dardis that trivial, nuisance cases should, by and large, be cut out. People who are badly injured should receive proper damages.</P>
      <P>I sum up by quoting the late Mr. Justice McCarthy who wrote, in Dr. John White's book <i>The Irish Law of Damages:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assessment of general damages for pain and suffering is a most inexact <Col N="1026" /> science.  The best that a court can do is to try to see that the assessment is within certain bounds having regard to past experience, continuing attitudes and the true value of money.  The underlying concept of damages for personal injuries used to be described to a jury as an attempt to put the plaintiff back into the position in which he would have been if the accident and the injury had not occurred.  A patently impossible task.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to respond positively and consider all the points raised.  A simple solution cannot be found.  The issue must be examined, costs must be reduced and greater efficiency introduced. I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the motion. Insurance claims form the greatest growth industry at present although I sometimes wonder if an injured person gets all that much money.  As Senator Cosgrave said, the procedures take too long.  The injured party borrows from a bank.  When the claim comes through, after repaying the loan and paying legal fees, he or she has little of the claim left.  I have seen cases where people were poorer when the claim was settled and wasted their lives hopping on crutches when they could have been walking if the claim had been settled much earlier.</P>
      <P>The Bill should protect people against unreasonable claims.  It is ridiculous that if a burglar falls and hurts himself while robbing a house, he can claim against the house owner.  Anybody who comes uninvited on to someone else's property, farm or a business, should not be entitled to claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few mornings ago on radio Gay Byrne asked who would want to be in business today after a person was awarded £6,000 having claimed that, while looking at dresses in a drapery shop in Dublin, a garment fell on her, she was hit on the head and damaged by the tag attached to it for security reasons.  This is ridiculous.  Everybody knows a tag could not cause that much injury.  I must be the greatest fool that ever wore shoes.  I fell <Col N="1027" /> and broke two bones in my back in a mart, was in hospital for three weeks and had to lie on a plank bed for three months but I never claimed a penny.  Thank God I am none the worse for it.  During a Senate election campaign I fell coming out of a guesthouse in Dundalk and broke my right arm.  I was in hospital for a week and had a pin inserted but I did not claim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>That was an extreme method of looking for the sympathy vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get the sympathy vote because I lost my seat.  Anybody who enters politics or business and hopes to get sympathy is very foolish.  There is no sentiment in either field, I assure you.</P>
      <P>Our roads are not that dangerous.  It amazes me that although thousands of people can walk on a footpath without falling, one person can fall and claim it is dangerous.  If it was dangerous, everybody would fall or step out on the road to avoid it.  Thousands of people walk on O'Connell Street and other streets in Dublin, Sligo and elsewhere and see nothing wrong whereas one person may fall without being seen by anyone and make a claim.  I know of a case where a person tripped on the step of an aluminium door when leaving a restaurant. The person was picked up, looked at and asked if they wanted a doctor.  They had no visible injuries except for a little scratch on a knee.  However, a week or a fortnight later they sent a solicitor's letter to the restaurant.  Such cases always amaze me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every town there is a solicitor who is well known for handling claims.  They advertise offering free consultation and, as the Minister said, no foal, no fee. However, there can be a danger in this. I know of a lady who took a case against a public body on a no foal, no fee basis. Unfortunately, the case was lost.  It cost her a large amount of money because, although her own solicitor did not charge her, she had to pay the defendant's solicitor. I sometimes think the legal profession have agreed on an inbuilt protection.  If the claim is not allowed the <Col N="1028" /> person making the claim will lose a great deal of money.  If no foal, no fee arrangements did not pay solicitors well, such cases would not be continued.</P>
    <P>These cases cause a great deal of heartache and will put many firms out of business. I pity people who look for insurance today.  I am sure Members received a letter from the AA recently seeking their business and offering attractive quotes.  I have been driving for 46 years and never had an accident or made a claim in that time.  I am with Norwich Union, which is a very good insurance company, and have no intention of changing.  For curiosity I filled out the AA form.  About a month later I received a letter from them saying they would prefer not to give me a quote. If I could not get a quote, given my long period of accident free driving, how can people with no record get quotes?</P>
    <P>I do not know where people will get insurance in the near future.  It is not the insurance companies who pay but the policy holders.  A stop must be put to this.  I would welcome a cap on the level of awards although I know the legal profession do not want it.  We are told the levels of awards in Ireland are not as great as those in Europe.  If we are looking for parity with the rest of Europe in other areas, we should also have parity in this area.  However, we want all the benefits of EU membership, when it suits us, but we do not want any of the drawbacks, when it does not suit us.  Many businesses cannot continue to pay high insurance premiums.  When I started in business in 1964 my public liability insurance for a garage and petrol pumps was £20.  My daughter is now paying £560.  I hate to think of what this would be in the event of a claim.  This situation will put many people out of work.</P>
    <P>Claims of the order of £0.5 million or £1 million should not be paid.  An annual or monthly sum should be paid to ensure the injured person can live comfortably for the rest of their life rather than a lump sum.  Very often the family, friends and relatives benefit from such large payments. Like many people who have won the lotto, people who are awarded large lump sums may not have a penny after <Col N="1029" /> nine or ten years.  I have always maintained there are two things in this world which require careful handling, brains and money.  Some of our most brilliant people are working behind bars and counters.  Like the lighthouse in the bog, they are brilliant but useless.  The same thing happens to people when they get a large amount of money.  They do not know how to handle it.  It is a case of &ldquo;easy come easy go&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I know an itinerant who was awarded a large amount as a result of an accident in Sligo about 30 years ago.  Shortly afterwards he was back at the crossroads where I lived, he was on the road again. Somebody asked him if he was back on the road again &mdash; he had a house in Sligo &mdash; despite all the money he got.  He replied that the money had not lasted long because it was shared between a good few people.  This is what happens to compensation, people get it, think there is no tomorrow and then it is gone.  I would prefer to see it capped and weekly payments made.  The practice of acting on a no foal, no fee basis is encouraging.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies are to blame for much of this.  They started this system of settling claims under £10,000 out of court.  That opened the floodgates because they would settle any kind of case.  We were told that headrests were put on car seats to prevent whiplash. However, while every car now has those headrests, the problem of whiplash has not been solved.  Measures taken do not solve the problem.  I am delighted this motion is before the House and I thank Senator Dardis for tabling it.  It something we all have to think about because all of us who pay insurance pay a portion of those claims.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the motion which is similar to one Senator Quinn and I put down some time ago.  I would <Col N="1030" /> like to address the issue, which Senator Cosgrave brought up, of professional witnesses. About two years ago, the Bar Council, the Incorporated Law Society and the Insurance Federation of Ireland set up a joint committee to look at the situation regarding professional witnesses. They submitted their findings and suggestions to the Attorney General and to the committee of the courts.  However, both felt the suggestions would require legislation so they were sent to the Department of Justice but nothing happened since.</P>
      <P>A great deal of savings could be made in this area.  I speak mainly from the point of view of professional medical witnesses but there are other professional witnesses too.  A great deal of money is spent to little avail to the public good.  For example, actuaries' findings are usually mathematical so they are rarely cross-examined in court.  It costs a lot of money to bring these witnesses to court and it costs them a lot of money to be there. Architects and engineers generally bring plans and maps which could probably be far better dealt with if they were looked at before the case.  It is important to remember that it not only involves the cost of bringing witnesses to court, but the cost of them going to court, because they are away from their practices.</P>
      <P>The Fair Trade Commission report on court cases concluded that a quarter of the costs were incurred in summoning professional witnesses to court and that this cost could be cut in half if account was taken of the professional witnesses' work.  They should come to court only in cases where there were disputes between professional witnesses from both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Great Britain all medical negligence claims must be accompanied by a medical report before they can be submitted but here a person can make a statement of claim without any medical report.  A large number of medical negligence and personal injury cases are dismissed because the medical evidence does not follow up. The medical defence companies and other insurances waste a great deal of time and money looking at cases which <Col N="1031" /> are not pursued because there was no original medical claim with them.</P>
    <P>We should follow the practice in Great Britain where after the defence has put forward its case, a time is set for handing down judgment.  Within ten weeks, the protagonists must submit the names of their expert witnesses and what they will say.  Unless there is a long delay in the trial these submissions cannot be changed.  This seems to have led to savings in Great Britain and it would be worthwhile trying it here rather than having expert witnesses arriving in the High Court and the case being concluded on the steps of the courts.  It would be a great step forward in helping to reduce the costs of court cases to which Senator Dardis referred.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Henry for allowing me to share her time.  It is only six months since we debated this matter in this House and the situation has worsened since then.  At the time I talked about the fact that each household is paying £26 per week in costs, the cost of compensation in various forms, regardless of whether cases have been settled out of court.  I welcome this debate.  I am delighted Senators Dardis and Honan put down this motion, which we must support.</P>
      <P>My concern &mdash; not only about the whole legal profession but particularly about the attitude of the Judiciary &mdash; is that a standard is not being maintained. I will relate to the House three short incidents from my own experience which happened in our stores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first case a customer came into a store in the whole of her health and left with a broken toe because one of the supermarket trolleys had been knocked over on her foot.  Afterwards, I asked friends how much they thought she should have been awarded.  Everybody agreed on a figure between £1,000 and £3,000.  I explained that she had not been awarded one penny because she had not been able to prove negligence.  The judge said he could not find any cause of negligence because the trolley was intact. <Col N="1032" /> The barrister acting for the defendant said that if the jury found that having a trolley which can be knocked over is negligent, then they must find every parent of a baby in a pram guilty of negligence.  The jury and the judge found that the defendant &mdash; us in that case &mdash; was not negligent.  This woman who had entered the store in the whole of her health and left with a broken toe received nothing.</P>
    <P>Another case involved a customer who came into one of our stores and slipped on the floor.  She left, having hurt herself, and went to a solicitor who encouraged her to take action.  She took action and went to considerable expense but received nothing because she was not able to prove negligence.  She had gone to considerable trouble because she had not, as Senator Farrell spoke about, done it on a no foal, no fee basis.</P>
    <P>The third story involved a customer who went into one of our stores where a packet of cornflakes fell on her.  She was advised to take action which she did on a no foal, no fee basis.  She went to considerable trouble and cost and lost the case.  She came back to me saying she could not believe that she was down £2,000 and asked if I could help her out. She did not understand that there was an unfairness because she had been led to believe that if one gets hurt on a premises one is entitled to recompense even if the defendant is not negligent.</P>
    <P>In those three cases the judge advised and found that we were not negligent. These people, who had been coaxed and encouraged to take cases lost a considerable sum of money.  I am only taking those three examples because there are many other stories where people have taken similar cases and were awarded considerable sums of money.  My point is that the Judiciary is not balanced, it seems to act on a whim.  However, the law seems to say, as far as we can see, that if one claims for an injury one must claim negligence on the part of the person responsible.  Some judges seem to understand that but other judges and juries believe that if a burglar falls in one's house, as Senator Farrell spoke about, <Col N="1033" /> he has a right to sue.  It seems that some decisions are made as outrageously as that.</P>
    <P>I repeated those stories because I felt that rather than cover the ground already covered, perhaps it is wise to concentrate on how we solve this problem.  I do not know the solution but the first step is a change of attitude and this is why I do not fully support the part of the motion which seems to call on the Government to do something.  I am not sure it is all that easy for the Government to do something to solve this.  We, as a nation, have to do it by changing our attitude to the whole area of compensation.  We should recognise that if somebody is negligent, they should pay and if they are not negligent, they should not pay.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that our attitude needs to change.  If we do that, we will reduce costs, that was my main motive when Senator Henry and I put down a similar motion last June.  The motive then was to see if we can make Ireland more competitive.  In this area we are making ourselves outrageously uncompetitive and that puts us at a disadvantage.  We have one hand tied behind our back when we try to create jobs.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that this motion was put forward today because it gives us an opportunity to make, once again, the case for a change of attitude.  I know the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Brennan, has already put forward proposals in this area.  They are all steps in the right direction but the fault lies with us.  We must take action and we should ensure that we do so in the coming year.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and compliment Senator Dardis on his motion.  There is no doubt that a compensation culture prevails at present which is particularly obvious to those working in the local authorities and <Col N="1034" /> the health boards.  My interest is in the area of local authorities.</P>
      <P>As a member of Donegal County Council, I see that for the year 1993, public liability insurance, which covers more than the area we are discussing, was in the region of £227,000.  It is expected that the excess at the end of the year will be about £75,000.  On that basis public liability insurance will be much higher and money will be taken from the funds raised by water and commercial rates and so on.  At the end of the day the taxpayer will pay.</P>
      <P>At present people take a case to court at the drop of a hat.  More cases should be contested because there are far too many fraudulent claims.  It is becoming a growth industry.  I received some figures from Northern Ireland, it is worse there and the British are seriously examining the situation arising from the number of fraudulent claims and contesting more of these cases.</P>
      <P>There are genuine cases and these people need to be helped.  People fall and have to be compensated because it may be the fault of someone who owns a shop where the floor was wet.  Those cases must be supported but lawyers and barristers should not encourage people to take every case under the sun.</P>
      <P>I recently saw a case where a gentleman was injured.  The county council were working on the road next to his house and had an agreement with him to replace a gate.  He was not happy with the gate, he wanted a wrought iron gate. As he was not satisfied with that when it was put up they took it away.  When they were changing it, his child ran on to the street.  He ran after the child, fell on the street and broke a limb.  He took the case to the court on the ground that if the county council had the gate up, he would not have had to run after the child.  He received compensation of £10,000.</P>
      <P>The motion is a good one.  The cost at the end of the day is being borne by the general public and the taxpayer.  I welcome the motion and legislation should be enacted to discourage many of the cases taken.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Maloney for sharing his time with me.  This issue has raised emotions in the hearts and minds of many people.  It represents something that goes to the very core of the moral and ethical reasons for the law of tort.  The majority of speakers welcomed this motion and called for legislation arising from cases they outlined. There have been fraudulent claims and people have been unjustly enriched in some circumstances.  However, if somebody is injured, they are entitled to have that wrong put to right.</P>
      <P>There are parts of the motion proposed by Senator Dardis with which I agree, such as the discouragement of fraudulent claims.  There is no problem there.  The provision of more realistic duties of care for landowners, employers and owners of premises is quite easy to implement. The safeguarding of defendants from nuisance and trivial claims is also easy to enforce.  The courts do it every day; one does not even have to legislate for it.</P>
      <P>I would have a difficulty with the concept of a statutory framework for the calculation of damages.  A situation is created where the loss of a leg may be worth £10,000 while the loss of a leg from the knee down is worth £8,000 and so on for the loss of an arm or an eye.  One cannot calculate the continued hardship an injured person will suffer.  Actuaries can assess loss of income and potential extra expenditure arising from an injury or disability but the courts must have sufficient leeway to ensure people are adequately catered for in future life.</P>
      <P>Having had an accident, suffered an injury and gone through a legal case, I know exactly what it took to readjust my life as well as the continuing expense involved and extra expenses likely to arise due to my injuries on an ongoing basis.  It may be ten years before I need to make that expenditure but it is 99 per cent certain that it will happen.  Various individuals will incur different levels of expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are fortunate that our legal system and Judiciary have taken a compassionate view in the majority of cases. As some people said, at times they have <Col N="1036" /> been slightly off track and over compensated some people and under compensated others.  However, removing the human element from personal injuries cases is really interfering with basic natural rights which are superior to any positive law we may enact here.  One should not interfere with the right to claim damages for personal injuries and any legislation enacted to do so could be struck down on grounds of unconstitutionality.</P>
    <P>Through the years, insurance companies have said that high insurance premia and the cost of insurance is due to the high level of claims.  The claims may have some relevance to the premium one pays.  Insurance companies fought for many years for the abolition of juries in personal injury cases.  Many political people objected but eventually the Government of the day decided to get rid of juries in personal injury cases and leave it to the judges.  The insurance companies were happy with that arrangement, but now say the judges are giving too much money, they do not know how to assess a claim and that we have to put a cap on the amount of damages a person can receive for personal injuries.</P>
    <P>This is an insurance scam, not in the sense that someone is trying to defraud the insurance company but in the sense that the insurance companies are defrauding the consumer.  I feel they have been allowed to get away with it for too long.</P>
    <P>This motion is anathema to me and to my way of thinking.  I have had many discussions with the Minister, Deputy Brennan, about reforming this area, and all our discussions have ended in disagreement because we hold opposite viewpoints.  My fear is that people who suffer a personal injury and are left incapacitated and needing constant care &mdash; perhaps paraplegic, quadriplegic or even with severe brain damage &mdash; will not be catered for.  Senator O'Kennedy commented on this and his view is similar to mine.  He said that a framework should be set up whereby the damages could be paid on an annual basis so that people would have the income as they need it and they would not have a chance to <Col N="1037" /> spend the full award when they get it. That is the angle we should be taking on it.</P>
    <P>To put a cap on any award is wrong.  It interferes with natural justice and with people's personal rights to set up a statutory framework saying that a leg is worth a certain amount.  Today my leg is worth, maybe £50 to me.  In reality there is no use for my leg at the moment, but what is the soccer player, Niall Quinn's, leg worth to him?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

      <P>About £25 at the moment, I should think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>If you enact legislation on the basis of a book with different amounts for each different type of injury huge injustice will be done.  This system would not allow the courts the flexibility to decide when more or less should be given.  The courts have that discretion at the moment and despite what people say, they do not always give the full amounts. Senator Quinn pointed out three cases that failed.  The insurance companies would say that every one of those cases succeeded because the judge found in their favour.  Senator Quinn said there were juries involved in two of these cases, so getting rid of the juries was probably the biggest mistake the insurance companies ever made.  With those few words, a Chathaoirligh, I will conclude.  I thank Senator Maloney again for sharing his time with me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most topical discussions we have had in this House and the fact that we discussed it six months ago does not take from the debate tonight because it is well known that we still pay too much for insurance of all sorts &mdash; car insurance, employers liability and public liability insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course there is a paranoia among all sorts of groups and voluntary bodies who want to get the public to come to their functions but are afraid they will be hit with a huge insurance claim which <Col N="1038" /> they will not be able to handle.  That is a widespread problem.  However, there is the other side of the coin.  Everybody is aware that they can make insurance claims.</P>
    <P>Advertising has been mentioned.  I do not know whether it is possible to stop people advertising because a lot of the time our citizens are not aware of their rights.  Some people might say that a number of solicitors' advertisements made spurious promises.  I am not sure if that is so.  In America solicitors advertise on books of matches &mdash; 0800 lawsuit is the number used.  Advertising there has been taken to an incredible degree and I imagine that is what will happen here in the future.</P>
    <P>Anything that makes people aware of their rights cannot be bad.  However, there is a negative side to this.  Some solicitors probably go over the top a bit on the no foal, no fee business.  It is leading to difficulties for insurance companies. I ran a campaign on this about three years ago.  As the Minister, Deputy Brennan, said, he is getting many letters from all over the country about it.  I got mail from people all over Ireland and the things I learned at that time led me to believe that insurance companies were very negligent in the way they ran their businesses.</P>
    <P>I was told about the following practice. A person buys a crashed vehicle on which an insurance claim has been paid and insures it with a different insurance company. Some time later he telephones the insurance company, says there has been an accident and makes another substantial claim on the basis of the original accident which happened when the car was somebody else's property.  That practice was widespread according to the information I got at the time.</P>
    <P>Thankfully as a result of my campaign the position has improved and the insurance companies now cross-reference claims, and not before time.  We still see cases in the paper where individuals are using cars for all sorts of reasons.  Cars are not bought just for driving, they can be used to provide an income.  A person buys a fairly modern <Col N="1039" /> car in bad condition and makes sure that somebody crashes into it.  He will have three passengers with him and the other driver will also have three passengers. Not alone will there be eight personal injuries claims but there will be insurance claims for the cars which would not be sustainable if the quality and condition of the car were known beforehand.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of fraud in the system and I suppose it is hard to make an honest pound in Ireland today.  Many people find it very hard to survive and turn therefore to crime.  The more unemployment there is, the more crime there will be. Because the graphs of unemployment and crime climb together it is very hard to control this fraud but the Minister is promising to make a good effort.  I hope he suceeds.  In the middle of my campaign an inter-ministerial group was set up and they made changes which helped.</P>
    <P>There is a certain stability now in the cost of car insurance for young drivers, although it has stabilised at a very high level.  There is a ludicrous situation where a young man buys a small car, eight or nine years old, in fairly good condition and pays £900 for it.  Then he insures it and if he is under 25, he can pay up to £2,000 a year.  I know the insurance companies have their ways of setting the fees and much of it has to do with the fact that young lads tend to be more accident prone than young lassies, and young people in general tend to be more accident prone than their elders, however, insurance costs are incredible.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Senator Henry talking about professional witnesses and when she started I wondered to which group she was referring.  In fact she was referring to the true professionals, doctors and other expert witnesses, but there are many professional witnesses who get away with it much of the time.  We can all call to mind a story where two cars bang into one another on a lonely country road, with only a driver in each car, and no witnesses.  A dispute arises and when the case comes to court there is a witness for one party who says that he or she was in a field when it happened. <Col N="1040" /> No one saw the witness but he or she was there.  There are professional witnesses of that kind around the country as well. Fraud is widespread and we all know it. The Government must tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>In the last couple of years claims have not been going through the courts as easily as they had and some of these gangsters are being caught.  Not before time, because for a certain period these people made a lot of money and we were paying through the nose.  Some of the judges are picking up on this now, some of the Garda are looking into the background of people who are making claims and some solicitors are being more careful. Now the gangster is caught and the fellow making the £10,000 or £15,000 claim is not getting away with it.</P>
    <P>This is a huge problem and the figures the Minister gave us are genuine.  A sum of £400 million is a colossal amount to be divided between those who pay insurance every year.  It is a huge cost to bear.  It is costing us jobs and this situation cannot be sustained.  We are all aware of the difficulties.  However, there are two sides to the argument when we talk about capping claims and it is an argument that will continue.  We can expect people to have an attitude that is wholesome and good; we can try to create an ethos which is good, but that is difficult to achieve in the present climate.  There is not a lot of respect for truth or honesty these days.  I do not know how we will achieve that since many insurance claims are questionable.</P>
    <P>I received letters from people involved in car accidents &mdash; if they could be called that &mdash; where they would have touched the car in front.  The impact would have been enough to break the tail light but would not have done any structural damage to the car.  The persons involved agreed to replace the tail light and went on their way.  Two weeks later they got a letter from a solicitor indicating that there was a personal injury claim from the driver of the other car who had suffered whiplash.  I had many such letters when I was in the middle of my campaign.  One did not have to be an <Col N="1041" /> engineer to look at the damage and see that whiplash could not have resulted. Intellectual whiplash yes, but physical whiplash no.  Cases came before the court and awards of £10,000 or £12,000 were made.  That was a disservice to society because a couple of successful cases bring hundreds of others.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister can make some progress on this matter but if he has not made progress within the next six months, we will have to discuss this again. The more we discuss it the more we will change attitudes, and if we are honest about the way we present our thoughts here and if our voices are heard, we may bring to people's attention the fact that they are paying these claims and if their neighbours are trying to rob them they should try to stop it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion but I am a little diffident about the contentious language, and when I see a phrase such as &ldquo;the compensation culture&rdquo; it reminds me of phrases like &ldquo;the condom mentality.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be too easily used to dismiss an entire group of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested and moved to hear what Senator Crowley said because he is in a position to speak from direct personal experience of the necessity to have proper compensation and I would not wish to do away with that.  Of course we should discourage fraudulent claims: there are fraudulent claims and everybody knows it.  I have seen it in the courts and reported in the media where the same people appear as witnesses.  One well known criminal was apparently organising a clinic where he provided services for people who wanted witnesses organised so that they could get compensation. There are people who repeatedly have the same kind of accidents; they carefully and conveniently fall into small holes left by Dublin Corporation. There is also the question of aggressive advertising by solicitors which can help create an appetite since people are given <Col N="1042" /> the impression that it is easy to get compensation. There is the old Dublin saying, when you have an accident lie there and wait for compensation to set in.</P>
    <P>I speak from both sides of the fence because I have taken successful action against Dublin Corporation, and I could have taken successful actions against individuals and shop owners but did not do so because I did not feel the injuries warranted it, although I made it my business to warn the people involved of the dangers on their premises.  The reason I took an action against Dublin Corporation was that they have a habit of leaving unlighted, unpainted tar barrels where children could move them into the middle of the road and they have a practice of no longer paying watchpersons to keep their eye on these miscreants. I had the misfortune to come around a curve in a road and smack into one of these barrels which was full of cement and was virtually immovable. Luckily, I was not going too fast and was wearing my safety belt but I rearranged my nose.</P>
    <P>I will not stretch the credulity of the House by suggesting that I thereby reduced my marriage prospects, but I did not improve my appearance and it caused me considerable alarm and concern and left a permanent scar.  I would have taken the £500 or £600 which is all my car was worth if the corporation had said that it was sorry and would do something about it, but it delayed and put matters on the long finger and had to be summonsed and subpoenaed and all manner of legal steps had to be taken in order to get the corporation to come up with documentation and so on.  Its own engineer admitted to me that it was extremely dangerous when added to the practice of removing watchmen, which had been done &mdash; and this was said unofficially but directly to me &mdash; because it was cheaper to pay the damages than to pay the wages of the watchmen.  That is outrageous, and since that accident I repeatedly noticed these dangerous roadworks.</P>
    <P>I have no sympathy for the local authorities when they are in breach of <Col N="1043" /> their responsibilities.  The corporation appealed my case; my original award was for £11,000 and it was reduced to £6,000. I was pleased with that.  The corporation won a section of the case because the liability was reduced to 75 per cent, but they were foolish because I fought the case tooth and nail and by going to the High Court established a precedent in law which means that local authorities are now responsible, as they should be. If they place the welfare and lives of the public at risk they should be taught a lesson.  I believe the practice of putting off and delaying claims is wrong.</P>
    <P>My car was worth £500.  I have never had a claim against the insurance company but my insurance Bill this year is £475.  That is idiotic.  Not having had a claim against the insurers and having a no claims bonus, I have to pay almost the same amount as the cost of the car.  I have to admit one fault; I was done for drunken parking some years ago outside my house.  I was just rearranging the car. I was rather unfortunate but it was a fair cop.  I presume that might have had some impact on my premium but it did not for the first couple of years so I do not see why it should suddenly rocket now. There is a case for looking at the insurance industry and reviewing it.</P>
    <P>House premiums also need scrutiny. They continually increase and I do not know what I am paying, my house has not been broken into nor has it burst into flames.  However, the insurers are always wanting to poke around and try to force me to put in extra fire protection that would destroy its 18th century character. It is a constant battle with the insurance company and it might be no harm to look at the whole insurance industry rather than specifically targeting the victims, although there are clearly cases of fraudulent claims.</P>
    <P>It is not always just the lower orders who take these claims and the claims are not always maliciously taken.  I laughed like a drain when I read in the paper of a well heeled lad in a golf club wearing his spiked shoes, who fell and broke his <Col N="1044" /> wrist and he said in court that it had improved his golf swing and he had gone from a handicap of 13 to one of 11.  Yet he sued the golf club for something which he knew was idiotic and which improved his golf performance.  That is laughable. I hope he had the same good humour that the judge showed in throwing out that case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The thought of people poking around in Senator Norris's home has fascinating connotations.  I thank the Minister for accepting this motion and for the way he addressed it.  I also thank the House for accepting the motion.</P>
      <P>It can be said with some certainty that there is a widespread consensus about this matter.  The Minister has given us quite a few pointers as to what might be in the legislation.  I hope our contributions provided additional pointers for the legislation. I accept there are practical difficulties in framing such legislation but that is true of most legislation that comes before the House.  It can be complex and difficult but that is not a reason to avoid it.  We have discussed and analysed this matter on several occasions and it should now be possible to arrive at definite conclusions and introduce legislation early in the new year.</P>
      <P>I can assure Senator Crowley that it is not the intention of the motion to cap awards.  The motion says there should be a statutory framework which would provide some degree of regulation in the matter.  I accept that Senator Crowley's personal experience is very telling and we must bow to it.  However, I think he would accept that there is a question of degree and balance.  It is for legislation to establish the degree of balance to ensure that some of the malpractices which occur at present can, to the extent that is possible, be regulated.  If people go into court and perjure themselves I am not sure it would matter what legislation was introduced, although there would be penalties to deal with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody has recounted some personal experiences.  My personal experience this year occurred when I was walking down Clonliffe Road after the <Col N="1045" /> All Ireland hurling final.  There was the usual mill of people.  A car was progressing down the road at about two miles per hour and one of the supporters brushed against it.  I was a witness to this event and I also witnessed the compensation syndrome take hold of the supporter as time went on.  He started off not being seriously injured and wound up taking off his shoe and his sock to show the driver the extent of the damage which had been caused to him.  I could see the process taking over&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It may have been due to the fact that they were from different counties.</P>
      <P>I accept that there are practical difficulties in framing the legislation but that is not a good enough reason for not introducing it.  The Minister referred to several bodies which we have set up, including the inter-ministerial group, the insurance reform unit and others.  We get to the point where we institute another body which produces a report which moulders in the vaults of the relevant Departments and nothing is done.  Something must be done.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Kennedy referred to solicitors. It is a fact that there are solicitors who seem to if not trawl the roads in search of claimants then trawl the columns of the local papers and approach claimants.  We have heard of their advertisements in the media.  We have recommended that where the solicitor is conniving &mdash; if we can use that word &mdash; in a claim which is frivolous or a nuisance and that claim is unsuccessful in court, the costs should be exacted from the person who is responsible for bringing the claim, who may be the solicitor rather than the plaintiff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other relevant areas which should be tackled.  Many excellent community facilities cannot be made available; and schools, for example, cannot be used after school hours because of insurance problems.  The seizure of cars was mentioned by Senator <Col N="1046" /> Cosgrave and I agree we should look at the case of uninsured motorists.</P>
    <P>The Minister has accepted the thrust of my argument and I thank him for that. However, my thanks are modified by my plea that he tackle the problem through legislation.  He has spoken about the economic consequences for the country which are significant in terms of what we must pay in premia and what the local authorities and rate payers are asked to pay.  We must address those problems, apart altogether from the equity of the situation.  The Minister made a reasonable point when he said that the legislation should be fair and equitable and that the insurance industry should be fair and equitable to those who must pay.  I agree and I look forward to him introducing the legislation at an early stage. While accepting the complexities involved, many practical proposals have been made this evening which could be incorporated into the legislation.</P>
    <P>I would not like Senator O'Kennedy to believe &mdash; as I think he did &mdash; that I suggested that the local authority would be almost exempt from its responsibilities in respect of injuries to third parties and personal injuries.  I do not suggest that. Of course the local authority has responsibility to have due care and to people who are injured.  I accept Senator Crowley's point that if people suffer serious injuries, society has a responsibility to look them so that they live in comfort.  That is not in dispute.  However, with regard to the very large awards of a capital sum which is meant to provide an annual income to keep somebody in a reasonable degree of comfort, it would be much better if that were an annual payment rather than a capital sum which, in the event of the death of the person who is given the award, passes on to people who never needed it and who should not get it.  There should be a mechanism to avoid that happening.  This compensation should be paid on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn referred to the lack of consistency in awards made by the Judiciary.  A consultative body should be established to give advisory direction so <Col N="1047" /> that we can achieve uniformity in how the Judiciary handle these cases.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh freagra sásúil aige don rún atá mé ag chuir ós comhair an Tí anocht.</P>
      <P>The John Paul Centre in Galway city provides residential accommodation for 60 residents, 50 on site and two houses in the community accommodating five each.  There is also a crisis and relief unit for under sixes which provides for up to eight clients at any one time but it is only open 26 weekends in the year and is unable to meet all the requests for relief.</P>
      <P>The budget for the day to day running of the services is paid from the Department of Health after discussion with the Brother Provincial.  However, money for any new developments within the services is allocated to the regional co-ordinating committee which consists of representatives of the Western Health Board, the Galway County Association, Western Care Association and the Brothers of Charity services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people want to use this money to provide additional services such as the opening of hostels, etc.  Unfortunately, this has not happened despite the fact that the Western Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee has been told it may decide how the money will be spent for the provision of additional services.  It was told that the 1992 allocation would be used to provide additional places in Swinford, County Mayo, for mentally handicapped people from the west who were availing of the <Col N="1048" /> Dublin service.  This was done to create more vacancies in Dublin and not to help the mentally handicapped people living in the west.</P>
    <P>The allocation of £150,000 received this year was not used for new developments, but to help the Western Care Association and the Galway Mental Handicap Association to offset their financial deficit, which resulted from inadequate funding by the Western Health Board.  In spite of the Government's recent statement that it is providing additional services for mentally handicapped people through the Western Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee, this has not happened.</P>
    <P>The parents and friends of the Pope John Paul Centre have provided a purpose built house which can accommodate five mentally handicapped people.  It has been at the top of the priority list for funding for the last two years.  However, as the Government is deciding how the money should be spent, there is little likelihood it will be opened if the money allocated to the Western Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee is earmarked before they receive it.</P>
    <P>There are five mentally handicapped people attending the Pope John Paul Centre on a daily basis and their families are in need of residential accommodation. Every effort is made to provide them with short-term care, but the centre is not able to meet their needs. These families do not know what will happen if there is a crisis in the near future.  Some 21 other people attend the centre on a daily basis and their families are provided with limited short term care. Only three places are available at the Pope John Paul Centre to provide short term care at present.  When residents go home their beds are used for those who require short-term care and this is unsatisfactory. Fewer people are going home for short periods because their parents are getting old and the children are getting stronger.  In the near future the centre will be able to provide less relief for those most in need.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1049" /> We need an assurance from the Government that the money given to the Western Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee will be used as the committee decides in the light of the various proposals and not earmarked by the Government before the committee receives it.  This money must be used to provide additional services, not to bail out services underfunded by the Government.</P>
    <P>Parents associated with the Burren View Centre have campaigned over the past three years for the establishment of a service for children in the Brothers of Charity.  Three years ago the Brothers of Charity forwarded a proposal to the Department of Health for the establishment of a community based service for children with severe mental handicaps in the six to 13 year old age group. However, no additional funding has been provided by the Department of Health for this service.  These children are part of a group of severely physically and mentally handicapped children in the services of the Brothers of Charity.</P>
    <P>To date, the children have received an excellent service at the Burren View Centre based on the principles of conductive education pioneered at the Peto Institute in Budapest, Hungary.  A number of children do not have a day service because they have not been offered places at the Pope John Paul Centre in Ballybane, County Galway.</P>
    <P>In an attempt to respond to the children's needs, the Brothers of Charity have provided a service for some of the children through redeployment of existing resources.  The Brothers of Charity are resubmitting the proposal I mentioned to the Department of Health for funding in 1994.  It is imperative that the Department of Health provides the necessary funds to consolidate and develop the service commenced by the Brothers of Charity so that provision can be made as soon as possible for the children without a service.  It is hard for parents to watch their children regress <Col N="1050" /> physically and intellectually as they wait for the Department of Health to honour the commitments made in the Department's report.  <i>Needs and Abilities: A Policy for the Intellectually Disabled</i>, in 1990.</P>
    <P>It was sad to see those who work for mentally handicapped groups marching outside Leinster House in the rain last week to highlight the plight of the associations around the country and the lack of funds available to them.  Adequate funding must be provided to enable people such as those involved in the Burren View Centre and the Pope John Paul Centre in Ballybane, County Galway to develop proper services to meet the growing needs of the handicapped. I hope the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy O'Dea, whom I thanked for coming here this evening, will respond positively to this important matter.</P>

      <P>An additional £8.5 million was made available in 1993 for the development of services for people with a mental handicap.  Some £2 million of this additional funding was made available to strengthen the funding base of direct funded mental handicap agencies, including the Brothers of Charity who provide the services at the Pope John Paul Centre in Ballybane, County Galway.  Further additional funding of £4 million was allocated to the various health board regions from which £158,000 was allocated to the western region.  In addition, an allocation of £2.5 million capital funding was provided which was directly related to the service developments put in place in 1993.  This included funding of £100,000 allocated to the western region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The precise services provided in each region were agreed by the Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committees within the guidelines issues and approved by the Department of Health. The co-ordinating committees are representative <Col N="1051" /> of the health boards and the main service providers and parents in each area.  The £4 million revenue funding was used to provide a broad range of additional services, including 90 residential, emergency and respite care places, 200 day places, increased home support services and early intervention-child education and development services.</P>
    <P>The additional funding also facilitated the continued transfer of people with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals to more appropriate placements in services for people with a mental handicap.  The Western Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee, on which the Brothers of Charity are represented, agreed that the additional funding provided in 1993 for the Western Health Board region would be used to strengthen the funding base of the Galway County Association and the Western County Association.</P>
    <P>The question of the provision of additional resources in 1994 for the development of services for people with a mental handicap is currently the subject of discussions with the Minister for Finance in the context of the budgetary arrangements for 1994.  Any additional funding which may be provided will be allocated having regard to whatever guidelines may be issued by the Department of Health and the priority developments identified by the Western Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee. I assure the Senator, on behalf of the Minister for Health, that if the local co-ordinating committee gives sufficient priority to the issues raised by him, the Minister will be happy to abide by that decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, for taking this matter.  I know she is busy and I appreciate her coming to the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1052" /> I tabled this motion about St. Columba's College, Stranorlar, County Donegal, because the situation at the school is serious.  This college was built for 500 students, but its success has increased the numbers to approximately 1,200 which has created many problems for the teaching staff and parents.</P>
    <P>I understand that the finance for a commitment by the Department of Education for an extension approved approximately one year ago has not been provided and that is my principal concern.  It is discouraging that, although the college management obtained approval for a minor extension it has not been funded.</P>
    <P>To give the Minister an overall picture of the situation, more than half the students are transported by bus 16 to 20 miles, morning and evening.  It is hard to explain to parents why their children are taught in such overcrowded conditions.  I appreciate that the Minister is less than a year in office and that she has an ongoing major programme of assistance and development, in relation to primary and secondary schools.  I appreciate her position.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister and the Department must appreciate the situation in St. Columba's College, Stranorlar.  We cannot allow it to continue without raising it as many times as necessary to get the Minister to raise the finance from whatever source, the National Development Plan, the inter-aid programme or whatever.  While there are difficulties and competition for money, there is no acceptable explanation for a lack of funding to St. Columba's College.  The fact that the Minister has been kind enough to attend the House this evening, will, I hope, provide an answer to my question which will enable me to tell the manager, the principal and those involved that the present diabolical conditions will not last.</P>
    <P>I do not believe one needs to stretch one's imagination too far to know what it is like to have a college built for 500 students which now accommodates 1,2000 students.  It is unworkable, which <Col N="1053" /> is patently obvious on a wet morning when buses and students are trying to get in and out.</P>
    <P>When will funding be provided for the approved extension?  Will the Minister send an official from her Department to make an assessment of the college's needs?  I ask her to put forward proposals to help the college to develop to meet the needs of its population.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's presence in the House and I hope her answer will be favourable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and Senator McGowan for your welcome to this House.  I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to the matter raised regarding St. Columba's College.  I am aware of the need to provide additional accommodation and I am glad that the architectural planning of an extension to the school which will alleviate their accommodation problems in now complete.</P>
      <P>I would like first to give some brief details on the background to the project. The college is a co-educational school originally built for 650 pupils in the early 1980s.  It had an enrolment of 1,108 in the school year just finished.  The school expanded significantly and rapidly and the Department has endeavoured over the years to assist the school authorities in meeting the ever increasing demands on its accommodation and resources.  In all, 19 prefabs have been provided at the school, six of which and a toilet block, were provided in 1991 to help alleviate the accommodation problems for the 1991-92 school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following visits to the school by a senior inspector from my Department it was concluded that although the school had an adequate number of teaching spaces to cater for its enrolment, its growth is such that the continuing provision of prefabricated accommodation did not in itself cater for the educational <Col N="1054" /> and operational needs of the school as a whole.</P>
    <P>Following a full assessment of the school's accommodation requirements by the planning and building unit of my Department and consultation with the school authorities, conversion works and the provision of 450 square metres of additional new accommodation was approved in August 1992.  Architectural planning of the extension was immediately initiated and the school authorities were authorised to prepare the relevant documentation, including the preparation of tender documentation.</P>
    <P>The conversion work to which I referred was part of the overall project. However, my Department, in July of this year, in recognition of the inadequate home economics facilities in the school, approved a proposal from the school to convert the existing library to a home economics room.  A circulation door and associated works to relieve congestion problems were also approved by my Department and all this work was grant-aided. In addition, grant-aid equivalent to the provision of two prefabricated classrooms and a career guidance officer for the current school year was also approved.</P>
    <P>The accommodation in St. Columba's has been monitored on a continuous basis by my Department and I am sure the Senator will agree that, over the years, every effort was made to ensure that the needs of the pupils were met.</P>
    <P>The extension at St. Columba's will be released to tender at the earliest possible time.  This project, with many other urgent projects currently with my Department, will be considered in the context of the 1994 capital allocation and my Department's ongoing commitments and priorities.  However, the Senator will appreciate it is not possible to give an exact starting date until the 1994 Estimates have been finalised.  I assure the Senator, however, that no effort will be spared in ensuring that the additional accommodation required at St. Columba's <Col N="1055" /> will be provided at the earliest possible time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 2 December 1993.</P>
