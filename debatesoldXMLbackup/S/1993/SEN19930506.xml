      <P>I have notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the adjournment of the House to-day, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to establish a compulsory system of registration of still births.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Roche of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to redress the inadequacy of funds provided in the 1993 housing construction programme to Bray UDC for the completion of refurbishment works at Oldcourt estate, Bray, County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that the Stella Maris School in Foynes, County Limerick, continues as a second level institution after 1995 in view of the withdrawal of the religious community and the decision not to accept 1st year students from September 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="106" /> I also received notice from Senator Farrelly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide £50,000 to Meath County Council for the appointment of a design consultant for the new bridge over the River Blackwater in Navan, County Meath which will alleviate the serious traffic problem which exists.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to explore the possibility of having St. Helen's House, Booterstown preserved for the benefit of the State.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Henry, Roche, Neville, Farrelly and Cosgrave as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Henry and Roche's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Neville, Farrelly and Cosgrave may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader of the House if he is prepared to give time to discuss the Bosnian situation.  Another matter which is of fundamental interest is Ireland's proposed submission to the European Commission for Structural and Cohesion Funds.  It is important that we discuss this matter because on the last occasion where discussion did not take place in the Oireachtas there were obvious omissions from the submission. I refer in particular to the omission of an application for funding in relation to marine erosion.  Perhaps the Leader of <Col N="107" /> the House would consider giving time to both of these matters.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I wish to raise a matter which I have raised here before and with you, that is the question of facilities for the Independent Senators Office.  You have used your good offices with the Minister yet no progress has been made.  I wish to make it absolutely clear to the House that I can no longer co-operate with the operation of the House if urgent action is not taken.  I have received a commitment that over the next week or so the Minister will be in contact with you about this.  I think the Independent Senators have been treated very badly as we are worst off among Members in terms of House facilities.  I will be expecting progress over the next week on that matter.  A stand must be taken and I ask for the support of the House on the matter.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, this week we saw one of the most important economic developments for a long time when the Government issued its decisions in regard to the Culliton report.  The Leader of the House said yesterday he would find time to discuss this but I urge the Seanad to keep momentum going on this and to make sure we bring it forward.  Time is of the essence.  It is a year since the Culliton report was published, and only now has the implementation been suggested.  It is important that we consider this report as a matter of urgency and I suggest to the Leader that we discuss it next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to make time available in the near future to discuss the school transport system under the following headings.  Is it efficient, safe and economic?  Are we getting the best value for money?  Are the pilot schemes working?  Do we need a new school transport authority or do we accept the system in place?  It would be proper and timely for this House to examine the question of school transport which is especially important for the rural population.</P>

      <P>In response to Senator Taylor-Quinn's question on Structural Funds, we are trying to organise discussions at the moment with the relevant Ministers.  I have a personal interest in her own concern about coastal erosion. We will debate the Bosnian situation in the House quite soon.  Senator Quinn mentioned the Culliton report and its implementation.  I am hopeful for some early news on that which may come next week.</P>

      <P>I thank Members for dealing with these largely technical amendments in such an expeditious manner. They will have a number of important implications in the area of enforcement of judgments, including maintenance orders where perhaps the main application will lie.  It is an important extension of the benefits of the EC that judgments can be mutually enforced in EC countries, and now also in EFTA countries as a result of the Lugano Convention.</P>
      <P>Senator Fahey commented on Second Stage on the desirability of extending similar provisions to other countries such as the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and so on.  As I indicated then additional legislation will be coming before the House to address some of those problems.  I am grateful to the Members, a Chathaoirligh, for their time.</P>

    <Title>Roads Bill, 1991: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCashin" hpid="Mr. Cashin Mr. Cashin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cashin</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Roads Authority to be established under the Roads Bill will be charged with provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads.  This development programme will in turn provide valuable support for the Government's overall strategy for economic recovery by contributing to a significant reduction in the transport cost disadvantages suffered by Irish industry, particularly Irish exporters, against other EC countries.</P>
      <P>The classification of public roads are national, regional and local.  At present there is a network of national roads from Letterkenny in County Donegal to County Kerry, through County Cork, County Waterford and north to Drogheda.  These roads provide the necessary links to our ports, to the UK and mainland Europe.  It is proposed at present to provide a new roadway linking Rosslare with Waterford and with County Donegal.  We hope this will be a positive link with the west of Ireland, helping exports and creating extra jobs in that region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding regional and local roads there is room for improvement.  Large trucks of up to 35 and 38 tonnes have caused the surfaces of these roads to crumble.  Over-hanging branches have ripped canvases from trucks and torn away side-view mirrors.  These conditions force trucks into the middle of the road; it is impossible for them due to over hanging branches and crumbling roads to keep to their left.  Roads in the Cork region, for example the Mallow-Mitchelstown <Col N="112" /> and the Fermoy-Mallow roads have not had a bend removed or a widening carried out on them over the past 17 to 20 years.  The towns served by these roads now have populations of nine to eleven thousand people.</P>
    <P>In my own town of Kanturk, as in other towns throughout the country, the cooperative lorries travel to the farmyard to collect milk.  These lorries transport 25 tonnes of moveable cargo each, by road as a result of which road surfaces breakdown under pressure.  For example, a half a mile from my own home less than three weeks ago, an articulated truck hit a lag and keeled its cargo out into the ditch. Fortunately no one was injured but it transpired that one of the main parts of the truck was broken.  Such accidents increase hauliers' expenses.  There are approximately 20,000 truck drivers and 4,000 haulage contractors throughout the country and poor road conditions are causing them much expense.</P>
    <P>In rural areas tourism is a growing industry.  Visitors to this country want to leave the main thoroughfares to travel on minor roads to see the hidden Ireland. To do so they should not have to take their lives in their hands or risk damaging their cars.  We must provide safe accessroutes to tourists.  In rural areas farmers, large and small, need access to the main roads in order to have milk ferried out and fertilizer brought in.</P>
    <P>Two rivers meet in the heart of Kanturk, my own town.  To get to the main street in Kanturk one has to cross two bridges; the main street leads to the market square.  A celebrated Dáil Deputy once said of the main street in Kanturk that &ldquo;the further up you travel the &lsquo;mainer&rsquo; it gets&rdquo;.  Thirty years on that situation still prevails.  I am sure the National Roads Authority will not be in a position to widen the main street in Kanturk, but I hope it will provide a new route and a third bridge in Kanturk to facilitate access.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this debate commenced in the other House there have been calls for an integrated national transport policy.  I understand the Minister <Col N="113" /> has responded negatively to this proposal while recognising the need for a co-ordinated approach between various departments.  He claims many practical difficulties would have to be overcome before one authority could take responsibility for seaports, airports, county roads, regional roads, national roads and transport policy generally.</P>
      <P>We are facing a serious situation over the next couple of years because of the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994.  This has to be the most significant event in European social and economic history. For the first time a land mass on the periphery of Europe will be joined with the body of Europe which will, in effect, leave us as the only island member State in the European Community, with the obvious disadvantages that will bring.</P>
      <P>I had informal discussions with Ministers on trade, marketing and transport particularly since I became spokesperson in this House on transport and communications. The response of those Ministers was that the opening of the Channel Tunnel should be considered in an exclusively positive light.  That view is misplaced. There will be significant benefits to be gained from quick, easy and direct access to Europe for freight and tourist traffic.  If there is easier access going east, then obviously there is easier access coming west.</P>
      <P>However, the argument then falls down as anyone who has taken a car ferry or a freight liner through any Irish port will know.  This applies especially to what I would call the main corridor between this country and Britain, the Dublin-Holyhead route, and to a lesser extent the Rosslare-Pembroke route in the context of freight traffic.  I recently took the ferry from Dublin to Holyhead.  It was a pleasant journey and when I got to the other side I headed south-east.  This is the direction most of the commercial traffic takes to get to the European network &mdash; the A5 out of Holyhead, across the Isle of Anglesea to Betws-y-Coed and on through Llangollen, eventually joining the main motorway east of Shrewsbury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> This is a route that would tax even the most intrepid explorers.  It is a winding, twisting and potentially dangerous route in some places where it might be safer to walk.  Yet there is no indication that the UK Government intends to develop a motorway route from the main access port from Ireland to the UK and on to Europe.</P>
    <P>I welcome the development of our road network, with special reference to the Euroroute from Wexford to Belfast, which will be a tremendous advantage to our commercial and tourism sectors.  The Roads Authority will oversee this development involving the spending of significant sums of Structural Fund money over the next seven years on the further upgrading of our regional and primary road network.  However, I am concerned that there does not seem to be an awareness in Government that, with the imminent opening of the Channel Tunnel, we will be at a distinct disadvantage in the short to medium term. I hope the National Roads Authority will recognise that and that in its deliberations on prioritising the allocation of funds over the next seven years &mdash; which is part of its remit &mdash; it will put more emphasis on regional development than on ring-roads or urban development.</P>
    <P>Far be it from me to criticise the significant developments around the capital city over the past five to six years, but anyone who has business in Dublin, be it for political, commercial or leisure purposes, and who lives in the west or north-west must recognise that the outer ring-road, the Western Parkway, the northern route and more recently the southern route through Shankill, are a boon.</P>
    <P>However, let us look at the road network from the perspective of County Leitrim, my own county.  If one looks at the national routes on a map of Ireland there is a significant amount of red, the colour which designates national primary routes, concentrated from the east outwards. However, the further north one looks the less red one sees to the extent that County Leitrim and a number of Border counties are, and have been, isolated from the great development of our <Col N="115" /> road network over the past few years. County Leitrim has the shortest mileage of national primary routes in the country. There is the route which runs through the coastal area of Tullaghan on the Sligo-Bundoran road and also the N16 route, through Manorhamilton, Glenfarne, and on to Enniskillen &mdash; I intend to refer to that route later.  Country Leitrim has the lowest number of secondary roads. Consequently, most of our road network has to be sourced out of local authority funding.  The same is true of a number of Border counties.</P>
    <P>It would be a job well done if I were to do nothing in this House but reiterate the demand &mdash; it has gone beyond a request &mdash; from those living in the Border counties for a more equitable share of the Structural Funds designated by the Department of the Environment for road development, and if that plea were to encourage decision makers, particularly the new National Roads Authority, to spend more resources in that area.</P>
    <P>The greatest difficulty facing the Border regions and the north-west is access.  We are constantly told the biggest difficulty facing the country in terms of tourism and economic development is access.  It should not be too difficult to marry the two priorities; the national priority of better, more direct access by air, sea and road, and more direct and easy access to the regions.</P>
    <P>There is a perception that the first tranche of European Structural Funds was designated almost exclusively to national primary routes and to routes on which there was a heavy volume of traffic to the detriment of the regional and county road networks.  I believe that perception is accurate.  I hope, and this is the impression I get from the Minister and his Department, that the second tranche of European Structural Funds will be reoriented so that a greater proportion of the money will be spent on regional and county road development.</P>
    <P>As the Cathaoirleach and any other Member of this House involved in local authorities will know, there is a lobby currently pressing for 10 per cent of <Col N="116" /> Structural Funds to be devoted exclusively to regional and county road development.  This lobby is representative of elected members of local authorities and should not be ignored.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to concede that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith has been and continues to be responsive to increased demands from elected local authority members for more resources at local level.  However, the Minister will not have direct control over the National Roads Authority.  Thus, decisions as to how scarce European resources matched by our own even scarcer resources are to be used will be made by a group of appointed individuals with no real awareness of local and regional needs.  Their approach to the roads network will be a global one.  Statistics, including some provided by the Minister, indicate that Irish roads are used by a high percentage of the population.  This calls for a more imaginative and creative response than simply highlighting national primary roads and investing more money in them.</P>
    <P>We inherited a road network built in the early to mid 1800s to cater for a population of seven to eight million people.  Unreasonable demands on local authorities to tarmac or repair county roads have created enormous tensions at local level.  These demands are unreasonable because the road network, built for eight million people, is now serving three million only so it is inevitable that some roads will not receive adequate attention.</P>
    <P>Some argue that every citizen has the right to live on a good road which is adequately maintained and surfaced and should not have to worry that the value of a car might be reduced by a purchasing garage because of the poor condition of local roads.  I am aware of those arguments and fully support them.  As resources are limited, however, I favour giving priority to road development at national primary level and then working down to county level.</P>
    <P>In spite of the substantial amount of money available for road and infrastructural development our county road network has only in recent years begun <Col N="117" /> to improve to an appreciable degree.  This improvement is a direct result of the reallocation of resources by Fianna Fáil Administrations from 1987 onwards.  It is a sad commentary that up to that time no Government, including the previous Coalition, from the mid-1950s onwards regarded road development as a national priority.  There was a view that spending money on roads was wasteful and that it should be spent instead on more fruitful areas.  In the 1990s we are reaping that whirlwind.</P>
    <P>There is no point going back over 30 or 40 years of misconceptions rather than mismanagement in relation to the importance of road development to the national social and economic fabric.  We need to look towards the next six to seven years when we will see, as all commentators have stated, the last major input of European funding for per-ipherality into Ireland.  It is vital that we spend these European funds well.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the state of Border roads Ireland is treated as a peripheral European nation and the Border region is a peripheral region within a peripheral country which has its own cultural and unique difficulties.  I use the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; because those of us who travel regularly across the frontier between North and South are constantly told by all sections of the Northern community &mdash; it is the one subject on which they are all united &mdash; that the South, or the Free State as they call it, would be a wonderful country if its roads were better.  I believe this comment is validly made, particularly along the Border regions.  When one travels to the South from the North one notices an immediate drop in road standards from Louth through to Donegal. Here, some areas are worse than others.  Cavan and Leitrim roads are particularly bad.  One cannot travel across the Border from Fermanagh to Leitrim due to Army road closures but that is another issue.</P>
    <P>Given all the talk over the last ten years of developing tourism, improving infrastructure and attracting economic development through the location of industry in Border regions and the north-west, <Col N="118" /> I cannot understand why greater emphasis has not been placed on improving cross-Border roads.  As far as I can gather the only funding available for the development of cross Border roads is under the inter regional programme and this programme is proceeding so slowly due to limited resources that I shudder to think when it will be fully completed. I do not think we will be around to see that.  I ask the Minister therefore, to make a special case for the Border regions, not for parochial or selfish reasons but for sound economic and social ones.</P>
    <P>I plead for the further development and upgrading of Irish sea ports.  During the last week to ten days the Minister, when announcing the implementation of the Culliton report recommendations stated that sea ports will come under the control of commercial companies with State involvement which will be set up for this purpose.  I welcome this development. For too long there has been a school of thought, which used to be called the Doheny and Nesbit school of economics, that everything in the State sector has failed while everything in the private sector is wonderful.  I do not share that point of view.  Irish State bodies have been efficient and exemplary in the main, creating jobs and wealth for the country. I welcome the proposal to place seaports under some degree of State control.</P>
    <P>I raise the issue of sea ports in the context of roads because I hope the development of the Euro-route from Rosslare to Belfast and link roads from it will move apace.  There was a suggestion in recent days that there should be a motorway development from the south-east across to the south-west.  This would help to speed traffic to and from Rosslare.  Why is Larne receiving an inordinate share of Irish outbound freight?  I think it is for purely economic reasons and has nothing to do with the pleasant scenery or excellent roads around Larne. There must be a reason people from this part of the country export their goods via Larne.  Perhaps the answer is that we have not developed our port facilities.  I <Col N="119" /> am glad it will be within the remit of the National Roads Authority to develop a better road structure from our ports.</P>
    <P>The trans-European routes have been set down by the European Commission as a blueprint for the future development of major routes.  The Euro-route is one of these.  Another route that has been recommended by the Commission is the N16, which runs through most of the northern part of County Leitrim.  This route, in the context of Larne and the north-east, carries a considerable amount of freight traffic.  There has been a considerable increase in the amount of tourist traffic on that road.  Belfast international airport, has developed its services over the last few years and is attracting an increasing number of passengers many of whom come to Belfast for tourism and leisure rather than for economic reasons and an increasing number of these visitors now travel outside Belfast.  They are using Belfast as a conduit to the North and, hopefully, coming south.  Consequently, the upgrading of the N16 route should be a priority for the New National Roads Authority.</P>
    <P>The N16 route is listed as a trans-European route under the most recent recommendations of the Commission. Unfortunately, the Commission can only make recommendations native to governments.  The Euro 1 route was originally recommended to the Government who accepted it and have been putting resources into it.  I ask the Minister as a priority, to ensure that this Authority would look at providing increased resources for trans-European routes, specifically the N16.  This route goes through Sligo and it would link the developing road network in Galway and Mayo and provide strong, clear and direct link between North and South. God knows, we need better access to our separated brethren in the North.  The condition of roads in the Border areas has been an inhibiting factor in both sides of the Irish community getting to know each other better.  There is a social as well as an economic reason for improving the roads.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="120" /> It would be remiss of me not to call for the upgrading of the county road which runs through County Leitrim.  This road runs from Carrick-on-Shannon, the border with Roscommon through Drumshanbo to Drumkeerin, Manorhamilton and Kinlough into Bundoran.  It is an alternative route for traffic travelling to the north-west.  If I were to ask my colleagues, on both sides of the House, how they would travel from Dublin to Sligo, they would inevitably tell me that they would go from Carrick-on-Shannon to Boyle and over to Curlews into Sligo. Anybody who comes from that area will tell you when you come to Carrick-on-Shannon to turn right into Drumshanbo, down into Drumkeerin, Manorhamilton and Kinlough.  This cuts about 20 miles off the journey.  Most people do not use that route because looking at the map, one would get the impression it is little more than a dirt track.  I appreciate that parts of it are winding but the road surface is a credit to Leitrim County Council.</P>
    <P>The roads in Leitrim are a credit to successive local administrations.  We are proud of our county road network.  Of course, there are major difficulties, as in all counties, but the main road artery through the county is good.  The economic development of County Leitrim and the north-west generally would be best served by an upgrading of this road to secondary road status.  This would mean Exchequer resources would be provided. According to the last census, County Leitrim has a population of 25,000 and the business rate applies to 700 people.  The reliance on central Exchequer funding for the maintenance of services in County Leitrim has reached an unhealthy level. Consequently, I am not adopting a begging bowl attitude.  It would be in the interests of not only the county but of the region and of the county if that road were to be upgraded.  I hope the National Roads Authority will take note of this and realise that it is a serious priority for Leitrim County Council and business and tourism interests in the country.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the stretch of road which runs north from Carrick-on-Shannon <Col N="121" /> through Ballinamore to Swanlinbar in County Cavan.  This stretch of road has taken on a new significance because of the imminent reopening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal and the development of ancillary facilities in that region.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer specifically to the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal development and the Slieve Russell Hotel outside Ballyconnell.  Seán Quinn's development is a marvellous commitment to a rural area.  I discussed this development with him recently and it was interesting that he did not rate the questionable state of the roads around Ballyconnell as an inhibiting factor in the development of his business.  However, he did say that if the road network were improved to enable better access to County Cavan and west Leitrim, it would improve his occupancy rate.  Perhaps, on hearing this, any potential entrepreneurs would look at the imaginative response of Seán Quinn to providing a valuable, important and excellent leisure facility in a country which some entrepreneurs would label Hicksville, Ireland.  Seán Quinn has proved that it can be done.  I hope other entrepreneurs will take note and realise that, while our road network may not be on a par with some parts of the south or east, developments are taking place and local authorities and public representatives with tourism and economic interests are committed to improving the infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The single, biggest difficulty facing this country and the part of the country I live is lack of access.  The statutory development of the National Roads Authority is a significant milestone in the development of our infrastructure.  I welcome the setting up of the National Roads Authority but I ask that its activities be monitored. I hope this House will have an opportunity to debate the activities of the National Roads Authority on an ongoing basis, particularly as in a sense, it is operating outside the direct remit of the Department of the Environment and local authorities.  For the first time, the relationship between the Department and the local authorities has been broken <Col N="122" /> hence public accountability is even more important.  I hope the upgrading of the main artery in Leitrim &mdash; the T54 and T53 &mdash; and the European Commission recommended that the N16 be sourced financially to bring it up to motorway status over the next ten to 15 years will be implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I am not convinced the new National Roads Authority will solve the problems the previous speaker mentioned or the problems every public representative meets daily.</P>
      <P>If the members of the National Roads Authority do not know rural Ireland then the Structural Funds for this year and in future will not be spent in the areas where the real need lies.</P>
      <P>When I became a member of a local authority in 1975 the rotation for the resurfacing of county roads was seven years, the rotation today is 27 years.  The last speaker mentioned the improvements which have taken place since 1987 under successive Fianna Fáil Administrations. At that time the rotation period was 17 years.  I do not consider the present rotation for the resurfacing of roads &mdash; 27 years &mdash; an improvement. Is that what the Senator calls real progress? We have regressed by ten years in the amount of funds provided for county roads.</P>
      <P>The road network consists of national primary, national secondary, county and class 3 roads.  Major improvements have been made to our national primary and national secondary roads over the last few years with the help of Structural Funds.  This must be welcomed.  Senator Mooney comes from a county with a population of 25,000; the population in my county has grown from 70,000 to 106,000 or 107,000.  These are two extreme cases.  Because of the reduction in the population of County Leitrim the money available to spend on roads in his county presents as big a problem for him as the over-spill from the city and the through traffic presents for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mooney mentioned heavy vehicles travelling to Larne.  These <Col N="123" /> vehicles go through Meath from Larne to Limerick on the N52.  The Minister is probably aware of a committee set up by the seven counties affected by vehicles using the N52.  Vehicles have to stop to let another pass on this road which is carrying very heavy traffic.  A great deal of money is required to upgrade and improve it.</P>
    <P>Another road crosses the county from the port in Drogheda to Maynooth.  Perhaps when the road around Dublin is finalised, some of these heavy vehicles will use that route.  However, at the moment, villages do not have proper roads to carry the traffic.  Heavy vehicles are damaging our roads.</P>
    <P>Does the Government intend to follow the suggestion of former Commissioner MacSharry to apply to use 10 per cent of the Structural Funds received for national primary and secondary roads for county roads?  If the Government wishes to keep people in rural Ireland, the road network must be improved.  When the roads were built, the 170,000 farmers in rural Ireland did not need a service for collecting their milk and other produce. Today, all goods are despatched in bulk and the roads were not built for heavy lorries.</P>
    <P>We could have a long debate about who made the decision to abolish rates. Notwithstanding that, over a period of ten years when inflation was between 16 per cent and 18 per cent, there was only a 10 per cent increase in road grants. As a result our roads have deteriorated rapidly since 1976-77.  People living on class 3 roads &mdash; off the county roads &mdash; have learned that the county councils took precedence over many of these roads which were surface-dressed once but the council have not repaired them since because funds are not available. That is the present position.</P>
    <P>Meath County Council made a decision two years ago when I was chairman that £200,000 would be made available for repairs to a number of class 3 roads.  We have made significant progress. Last year 38 different roadways were resurfaced and it is intended to deal <Col N="124" /> with a similar number this year.  If the council received funds matching the allocation it is making out of its own resources, we would have £500,000.  At that time, children who have to walk one and a half miles to meet the school bus in winter would not need waders to reach the road.  If we are serious about developing infrastructure and keeping people in rural Ireland, there must be investment in the county road network.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of a new authority proposing new toll bridges.  If Structural Funds are made available to provide the road, people should not have to pay indefinitely for those improvements. Serious consideration should be given to that matter.</P>
    <P>Why was the local authority in Meath not allowed to appoint consultant engineers this year for the design of a bridge over the Blackwater at Navan at a cost of £50,000 to start the second phase of the by-pass?  Phase 1 has been completed; 17,000 vehicles from the north of the town and the county have to cross one small bridge; another 23,000 vehicles use the road from Dublin through Navan to Kells and the north-west; and a further 8,000 and 5,000 vehicles, respectively, use the other two roads.  All of these vehicles arrive during a 24 hour period at one junction.</P>
    <P>The second phase of this development must be started but the Minister has decided that no funds will be available this year.  Perhaps he would allow the council to employ the consultants this year and make the money available next year.  The development must be planned in advance although work cannot commence until funds are available. Members of my family who live about 17 miles from town, are obliged to set out 45 minutes earlier for work because of this problem.  It will take five years to solve the problem and, at present, we are seeking approval to start the process.</P>
    <P>Money should also be made available to commence design work on the Kells by-pass.  The Minister not being familiar with Kells, has not had to endure the traffic problems there.  You, a Chathaoirligh, and I are familiar with the traffic <Col N="125" /> problems in towns throughout the country, having had to travel through them during recent months.</P>
    <P>The traffic problem in Kells is caused by the Limerick bound traffic on the N52 meeting the traffic bound for the north west.  Every day of the week one can be held up by trucks for up to 15 minutes.  I urge the Minister to ensure that the Kells by-pass be given top priority if we are serious about ensuring that money is spent efficiently.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transport Initiative produced proposals to alleviate the serious traffic problems in the city and some of the proposals relate to areas of Country Meath.  We could reduce the number of vehicles travelling daily into the city with a light rail system to Ashbourne, Dunshaughlin and Dunboyne.  Due to increased housing development and the resulting increase in population there is a demand for such a system.</P>
    <P>The Stillorgan Road, which was the first major by-pass, was discussed during a radio programme about two weeks ago. That road, when it opened, provided fast access to the city.  Now, however, commuters who use it complain that travelling into the city centre can take over an hour.  We do not have that problem on the Navan Road thanks to the efficient work carried out there over the last three or four years.  Everybody concerned with that development should be complimented as there are no traffic lights on the road from the city after Phibsboro.</P>
    <P>The Naas Road was considered the best road in the country until 15 years ago.  Now there are more traffic lights on that road than on the road from Phibsboro to Leinster House.  Traffic on the Naas Road moves quite slowly for a number of miles.  The development of the Navan Road, with flyovers rather than traffic lights, is the prototype for the future and the engineers and design team of that road deserve to be complimented.</P>
    <P>Who will the National Roads Authority answer to?  Are we creating another layer of bureaurcacy here?  Most local authorities, when given sufficient funds, have carried out good work on the roads. It would be inappropriate to appoint as <Col N="126" /> members of the new Authority people who are unfamiliar with rural Ireland.  I am aware that probably the majority of Dublin residents are descendents of people from rural Ireland but now they, as the old saying goes, &ldquo;are more Dublin than the Dubliners themselves&rdquo; and may not appreciate the importance of upgrading the infrastructure in rural areas whereby people travel to and from work. Ireland's 170,000 farmers should be able to transport their produce without hauliers and others complaining about the condition of roads and threatening not to collect their milk or whatever for fear of damage to lorries etc.  There is not one Member of the Oireachtas who has not heard of hauliers refusing to collect milk because of the condition of country roads.</P>
    <P>Major decisions must be made regarding the upkeep of roads.  A proportion of the funds, perhaps 10 per cent, could be transferred to local authorities to service local road requirements.  This proposal could work in the same way as the arrangement under which the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment is dealing with county housing needs with funds allocated on the basis of numbers on the waiting lists.</P>
    <P>In Meath there are about 1,900 miles of county road, which is low in comparison with Cork, but the county, according to the last census, has a population of 106,500 people.  The roads are under extreme pressure due to the number of vehicles travelling through the county. Many people do not use the national primary or secondary routes; they travel the country roads as shortcuts to and from their destinations.</P>
    <P>The Minister must issue a comprehensive statement on the National Roads Authority and outline how it will carry out developments as funds become available.  The last thing we want is rural areas being completely depleted of population due to lack of services.  Major funding is required to upgrade local services in every country.  Ireland has serious road problems which will not be alleviated without substantial expenditure.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the statement that <Col N="127" /> will be made <i>vis-a-vis</i> the setting up of the roads Authority and the instructions that will be given.  I will take note, as will Members of both Houses, of Authority appointees knowledge of rural Ireland. The Minister comes from a rural constituency and he knows the position.  He should not miss this opportunity or allow a precedent to be set whereby decisions are made and two years pass before one discovers in what direction the graph is going.  By then it is too late to stop.  It is the only chance that we will get to develop our roads and we should not miss the opportunity to ensure that rural parts receive the amount of funds required to alleviate its road problems.</P>
    <P>My local authority has allocated sufficient funds over a period of years for county roads and for all of its road network. We provided those funds from local revenue and it has been getting harder to do so because the area sources from which we collect money are becoming fewer.  Nevertheless we should not prohibit counties who want to improve their situation from receiving a small allocation, perhaps 10 per cent of Structural Funds to ensure that rural Ireland is kept alive.  When roads are improved people will want to remain in the country.  Children will be available to go to local schools and there will be demands for other services too.  I am sure there is worry in many counties as in Leitrim, that large numbers of people will move to the towns leaving nobody in rural areas.  We should not allocate Structural Funds in ways that will be considered an incredible mistake in 20 years time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the Seanad today for this important Bill.  I understand that to have the roads of any country well organised a national roads authority is required. When it was first mentioned at Cork County Council it was felt that a roads authority might take from the powers of local authorities.  We must be careful that the powers of local authorities are not diminished.  I hope local authorities will not lose out and that the National Roads <Col N="128" /> Authority will take their recommendations into account.</P>
      <P>We have a national network of primary roads and a number of essential motorways. For example the transportation of goods to the continent, Britain and elsewhere on the N25 from Cork to Rosslare is dependent on that road having a good quality surface and no sharp bends.  The provision of by-passes and the realignment and reconstruction work on that road have provided truck drivers with a direct fast route.  I travelled that road some 30 years ago and I remember it as it was then.  That road has been much improved.</P>
      <P>Many by-passes are necessary on the N7 and N8 routes from Dublin to Cork and I am glad that there are plans for their construction.  On a parochial level I welcome the planned tunnel in Cork and the sooner it is started the better so that we can travel to Dublin a little faster.  I also welcome the planned improvements to the N71 from Cork to Bandon which have been called for by many councillors over the years including the deceased former Member, John N. O'Sullivan. The new road should be named after him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding my own area, the N71 skirts the coast from Cork to Bandon into Clonakilty and Skibbereen, on to Ballydehob, Bantry, Glengariff, Kenmare before joining the national route at Killarney. That road is very important to west Cork and its condition at the moment is not satisfactory.  I want another extension of it to be classified as a national secondary route, that is the busy section that leaves the N71 at Bandon, for Dunmanway and Bantry.  The reason I am seeking this is that on the western side, on the far tip, of the country lies the busy fishing port of Castletownbere. Great work is being done on the road from Glengariff to Castletownbere but drivers from the continent are inclined to identify the main road to Castletownbere as the N71 and drivers who take that route and have to drive 60 to 70 miles out of their way.  If this middle road in the west Cork were upgraded and classified it could be put on maps as part of the N71.  It was the old road into west Cork <Col N="129" /> and serious consideration should be given to its reclassification which has been sought by locals and councillors on numerous occasions.  I do not want the part of the N71 that goes through Clonakilty and Skibbereen to be downgraded; the two roads running beside each other should each be classified as national secondary routes.</P>
    <P>I stress again the importance of the main road to Castletownbere.  Huge trucks bring fish from this region to all over Europe and the road is totally unsuitable for that type of traffic.  The Council has tried over the years to be prudent with its finances so as to allocate some money towards improvements. Castletownbere is very important nationally as a fishing port and more work needs to be done on this road to bring it to a proper standard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to stress the importance of the Castletownbere port not only to the Beara area where employment opportunities are few but as a national port.  The road to the port must be improved irrespective of whether it becomes the responsibility of the National Roads Authority.</P>
      <P>EC money for roads is welcome but I fear most of it will be spent on major road improvements only and that little will be left for county roads.  I believe EC money is being spent wisely, but I hope, as Senator Farrelly suggested, a percentage will be allocated to roads in rural areas. Without money to improve these roads rural under-development will continue.</P>
      <P>Motorways, national primary routes and national secondary routes have the highest classification followed by regional routes and county roads.  The bulk of the money is spent on the major roads; there is not enough money for the maintenance of county roads, let alone road improvements. More money must be spent on the local improvement schemes to bring these roads up to standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cyclists are in more danger than other road users.  Many continental countries have cycle lanes.  In Germany, paths are divided for walking and cycling.  In Berlin pathways are made from a special type of stone.  Cyclists must be accommodated because more people than ever are cycling now.  If there were as many cyclists <Col N="131" /> in Ireland as there are in Holland there would not be the same level of congestion in our cities.</P>
    <P>The Bill also refers to vegetation. Commercial drivers continuously claim that vegetation does an enormous amount of damage to the mirrors and sides of their vehicles.  If a left hand side mirror is broken by a branch that immediately creates an element of danger; by law, the driver should stop and get the mirror repaired.  However, in reality, the driver must finish his day's work.  The National Roads Authority should take this issue into account when formulating policy.</P>
    <P>The present policy covering the clearing of roadsides is unclear.  At present, Telecom Éireann and the ESB clear trees and small vegetation, if they are a danger to wires or are causing damage to communication lines.  This absolves councils of responsibility for some stretches of road.  County councils are only responsible for clearing growth for four feet on either side of the road on the outer side of the fence.  Thereafter responsibility lies with the landowners.</P>
    <P>A policy of clearing overhanging trees would provide work, firewood and so on. Some people like to see trees overhanging the road because of their environmental value but this must be balanced by considerations of safety and the cost of repairs to side mirrors and to the sides of vehicles.  There is a danger that a child who puts his head out the window could be seriously injured by overhanging vegetation.</P>
    <P>The system of roadsigns must be standardised: at present, one finds signs of different shapes, sizes and colours fulfilling similar functions.  It is not good enough for signs giving advance notice of roadworks, to be painted on boards, in any colour and in any shape.  Frequently one may pass a signpost without seeing it.</P>
    <P>During the Seanad election campaign I often went 50 metres past a turn before realising I had gone wrong.  Even on English country roads advance signposting is of a very high standard.  One sees the sign <Col N="132" /> well in advance of the turn and then can note the finger posts showing the distance in miles of the actual turn.  It is dangerous for drivers to make late turns at crossroads, having just seen the signposts.  We must standardise and regulate the signs, finger posts and lines on our roads.</P>
    <P>When two lanes merge should it be to the right or to the left?  This needs to be standardised or accidents will occur.  It must be clear who has the right of way.</P>
    <P>On motorways all over the world, hitch-hiking is prohibited because of the danger to hitch-hikers and to traffic. Hitch-hiking on other roads is acceptable however, because it enables young people especially to travel cheaply.  I would not like to see a total ban on hitching. When I was a student I was very glad to be able to hitch a lift; it spared me the bus fare.  It was better to be able to use the money for entertainment.</P>
    <P>The toll road on the western side of Dublin was a high cost project and I understand why a toll is being charged in that case.  However I would like tolls to be lifted after a certain length of time.  If the present situation is taken to its logical conclusion all new roads will be toll roads because all roads are expensive to build. I understand that where big projects are involved and bridges or tunnels must be built, the amount of money involved make a toll necessary but I would not like additional toll roads.  The cost of motoring is high enough without adding a further bill to it.</P>
    <P>Cork County Council allows the use of its roads for races, rallies and the west Cork sport of bowling.  Horse racing on the road has a certain character about it and I know of a race that is run every year.  If there were any difficulty in running such races it would cause great disappointment. These races are part of the social calendar for people living in rural communities.  However, the cost of insurance for these races is so high that some of them can no longer be held. Luckily, some races can afford the insurance costs and have managed to survive.</P>
    <P>Rallies are also held on our roads.  Very often people come to see the rally from <Col N="133" /> abroad bringing much-needed money into the area.  In Clonakilty, a rally attracted visitors from Britain and all over Ireland who stayed in guest houses in the off-peak season when business is usually slow.  This was a great boost to the local economy.</P>
    <P>Ból Chumann na h-Éireann and Cork County Council enjoy a very good relationship.  This sport is not played in some countries but it is very popular in the south-west.  Ból-Chumann na hÉireann usually invites the chairman of the county council and the county manager to its functions because a special type of chip is needed on roads used for bowling.  The surface of the road must be smooth.  It is great on a Sunday evening to see people taking part in this sport.</P>
    <P>School bus drivers must be complimented on the work they do.  They can have three or four scamps in the back seat &mdash; scamps usually sit in the back seat &mdash; and they control the children and drive safely at the same time.  These people must be magicians to do their job so well.</P>
    <P>Co-op drivers are also to be commended on the good work they do.  A previous speaker mentioned that lorries are getting bigger and cannot always get into farmyards.  We have to examine this problem seriously because if a small farmer cannot get a truck into his yard it will eventually mean ceasing production if he cannot obtain equipment necessary to do the work.</P>
    <P>Road workers are becoming scarce.  In the past many road workers were employed and it was money well spent. A road worker who knows his area well will know where trenches and drains are situated.  The cost of road repairs can often be reduced by draining flood water from roads.  The ganger who knew every drain, pool and turn on the road has become a thing of the past and their work is done now by machinery.  Road workers are essential for road maintenance.  This is also a form of employment at a time when employment is scarce.  I know the importance of road and forestry workers. They are a rare species today, whereas in the past many families were reared <Col N="134" /> on their earnings.  The more road and forestry workers we have the better.</P>
    <P>I commend the people who have made such a fine job of Millstreet in preparation for the Eurovision Song Contest. Tremendous work has been done there by engineers, road workers and machinery operators.  I know that the contest will be a tremendous boost for the Millstreet area and for the south west.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Roads Bill.  We need a roads authority to coordinate the improvements of our roads.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill, and as the Minister said in his opening speech, this is probably the most important Roads Bill ever to be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Our infrastructure and our roads are of vital importance to the country for the facilitation of communication between cities, towns, villages and parishes. While a certain amount of work has been done on roads throughout the country much of it has been done at local level.  The roads in the Minister for the Environment's constitutency are always in good condition, but the roads in other constituencies are not always as good.  I travelled around the country like everybody else during the election and when I got to Mayo I almost got lost because the place had totally changed.  The Westport by-pass would meet the needs of the city of Dublin let alone Westport.  Meanwhile, in Limerick, a city ten times the size of Westport, a heavy traffic flow is catered for by a boreen, a small by-pass around the city.  We ought to get our priorities right by looking after the cities and catering for people who live a distance from the main urban centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I travel 1,000 miles a week to and from Dublin.  One of the cumanns I visit for constituency work in south Kerry is 96 miles from Dingle.  The road I travel to Sneem is diabolical.  The county council has made very little effort down the years to improve the roads.  I cannot understand <Col N="135" /> the huge amounts of money being spent maintaining roads in other areas.  I travel through Limerick and there is a beautiful by-pass going past Rathkeale from Adare into Newcastle West.  The road into Newcastle West was tarmacadamed about four years ago, and the same five-mile stretch was done again last year.  However, when you leave Newcastle West, you drive into a boreen.</P>
    <P>The way county councils their engineers and staff operate is open to criticism. The Minister said that local authorities would be relied upon to prepare road designs, etc.  I am amazed that every county council has not already prepared a road design so that we could fight for whatever money is needed.  The more I travel the 221 miles from Dublin to Dingle the more amazed I become at how different county councils operate.  After the Naas dual carriageway and motorway to Kildare you come to the bad road to Portlaoise.  This road is full of black spots and danger signs.  I cannot understand why this road does not receive priority funding for improvements.</P>
    <P>Dingle will soon be on a par with Castletownbere as a fisheries harbour centre.  In tonnage of fish landed, Dingle fisheries harbour passed out Castletownbere almost two years ago.  There is largescale transfer of fish and other produce between Castletownbere and Dingle involving articulated lorries, sometimes laded with 20 or 30 tonnes of fish, which have to travel on very bad roads.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill but I would sound a word of warning to many of our county engineers.  Not every county engineer is the same but I have found fault with local engineers over the years.  The local engineer is a man who goes through college and university, then qualifies and gets a job in Dingle, or some other area as a glorified foreman with no suitable work to do apart from supervising 15 or 20 men.  A local engineer does not design the roads.  If a small bridge has to be constructed a consultant will be brought in to design it.  What are these engineers doing?  Their role should be changed and <Col N="136" /> all those qualified, brilliant engineers would operate from a central office planning the roads.  That way they could still sign dockets for the district under their control, but at present they are doing nothing but making sure a worker opens a drain here or there.  The engineer drives around clocking up mileage.  This is a crazy system.</P>
    <P>I am amazed how county councils waste money by, for example, using huge machinery to open dikes.  In Limerick I saw three men, a JCB and a driver on the side of the road.  They opened the drain with the JCB; one man was at the back of the vehicle with a stop sign and another stood at the front directing traffic.  Three men and not a shovel between them, yet the drain could have been opened and cleaned by a man with a shovel.  On the same stretch of road from Pallaskenry to Limerick, which had been tarred and chipped, there was a 15-stone truck marked &ldquo;Traffic Control&rdquo; driving at a speed of five miles an hour.  One had to stay behind that truck all the way to the regional hospital where it turned and went back the other way.  All day that worker was driving along that stretch of road, slowing traffic in case the chips might break someone's windscreen.</P>

      <P>That lorry cost £28 an hour while a small dumper would have done the just as well and cheaper.  Those are areas where money is wasted.  There is an attitude taken by county councils that since money will be available they will carry on in the same way year after year.  I do not know whether other Senators get the same message, but when I complain to the county council I am told: &ldquo;You get the money and we will fix the roads.&rdquo;  However, even when they get the money the road is left in the same condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 75 per cent of our tourists visit the Cork/Kerry region, and 60 per cent of them visit the Dingle peninsula, and I am delighted they do.  I am not looking for a motorway or a dual carriageway in <Col N="137" /> Kerry but there is very heavy traffic on some of those roads.  The average width of the road from Tralee to Dingle is 12 feet and the sides are falling away.  Buses, lorries and other traffic have to stay in the middle of the road.  In 1956 the famous Dingle-Tralee railway was dismantled. That railway ran alongside the road for about 70 per cent of the journey to Tralee.  About a mile of that railway line only has been taken in for road widening since 1956 despite repeated requests.  It is pointless for any engineer to protest that it is a big job to widen the Dingle-Tralee road by including the former railway. If trains ran there, surely it will take cars and lorries?</P>
    <P>There was mention earlier of airports and seaports, etc.  The ferry from Killimer to Tarbert is a vital link between Clare and the rest of Munster.  However, the road from Ennis to Killimer is disastrous and with the exception of about two or three miles there is no opportunity to pass another vehicle.</P>
    <P>The Tarbert-Listowel road on the other side is in a disastrous state also, largely because it goes through a bog. Money will have to be spent on it.  By way of illustration, a lorry load of timber was going to Dingle when the engine broke down on the Tarbert road.  The driver parked on the side of the road and went to make a phone call.  When he came back the lorry was upside down in the ditch.  Nobody had interferred with it; it just slowly sank and turned over.</P>
    <P>The last speaker mentioned Millstreet. A fantastic job has been done there.  Why could Cork County Council not have done this job last year or the year before? Going into Millstreet from the Mallow road now is like entering another world. There are wide sidewalks, parking spaces, lovely trees, tarmacadamed roads and so on.  The bends seem to have disappeared over-night.  If somebody in Cork County three years ago had suggested the road be improved in this way there would have been interminable delays with CPOs and other measures. Yet when the decision was made to hold the Eurovision Song Contest in <Col N="138" /> Millstreet, a way was found to improve the road there immediately.</P>
    <P>Every county council in Ireland should target a town in their own county to be improved over a two or three year period as Millstreet has recently been due to substantial investment.  Millstreet has been transformed &mdash; the roads in every direction are better, the hedges have been trimmed, potholes filled and all for four or five hours of a Eurovision Song Contest.  Why could we not take an example from that and do a similar job for other towns?</P>
    <P>I hope the intentions of this Bill are correct.  I notice that a board of 17 people is proposed.  That is less than one for every county.  I would like a Kerry man or a Dingle man on the board.  There should be somebody on the board from every county because each will be pulling for her or his own corner.  A Kerry man on the board might be able to obtain a good sum of money for Kerry.  There is a good road to Wexford as the Minister knows.</P>
    <P>The aims of the Bill are good and I wish it success.  It is about time a Bill came before the House which will make it possible to draw up one plan for the roads network.  Without roads we are going nowhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few proposals to the Minister and to reiterate some that have already been made by my own county council.</P>
      <P>The Galway-Roscommon road, the N63, which I am sure will also be of interest to the Leas-Chathaoirleach, should be upgraded from the status of national secondary to national primary route.  It is unable to cope in its present state with the volume of traffic using it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reiterating the plea from Galway County Council, a special case should be made for the roads of Connemara.  Due to the physical terrain, these roads tend to sink and break up.  Some are in a deplorable state and a rescue package is vital.  In addition, the Galway-Headford Road, locally known as the Curaline, carries a huge volume of tourist and business <Col N="139" /> traffic and there is a request for a special rescue package for that road.</P>
    <P>The Western Railway Committee have submitted a fine proposal for a rail-road traffic link from Sligo to Limerick to Rosslare.  Ultimately this would establish a rail link between the north-west and Europe.  This application has been sent to the Minister with the request that the development and improvement of the Sligo-Limerick-Rosslare rail link, and the retention and improvement of the Collooney-Claremorris portion of this link, be formally included in the National Development Plan to ensure the eligibility of this project for EC funding.</P>
    <P>Much research, thought and discussion has gone into this application.  I strongly appeal to the Minister and the National Roads Authority to give it favourable consideration.  The application is already with the Government and we have discussed the matter with the EC Commissioners. It must be included in the National Development Plan before it can be brought to Europe.  I appeal, as a member of the Western Railway Committee and as a public representative for the area, that this proposal be included in the National Development Plan which I understand is being drawn up this month.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on the Government to negotiate with the EC to allow the spending of at least 10 per cent of European funds on county roads.  The former EC Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry, stated at a LAMA conference in Donegal which I attended, that the councils of Ireland should be calling on the national Government to try and bring that about. Motions poured in after the Commissioner's statement, via the General Council of County Councils, calling on the Government to act in the suggested manner.  To date nothing has happened. I call on the Government, in the context of the new National Roads Authority, and on our MEPs, to contact our EC Commissioner and negotiate to secure proper funding for our county roads.  We could remind our MEPs that they will be travelling these county roads some time <Col N="140" /> next year in search of the elusive votes which will keep them in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Government will immediately set up the proposed regional councils as defined in the local government reform package and that these councils will be empowered to negotiate directly with Europe for funds, especially for county roads.  The west in particular &mdash; my region &mdash; has been neglected and we feel that we have been propping up the east for too long.  All the moneys have been going into the major by-passes around Dublin etc.  As John Healy once said about the death of an Irish town, it is time that somebody cried stop.  The Government's neglect of the west must not be allowed to continue.  A rescue package for roads in the west is vital or many of the roads will be reduced to the status of paths.</P>
    <P>The county engineers have been vocal in describing the deplorable state of the roads, particularly the county roads on the western seaboard.  In recent years many of the county engineers would have felt like John the Baptist crying in the wilderness with nobody heeding their plaintive cries.  If the Government does not respond soon to the pleas of the county engineers many of the roads of rural Ireland will disintegrate.  Already many of the roads are not safe for bicycles, never mind cars.</P>
    <P>Some of the county engineers' reports of recent times are disturbing and no funds are available for surface dressing of regional or county roads.  I understand that this is the sixth year that regional roads and the seventh year that county roads around the country will not be surface dressed.  If this trend continues the roads will be beyond repair.</P>
    <P>In my own county the local improvement schemes for farm roads have been savagely reduced.  In County Galway the funding for 1993 is £136,000, which is a decrease of £32,000 on 1992.  I would like the Minister and the new National Roads Authority to look at this sad and deplorable matter with a view to restoring the former levels of funding for these roads. <Col N="141" /> I ask the Minister and any roads authority that may come into being to give priority treatment to the county roads since they are, as I have already said, in a deplorable state.  If something is not done soon the roads will be so bad that no Government, regardless of funds, will be able to repair the damage.  I make a special plea to the Minister to take a particular interest in the county roads before they disappear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>While my colleague, Senator McDonagh, was speaking I was thinking that in the last month we had four Government Ministers visiting County Leitrim.  I am waiting for the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, to visit the county as well.  The common factor is that the four Ministers arrived by helicopter.  I have no doubt they realised that the condition of the roads in my county is so appalling that it is safer to arrive by helicopter than by car.  The actions by the Ministers and the Government show that the amount of funding made available for road maintenance and repair in rural Ireland is quite appalling.</P>
      <P>In my home town of Ballinamore the IDA built a factory about 17 or 18 years ago which, unfortunately, is still vacant. Originally the reason no industrialist would set up in the area was due to the bad road and telecommunications infrastructures. Over the last 17 years the telecommunications infrastructure in County Leitrim has become one of the most modern in Europe since it was one of the last areas to become automated. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the road network, which has deteriorated. One of the main reasons we still cannot attract industry to the county is the lack of a proper road infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County Leitrim is in a unique position as it has only about 16 miles of national primary route.  This year my county council colleague, Deputy Ellis, issued a statement in the local papers claiming that £5 million was to be spent on roads within the county.  Every one of the 22 county councillors in County Leitrim has since been burdened by the local constituents thinking that there has been a windfall of <Col N="142" /> money to be spent on roads in the county. The unfortunate aspect is that £3.5 million of this money is to be spent on the national primary routes.  To take my argument on infrastructure, a bit further, I welcome the money being spent on the national primary routes.</P>
    <P>It is essential for County Leitrim, and County Sligo, that the N4 be improved. Given that we are on the periphery of Europe it is essential for the transport of goods from Sligo to Dublin or to any other port, that there is an excellent national primary road infrastructure.  The £3.5 million in County Leitrim is money well spent.</P>
    <P>However, we have something like 2,200 miles of county roads in County Leitrim, including regional roads, and we have the paltry sum of £1.5 million to spend on them.  It is impossible to maintain a respectable infrastructure with that level of funding.  Senator McDonagh spoke of the former Commissioner MacSharry suggesting at a meeting in Donegal that the General Council of County Councils put pressure on the Government to have money from Europe spent on county roads.  That is something which most rural councils would wish for.  It is something that should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Creed, put a question to the Minister for the Environment requesting that money coming directly from Europe should be spent on county roads this year.  The answer was that in the 1993 Structural Funding programme the Government would take into consideration the request.  I would ask the Minister to put as much pressure on the Cabinet as possible so that money becomes available to local authorities specifically for county roads.</P>
    <P>The draft road works scheme for County Leitrim provides for ten new pilot schemes.  These have been introduced in a number of counties.  These schemes relate to roads in areas with low population densities.  Leitrim has per capita more miles of county road than any other county.  Some stretches of road two or three miles long may have only two families living on them.  If priority is given to <Col N="143" /> more populous areas the chances are that those roads will be tarred, as the county engineer stated to Leitrim County Council, only once every 40 years.  This is one of the few services people in rural Ireland receive from the State.  This pilot scheme is welcome but it is an indictment of previous Governments of all parties and their lack of interest in the development of the least populated parts of rural Ireland that people in these areas must pay for the resurfacing and maintenance of roads.</P>
    <P>A decent road structure is essential to maintain vibrant communities in rural Ireland.  If funding continues to decline it will be possible to put a gate at each side of County Leitrim and close it off. People will not stay in isolated parts of Leitrim because they have no services. Services will only be available to them if they move to small towns and villages.  A similar situation exists in other counties in the west.  I presume that if we had more resources larger amounts would be spent on county road maintenance and repair.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator McDonagh, referred to the amount of money spent on roads around Dublin.  As a businessman I regard this as money well spent because the amount of time wasted by business people entering Dublin was horrendous. However, rural Ireland should also receive a fair distribution of the Structural Funds.  There is no point in having within a radius of four to ten miles of Dublin highways, dual carriageways and motorways which provide quick access while further down the country having a whole clog up of traffic leading to the city.</P>
    <P>It is very important that such development is extended to rural Ireland and peripheral areas of the country because of the open market and because we are about to receive our final allocation of Structural Funds.  If this £8 billion is not spent more effectively than the £6 billion we received under the last phase of Structural Funds people will find it very hard to survive.  Road infrastructure is one of the main means by which areas in rural <Col N="144" /> Ireland can come to terms with their peripherality and become as competitive as their neighbours in Europe or along the east coast.</P>
    <P>The R202 is a regional road which links Northern Ireland to the midlands.  It runs through Dromod in Leitrim to Swanlinbar in County Cavan and into Enniskillen. The towns of Ballinamore and Mohill are on that road and the amount of time trucks and traffic are held up in both these towns must be soul destroying for business.  Although Leitrim County Council does its best to widen and maintain roads it does not receive sufficient financial assistance to do this effectively. I ask the Minister to consider upgrading the R202 from a regional road to a national secondary route.  The volume of traffic on this road justifies such an upgrading.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonagh pointed out that local improvement scheme grants have been severely cut in Galway.  The same is true of Leitrim.  These schemes have done much worthwhile work over the last 15 or 20 years in different areas.  Grant recipients have to pay 10 per cent of the cost of schemes, which gives them a sense of appreciation of the road they have as a result of the scheme.  The Department should consider increasing the money made available for these schemes over the next few years.  The recent decrease has been a retrograde rather than a positive step.</P>
    <P>Most of what I have said has been negative and is related to the financial situation in which the Government finds itself.  If Structural Funds are not used to develop rural Ireland it will never catch up with the east coast or mainland Europe.  Rural Ireland, because of its peripherality, needs all the incentives and financial assistance it can get.  I ask the Minister to bring this view to the Cabinet table in the hope that most of the Structural Funds allocated to road development will be spent in rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>I have to defend Dublin as many of my colleagues have spoken in favour of the farmer.  It is easy to point to the amount of money spent <Col N="145" /> on roads in Dublin.  When I moved to Blanchardstown 17 years ago its population was 1,000; today there are 60,000 people living there.  One should look at the development of the road structure in Dublin on the basis of the number of people living there.  I do not know why you all insist on coming to Dublin but we are delighted to have you here.</P>

      <P>Not a chance.  I might change house but not politics.  I presume the Bill is complementary to the operational programme on peripherality and in that respect I welcome it.  I have some reservations but I will go through these on Committee Stage.  My reservations are mainly that the National Roads Authority will result in a diminution of the status and role of local authorities.  I am sure this is not the Minister's intention but, as a local authority member, I am concerned about this.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out that there are two aspects to this Bill.  The first is the establishment of the National Roads Authority, while the second is the consolidation of existing road laws and updating of provisions.  I welcome the second aspect although I have reservations about the first.  Much of the legislation on roads is very much outdated and needs to be changed.  That will be discussed in greater depth on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in establishing the National Roads Authority, is giving them substantial powers, which I hope does not imply criticism of the work of the local authorities.  I am sure he will allay any fears I have in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to bring this House up to date with developments on the implementation of the reformed Common Agricultural Policy.  Almost a year has passed since the historic agreement was reached by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in May 1992.  The change in policy direction was fundamental and marked a new phase in the evolution of the Community's agricultural policy.  At the core of the agreement are the twin aims of aligning production more closely to available disposal outlets while at the same time protecting producer incomes.  I readily identify with these aims.</P>
      <P>We have already had a number of debates in this House on the background to and the reasons why it became necessary to fundamentally reform the Common Agricultural Policy support mechanisms.  Therefore, I do not propose to go over that ground again today. Instead, I propose to concentrate on the measures involved for our major sectors and the developments that have taken place since the reform decisions were taken.</P>
      <P>Before doing so, I should say that the reform measures taken were radical in nature, involving significant price cuts to be offset by increases in direct income supports especially aimed at extensive producers.  The direct support was designed in such a way as to effectively put ceilings on production in the beef, sheep and cereal sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we in Ireland accepted the need for change, we did not accept the proposals made initially by the Commission. <Col N="147" /> During the long and difficult negotiations which followed, my predecessors &mdash; one of whom, Senator O'Kennedy, is present &mdash; and I sought to secure the best possible arrangements for our farmers and the economy generally.  There were strong forces within the Council with totally opposite views.</P>
    <P>While the outcome was not exactly what we wanted in every respect, I am happy I secured the best possible outcome for Ireland and the adjustments I negotiated will be of unique benefit to Irish farmers and consumers.  For example, the special beef premium payment arrangements and the new extensification premium are tailor made for the majority of Irish producers given their extensive production methods.  In addition, the deseasonalisation slaughter premium, which has already been introduced, will tackle the problem of seasonality in the beef industry in a practical way.  This has been consistently identified by experts as one of the main impediments to a more market oriented approach to our beef marketing.</P>
    <P>The decisions of the Council in May 1992 set out the broad framework for the new support arrangements.  Since then, the detailed rules for the various schemes covered by the reform have been drawn up and the integrated administration and control system has been introduced.  This means more bureaucracy but the measures must be operated as intended if the system is to remain credible.  A uniform set of rules at Community level are essential if the Common Agricultural Policy is to remain a common policy operating under the same terms in all Twelve member states.</P>
    <P>I am keenly aware of the teething problems which have arisen over the last few weeks as the new application forms have been received by farmers.  I can understand the reaction; it is similar to my own when I open my income tax form. Nobody likes filling in forms but the proper completion of these forms is essential for the smooth operation of the reformed Common Agricultural Policy. It is also imperative from the individual farmer's point of view to get things right <Col N="148" /> in the first year to secure their entitlements. Once this is done the task will be much more straightforward in future years.</P>
    <P>To assist the process, my Department and Teagasc undertook a massive information campaign over the past few months to help individual farmers understand the new and revised schemes from which they will derive an important part of their income over the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In the first instance information meetings were held throughout the country and were attended by substantial numbers of farmers.  Information booklets have been made available setting out clearly what individual entitlements would be under the new régime.  The departmental and Teagasc officials have answered queries and are available to farmers individually or in workshops. More recently, farmers have received their application forms together with help sheets for their correct completion.  I am happy that every resource available has been and will continue to be put at the disposal of farmers to ensure the optimum outcome both for them individually and for the country in general.  I will refer to the area aid forms in a little more detail later.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the new arrangements for the different sectors. The new rules for the cattle and sheep sectors provide for the introduction of quota arrangements, individual quotas for the suckler cow and ewe premium schemes and individual or national quotas in the case of the special beef premium.  In the case of suckler cow and ewe premium schemes, we have to set up national reserves from which farmers who fulfil certain criteria may draw.  Also, we will have additional reserves for these two schemes equal to 1 per cent of quotas in the disadvantaged areas: this reserve is to be distributed among farmers in the disadvantaged areas in accordance with criteria to be laid down by member states.</P>
    <P>As regards the suckler cow premium scheme, individual quotas are to be established on the basis of the number of cows for which a premium was granted in 1990, 1991, or 1992.  I decided that <Col N="149" /> 1992 will be the reference year for Ireland because this gave Irish producers an opportunity to build up their herds and establish quotas to best advantage.  In effect, therefore, our farmers will be granted quotas based on the number of suckler cows for which they were paid a premium in 1992, less a small deduction for the national reserve.  The Department will notify farmers of their quotas when the applications for the premium submitted in November and December 1992 have been processed.  This will be done by the deadline which is set down in the relevant Commission regulations.</P>
    <P>As regards the ewe premium, all farmers who were paid the premium in 1991 and who submitted an application for the premium in 1992 are automatically entitled to individual quotas based on the number of ewes for which they were paid the ewe premium in 1991, less a deduction for the national reserve on the lines already announced.  In the case of both the suckler cow and ewe premium quota systems, the regulations also provide that farmers, whose premium payment in the year chosen was lower than normal because of natural circumstances or the imposition of penalties, may have their quotas based on a different year.  This particular provision has created substantial additional work for my Department and has delayed the notification of individual quota entitlements.  However, the notification process has now commenced and all sheep farmers should be notified of their quotas by 10 May.</P>
    <P>The quota arrangements for both the ewe premium and suckler cow premium provide for the establishment of two types of reserves.  The EC regulations set down certain priority categories for allocating from the reserve quotas but member states are free to select from these categories or add additional priority categories.  My Department has had detailed discussions with the various farming interests on possible priority categories for the ewe premium and the priority categories will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>As regards the level of the national reserve for the ewe premium scheme, I <Col N="150" /> have decided to set this reserve at about 1.6 per cent of our total national quota. The reserve quota has been established by exempting farmers with less than 100 ewe premium rights from any deduction and by reducing the entitlements of producers with quotas in excess of this number by amounts ranging from 1 per cent to 5 per cent.  This gives a reserve quota of about 65,000 ewe premium rights.  The special reserve for the disadvantaged areas will add a further 35,000 ewe premium rights to the reserve for distribution to priority categories in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>It will not be possible to establish individual quotas for the suckler cow premium until the November/December applications have been processed.  Similarly, it will not be possible to establish reserve quotas or the priority categories until these applications have been dealt with.  The reserve quota has been complicated by the decision of the Council of Ministers to increase the milk quota limit for small scale milk producers from 12,619 gallons to 25,638 gallons and to abolish the ten cow limit on applications under this scheme.  In the negotiations on this measure, I secured a special reserve quota of 63,400 premium entitlements to cater for these categories and any unused quota will revert to the national reserve. The Department has recently invited applications for premium entitlements from this special reserve quota with the deadline of 17 May for the submission of applications.</P>
    <P>Under the arrangements, my Department has to monitor and record all leasing and transfer arrangements.  The deadline for notification of transfer/leas-ing arrangements is normally two months prior to the opening date for receipt of applications but for 1993 member states are allowed to fix a later date because of delays in notifying producers of their quota entitlements.  In view of this, we have set 28 May as the deadline for receipt of notifications under the ewe premium scheme.</P>
    <P>The main changes in the special beef premium scheme involve the introduction of ceilings on the number of animals <Col N="151" /> which can qualify for payment at the full rate, a substantial increase in the rate of the premium and the payment of the premium twice in the lifetime of each male animal instead of once under the old system.  As regards the quota system, member states were given the option of implementing a national or individual quota system and of selecting 1990, 1991 or 1992 as the reference year for establishing the quota.  In this instance, I opted for a national quota system and have based the quota on 1992 payments because this gives maximum flexibility and the highest possible number of entitlements.  We do not yet have final details of the 1992 payments position but I am satisfied that the national quota to be established will be adequate for the needs of the beef industry for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The substantial increase in the rate of the special beef premium, combined with the fact that it is payable twice in the lifetime of each male animal and is subject to stocking density provisions, requires the Department to operate this scheme more flexibly than in the past.  I have already responded to the changed situation and we have accepted applications during the months of January and February in order to ensure that farmers derive maximum benefit both from this scheme and the deseasonalisation slaughter scheme.  There will be two further application periods for this scheme, in June and in the autumn, to facilitate producers in claiming the relevant grants.</P>
    <P>A significant element of the Common Agricultural Policy reform package and a measure designed specifically to counter our seasonality problem is the deseasonalisation slaughter premium. Application forms for claiming this premium are available from the local offices of the Department and from Teagasc offices and the closing date for the submission of applications is 28 May 1993.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements provide for the introduction of stocking density limits on the payment of the various premia.  In other words, premium payments will be capped by stocking density limits, which <Col N="152" /> are to be progressively reduced from 3.5 livestock units per hectare in 1993 to 2.0 livestock units per hectare in 1996.  These restrictions should not create significant problems for the majority of our producers given the extensive nature of Irish beef production.  Allied to the stocking density limits, an extensification premium of approximately £26.36 per suckler cow and male animal will be payable where the stocking density is less than 1.4 livestock units per hectare.  I expect that a substantial number of Irish farmers will quality for the extensification premium, which will be payable at the same time as the final instalment of the suckler cow and special beef premium.</P>
    <P>The stocking density limits oblige us to ask farmers to declare the forage area available to them for grazing their livestock. The procuedure for this declaration is the area aid application.  In essence, the area aid application is the declaration by the producer of how he intends to use his land for the purposes of the livestock aid schemes and the arable aid schemes.  The normal deadline for submitting the area application will be 15 May or 31 March.  However, I secured a derogation from these deadlines in the case of farmers whose land has been under permanent pasture since 1 January 1987 whereby such producers may submit their area aid applications along with their first livestock aid applications after 14 May but on later than 1 July.  Producers who are submitting applications for livestock aid only do not have to submit a map in support of their area aid applications this year.  This concession should substantially reduce the burden on livestock farmers.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints from many quarters that the area aid application is unnecessarily complex, particularly for farmers declaring forage area only.  All of the information sought in the area aid application is required by Community regulations and is needed to enable the Department to properly process applications for arable aid and forage area declarations.  I accept that the area aid applications are complex, and for that reason, I have asked my Department to <Col N="153" /> issue a special help sheet to farmers who are declaring permanent pasture only, in order to assist them in the completion of this form.  This help sheet will be issued to all livestock farmers later this month in conjunction with application forms for the various livestock schemes.</P>
    <P>I will avail of every possibility to simplify both application and area aid forms. However, we must ensure that simplification does not erode the substantial benefits we secured in the reform package.</P>
    <P>As regards payments, the EC regulations provide that 60 per cent of the premium payable on foot of applications for the suckler cow and special beef premium schemes can be paid in 1993 but not before 1 November with the balance to be paid in 1994.  The reason for this restriction is due to budgetary factors, the application of stocking density limits on these schemes and the application of the national quota on the special beef premium scheme which effectively means that the final premium payable to producers will not be known until all applications have been processed.  The Commission has given a commitment to consider whether a higher percentage could be paid in future years.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy reform arrangements in the tillage sector provide for area based aid for farmers who grow cereals, oilseeds and protein crops.  In the case of larger producers, payment of this aid is conditional on the withdrawal of land from production. Smaller scale farmers do not have to set aside land but they can do so if they wish to avail of higher rates of aid for oilseeds and protein crops.</P>
    <P>For this year the total amount of aid payable under the arable crops schemes will be limited to a national base area representing the average of the areas tilled in the years 1989, 1990 and 1991.  If the area applied for exceeds the national base area, payments will be reduced proportionately and there will be an additional set-aside requirement, without compensation in the next year.  We are actively pursuing the question of individual <Col N="154" /> base areas for cereal farmers for later years.</P>
    <P>In order to claim aid for arable crops and for land in set-aside, farmers must also complete an area aid application showing details of all of the land they are farming.  This form must be accompanied by a map or maps enabling each field to be located for checking purposes.  The relevant regulations provide that the forms be returned together with the relevant maps by 14 May 1993.  Applications received after that date will be subject to a deducation of 1 per cent per working day by which it is late and no aid will be payable on applications received after 3 June 1993.</P>
    <P>The closing date for receipt of applications is laid down in EC regulations and is aimed at allowing time for processing and verification of claims.  No extension of this deadline will be permitted.</P>
    <P>However, it has come to my notice that, because of the heavy demand for maps being placed on the Ordnance Survey Office, some farmers who requested their maps in good time may not receive them in time to meet the closing date.  In order to address this problem, I have arranged that my Department will accept area aid applications, without maps, up to the closing date, from farmers who made their requests to the Ordnance Survey Office. In such cases, farmers will be given until 31 May to forward the relevant maps.</P>
    <P>In the milk sector, the May agreement provided for reductions in the support price for butter and for possible quota cuts in 1993-94 and 1994-95.  The Commission has recently proposed that quotas should not be reduced this year but that both price cuts should be applied from 1 July next.  I agree that current market conditions do not require quotas to be cut and I have opposed the extent of the butter cut in the on-going negotiations. I am also pursuing a number of quota related issues in these negotiations, including the issues of compensation for the 4.5 per cent suspended quotas and Community aid for restructuring measures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> Apart from the reform of support arrangements, the May 1992 decisions also included a range of accompanying measures related to early retirement, forestry and agri-environment.  I have already submitted proposals to the EC Commission in regard to the introduction of the Community's early retirement scheme from farming in Ireland.  I believe such a scheme will play a very significant part in ameliorating the main defects in the current structure of Irish farming. The land to be released under the scheme will improve the overall farm structure in the country and facilitate young full-time progressive farmers who need additional land to improve their income.</P>
    <P>The proposals which I have submitted provide for a pension scheme open to farmers between 55 and 66 years of age who retire from farming and transfer their farms by gift, lease or sale to farmers who expand their own holdings; a rate of pension which consists of a basic annual payment of £3,515 plus an annual allowance of £219 per hectare subject to an overall maximum annual pension of £8,771; and payment of the pension for a maximum of ten years but in any event not beyond the retired farmer's 70th birthday.</P>
    <P>The scheme would apply to farmers who have practised farming for at least ten years immediately prior to giving up farming and who are farming an area of not less than five hectares of agricultural land.  Farmers taking over the released land would have to be suitable qualified and would be required to expand their total farm areas by 10 per cent and by at least five hectares.  Transfer of land to persons or bodies for non-agricultural, forestry or ecological reserve creation would be permissible in certain limited circumstances.</P>
    <P>I believe that farming transferees should be given up to two years to meet the necessary enlargement and education/skills requirements and this, with the fact that leasing of land is permissible, would greatly alleviate difficulties in meeting the enlargement requirements laid down by the EC.  In addition, I am <Col N="156" /> asking the Commission to show some flexibility in the case of farmers who retired from farming since July of last year.  I am hopeful that the EC Commission will be able to accept that such farmers, provided they meet the various criteria, will be eligible to apply for pension under the scheme when it is ultimately agreed by the EC.  My expectation is that the scheme will be in operation by late summer.  The scheme would also provide for pension payments to farm workers who lose their employment as a result of a farmer's early retirement.</P>
    <P>While I hope that the EC Commission will be able to go along with all my proposals for the early retirement scheme, some of the details may have to be revised in the context of the normal consultative process between my Department and the Commission.  In these proposals I have endeavoured to reflect the views of the various farming bodies.  Further discussions on the details of the scheme are taking place with farming representatives and points emerging from these discussions may be taken into account in the consultations with the EC Commission.</P>
    <P>Under forestry elements of the reform, member states are obliged to introduce an afforestation programme which provides for Community co-financing of afforestation grants; premium payments, for up to 20 years, to cover loss of income; and woodland improvement grants aimed at improving existing farm woodlands, including upgrading existing woodland, provision of forest roads, shelterbelts and firebreaks.</P>
    <P>The objectives of this programme, which complement those of the existing forestry operational programme, seek to provide a credible economic alternative to the agricultural use of land.  In addition, the measures are designed to provide a suitable tool for the implementation of an active afforestation policy, to improve agricultural incomes and land use as well as contribute to the improvement of the environment.</P>
    <P>The Government in its Programme for a Partnership Government identified forestry as a key sector based on indigenous natural resources with the potential to <Col N="157" /> create sustainable employment and committed itself to an annual planting target of 30,000 hectares and maintain this level to the year 2000.</P>
    <P>The achievement of a 30,000 hectare annual planting target would, by the end of the decade, result in a rise in the area under forestry from the current 7 per cent of total land area to 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>The achievement of this annual target will also result in the creation of new jobs in planting and maintenance and related activities.  It will, furthermore, stimulate rural development and contribute to farmers' welfare by diversifying and improving agricultural incomes.</P>
    <P>The agri-environment measure recognises the dual role of farmers as producers of food and guardians and protectors of the countryside.  It allows us, for the first time, to put in place a comprehensive scheme which will allow farmers to receive grant assistance for their environmental maintenance and improvement work.</P>
    <P>Each member state is required to introduce an agri-environment programme though any scheme under it will be voluntary for farmers.  Compensation can be paid to farmers for loss of income and/or increased costs and for the part they play in improving the environment.  Subject to positive effects on the environment, aid can be paid to farmers who reduce substantially their use of fertilisers and plant protection products, or introduce or continue with organic farming methods; change to or maintain extensive crop production or convert arable land to grassland; reduce sheep and cattle numbers per forage area; use any other farming methods beneficial to the environment or to rear endangered native breeds; upkeep abandoned farmland and woodland; set aside farmland for 20 years, especially for the establishment of biotype reserves or natural parks; and management of land for public access and leisure activities.  Aid can also be made available for training farmers in farming or forestry practices &ldquo;compatible with the environment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="158" /> Each member state must submit its draft scheme to the Commission by 30 July 1993 for approval and I expect to have the draft scheme from Ireland submitted well ahead of that deadline.  My Department has had consultations with or received submissions from various organisations in connection with the preparation of our scheme to give effect to their important measure.</P>
    <P>I am not yet in a position to give final details of my proposals for the agri-environment scheme but it is envisaged at this stage that there will be a general environmentally sensitive areas type scheme available to farmers throughout the country.  Farmers will be paid a basic premium per hectare for work carried out under this scheme, such as maintaining hedgerows, repairing traditional stone walls, fencing water courses and protecting wildlife habitats.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is envisaged that farmers who undertake further environmentally friendly farming activities, such as organic farming, tackling overgrazing and water quality problems, and managing land designated as natural heritage areas by the Office of Public Works, will receive additional aid.  The EC funding for the scheme will amount to 75 per cent of the cost.</P>
    <P>The foregoing gives some indication of the scope and complexity of the new support system, for farmers, departmental official and support organisations like Teagasc.  Under the new premia arrangements, we expect to be dealing with almost a million applications, including area aid applications which is more than twice the number received last year.  Direct payments to farmers will reach £700 million when the system is fully operational which will be in approximately three years.</P>
    <P>There is a very substantial amount of annual payments &mdash; £700 million &mdash; involved in all these schemes.  They are extremely complex but they are new. Assistance is available from the Department, its network of offices and Teagasc. Farmers have responded very well by attending information meetings.  I acknowledge that the forms are new to <Col N="159" /> many farmers and are complex and bewildering to a great extent.  However, with the assistance and advice that is available, the whole operation can be made to work smoothly.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that payments under all these schemes are made as quickly as possible. To this end additional resources were made available to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in this year's budget.  An additional £4.4 million and about 300 additional staff were provided to cope with the complexity of these schemes and the additional work involved.  We are currently in the process of putting the necessary staffing resources in place to ensure that we can deliver on the Government's commitment.</P>
    <P>The new régime will require a more market oriented approach on the part of farmers and the food industry generally. Senators will be aware that I have recently received a report from the expert group on the food industry which I established in April 1992.  This report will now be considered by the Government with a view to taking early decisions.  Without prejudicing the Government's decision, I believe the programme outlined by the expert group will enable the industry to develop in a world dominated by Common Agricultural Policy reform, the GATT Round and the Single Market.</P>
    <P>I am glad we have a member of the expert group in the House who is an expert on the fruit business.  Senator Quinn is at the cutting edge in the retail end of the fruit business where much more of our produce will end up in the coming years.</P>
    <P>After this short talk about Common Agricultural Policy reform, and its complexity Senators will have an idea of how difficult and bewildering it is for individual farmers.  However, with the goodwill and support services available there are sufficient resources to help farmers. If the process can be further simplified I will be glad to seek Community go ahead to do so without interfering with its basic provisions and the substantial payments that will be available to farmers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> I look forward to hearing the views of individual Senators because they are in close touch with the people.  I am sure their comments will be helpful to me in trying to bring about desirable changes in the implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy reforms, which will be the blueprint for the operation of the agricultural industry in the coming years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the Seanad to explain the Common Agricultural Policy reforms. However, the time available to this House &mdash; a quarter of an hour per speaker &mdash; is not adequate time to respond to this document, in view of the fact that farmers are having serious problems filling in Common Agricultural Policy forms and in some other areas of Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
      <P>Much pressure has been put on the Minister and his Department in the past two to three weeks in relation to these forms.  I am disappointed that the Minister has only extended the date until 3 June.  This will not work: the Department and the Minister know how few forms they have received.  I understand the Ordnance Survey office wrote to all the farmers with forms this morning informing them that it may be four or five weeks before the maps are ready.  When they get the maps they will have to go to local Teagasc offices for assistance in filling in the forms.  Therefore, it is physically impossible to complete the forms in time.</P>
      <P>I have one of the forms here and to fill it out a farmer would need an accountant, an engineer to measure the fields and the tracks and to account for the ditches etc., a grade A draughtsperson and above all, a solicitor to make sure everything is right.  Sadly, these forms will determine the basis of all grants to farmers for the next four years.  What happens if a mistake is made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find the Department inflexible.  I do not wish to be critical but there are cases which I cannot have resolved by the Minister's Department.  On the Adjournment debate in the Dáil last year, I raised the beef premium and the Minister was persuaded to give certain undertakings, but <Col N="161" /> these were not followed up by his officials.  I know of a man with 50 suckler cows who made a mistake registering one and it cost him £7,000.  The Department has described the man &mdash; he is not from my area, but the west of Ireland &mdash; as fraudulent and he has been put out of business.  It will be fatal if the intransigence and inflexibility of the Department continues.  The Minister claims that, where there is no sign of fraudulence, the Department is prepared to accept mistakes.  Yet, the Department has only been reasonable in some cases and this has put the fear of God in many people.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not accept that a simplified form should be provided for farmers with no tillage who do not require any maps?  I accept, as the Minister says, that the form is an EC requirement, but for those applying for beef premia or suckler cow premia there should be a simple, one page form which they could fill themselves without advice from a Teagasc office.  I appeal to the Minister to provide this and to extend the date for non-tillage farmers to 3 June too. They will be better able to comply with this date than those with tillage.</P>
    <P>I read with interest the explanatory leaflet which contains a section on the penalties to be charged: &ldquo;A reduction of 1 per cent will apply to payments covered by the area aid application for each working day&rdquo;.  If, after 20 days, the discrepancy is not remedied the farmer in question will be eliminated from the system of benefits.  Such a penalty hardly fits the crime.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that if a farmer's form is incorrectly filled he will be eliminated.  I predict, and I have a good knowledge of farmers, that at least 25 per cent of forms will be wrong.  If 25 per cent of farmers are eliminated from all of the schemes it will be a disaster for the Minister and his Department, and will create havoc in the farming community. The Minister will claim that this is outlined in EC regulations.  I spent nine months only in the Department of Agriculture, but I know that things can be changed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="162" /> Farmers are also being asked to sign a declaration as part of the main form: &ldquo;I declare that all the information given by me in this application form and/or declared is correct and complete to the best of my knowledge.&rdquo;  I attended one of the Teagasc seminars held to explain how to fill out the forms and I was as confused as everybody else until I had read the form three or four times.  The Minister must accept that thousands of farmers will have grave difficulty understanding that form and they are being asked to sign a declaration saying that they have clearly understood it.  That is serious because in many cases they do not understand it.  The EC are strict about enforcing penalties for false declarations. That will cause problems for at least 25 per cent of farmers.</P>
    <P>With reference to the deadline for submitting forms I appeal to the Minister to extend the 3 June deadline for people who have no tillage.  The Minister has done it for the people with tillage &mdash; could be extend the other date to 1 July? In the circumstances prevailing I appeal to the Minister to do so.  I am sure if he contacted Brussels they would allow this extension.  The forms came out on 15 April, a little over two weeks ago.  Seminars then had to be held and unfortunately in many areas the crop was not sown because the month of April was extremely wet.  In my area people have been sowing beet and barley over the last week or ten days.  They did not have time to look at the forms until now.</P>
    <P>When I went home last night several farmers were waiting for me and I told them that I would not fill in the form for anybody in case they were penalised in two months' time for an incorrectly filled in form.  That would result in terrible disruption in respect of their enterprise as farmers and they would also lose their grants over the next four or five years.  I am appealing to the Minister to extend the first deadline to 3 June and the second deadline to 1 July.  It will take that length of time to clear this difficulty.  The Ordnance Survey office have informed the farmers that they cannot despatch the maps.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> The Minister said in his speech that Teagasc would help people fill in the forms.  I asked Teagasc this morning how many were involved in this work and I was told there are about 200 officers throughout the country.  Approximately 35,000 farmers need to submit maps with their application forms.  Teagasc said that at most, an officer working full time could fill in six or seven forms per day.  Multiply that by 200 over the 14 days allowed and it is clear that about 7,000 out of the 35,000 forms will be correctly filled in by the officers.  It is physically impossible to fill all the forms on time by the closing date on 3 June with the resources available. That is why I am requesting the Minister to extend that date if possible to 1 July which would give the farmers a further 21 working days.  I appeal to the Minister to do that, in view of the circumstances prevailing.</P>
    <P>Professional, accountants and people who thought they knew about agriculture have found it impossible to fill in the forms.  One man who is an accountant rang me this morning and said that he had six of these forms on his desk and that he did not understand them.  The Minister also stated that the people who require maps could send in this form. Two thirds of the information on the form must be taken from the map, so how is it possible to send in the form when the map is not available?</P>
    <P>The marking of the map is very difficult, because a section in the regulations in respect of the map states:</P>
    <P>A part of the field not tilled between the crops and the centre of the joining boundary of the field not to be included.  This includes ditches, dykes, hedges, fences and drains.</P>
    <P>I spoke to a man this morning who said that a mile of river flows through his land which erodes one to one and a half acres of land per year.  He said that it twists and winds all around the field.  He asked me whether he must measure that river and deduct it from the area to be calculated. According to the leaflet, he does.  Wet patches and places that are <Col N="164" /> planted also have to be excluded from the form.  Nobody can do the calculations needed for this scheme.  An error tolerance of about 2 per cent is allowed, but this is not enough.</P>
    <P>The scheme does not allow adjustments for stoney areas such as foothills. I would like to know exactly how a person can calculate the area of a foothill and base the calculations on stoney land.  Will the owner be allowed to adjust that one way or another or will it be all counted as good land?  If the farmer makes a mistake, does he lose out over the four years?  These are the questions people ask me and I can only ask the Minister. The Minister is operating the scheme. The ordinary farmers are extremely worried about it.</P>
    <P>I am making an earnest appeal to the Minister to allow some flexibility by extending the deadlines to 3 June for the people who do not have to submit maps and 1 July for the people who have to submit maps.  I do not think that would be unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I know a number of people who had sheep in 1991 but who did not keep sheep in 1992 and did not make an application. Are they now excluded from any headage in respect of sheep?  The return from sheep over a two year period has been extremely poor and these people found themselves in financial difficulties.  Their bank managers and financial institutions advised them, as did their accountants, at least to pay off some of the capital payments, work for a while and then return to sheep farming.  Are these people excluded from any quota whatsoever in respect of the next four years of the programme?  Adjustments such as these will have to be made in order to allow people to buy at least the number of sheep they had in the 1991 season.  I know other people who had no sheep in 1992 but who sent in the application form.  Will they qualify for sheep premia and quotas although they had no sheep in 1992?</P>
    <P>The Minister did not specify the position regarding the reference price.  The reference price last year was based on prices in Germany, France and Europe <Col N="165" /> in general.  Our price was approximately 10 per cent to 15 per cent lower and as a result we lost out on the level of premium. Farmers would favour a national reference in respect of the price of sheep rather than an EC reference price.  Our farmers have suffered a reduction in the level of premia.</P>
    <P>The qualifying weight for the beef premium is now creating a serious problem. Am I correct in saying that the weight from 1 July 1993 is 380 kilos, that in January 1994 it will be 360 kilos and that in July 1994 it will be 340 kilos?  Am I correct in stating that the regulations cover these weights?  The Minister did not specify this in his speech.  These weights pose a very serious problem for many farmers.  What percentage of cattle taking, the July 1994 figure of 340 kilos into consideration, would not qualify for intervention under this scheme?</P>
    <P>For the last ten years we have been trying to encourage people to buy continental breeds and now we must tell them to buy Whiteheads and Aberdeen Angus because it is not possible to finish continental cattle within the weight guidelines of 12.5 hundredweight.  It is possible to finish heifers at these weights but not steers.  I know that heifers are not covered by the scheme yet, but I believe they will be covered at some stage.  What percentage of cattle would not qualify taking into account the present difficult circumstances?</P>
    <P>The Minister is allowing some small milk producers, under 50,000 gallons, to change over to the suckler cow scheme. They can either lease or sell their quotas in view of the costs of the new regulations for milk production.  I agree with that and think it is a very good thing to do.  There is a very serious problem regarding the definition of beef cows.  Has the Minister made any progress in respect of Friesian cows?  The people concerned have Friesian cows, not beef cows.  People have been trying to boost their herd numbers and as a result all available beef cows on the market for the past six months have been bought up.  These people are being asked to change over rather quickly.  I understand that the date is 1 January. <Col N="166" /> Can the Minister not get that definition changed?  Many of the people concerned cannot and will not qualify and will thus lose their grants over the next four to five years.  I would ask the Minister to outline the number of cows disqualified by definition in the 1992 season as this would indicate the approximate number of farmers affected.</P>
    <P>We should spend another day teasing out the Minister's speech and going through it with a fine tooth comb.  I am worried about the retirement scheme for farmers which we have been fighting for for ten years.  The Minister's proposal today appears somewhat better then earlier schemes but until it is put into operation we will not know what the catches are.  Two retirement schemes were introduced and both were disasters.  One was during Fine Gael's term in office and I said at the time that it would be a disaster.</P>
    <P>It would be a worthwhile exercise to bring in a proper retirement scheme for farmers aged from 55 to 70 to allow young farmers to take over the land.  That would be very beneficial to the country and to farming in general and we wait with interest to see how the scheme will operate. I thank the Minister for coming here to explain his proposals.  Let us hope we can have another day to sort out the problems attached to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for explaining the Common Agricultural Policy reform measures to the House.  When Ireland joined the EC several adjustments had to be made to our agricultural industry.  The Common Agricultural Policy has served Irish farmers well and we definitely benefited from a social point of view.  As a dairy farmer myself it was a change to see a milk lorry coming into my farmyard to collect milk whereas before we joined the EC we would deliver to the creamery ourselves with a few old tankers.  That has all changed for the better.  We have a better standard of living in rural Ireland as a result of joining the European Community. The Common Agricultural Policy served the country well because it ensured that weaker or less-developed <Col N="167" /> countries on the periphery of Europe had a chance to develop their agricultural output.  In Denmark, for example, the average milk yield per cow was double the Irish average but now Ireland is almost on a par with Denmark to the extent that we have grass-based milk production, not factory production.  This is something we should be proud of and we can thank the Common Agricultural Policy for it.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister for his efforts to ensure that Ireland would benefit from his negotiations with other EC Agriculture Ministers on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  My information is that we will receive £500 million from an approximate total of £1.2 billion going directly to farmers.  Previously, only 25 per cent of this money went directly to farmers because it was channelled to other areas such as co-ops, and for administrative purposes.  Now we are moving close to 50 per cent, and over 60 per cent of this money will go directly to farmers over the next three years up to 1995.  I commend the Minister for ensuring that farmers will benefit in this way. It is important that farmers receive the maximum benefits available.  This fund is not subsidised by the State but comes directly from the European Community, which is an important point.</P>
      <P>Senator D'Arcy mentioned the complexity of the new application forms. They are, however, desirable and people should complete them properly.  If they are not completed correctly, will the Minister return them, giving farmers another opportunity to complete them?  If I incorrectly completed a tax form for my car, the form would definitely be sent back to me.  I appeal to the Minister to allow farmers a second opportunity in such cases so as not to miss the deadlines involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for setting up monitoring committees throughout the country involving farming organisations, Teagasc and the Minister's Department.  In my own area 14 meetings were held over three days to help farmers. Teagasc is an important advisory <Col N="168" /> organisation.  Part of its role is to help farmers complete these forms correctly. I congratulate the Minister for setting up these monitoring committees for the farming organisations.  I compliment Teagasc on the service they have provided for farmers over the years, helping them to compete with farmers from other European countries.</P>
    <P>Farmers should avail of all the help provided by the advisory services and Teagasc.  As a farmer myself I have availed of this valuable advice.  With the introduction of the Common Agricultural Policy reform I appeal to farmers to become more closely involved in Europe because farming should be approached in a more business-like manner.  We should avail of the professional advice provided, particularly when completing application forms for EC aid.</P>
    <P>May I suggest that there be separate forms for grassland farmers and for beef farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">

      <P>There should be no need for repetition.  Unless the area or ownership of land has changed the farmer should not be asked to complete a form year after year, providing the same information. I also suggest that there be a simple table attached to the forms to help farmers convert acres to hectares.</P>
      <P>Under the extensification scheme, there is an extra grant of £26 per beef animal.  We have enough land to qualify for the maximum extensification grant and we should ensure that we obtain the maximum grant available.  May I suggest that only an application form in duplicate, be issued to farmers so that the farmer could retain one for his records.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Dardis; any correspondent for the <i>Farmers Journal</i> would have access to one. However, there are many farmers in my part of the country who do not have photocopiers and they need to keep a record if they are to resubmit forms the <Col N="169" /> following year.  I suggest, as an alternative to a duplicate form, that the Department photocopies the completed form and sends it back with a receipt so that it may be used the following year.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the pension scheme for farmers between 55 and 66 years of age.  I agree that the pension scheme should be available; I also agree with the transfer of land from father to son at an early age.  However, the greatest factor inhibiting this transfer is the inheritance tax on family farms.  This should be abolished&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his kind comments in regard to the participation of the Expert Group on the Food Industry. I have two points to make and I do not expect either to be popular with farming interests.</P>
      <P>First, whenever we discuss the Common Agricultural Policy almost the only voices heard are on the producers side.  I listened carefully to the Minister's speech and to that of Senator D'Arcy and Senator R. Kiely but I did not hear them mention the word consumer.  We rarely hear a word on behalf of the consumer. It is the consumer who pays at the end of the day.  In this country it is assumed that our only interst in Common Agricultural Policy reform is from the producer's point of view, and that our national interest is synonymous with watering down the impact of the reform as much as we can.  It is time that we took a much wider view than that and realised that while agriculture is an important part of our economy, it is not the whole economy. When we come to consider GATT reform we should think of the whole economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People rarely dare to speak out on behalf of the consumer.  In this country, at least, they rarely dare to declare that <Col N="170" /> Common Agricultural Policy is a monster that has swallowed up a totally disproportionate amount of EC resources and distorted the development of the community for the last 20 years.  Ireland has certainly benefited greatly from the Common Agricultural Policy which was an effort to make Europe self-sufficient in food and to give reasonable prices to European farmers.  However, what was a good idea to begin with has got grotesquely out of hand resulting in food mountains, wine lakes and consumer prices that are much higher than necessary. Furthermore, it resulted in the Third World being squeezed out of one of their most important markets.</P>
    <P>I do not see how any European can be proud of the Common Agricultural Policy.  As a prime beneficiary of that policy, Ireland should now be to the forefront in realising that the Common Agricultural Policy era has gone forever and should not try to hold onto its remnants or seek to continue it under a different guise.  We should support a root and branch reform, one that would reduce the price of food to Irish consumers, put our agriculture on a genuinely market related basis and allow us to foster trade with the deserving countries of the Third World.</P>
    <P>If we take a long term view we must admit that the Common Agricultural Policy has done more harm than good to Irish agriculture.  It has allowed us to put on the long finger, over the last 20 years, the vital task of shifting Irish agriculture away from the production of commodities towards the production of value added products.  Twenty years after joining the EC we have made painfully little progress in that direction mainly as a result of the cushion afforded by the Common Agricultural Policy.  Too much of our agricultural output has little or no added value.  At the high end of the value added spectrum, the area of consumer food products, we have failed almost totally.</P>
    <P>We talk endlessly about losing jobs in agriculture instead of accepting that loss as inevitable.  We could create jobs in food production but for the most part we have failed to do that.  Jobs in food <Col N="171" /> production are also in decline now.  The Common Agricultural Policy has allowed us to turn our back on the marketplace but we cannot ignore the marketplace any longer.  The catching up that we have to do is now a much bigger task than it might have been.  It is time that point was made and the ordinary consumer and taxpayer had a voice in this important Common Agricultural Policy debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>Since joining the EC about 20 years ago we have lost, at a conservative estimate, 7,500 farmers per year, making a total of 150,000 which, incidentally, is half the number of people unemployed at present.  That would be the equivalent of closing down a factory employing 150 people every week since we entered the EC.  It is no wonder, therefore, that Mr. Ray MacSharry set about reforming the Common Agricultural Policy.  When he set about doing so he said a couple of things that I agree with totally, and Mr. MacSharry was in a position to know what he was talking about.  He said that 20 per cent of the larger farmers got 80 per cent of the Common Agricultural Policy transfers and the reason for that was that money was paid on the basis of animal numbers and production.  The bigger the holding the more animals and the greater the production.  In that way the biggest farmers got the most.</P>
      <P>Mr. MacSharry also said that he was going to re-direct some of that income towards the 80 per cent who were only getting 20 per cent of the transfers.  That seemed the right thing to do but, unfortunately, when he set about it all the vested interests closed in on him immediately &mdash; the political parties, the farming organisations and the banks all objected. The result was that Mr. MacSharry had to back down with his proposals.  He was praised loudly by Mr. John Gummer, the British agriculture secretary, for his efforts and that is not a good sign for Irish small farmers.</P>
      <P>The new Common Agricultural Policy, in so far as small family farmers are concerned, is much worse than what was in place before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" /> I will give two examples to highlight what I am talking about.  First, let us consider a 200 acre grain farmer operating under the set-aside scheme.  People from urban areas who do not understand the scheme might think it ridiculous but nevertheless there is a lot of money in it for big farmers.  A grain farmer with 200 acres would get about £13,400 per year from the scheme, so it is not too ridiculous for him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator did not tell us how much less he is going to get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>He would get a cheque for about £13,400 in the post.  The second example relates to the suckler cow premium. A large farmer who, in 1992, had a lot of land and could purchase 100 suckler cows might receive a cheque for £20,000 per year.  Many of the small farmers I represent were not even able to buy one cow and they will not get much benefit.</P>
      <P>It can be seen from the two examples I have given that the revised Common Agricultural Policy will, in fact, be disastrous for small farmers and the demise of rural Ireland will be speeded up.  That will be the position since Mr. MacSharry's fundamental point was that indirect income would be paid relative to production and animal numbers and there has been no change in that.  He was right to try to do something about the 80 per cent of farmers who would not be able to acquire extra animals or have the extra production.  A new system should be put in place which will direct income to that 80 per cent in order to keep them on their holdings.  They should receive a cheque in the post providing them with a family income supplement.  I have heard farming organisations say that farmers would not accept and did not want a cheque in the post.  I have yet to meet a farmer who sent a cheque back but I have met several who thought they did not get enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have in mind would be a direct income aid, put in place for small farmers based on their acreage and family size, in other words, give money to people with families.  There may be a way by which this can be achieved.  In the 1970s <Col N="173" /> and early 1980s intensification resulted in the accumulation of surpluses of wine and other agricultural products.  In the 1990s the EC is discussing extensification. A proper extensification programme, coupled with an indirect or family income supplement for small farmers, would enable them to stay on their holdings. This would also help tourism promotion. People could be paid to stay on their holdings and advised to carry out certain environmental works.  I am not sure whether the Common Agricultural Policy can be revised because the EC Agriculture Commissioner stated last week that the revised Common Agricultural Policy is in place and cannot be renegotiated.</P>
    <P>The EC area aid application for arable and livestock schemes consists of four pages of terms and conditions and eight pages of explanatory notes.  A woman who contacted me during the week said she went to a solicitor for help in completing this application.  He was unable to do so and suggested that she go to politicians for help as it was they who drew up the form.  The Teagasc staff in Carlow are working around the clock and will work next Saturday and Sunday to help farmers complete these forms.  I and other small farmers would be unable to fill in this form.</P>
    <P>The procedures are strict, detailed and complicated.  All tillage farmers must submit either a six or a 25 inch ordnance survey map.  Perimeter boundaries must be highlighted in red, boundaries of individual fields or blocks in green and separate crops within a field must be indicated by a dotted line in black felt. Areas for each individual tillage crop must be given in hectares rounded to two decimal places.  The width of each headland must be measured to the centre of the ditch.  In the case of grass farms there is no need for a map but every farmer has to provide the townland address and district electoral division for each field or block of land.  The area aid application is the key requirement for all European Community premia.  Unless the form is completed and sent to the Department a farmer will not qualify for premia.  Many of them may not be aware of this and may not send in the form.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> An area aid application performs a number of functions.  It is a declaration of land use.  One must state what crops, including grass, one is growing in each field or block of land in 1993.  In the case of tillage it is an actual application for European Community tillage aid.  For livestock farmers the forage area declared in the area aid form will be used to calculate stocking densities for cattle premia and extensification, but the area aid form is not in itself an application for any livestock schemes.  One must still have to apply separately for suckler and beef premia.  This could cause confusion.</P>
    <P>For tillage and mixed tillage dry stock farms the completed form must reach the Department by 14 May.  Also, farmers who tilled any of their land since 1 January 1987 must submit the form by 14 May even though these farmers may have no tillage in 1993.  All grass farmers with no land in tillage since 1987 must submit their completed forms with the first livestock aid application after 14 May but in any event not later than 1 July.  There are penalties for late declarations.  Aid will be reduced by 1 per cent for each working day that an application/declaration is late, up to a maximum of 20 days after the closing date.  No aid will be paid if it is received after 3 June which is 20 days after the closing date.  It is not surprising that the solicitor to whom I referred earlier would not fill in the form.</P>
    <P>Accuracy in crop and forage acreage declaration is crucial.  Acreage declarations up to 2 per cent in excess of actual acreage will incur no penalty. Excess declarations of between 2 and 10 per cent will result in aid not being paid for twice the number of acres falsely declared.  Excess declarations of between 10 and 20 per cent will lead to a 30 per cent penalty.  No aid will be paid where the difference between declared and actual acreage is greater than 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>Forage area aid is complicated because it includes fences, hedgerows, drains and excludes buldings, woods, ponds, paths, rock outcrop and bogs not grazed.  Tillage crops entered for set aside and tillage areas as well as permanent horticultural crops are also excluded.  It is important to note that differences of more than 2 per cent between declared and actual <Col N="175" /> forage area will lead to severe reductions or a complete withdrawal of aid.  If the time granted for submitting applications is not extended many people will not qualify for aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House very long because I know other Members wish to speak.  I never thought I would see the day that Gay Byrne would be the saviour of the Irish farmer.  This morning he agreed that the forms which have to be completed, the arable crop lands which have to be measured and the timescale within which the forms must be returned are posing an impossible task for 36,000 farmers.  By this morning 125 applications throughout the country were returned. The Land Registry maps will not be available in most cases for about three weeks or more.  The Minister informed the House today that he is extending the closing date for receipt of applications until 31 May.  On the basis of the information made available through the airwaves and Gay Byrne, farmers will be delighted that an extension of two weeks was granted but it is insufficient.</P>
      <P>One speaker after another referred to the serious problems many farmers are facing.  Would the Minister not agree that it is in the national interest that each of these forms is filled in properly so that the maximum aid transfers are received from Europe?  I ask the Minister for an extension of time on the lines that Senator D'Arcy mentioned.  Even if the forms were not as complicated as they are, more time would still be needed. When Deputy Deasy was Minister for Agriculture forms were issued to farmers to enable them to apply for financial assistance to cope with problems they faced as a result of bad weather in 1986. Although this form consisted of two pages, many people had difficulties completing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister for a change in attitude. It should not be the Department against 170,000 farmers.  We should be helping them.  If the 200 field staff worked 24 hours a day from now until the closing date, they would not get the work finished. Some 50 per cent of the people who have received those forms will <Col N="176" /> require help.  People are out measuring with tape &mdash; it takes two family members to do so &mdash; the bits and pieces of farms that cannot be included and there can only be a 2 per cent error tolerance.  I ask the Minister to help rather than hinder the process.  It is fine for the people in Europe to ask that this be done within a certain period but it is for the Minister to ask Europe for an extension to ensure we receive the maximum benefit.</P>
    <P>There is another issue in relation to GATT and the other reforms taking place which should be addressed.  There was an average of 460,000 suckler cows here over the last number of years.  That has increased to a million.  Are there any contingency plans to ensure markets for the extra stock that we will have in the next six, 12 or 18 months?  We do not want to return to the problem we had in 1974 when the cattle market collapsed. Long term plans for solving and preparing for that problem are required. Many people will start to think about this when these forms are filled, but we should not have it until then.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Naughten.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is an important subject which is undoubtedly affecting every farm in the country.  I thank Senator Farrelly for sharing his time with me.</P>
      <P>There is major concern about this form as there is little time available for getting maps or assistance when filling it out. Senator D'Arcy dealt with that part earlier. The form is causing concern to farmers because of the problem of obtaining maps.  Could the Minister confirm that only tillage farmers have to get maps this year?  There is confusion in the minds of farmers seeking extensification grants who think they also have to furnish maps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Land leasing is another area of difficulty, particularly in the west, where maps are being sought for land that has been leased.  I ask the Minister, with regard to extensification and the leasing of land, to waive the requirement to send in maps.  I cannot understand why it is <Col N="177" /> not possible for farmers to go into their local county council office and get maps, thereby generating much needed revenue for the local authority.  It is possible for each local authority to provide detailed maps of acreages on the 25-inch square map.  That would be of major assistance to farmers who will have to send in maps next year.</P>
    <P>The ewe premium scheme is causing many problems for farmers.  Many farmers in my country had more sheep in 1992 than they had in 1991.  The quota is based on the 1991 figures and farmers who had more sheep in 1992 are losing out on grants as a result.  Perhaps it would be possible for farmers who had more sheep in 1992 to get a premium based on an average over the two years.  This would be of major assistance to many farmers.</P>
    <P>The sheep meat regime and the reference price, which is now based on a price throughout the EC is unfortunate as far as the Irish farmer is concerned. Ireland is very far away from the market, which is mainly in Paris, and we have received no allowance or special recognition of that fact.  The reference price, which has effectively reduced the ewe subsidies by 15 per cent, is affecting every Irish sheep farmer at a time when the sheep meat regime is going through a difficult period.  We should have fought our case to be treated differently from the rest of the EC.  We are treated as if we were farming in France or adjacent to the main market and that has caused major problems for many sheep farmers throughout this country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's efforts with regard to the pension scheme for farmers. That will be an interesting and exciting development.  Farmers, on reaching 55 years can lease their land to their sons and introduce them to farming.  I welcome the scheme and ask the Minister to press ahead with it.  It will make major changes in the face of Irish farming.  Farms can generate only one income.  The introduction of this scheme may bring many young people into farming as the retiring farmer will have a income by way of pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and compliment him on <Col N="178" /> his speech which covered practically all aspects of Common Agricultural Policy reform.  It is important to put Common Agricultural Policy and Common Agricultural Policy reform in context.  We joined the EC on the cornerstone of the Common Agricultural Policy and it has served us well.  As Senator Kiely said, we have had our hiccups along the way but the new cornerstone for farming is the reform of that package and its implementation. I am somewhat surprised by the fact that farmers are upset about being asked to fill out a form that will guarantee them an income over the next number of years.  We must look at the positive side. There is now an opportunity for direct payment to farmers.  Forms have to be filled and farmers will have to be discommoded to some extent in that they have to get maps and so on.  I ask the Minister to allow them time to do that. We are setting down a new system of direct payment to farmers from Brussels and it is important that it is set down properly and that every farmer fully avails of the opportunity presented by the new package.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with two specific areas of Common Agricultural Policy and Common Agricultural Policy reform.  I welcome the retirement scheme but I have one major problem with it.  It is wrong to exclude part-time farmers; the Government should include them in the early retirement scheme under the Common Agricultural Policy.  Part-time farmers should not and must not be discriminated against in this scheme if economic circumstances force them to take employment off the farm to maintain and develop their holdings and to provide for their families.  It would be a national disgrace if progressive part-time farmers were penalised while farmers who resort to the farmers' dole will benefit.  I have received numerous representations about this retirement scheme over the last number of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to explain what is involved for thousands of farmers in the west, the midlands, and elsewhere.  There are areas where almost every farm cannot provide an adequate income for a family due to its size, bad land or flood damage and if the farmer does not have an off-farm <Col N="179" /> income he may have to leave his farm. Are the farmers who have upgraded their farms, their stocking levels and building, reclaimed land and provided for their families to be excluded from this scheme because of their initiative?  That would be wrong.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to include these farmers in this scheme.  We have a duty to them.  They have been good workers as can be seen from the statistics for store cattle, sheep, milk production, etc., since we joined the EC.  We cannot turn our backs on them and exclude them from a national scheme providing an opportunity to hand over those lands to somebody that could join a number of such farms together to farm in a progressive way.</P>
    <P>The Minister should create a third tier of disadvantage in the catchment area of the Shannon and its tributaries.  Parts of the disadvantaged area can be classified as extremely disadvantaged.  This description would allow for higher headage payments and would improve farmers' incomes.  Many farms in this area are affected by severe and persistent flooding.  The area of the Shannon could be classified with the peripheral areas in the west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I was afraid the Senator was going to ask the Minister to drain the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Too many promises to do that were made over the years.  The farmers in the Shannon catchment area could also benefit through the EC agricultural environment scheme which has been agreed under the Common Agricultural Policy reform.  This scheme will reward farmers through area payments for environmental management agreement. Such schemes already exist in Northern Ireland, Britain and Germany. There could be £25 million in income over five years for farmers in that catchment area.  These figures are mentioned by the Shannon forum and the IFA who have done a detailed investigation into this matter.  This would ensure the area was used in an environmentally friendly <Col N="180" /> way and the Shannon callows could be preserved.</P>
      <P>People in those areas live under threat of flood at all times.  This spring all the carrot farmers in the south Roscommon area, lost their crops due to flooding. About £1,000 an acre has been lost in seed, fertilizer and replacing the crop. This has caused great hardship for these people.</P>
      <P>I am pleased with the 18 per cent share of the £8.4 million Structural Funds going to agriculture and rural development.  We must support farming, which is still the backbone of Irish industry.  I disagree with Senator Quinn who castigated and downgraded the Common Agricultural Policy over the last 20 years.  The Common Agricultural Policy gave Irish farmers a reasonable standard of living. Urban and rural representatives must ensure the farmers make a reasonable livelihood from the Common Agricultural Policy reform.</P>
      <P>A great opportunity now exists for an integrated package of measures for the development of the Shannon catchment area for tourism, agriculture, etc.  I ask the Minister when looking at designated area for the EC agri-environmental scheme to consider this area because a reasonable income will help farmers to stay in that area and a natural habitat will be preserved.  I hope the Minister will consider some of the points I have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister. I thank him for attending throughout the debate.  A valuable aspect of his speech is that he listed in chronological order the various schemes available to us and how they operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an indication of how we have developed as a society in Europe that we spend two hours discussing not where agriculture is going, not how farming is progressing, not how the food industry should respond to the changes that are upon us, but discussing the detail of how particular schemes operate, deficiencies in forms being circulated and how farmers can deal with those forms.  This is a form of madness.  In 200 or 300 years time historians studying this period will not understand how our industry was ruled <Col N="181" /> by a bureaucracy which is suffocating progress and our ability to compete.</P>
    <P>Of course farm surpluses had to be contained and we had to devise different systems.  However, it is illogical to worry about the detail of forms, to put in commas and full stops and how to measure our land.  This has nothing to do with farming.</P>
    <P>There is a field on my farm where only weeds are growing.  Mr. Pat O'Neill, Group Managing Director of Avonmore, said that it is difficult to defend the fact that the only source of protein in Irish fields is the grasshoppers.  How can I defend the fact that I have a field on my farm which is lying idle, or that some of the best productive land in the world is growing nothing, when each evening we see on our television screens the starving people of Somalia and the Sudan?  What sort of madness has led us to a point where we have created this Hydra &mdash; when one head is chopped off another grows in its place?  I do not understand how we can defend this.</P>
    <P>I accept that in the practical world we must devise procedures which respond to the pressures imposed on us because of the way the Common Agricultural Policy has developed.  It defies logic that we do it this way.  A great Irishman, Jonathan Swift, said that the value of a man who could make two blades of grass grow where one formerly grew was worth more than a group of politicians.  That precept has existed for almost 300 years, but we have stood it on its head.</P>
    <P>Psychologically, every farmer recoils from seeing land lying idle.  We were brought up in the tradition that we should work our land properly, we should work hard and we should produce for the benefit of the country.  Yet, we leave our most productive asset lying idle.  This does not make sense.</P>
    <P>The MacSharry reforms represent the most fundamental change in the way our agricultural economy has been managed since the foundation of the State.  We are moving from a system of price support to one of income support where we are controlling surpluses and limiting intervention. However, is it achieving anything, and, if so, at what price?  The latest FÁS ESRI report, &ldquo;Occupational <Col N="182" /> Employment Forecast 1996&rdquo;, says that farming employment is expected to resume its long term decline after a brief period of stability in 1986-90.</P>
    <P>Senator R. Kiely said that we now have a better standard of living.  Those of us who remain have a better standard of living.  But at what price?  There were 189,000 people working in agriculture in 1981, 167,000 in 1990 and, if this forecast is correct, that number will be reduced to 138,000 by 1996.  We talk about great job creation prospects in the food industy and I accept that this is an area where progress must take place.  We have an indigenous resource we must exploit to national advantage.  However, even in that area, the forecast says the number employed will decrease from 36,000 in 1990 to 32,000 in 1996.  How can this policy achieve results when we are experiencing a severe unemployment crisis?  Where will the people who are leaving the land go?  How will they make a living to support their families?  Europe must respond to these problems.</P>
    <P>I accept that the people who framed the changes in this policy did so because they hoped to secure the future of the rural population.  As I said, I am sceptical that it will achieve this objective.  Everything that has happened has convinced me that that objective will not be achieved.  Where is the merit in what has been done?</P>
    <P>I declare that I have a vested interest in this matter.  I have to complete an EC area aid application form which I received in the last ten days.  I accept that procedures must be put in place to ensure that people do not become involved in fraudulent activities and that they regulate their affairs properly.  In fairness to the Minister and his officials, the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the EC area aid application form translates the language of bureaucracy and makes it easier to understand.  However, we are still too concerned with the procedure of red, green and black pencils and Ordnance Survey maps.  How will we defend this situation?  What will be said about us in 100 years time?  Future generations will not understand our actions.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to how we regulate the existing area and how we ensure <Col N="183" /> it is in accordance with the conditions of the arable and livestock schemes.  I have land which is eroded by a river; I do not know the area of that land.  It is not on the Ordnance Survey map.  A motorway was built across the middle of my farm within the last few years and that is not on any Ordnance Survey map.  These are the practical difficulties I see in the scheme.</P>
    <P>If this scheme is imposed on us, the onus will be on the bureaucrats to facilitate farmers.  If it was possible to send officials to inspect land in every county for taxation purposes, then it is possible to send them to help farmers.  The Minister referred to the amount of money allocated in the budget and the fact that there are 300 extra staff involved.  Where are they?  I do not know, I have dealt with a few individuals in the Department who perform miracles to try to help farmers and individuals who have queries. Every case is different.  I do not know how those officials maintain their sanity because they are so busy; it is a victory even to get through to them.  The fact that they remain calm and answer the questions put to them says a lot for their good sense and the quality of our public service.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to £700 million and the one million applications from farmers.  That is a considerable number of applications; it would suggest that each farmer is making six or seven applications. I question that statistic.</P>
    <P>I wanted to make a few points about fulfilling the conditions for applications and the need for proper research and development; I also intended to speak on the report of the expert group on the food industry mentioned by Senator Quinn, but time is not on my side.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the report is circulated to every Member.  I have not seen it and I would like to.  We are reaching a point where those who are left on the land will have to try to make a living from filling in these application forms.</P>

    <P>Senator Dardis mentioned the problem of rural depopulation.  The Senator will be aware that this problem underlined the need for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The pattern of rural depopulation in Europe, was vigorously under way at a rate we did not experience, during the last 15 to 20 years.  Senator Dardis is aware that the rural population in the Paris basin was devastated and for that reason the reform we are discussing at present is long overdue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment the lack of a stillbirths register in Ireland.  I also thank the Minister for attending.  I speak for those in the Irish Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society who have campaigned for a stillbirths register since 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was a medical student in the Rotunda Hospital 25 years ago, the attitude to stillbirths was completely different from that which prevails nowadays. The mother was often advised not to see her baby even though it might have been a perfectly formed child who had died just before birth or during labour.  The views of the father were rarely considered, <Col N="185" /> the role of the man in the production of small children being considered to be that of an obstetrician rather than a father.  The Church did not bury such children and was often reluctant to say prayers over them.</P>
    <P>That approach caused great distress for the mother and the father and, indeed, for the extended family.  Parents, siblings, grandparents and neighbours look forward, with great joy, to the birth of a baby.  It is a welcome event.  How terrible then, in the event of a stillbirth, that it was dismissed as something that should be hushed up or not discussed.  Those involved were often encouraged not to grieve openly which had an appalling effect, especially on the bereaved mother.  One mother told me that she kept her dead baby's clothes and years later she used to hug them because she had never been permitted to touch the lovely child she had borne.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, attitudes have changed. The parents are now encouraged to hold the baby and photographs are taken if desired.  The Church will bury the child in a special ceremony and we all grieve with the bereaved parents.  This is a more loving and responsive attitude.  Some parents name the baby and its siblings are often encouraged to see the child and to grieve openly rather than pretend the event had never happened.</P>
    <P>One pretence still continues: the State pretends that such births do not take place and does not register them.  More than one stillbirth occurs every day in Ireland, yet ours is one of the only countries in the western world which does not register stillbirths.  The reluctance of the State to set up such a register is hard to understand as registration would not only recognise the birth of the child, which has psychological importance for the parents, but it would also provide statistics regarding perinatal mortality rates.</P>
    <P>The birth of stillborn infants should be registered in the same way as live born infants.  The Masters of the three maternity hospitals in Dublin, in letters to the Irish Stillbirths and Neonatal Death Society, support the efforts of the society to establish a stillbirths register. They point out that such a register could assist investigations into perinatal births, <Col N="186" /> as the causes of some such deaths are not known at present.</P>
    <P>A stillbirth is a child who would have been viable but was born dead.  Viability is usually considered possible from 28 weeks gestation, but due to improvements in the care of neonates or new born children, this has recently been revised in Great Britain to 24 weeks.  Some countries favour a more scientific method of deciding when the child will be considered a stillbirth or a miscarriage.  Usually this is taken to be 500 grammes weight but I believe the World Health Organisation now recommends 400 grammes as a possible guide to viability.</P>
    <P>Stillbirths are registered in Northern Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales and the certificate is prepared by either the doctor or the midwife who attends the birth.  In Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg they are registered on the deaths register.  There is a special register in France for all stillbirths of over 24 weeks gestation.  In Italy the registration of all births, including stillbirths is compulsory within ten days of the birth.  The Netherlands has a special register for births and the distinction between a live or dead child at birth is not made; instead it is noted if the child is dead or alive at the time of registration.  Denmark makes no distinction between live and stillbirths and the parents can receive a birth and a death certificate for the child.</P>
    <P>In addition to the strong social reasons for having a stillbirths register, there are scientific ones.  Our medical statistics are excellent but in this area there is a deficiency and I urge the Minister to rectify it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree generally with Senator Henry on the need to introduce a system of stillbirth registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our present legislation on the registration of births, marriages and deaths is showing its age as it dates from simpler but harsher times.  The law governing the registration of births dates back to 1880 and relates to live births only.  It is perhaps possible to understand this emphasis on live births only at a time infant and child mortality was high due to the factors of poverty, poor nutrition, lack of sanitation <Col N="187" /> and disease.  Happily this has changed and Ireland now has one of the lowest rates of perinatal mortality in the world.</P>
    <P>Due to education and fertility control we have reached a stage where, more than at any time in our history, the decision to have a child is now a conscious choice.  As a result there is a great sense of loss if something goes wrong and a baby is stillborn.  It is a very traumatic event for the parents; it is the end of their hopes for that manifestation of their love for each other.  A mother who has nurtured her child through her pregnancy and felt its life now has to face the future with a sense of loss.  One of the significant developments in psychology in recent years has been the recognition of the need to grieve as part of the healing process.</P>
    <P>As legislators it is important that we pay heed to the people directly involved. Many individual parents and groups, such as the Irish Stillbirth Neonatal Death Society, have made the case movingly for a stillbirth register which would serve as a focus for the memories of bereaved parents and help them come to terms with their loss.</P>
    <P>A number of maternity hospitals and units have responded to this concern with tact and sensitivity and set up in-house registers of their own.  I am receptive to the idea of setting up such a statutory register as part of an overall review of the registration of birth, marriages and deaths.  While the registration system has served us well, it does need an overhaul to take account of current patterns of living.</P>
    <P>The Second Commission on the Status of Women, in its recent report, recommended the establishment of a register of stillbirths and proposed changes in the format of birth certificates, in addition to proposals on the age of consent for marriage and the ceremony of civil marriage.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the arguments for a register of stillbirths.  However, there are still a number of issues to be decided on, some of which were mentioned by Senator Henry.  These include the gestational age and weight of deciding if a <Col N="188" /> pregnancy has ended in a stillbirth and the format of the register and access to the register.</P>
    <P>It is important that we undertake a comprehensive review of the entire code of registration legislation covering births, marriages and deaths rather than go the route of piecemeal change.  The registration laws as they exist do not meet the needs of our society.  The objective in reviewing the code is to put in place a registration system which is appropriate, effective, sensitive to people's needs and involves as little bureaucracy as possible.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for reform in this area has become the task of my Department and our job will be to determine how registration can be modified to meet today's conditions and needs.  This is a sensitive issue and I assure the parents and families involved, and the Members of this House, that within the parameters I have set we will develop our proposals on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first occasion I have spoken when my friend, neighbour and party colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, has been in this House.  I welcome the Minister and commend him on his recent appointment.  I am grateful that he has come to the House to deal with this matter.  However, this is probably my last compliment until I hear his response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early 1970s the State through the NBA and local authorities, perpetrated one of the greatest injustices on the people.  In a fit of madness, thousands of so-called system built low cost houses were erected to meet urgent housing needs.  Houses were built from prefabricated <Col N="189" /> units with electric air central heating units which did not work or were expensive to run.  The houses had no standard fireplaces.  These housing estates were finished in a spartan fashion and have been a problem ever since.  The Minister is familiar with them because there are some of these houses in his constituency.</P>
    <P>We in County Wicklow received more than our fair share of these houses.  One of the estates concerned is the Oldcourt estate in Bray.  This estate was designed by the NBA and built under the aegis of that Authority during the period 1971 to 1973.  The estate contains 240 houses. After years of complaints, a refurbishment scheme was started.  In 1985 a pilot project involving a limited number of houses was commenced.  The refurbishment scheme proper got under way in 1986.  Since that date the Government has invested £4.541 million in the programme. Only £100,000 was allocated for the completion of this work since the programme was undertaken.</P>
    <P>Houses which were once the dread of the local authority tenants, have become prime housing stock and comfortable homes.  The refurbishment scheme has been costly for the Government and for the people who live in the Oldcourt estate.  They have lived in an estate which, to put it mildly, has been a disorganised housing site for the last eight years.  The people endured these refurbishments with stoic dignity in the knowledge that at the end of the day, they would have an estate of which they could be proud, a place where they could rear their children.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years the atmosphere in the Oldcourt estate has been transformed.  An air of confidence has prevailed.  However, this was brought to an end earlier this week when the Department of the Environment allocated £100,000 to Bray Urban District Council for the completion of the work in the Oldcourt estate.  This figure is inadequate. It will not even cover the outstanding bills in respect of work which is already being carried out.</P>
    <P>At present, Bray Urban District Council owes Wicklow County Council <Col N="190" /> £300,000 for work which is being completed. Seven houses in one block still await refurbishment and completing that work will cost £150,000.  Bray Urban District Council has asked the Department of the Environment for approximately £100,000 to carry out work on roads and footpaths, some of which are in a shambolic state because of building works.</P>
    <P>The council submitted landscaping and gardening proposals to the Department which will cost approximately £250,000. None of these proposals could be regarded as luxuries.  Residents are entitled to them because for 20 years they have put up with housing conditions which, at its most charitable, could be described as substandard.  An entire generation has grown up in the Oldcourt estate without the benefit of facilities which could be regarded as a basic and fundamental right.</P>
    <P>For eight years, the people of the estate have been living on a building site.  I ask the Minister to review the derisory allocation of £100,000 for the refurbishment of the Oldcourt estate.  A substantial increase is needed if the work, which has been carried out over the last eight years, is to be completed without further costly and frustrating delays.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, who has specific responsibility for housing, is due to visit Bray at the invitation of Councillor John Byrne and Councillor Michael Ledwidge, the chairmen of Wicklow County Council and Bray UDC, respectively.  I invite the Ministers, Deputy Browne (<i>Wexford</i>) and Deputy Stagg, to visit the Oldcourt estate and see what has been done and what needs to be done.</P>
    <P>Two other refurbishment schemes are needed in the area, in particular, parts of the Fassaroe estate in Bray.  However, the most urgent need is to complete the work which has gone on for eight years in the Oldcourt estate.  The people in that estate have put up with a considerable amount of inconvenience because they were promised that the estate, like those in Kindlestown Park, Greystones, or Rockfield Park, Kilmacanogue, would be refurbished and landscaped.  Given the State's investment of £4.5 million in the <Col N="191" /> Oldcourt estate, I ask the Minister, to complete refurbishment work without further delay.</P>
    <P>Until very recently the Department of the Environment looked favourably on Old Court in the review of expenditure proposals for refurbishment schemes at the end of each financial year.  They have done this &mdash; and it is a broad hint to the Minister &mdash; because the direct labour scheme which is operated in County Wicklow has been a model.  It has been very efficient and it has always managed to spend the Departmental allocations which in the past were available but unspent, to the embarrassment of Ministers.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister at my invitation to review this matter and to look around Oldcourt.  If he were to do that and meet with local officials he would be as convinced as I am that the balance of the money would be well worth investing in this Estate in this financial year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The management, maintenance and improvement of the rented dwellings is a matter for Bray UDC.  For this purpose they have available 100 per cent of rental income in addition to 40 per cent of the proceeds of tenant purchase schemes. However, successive Governments have realised that there are some exceptional housing problems, the cost of which housing authorities could not easily deal with from their own resources.  The remedial work scheme was introduced to assist authorities in coping with these problems.  The scheme is primarily intended to enable authorities to undertake necessary structural works to so-called low cost housing schemes, pre-1940 dwelling and, in certain cases, to rundown urban estates.  The full cost of eligible major structural works to estates which have been designated for funding under the scheme is made available to authorities.  To date nearly £100 million has been allocated to authorities to meet <Col N="192" /> expenditure under the scheme and the 1993 allocation of £17.2 million will allow work to continue on some 70 estates throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Oldcourt estate in Bray is one of the low cost estates which has been transformed with the assistance of remedial scheme funding.  The estate consists of 240 low cost houses building between 1973 and 1976.  The refurbishment work involves major reconstruction including the provision of block work, walls, pitched roofing, replacement of joinery and windows, replacement of existing heating systems and necessary ancillary work.  To date over £4.5 million has been allocated to the UDC to fund the work in the Oldcourt estate.  The UDC has allocated a total of £643,000 in the 1993 housing capital programme to provide for their housing construction programme and remedial works.  The amount includes £100,000 for the Oldcourt project.</P>
    <P>The funds available have been allocated in full and at this stage it is not possible to increase the amount given to any authority.  However, work on this project has been ongoing for a number of years and at the start of this year it is understood that only 14 houses, two lots of seven, remain to be done, together with the landscaping and environmental works.  Proposals made by the Urban District Council for the landscape and environmental aspects of the project are under examination and we will shortly be in a position to notify them of the extent to which these works will be eligible for funding under the scheme.  When the complete cost of works eligible for funding has been established the allocation notified to the UDC will be reviewed later in the year in the light of spending by the council and other authorities generally. The Senator can rest assured of our commitment that sufficient capital funding will be provided to meet approved expenditure for the completion of the refurbishment works on this estate. I will visit the estate in the next couple of weeks to see the position.</P>
