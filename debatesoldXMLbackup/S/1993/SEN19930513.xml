      <P>I have notice from Senator Cosgrave that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to explore the possibility of having St. Helen's House, Booterstown, preserved for the benefit of the State.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Roche of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to make immediate arrangements to permit children from Kilcoole, Delgany and Greystones areas who cannot get admission to the local second level school in Greystones to use the school bus transport system in order that they may attend schools in Wicklow where there are second level places available.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Reynolds of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide the necessary funding for adequate staffing levels at Manorhamilton Hospital, County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="318" /> The need for the Minister for Health to provide additional funding for the improvement of services including maternity services at the General Hospital, Ennis; to indicate his plans for the long term development of acute medical surgical services at the hospital, the appointment of additional nurses to help alleviate the workload on the existing staff, and if he will give an assurance that no wards will be closed during the summer period.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to make a statement on the proposals to close the casualty department of Ennis General Hospital from 1 a.m. to 8 a.m. from 1 June and on the proposed closure of a ward and a theatre in the hospital.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to take steps as a matter of urgency to protect the important archaeological site at Christchurch Place, recently uncovered, which contains an impressive portion of the pre-Norman town wall and thirteenth century mural tower, which is threatened by commercial development and infill.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators, Cosgrave, Roche, Reynolds, Daly, Taylor-Quinn and Norris as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Cosgrave's and Roche's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Reynolds, Daly, Taylor-Quinn and Norris may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Item I to conclude by 1 p.m. If the House wishes, time limits on that item can be agreed.  Item 2 will be taken from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. I suggest 20 minutes <Col N="319" /> for spokespersons and ten minutes for each Senator thereafter to allow time sharing.  A sos will be taken between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business can I take it that the item on the Culliton report will not necessarily conclude today if there are more speakers than time available?  This is a major issue and will it be left on the Order Paper if that should be necessary?</P>
      <P>I want to raise a question which is causing concern to members of my group and that is the new system of committees in both Houses.  I do not want to anticipate what will be said in the debate today but the fact is that the new system of committees has largely by-passed this House.  It could be said that this House is small enough to allow its Members to participate much more freely in committees than Members of the other House.  These new committees will confer extensive powers and influence on the Members who comprise them, especially in such matters as the calling of witnesses and civil servants, the investigation of matters and so forth.</P>
      <P>The neglect of this House is a serious matter and steps should be taken but not necessarily to ape what is happening in the other House or to set up structures for the sake of it.  We are at the beginning of a session, with many new, enthusiastic Members in addition to older experienced Members.  There is a genuine desire on all sides to be included in what is happening.  I ask the Leader of the House to consider convening a meeting of leaders of groups, or a small committee, to examine ways in which we could be part of the committee process.</P>
      <P>Finally, on a different matter which may have been raised already on the Order of Business, there is concern about the late arrival of Seanad Official Reports.  I think there is a delay of almost a month at present.  If there is a problem perhaps we could be informed.</P>

      <P>I will make inquiries on the matter and let the Senator know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Leader of the House about the dearth of Government legislation.  I note the Bill on refugee status was defeated by the Government in the other House last night.  What is the programme for legislation for the next period?  It has been indicated to Senators that there is legislation ready to be introduced, but this is not happening.  The Suicide Bill was moved from here to the other House because the other House did not have sufficient legislation.</P>
      <P>This delay raises two issues.  First, what Government legislation is forthcoming? Secondly, Government should be more open to accepting legislation from the Opposition or the Independent benches. Where legislation is in line with Government policy there should be a more open-minded and generous response.</P>
      <P>You will have noted, a Chathaoirligh, that last night's two Adjournment matters and one of this evening's are concerned with education.  During the previous session there was long discussion on the Green Paper on Education, which through the agreement of the Whips ended with a form of question time.  It was then decided that education debates should take place in the Seanad on a regular basis.  I put it to the Leader of the House that general discussions could be followed by a form of question time, and that the House should return to the previous agreement to have a major debate on education at least twice a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask a question of the Leader of the House.  One of his colleagues suggested a few weeks ago that Mother Teresa should address this House and he received the support of many Members of the House.  I would like to know whether that proposal has been rejected by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is being discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and a decision will be conveyed to the Senator in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Item 2 is a very important matter.  The time limits placed on speakers <Col N="321" /> are too tight.  Would it be possible to get agreement for an open ended debate where Senators could speak for as long as they wished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>The first matter raised was on the system of committees and I will arrange a meeting with Senator Manning.  Other points may emerge from the debate this morning, but I would welcome nevertheless a meeting of the leaders of each group in this House to discuss ways of ensuring that this House is not left out of the new system of committees.</P>
      <P>In response to Senator O'Toole I will bring the House up to date next week on the Government's programme for legislation between now and the summer recess.  I would welcome a debate on education with the new Minister before the summer recess and I will ask the Government Whip to arrange that.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would make the point to the Senator that the best debates in this House have featured some control on time.  There will be no guillotine on today's debate.  However, in the interest of many Senators who would like to contribute today, I would like agreement to restrict speeches to 20 minutes for opening statements and ten thereafter.  It would be possible to change that a little, but I believe in the interest of a sharp and constructive debate there should be some time limits on contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Today we have reached the final stage of the Seanad's consideration of the establishment of a foreign affairs committee. The committee we are about to establish has a very broad mandate.  It covers the entire area of our European and international relations, examination of EC secondary legislation, co-operation with developing countries, the financing of the Department of Foreign Affairs and of programmes funded by it and legislation sponsored by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know this House has been to the <Col N="331" /> forefront in pointing to the need for a foreign affairs committee and in advancing proposals for the terms of reference of such a committee.  It is, therefore, appropriate that the foreign affairs committee should be a joint one of both Houses of the Oireachtas, which can benefit from the particular perspective that this House can bring to bear on foreign policy issues.</P>
    <P>My appointment as Minister of State came at a time of dramatic changes in the international environment in which Ireland must operate.  The implications of the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe are still working their way through the international system.  The new world order that is now being shaped offers both opportunities and dangers for Ireland and for the principles that have traditionally informed our foreign policy.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and I look forward to the advice that the foreign affairs committee can offer on how this country should respond to the challenges that now face us.  It is important that the issues involved are fully explored against the background of our national concerns and aspirations, and that the broadest possible consensus is reached on the future path of our foreign policy.</P>
    <P>Our future relationship with Europe is one vital area that the Committee will no doubt wish to investigate in depth.  Our accession to the European Community in 1973 involved a fundamental decision by the Irish people to join with the original six member states in a community which aspired towards European Union.  The Community has developed considerably since then, the milestones of this development being the Single European Act and the Treaty on European Union.  The Irish people, by very large majorities, endorsed the progress towards European Union marked by these instruments.</P>
    <P>The difficulties that have been encountered in certain member states in the ratification process of the Maastricht Treaty illustrate the tensions that arise as national sovereignty is pooled in a common Europe.  The recent difficulties in the European Monetary System, culminating <Col N="332" /> for this country in the downward realignment of the punt within the EMS, are a further illustration of the challenges involved in the specific area of Economic and Monetary Union.  The problems which the Community has been experiencing in responding adequately to the situation in former Yugoslavia illustrate the challenges involved in developing the common foreign and security policy envisaged under the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>The committee might usefully consider what this country can expect from, and contribute to, the European Union which is to be developed under the Maastricht Treaty.  There are many issues that arise for Ireland in the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty.  For example, will the union be able to adhere to the timetable for Economic and Monetary Union envisaged under the Maastricht Treaty? Whatever about the precise timetable, Ireland's position on the principle of going ahead and on our full participation from the outset to the final stage are clear.</P>
    <P>There was much talk some months ago &mdash; at the height of the currency turmoil in Europe &mdash; about a &ldquo;two-speed&rdquo; approach to European Monetary Union, with a central core going ahead without the others.  The countries usually considered capable of becoming part of any core group included Germany, France, the Benelux countries and Ireland, although we were not always included in the list.  In Ireland's case, our assessed eligibility was based on our fulfilment of the entry criteria contained in the Maastricht Treaty: low inflation and budget deficit, restricted annual government borrowing, as well as our very favourable balance of payments position on our high economic growth relative to our Community partners.</P>
    <P>It has now been clearly signalled that an European Monetary Union fast track is not on the cards.  What we do have before us is the Maastricht Treaty, which makes it plain that not all member states need join the final stage at the same time. Indeed, Britain and Denmark have explicitly opted out of the arrangements. Whatever happens, it is Ireland's firm <Col N="333" /> intention &mdash; an intention backed up by appropriate economic policies and performance &mdash; to be part of the first group.</P>
    <P>Some other member states may be proud of being geographically closer to the centre of the EC, but let me say that, in terms of political commitment and public support, we in Ireland are a core country.  Our commitment to the ERM and to European Monetary Union is strong and unwavering.  We want to see co-operation within the ERM strengthened as we prepare for European Monetary Union.  No one should make the mistake of identifying a small inner circle connecting Bonn, Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels.  The inner circle, if such there must be, cannot be merely geographical. On all economic and political grounds, it must include Ireland.</P>
    <P>Other issues that arise for Ireland in our relationship with the EC include: will resources from the Cohesion and Structural Funds be adequate to ensure that Ireland makes satisfactory progress in narrowing the gap between our level of economic prosperity and that of other member states?  What are the principles that should underlie our approach to the development of the European Union's common foreign and security policy? What are the issues for Ireland in the accession of new members?  Should we favour early accession of the countries of Eastern Europe?  What should our view be of the balance to be eventually aimed for between the power of the institutions of the future Union and the power of member states?</P>
    <P>The new committee will provide an important link to the European Parliament, as well as to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.  Irish MEPs will have the right to attend and participate in meetings of the committee. Other MEPs may attend by invitation.</P>
    <P>I hope the committee will address, at an early stage, the relationship between the Houses of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament.  The importance of this relationship was specifically recognised in the Declaration on the role of national parliaments in the European Union approved at Maastricht.  The committee <Col N="334" /> may wish to reflect on how best to give effect to the suggestion in the Declaration that contacts between the European Parliament and national parliaments should be stepped up.  The Declaration mentioned in particular the granting of appropriate reciprocal facilities and regular meetings between members of parliament interested in the same issues.</P>
    <P>In the new world order that is emerging, the role of the United Nations is of major importance.  The end of the cold-war rivalries has given a new impetus to the work of the United Nations which stems from greater international recognition of its potential.  Ireland's longstanding commitment to the purposes and principles of the UN remains firm. Global action is needed to preserve international peace, maintain the rule of international law, promote respect for fundamental human rights, protect the environment and combat hunger and disease in the world.  The United Nations provides an irreplaceable framework for the common efforts of mankind in these and other areas.</P>
    <P>The creation of peace-keeping and observer forces is one of the most important activities undertaken by the United Nations.  New challenges are facing the United Nations in this area &mdash; for example in Cambodia, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia.  These challenges may call for a new approach in which peace-keeping may have to be complemented by elements of peace-enforcement. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs might usefully reflect on how this country, with its long and proud record of involvement in UN peace-keeping, should respond to these challenges.</P>
    <P>Another positive result of the end of the Cold War has been a renewed emphasis on giving effect to international human rights norms.  Ideological differences and an excessive emphasis on the doctrine of non-interference in the internal affairs of individual states have, in the past, been major obstacles to the human rights work of the United Nations.  New opportunities now exist to <Col N="335" /> ensure that respect for the basic human rights of the individual are seen as one of the key building-blocks of the new world order that is being created.  In this new world order, the individual whose basic human rights are being abused by a State should be able to look with confidence to the international community for redress.</P>
    <P>The World Conference on Human Rights, scheduled to take place in Vienna in June 1993, will provide an opportunity to strengthen further existing mechanisms for the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Ireland, together with its EC partners, is advocating the establishment of a UN High Commissioner for Human Rights as a practical step in improving the enforcement of minimum universal standards.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs could usefully examine how Ireland, with its traditional emphasis on human rights, can best contribute to the development of a new international consensus on the enforcement of human rights norms.  The gross human rights abuses that have been perpetrated in former Yugoslavia are a grim reminder of the urgency of the task.</P>
    <P>Because of my particular responsibility for overseas development assistance, I am very glad that our relations with developing countries are mentioned specifically in the terms of reference of the committee.  I recall the valuable work done in the past by the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries. Its reports helped to clarify aspects of our relations with developing countries and to forge a broad consensus around the main features of our official aid programme. These features include a focus on the poorest countries in Africa, close co-operation with Irish non-governmental organisations and an emphasis on the placement of Irish volunteers and other development workers overseas.</P>
    <P>In the light of the Government's firm commitment to increase our official development assistance effort, the Tánaiste and I have been examining closely the direction which the expanded official <Col N="336" /> development assistance programme should take.  We hope to publish a document on this subject in the coming months.  We would especially welcome the advice of the committee in this area.</P>
    <P>In recent months we have again been faced with the growing plight of millions of people in Africa who live in conditions of danger and deprivation because of drought, famine and disease &mdash; not to speak of man-made disasters, such as brought on the crisis in Somalia last year. Irish agencies and Irish humanitarian relief workers have traditionally played an important role in bringing relief to those in distress, as I have seen for myself in my visits to Somalia and Southern Sudan.  The commitment and generosity of these Irish women and men &mdash; including a willingness to risk their lives for the good of their fellow human beings &mdash; should be a source of pride to all of us.</P>
    <P>When I visited Southern Sudan, I saw for myself the extent of the problem that the people in these countries face and the effective assistance being provided by Irish agencies.  It is impossible to convey in words the horror of the situation there. Children, and indeed adults also, are dying every day from hunger and from disease.  Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced and are wandering from one centre to another in search of food and shelter.  In some areas, up to 40 per cent of the population is said to have died.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem, of course, arises from the recurrent difficulties of irregular rainfall, and plant and animal disease. However, I would emphasise that most of these major tragedies are man-made. Increased humanitarian assistance is essential as an immediate response but does not represent a full answer.  The answer must be political.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs might usefully consider what role Ireland could play in helping to articulate the need for political progress aimed at avoiding a repeat of the type of humanitarian disaster we have seen in Somalia and are seeing emerging again in Southern Sudan.</P>
    <P>Finally, we must remember that aid <Col N="337" /> programmes are only a part of what is involved in development cooperation. For many developing countries, the policies followed by the developed world in relation to trade and debt issues are far more important than aid flows.  I hope that the committee will ensure that this broader picture is kept in mind when we face policy choices, especially in the trade area, which have implications both for employment at home and for the long term needs of developing countries.  We must be careful to avoid damaging the interests of developing countries.  It is easy for us to respond instantly and generously to the image of a starving child on a TV screen.  It is not so easy to address policy issues in the trade area which may be vital for the longer-term development of Third World countries, especially if such policies may cause short term job-losses in vulnerable industries in the developed world.</P>
    <P>We have tried to be as open as possible in our approach to the terms of reference of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  The result is that all issues of relevance to policy-formation in the foreign affairs area will be open for discussion.  As Members may be aware, there were detailed deliberations about the arrangements for discussion by the committee of political and security issues relating to Northern Ireland.  At the outset, the Government was concerned that the sensitivity and need for confidentiality in debating these issues was such as to raise doubts about the appropriateness of debating them at a committee meeting.  It was then suggested that these issues might be discussed in private sessions of the committee. Finally, however, following further reflection, it was accepted by the Government that political issues relating to the North could be discussed in public, with security issues only reserved for private discussion.  I feel that this provides a basis for a very full and constructive role by the committee in discussing the appropriate way forward in addressing the problems of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>What I have outlined is a small selection of the many issues that can usefully <Col N="338" /> be addressed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  I believe that the committee will provide a much needed focus for public discussion on foreign affairs issues.  The Tánaiste and I look forward to working closely with the committee and wish it the very best in its challenging work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion before the Seanad today to form an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  Fine Gael has strongly advocated the establishment of such a committee for a number of years because we recognise its importance not just to the House but to Ireland's role within Europe and the wider international community.</P>
      <P>I have a criticism of the terms of the reference of the committee in relation to the number of Senators included on it which is five. Given that approximately 30 Members of the Dáil are already involved in Cabinet and as Ministers of State, there are 130 Members of the Dáil available to participate on this committee. On a <i>pro rata</i> basis at least ten members of Seanad Éireann should be included also.  This House has been discriminated against by Government in the establishment of this committee.  We are under-represented; five members is not an adequate representation of Seanad Éireann.  I hope the Minister will take this matter into account and if possible will redress the situation at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Government's decision to change the original terms of reference which suggested that all aspects of discussions on Northern Ireland by the committee would be held in private.  I had hoped the Government would allow the committee to decide what matters, if any should be discussed in private.  All Members of the Oireachtas are responsible and recognise the sensitivity of security matters.  There was no need to include this condition in the committee's terms of reference and I welcome its removal.  The Chairman and Members <Col N="339" /> would have been capable of making that decision if necessary.</P>
    <P>I hope the aspirations in the Minister's speech will be reflected in the committee and that we will have the broadest possible level of discussion on all aspects of foreign affairs and especially of the EC. I hope the committee will be able to discuss the institutions of the community with a view to establishing how each of these institutions relates to the Houses of the Oireachtas and how co-operation and closer links with the European Parliament might be achieved.</P>
    <P>It is a welcome development that Irish Members of the European Parliament are being given an opportunity to take part in this committee.  That is a step in the right direction.  Inviting other Members with specific responsibilities and expertise in areas of particular interest to us, especially those involved in the Regional Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, and affording them an opportunity of addressing the Irish committee and having an exchange of views could be very useful exercise.</P>
    <P>The European monetary system and the exchange rate mechanism must be addressed urgently by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  The recent reduction of interest rates in Europe two days after we had devalued our currency deserves examination.  It was unacceptable that Germany appeared to accommodate Denmark, which had not ratified the Maastricht Treaty while Ireland was treated less favourably.  That matter must be addressed by the committee.</P>
    <P>Industrial, environmental, regional and social policies as they are being developed in the European Parliament and within the European Community must also be addressed in detail by the new committee.  I hope the Minister of State and the Minister will attend these meetings regularly and provide details of what is going on in the Department and of how the Minister is relating to his counterparts in Europe on various issues.</P>
    <P>One of the most important events in recent times affecting the whole of <Col N="340" /> Europe is the collapse of communism in eastern Europe.  Its potential effect on the European Community must be addressed.  Irish foreign policy in relation to Europe is very important.  In the Maastricht Treaty security was not dealt with in detail but we must address it before 1996 because in 1997 it is expected that a referendum will be held on Europe's security policy.  The fundamental issue of neutrality, which has been sacred to many of us will have to be tackled.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State in his reply will elaborate in greater detail on recent statements by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs relating to peace-keeping and our role within the United Nations.  As the Minister of State correctly stated the United Nations has done great humanitarian work across the world to ensure that international law is adhered to and that peace is maintained in troubled areas.  However recently the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that the Defence Act of 1960 will have to be amended to allow the Irish Defence Forces to get involved in what he termed in an interview as peacemaking activities in Somalia.  The background to the Tánaiste's statement which changed the terminology from peace enforcement to peacemaking must be examined. Initially the Tánaiste spoke about peace enforcement activities in Somalia and in more recent interviews has spoken of peacemaking.  I hope that he will not try to hide the real position from the Irish people.  If we are to go in in a peace enforcement capacity we need to be specific about it and the Minister must ensure that the Irish people are fully informed about any change in policy.</P>
    <P>It is important that peace be restored to Somalia and Bosnia and Ireland may be able to assist in that process.  It is also vital that the Government be clear about any changes in our role in the United Nations.  We must be specific if we are changing from a peacekeeping to a peace enforcement role or as the Tánaiste said, to a peacemaking role.  The Tánaiste recently stated that peacemaking would involve dealing with land mines and removing types of military artillery from <Col N="341" /> vital positions.  We need to find out if that means Irish soldiers will be involved in direct armed confrontation.  There is no point in trying to hide the reality of the situation.  Is this an attempt to soften our position on neutrality without saying so? Having taken the initial steps in Somalia will we be asked to go further in Bosnia? It is important that we be open, clear and specific.  We must not be convoluted or attempt to minimise what the change in policy might be.  The Minister and Minister for State should come to the committee and state clearly their position on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Cohesion and Structural Funds must be addressed.  The Government is preparing a submission for the European Community.  Unfortunately the Government did not consider it necessary to bring the last submission before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As a result many vital aspects were omitted which could have been covered if Deputies and Senators had had the opportunity to speak to such a motion.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs should be presented with the Government's proposed document and afforded the opportunity of examining it in detail, agreeing to it, adding to it if necessary or making recommendations to the Minister on additional areas that should be covered.</P>
    <P>In the last submission there was no mention of coastal erosion or of providing money to solve the problem.  As the Minister knows, vast areas in the east, the south-east and the west are severely affected by coastal erosion.  Given that Ireland is the only island member state of the EC the Government was remiss in not examining that area and making a submission for Structural Funds on that basis.  Coastal erosion affects many local authorities.  I hope on this occasion the Government does include coastal erosion in its submission.  I understand local authorities have made representation on that matter.</P>
    <P>As regards education, there must be a focus on the under-privileged and on remedial education.  Specific funding must be provided to bring us on a par <Col N="342" /> with other European countries in terms of the support system necessary for the under-privileged in education.  I hope the Minister in his reply will tell us if the new committee will deal with industry, the environment, education, external relations, consumer issues and Customs and Excise.</P>
    <P>Customs policy will affect us in the future.  What will happen our duty free shops when the borders are dismantled? What does the future hold for the staff of those shops?</P>
    <P>We must examine our role on the broader international scene, particularly in relation to the Third World.  On a voluntary basis Ireland has an exemplary record and we have extremely good ambassadors and ambassadresses in the under-privileged world.  However, we seem to react to what is happening in other countries.  As a nation we have a responsibility in this area.  What is our policy in regard to the Third World?  How do we promote that policy in Europe, in the GATT countries and in the international community generally?  Are we satisfied to stand back and allow the major trading countries to act to the detriment of the starving people of the Third World?  These matters are not only political, they are also moral.</P>
    <P>Ireland has always had a strong relationship with the United States.  This continues primarily because many of our people emigrated there and many of us have family connections there.  As a country do we intend to continue that strong relationship with the United States?  Do we intend to develop that relationship or reduce it and integrate further with the European Community? We have never really addressed this issue.  We have to balance our position as a peripheral state in Europe that has strong connections with the United States with our membership of the European Community.  We may then decide what our non-EC commitments to the US are.</P>
    <P>I am pleased we have before us the terms of reference of this committee which will be established shortly.  There is a great deal of work to be done.  I hope the committee works effectively and gets <Col N="343" /> co-operation from the Department of Foreign Affairs and other Departments. Perhaps the Minister could say what contact the committee will have with the Department and whether we can summon other Ministers.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Minister for Social Welfare have contact with their European counterparts through regular meetings.  Can the committee examine those areas as well as foreign policy?  European affairs affect every Minister.  I hope the committee will be able to invite Ministers to find out how their Departments are relating to Europe.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Government has acceded to the constant requests from Fine Gael Members in both Houses to have this committee established.  I hope nothing will be done to minimise their work and that co-operation and support will be given by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Government.  We must take a strong stand and be at the forefront on important issues.  I hope this committee will strengthen the hand of the Government in Europe but that can only be done with genuine co-operation and commitment from the Government and the Department.</P>
    <P>I wish the committee well and hope it will benefit Ireland and the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  For many years I and other Members have fought for the establishment of this committee.  When in Government we were not able to fight as hard as when we were in Opposition.  I am glad the committee has been formed while my party is in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn asked the Minister to outline the parameters of the committee.  I hope the committee will set its own parameters and the Minister and Minister of State, while available at all times to help the committee, should not play a leading role in it.  Unless the committee is given a major role in deciding foreign policy there is not much point in establishing it and foreign policy will continue to be dictated by those in the <Col N="344" /> hallowed halls of the Department of Foreign Affairs on St. Stephen's Green.</P>
    <P>I am glad the committee will have broad powers.  Its work will be quite onerous as it will deal with issues which affect not only international relations but also, due to our close alignment with the EC, most of our national affairs.  The work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, which has been incorporated into this committee, was extremely onerous.  Membership of the former committee generated more work for Senators than membership of the House itself.  Ireland's international affairs include co-operation with developing countries, dealing with the EC Treaty on European Union, our relationship with the United Nations and every aspect of Northern Ireland, all major issues and part and parcel of the political fabric of this country.</P>
    <P>I am glad that members of the European Parliament and of the Council of Europe will be able to attend and speak but not vote at meetings of the committee. This will give them a more meaningful role.  Although some would say that MEPs have sufficient opportunity to inform the people of Ireland of the work they do in Europe the right to address the committee gives an opportunity to MEPs to explain their role and allows us to offer guidance in some matters.</P>
    <P>The role of the United Nations will be an issue of major importance for the committee.  This role has changed dramatically over the past few years because of the breakup of the Soviet Union.  There is now no major world power other than the United States and the United States is taking upon itself a world policing role.  On occasions it seems to by-pass the United Nations which is reasonable from its point of view as it sees itself as the major power broker in the world at present.  The United Nations is made up of a conglomeration of nations some of whom are friendly towards the United States and others unfriendly.  Some developing countries are not as supportive of the United States as it would like them to be.  The United <Col N="345" /> Nations and not the United States should be the overall world policeman.  The existence of the United Nations is pointless if it is not allowed to play the major role in world affairs.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have seen the breakup of States and a resurgence of nationalism which is creating problems in Europe and elsewhere.  We must be involved in trying to resolve the issues which give rise to national conflicts.  The major conflict in Europe at present is taking place in an area which was formerly part of Yugoslavia and is only about two hours air journey from Dublin. Issues of ethnic origin and religious affiliation gave rise to this conflict which could spread eastwards and westwards to involve us unless it is resolved shortly.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of overseas development assistance and the need to help Third World countries.  Much work will have to be done by the committee to deal with the elements which contribute to conflict in the Third World.  The politics of aid must be addressed carefully. International aid has been politicised to a huge extent.  The number of groups involved in such aid is growing daily, groups which sometimes operate in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner by identifying problems and intervening to assist people affected by them.  However, such groups do not deal with the reasons for those problems and unless this is done there will be no long term resolution of development problems.</P>
    <P>Man-made disasters rather than natural disasters create most difficulties throughout the world.  Unfortunately, the same assistance is given for all disasters, irrespective of cause.  Some Third World countries are given excessive amounts of food aid.  The purpose of food aid is to help countries cope with natural disasters, but when the rain comes and a natural growth cycle is restored, farmers will not grow a cash crop since there is no point growing grain which is supplied free from outside.  Food aid when no longer required is not shifted to other areas of need but is left to rot.</P>
    <P>Many people who work with UN and EC aid agencies do not have the basic <Col N="346" /> education required for the job.  People from the EC go on aid missions to countries, the languages of which they are unable to speak, and then have to hire interpreters.  In many cases the translation provided by an interpreter is based on what it is believed the aid worker wants to hear.  Sometimes these interpreters work against the interests of the aid groups.  There are parts of Africa which are awash with United Nations aid associations.  The amount of money being poured into these countries is enormous and the only result we see is the moneys being siphoned off to a large degree.</P>
    <P>I was speaking recently to some people who work on aid programmes for the EC and according to them one of the biggest problems they have is when they look for language training before being sent abroad.  They are told there is no time for language training.  They have to go out and do the job and hire interpreters. That is no way to work.  The international languages are French and English and are of use when one is dealing with diplomats or higher civil servants but are of no use on the ground.  Unless aid workers speak the language of the country they are not doing the job they are sent out to do.  The committee will have to look at the question of aid in which we are involved through our contributions to the EC or our contributions to international aid groups.  We have to look at how best this money may be spent.  The World Bank seems to make decisions which do not relate to the needs of the communities to which it is giving money.  It does not work to the best advantage of the aid receiving countries.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister mentioned the need for an extension of human rights to all areas.  The committee must address the question of human rights since 90 per cent of all conflicts are due to the negation of human rights.  Throughout the world human rights violations are a constant factor in the development of major problems.  It may be said that militant Islamism caused the rising against the Shah in Iran.  I would suggest it was caused by nothing but the violation of human rights by the Shah and his <Col N="347" /> Government.  When people in Iran realised they had no hope, they turned to militancy and the militancy they turned to was that of Islam.  The same thing is happening in other areas of the world.</P>
    <P>The committee, in addressing the question of our foreign affairs policies, will have to look at our diplomatic missions abroad, the relevance of these missions, the numbers of them, their locations and the reason for having diplomatic missions. The world has become a smaller place thanks to international travel, so the need for diplomatic missions has reduced.  Furthermore, communication between this country and others can be made instantaneously and without the need, in many cases, for the diplomatic bag which has to be transported by aeroplane. There are ways of communicating other than diplomatic bags.</P>
    <P>In many cases our diplomatic missions abroad are not geared to modern day society.  They are geared to a time when our diplomats needed to develop a feeling for the countries they were sent to and to convey their impressions via the diplomatic bag.  That diplomacy is only needed now in a minority of places.  Our diplomatic missions abroad should be used now as centres for the expansion of trade with the countries in which we have diplomatic missions.  The era of the &ldquo;red carpet&rdquo; diplomatic brigade should be forgotten. There is obviously a need for us to have representation abroad but we should look at the nature of that representation. I suggest that this is an issue the new committee will have to address in the near future.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the United Nations reasserting itself as the major world power or, if not, to see a balancing power to the United States emerge.  Perhaps Europe is the logical balancing power. The question of peace-keeping forces and peace-keeping against peace-enforcement is an argument that will go on for some time.  It is interesting to see Britain backing peace-enforcement in Europe and Yugoslavia, yet when the possibility of bringing the UN into the Six Counties is raised Britain's attitude has always <Col N="348" /> been that the United Nations could not get involved in the internal affairs of a member nation.  However, Britain is happy to support involvement in the internal affairs of nations other than Ireland.  It has been involved on a multilateral basis in Lebanon and is involved on a multilateral basis in Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that it is easy to respond instantaneously to the image of a child dying on television and that is at the root of the <i>ad hoc</i> nature of a good deal of aid.  If we could respond to television with a third sense many of the conflicts in the world would be abated if not eliminated.  At present we can see television and we can hear television but we cannot smell television.  The day smell is brought onto television will be the day people realise what poverty and deprivation really are.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have shown themselves to be responsive to the needs of the under-privileged both outside and inside this country.  A major task which this foreign affairs committee can carry out would be to put together a plan to deal with the problems of the Third World in terms of having development assistance and not aid.  That will enable these countries to escape the cycle of manmade and natural disasters.  These disasters can be addressed but a viable plan has to be produced.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Taylor-Quinn, I am glad the issue of Northern Ireland will be debated in public to a large degree.  Naturally, issues of security should be dealt with privately and not in public as they could have major implications for people on both sides of the Border.  I welcome the Minister of State.  I am glad this committee is being set up because the work of the committee will have major implications for our foreign and economic policies.  The committee's work on EC affairs will influence not only our international diplomacy but also our national economic policy.  I welcome this motion.</P>

      <P>That is the highest praise I can give.</P>
      <P>It occurred to me that we do not have a department for international relations in any of our universities.  One of the matters that this committee &mdash; which I welcome &mdash; ought to consider is the type of support it can expect from those whose professional activity is intellectual analysis of these matters.  It must be noted by those who work in higher education abroad how casual is the relationship in this country between policy makers and the intellectual community compared to other countries which have more intellectual resources available to policy makers.  This committee should consider mobilising our intellectual resources in the higher education system more effectively to assist the committee in its activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mean that members of universities should write papers for the committee but there ought to be a closer relationship between the work of policy makers &mdash; including this committee of backbenchers &mdash; and current intellectual thought.  A small number of people in our universities analyse these matters. They are talented but their time and <Col N="350" /> energy can be frittered away on a range of topics which have no relationship to Irish policy making.  I see no reason a means cannot be devised to focus their energy on issues which are directly relevant to our country's needs without sacrificing scholarly standards.  I hope that some consideration will be given to this proposal.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that it took nearly 20 years from our entry to the EC to establish an Institute of European Affairs in this country.  It was not until the institute &mdash; which is doing excellent work &mdash; was established a year or two ago that we had a centre to produce systematic analysis of EC affairs.  I hope there will not be the same gap between the establishment of this committee and the encouragement of intellectual investigation of international affairs.  There is a committee on international affairs in the Royal Irish Academy; its work is worthy but is randomly organised.  I hope, therefore, that there can be a more structured relationship between the policy makers, including those on this committee, and the intellectual community. It would be an important factor in making the best use of our very limited national resources in this area.</P>
    <P>To put what I have just said into a wider context, we who are in third level and other educational facilities are regularly harangued by Government about what are we or are not doing for business. Why do we not provide more assistance for business?  Why do we not provide more business orientated courses?  It is time the Government asked that the activity of Government be taken seriously in the work of higher education institutions.  I put the relationship between the higher education community and the foreign affairs committee in that context.</P>
    <P>I turn now to some of the observations in the Minister's speech.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The committee might usefully consider what this country can expect from, and contribute to, the European <Col N="351" /> Union which is to be developed under the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it could spend every minute of every day for ten years considering these matters.  That demonstrates the resource requirement the committee might reasonably expect to have if it is to make the contribution which it is suggested it should make.</P>
    <P>The reference to our &ldquo;assessed eligibility (to the Maastricht Treaty) was based on our fulfilment of the entry criteria...low inflation and budget deficit, restricted annual Government borrowing, as well as our favourable balance of payments position and our high economic growth relative to our Community partners.&rdquo;  The latter two criteria were inserted by the Government because, as I recollect, they are not part of the Maastricht Treaty.  The first two criteria are contained in the Treaty.  It might be interesting to know why some criteria were included in the Maastricht Treaty and others were not.  There is no reference to unemployment in those criteria.</P>
    <P>The concept of economic fundamentals in Maastricht may be valid.  It may be in our international interest to strive to achieve those fundamentals in inflation rates and a decrease to 60 per cent national debt ratio to GDP.  It would be interesting if this committee could examine and propose the criteria Ireland should seek in any renegotiation of Maastricht or in a future stage of European Union.  There would be more discussion next time &mdash; which would not be difficult &mdash; of the criteria for which Ireland should fight.  Perhaps the Government sought other criteria for the Maastricht Treaty. However, the final criteria are very restrictive and serve a particular concept of economic development.  That concept is, arguably, not necessarily in the interest of this country or in the interest of poorer countries within the EC or, indeed in the interest of EC relations with the international community.</P>
    <P>I would quibble with the following:</P>
    <P>Will resources from the Cohesion <Col N="352" /> and Structural Funds be adequate to ensure that Ireland makes satisfactory progress in narrowing the gap between us and the level of economic prosperity in other member states?</P>
    <P>We already know the answer to that.  Of course the level of resources will not be adequate, whether it is £8 billion &mdash; and good luck to the Government for achieving £8 billion &mdash; or £18 billion, because the main issue is not the size of the funds, although that is important, but the use we make of them.  That is affected by our capacity to formulate policy and not, except in a loose sense, the EC.  If this committee gets bogged down in debating all the worthy areas on which Structural and Cohesion Funds could be spent, it could spend its time discussing something which in the end would become a political issue and would not necessarily contribute to the effective use of those funds. I hope it will not be diverted by that issue, although, in the short term, it is bound to be.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting sentence in the Minister's speech which has implications for our foreign policy and neutrality: &ldquo;Ideological differences and an excessive emphasis on the doctrine of non-interference in the internal affairs of individual states have, in the past, been major obstacles to the human rights work of the United Nations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;an excessive emphasis&rdquo; is very instructive.  It suggests a trend of thought in the Department of Foreign Affairs with which I agree.  Nevertheless, who defines what is &ldquo;an excessive emphasis&rdquo;? What is a normal emphasis?  What is subnormal?  What is excessive?  Do we have a policy on the matter at this stage? It must be difficult to formulate a definite policy as distinct from responding in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner within a loose framework.</P>
    <P>If it is possible to specify criteria, then the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs should be aware of those criteria and, if not, then the problems involved in specifying criteria should be spelled out in a professional manner by the Department of Foreign Affairs or by the formulators of foreign policy.  I share <Col N="353" /> what I take to be the implications of the tone behind this but I would like to see &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; elaborated on in due course. I do not want to ask the Minister of State to give an instant response today, but the dimension of our thinking on foreign policy must be gradually elaborated upon.</P>
    <P>I agree with most of the sentiments expressed by speakers on both sides, with one reservation.  We have much to be proud of regarding the conduct of our foreign policy.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has frequently suffered from ill-considered criticism.  There is no doubt that the Department like all Departments could improve its performance in certain areas; however, I do not share the view that the prime function of the Department of Foreign Affairs is to conduct trade policy.  That may be part of its function but it should not be its main function.</P>
    <P>The fact that we live in a global village and that communication is more efficient than it used to be does not mean that we do not need diplomatic representation abroad, whatever the nature of that representation. Every day we are subjected to television images of disaster around the world.  Television reporters do an excellent job yet it is important to have detached and informed diplomatic commentary and observation on what is happening and on long term implications. Television images greatly affect public opinion but that does not absolve us from the obligation to acquire informed diplomatic commentary.  It is necessary that our policy makers would have access to a reliable independent channel of opinion rather than reacting to the latest image from Bosnia, Somalia or elsewhere.  I see that as a reason for, rather than against, a commitment to adequate diplomatic representation in as many places as we can afford.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the Department of Foreign Affairs is overstretched in many ways.  It is a very small Department by international standards and has to contend sometimes with policy makers from better resourced Departments in larger countries.  Our diplomats must be &ldquo;jacks <Col N="354" /> of all trades&rdquo;, unlike specialists in other countries.  Department officials do a remarkable job and we do not make adequate allowance for the fact that they represent a small country of limited resources and back-up.</P>
    <P>The programme which the Minister mentioned in his speech requires third level institute research.  It also poses enormous problems for his Department because now the rigidities of the Cold War have been relaxed.  Issues which were not problematic in the past have now become so.  As a result, expertise is needed in a range of new areas.  I am sure that the Department does not have the resources to cope with this change.</P>
    <P>Later today, we will discuss the Culliton report.  The Government's response to the Moriarty report on the Culliton report as regards foreign trade states:</P>
    <P>Ireland's economic interests are the <i>raison d'être</i> for most of our Embassies and Missions abroad.  Therefore, the training of our diplomats, so they can make the most effective possible contribution to programmes for achieving those interests, has to be a priority.</P>
    <P>The emphasis here is different from that in the Minister of State's statement. The references in the document, &ldquo;Employment through Enterprise&rdquo;, which we will debate later today, are uncomprehending of the nature and role of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which includes the representation of Irish economic interests.  The way it is envisaged here does not take account of the most effective means by which that can be done.  I would prefer the more traditional emphasis in the Minister of State's statement. There are two different voices or tones in the documents which we will be considering today.</P>
    <P>I would like clarification of the Minister of State's priorities and the Government's perspective with regard to the most effective role for the Department of Foreign Affairs, a Department which has served the country extraordinarily well over the years.  I hope its effectiveness will not be damaged by ill-considered &ldquo;shooting from the hip&rdquo;<Col N="355" /> recommendations by people who have not had the opportunity to be professionally involved in the conduct of foreign affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy T. Kitt, to the House; his speech this morning was thought provoking. I am delighted that Members of the Seanad over the years stressed the need for an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>One does not have to travel far to find political problems.  The serious political situation in Northern Ireland, which the committee will address, is on our doorstep. In Europe, Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia are enduring severe political strife at present.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State and President Robinson for visiting Somalia. President Robinson has played an active role in visiting troubled countries.  We are fortunate to have a President who is such a successful ambassador.  Her actions help to educate Irish people about world problems.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs must look at our relationship with Europe when it meets to discuss current issues.  In relation to the formulation of foreign policy, one must look at the critical situation which developed during the currency crisis.  We were not prepared for what happened at that time. Committees, such as the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, should anticipate potential problems so as to avoid future crises.  Perhaps our failure to understand the implications of German reunification led to the currency crisis.</P>
      <P>We are an island State and we must play a role in the European Community. Otherwise, we will not survive.  We must ensure that we receive the money available to us, through the Structural and Cohesion Funds, for national development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country has always been to the forefront in fighting for the rights of individuals throughout the world.  Groups such as Amnesty International have highlighted human rights violations <Col N="356" /> throughout the world, including South America and Europe.  It is important to highlight the problems of people in other countries by making representation through our embassies.</P>
    <P>Regarding Third World countries, the poorer they are, the more problems they have.  One looks at Somalia and Ethiopia and the fabulous work done by the Minister of State, our President and people like Bob Geldof and the money which was raised at that time.  We must ask if that money was spent properly and if policies had been organised, could better use have been made of it?  I have no doubt that much of it was wasted.</P>
    <P>We have a European food mountain while people are starving in other countries. Morally, it is not right.  We see dying children on television and we ask ourselves if there is anything we can do. I have no doubt we are doing our best but I hope that with the formation of the committee we, as a nation, will be able to help these people.</P>
    <P>The Northern Ireland issue is close to my heart.  People in Northern Ireland often say we are living in a foreign country. It is right to have open discussion on Northern Ireland but not on security policy.  Any Senator or TD from a Border county comes under unique political pressure from his constituents, unlike Members from other constituencies.</P>
    <P>I was one of those who welcomed Senator Wilson to this House.  It was an inspired choice.  His contributions have helped us understand the situation in the North.  I congratulate him on his initiative to talk to the IRA.  Many people may have disagreed with it but at least he did something but we will never know the outcome of that initiative.  People should not say he was wrong because it is better to have tried and failed than not to have tried at all.</P>
    <P>In relation to inviting people to address the committee would it be possible to invite people from the Falls Road and the Shankill Road?  Talking to individual politicians does not always improve our understanding of the situation.  I think <Col N="357" /> our approach to Northern Ireland is the correct one.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that there are five Senators on the committee.  These Members have acquired a great deal of experience in the area of foreign policy which will strengthen this committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  He has been a short time in the job but already he has made a definite impact.  I compliment him in particular on his recent work in the Sudan and for the priority he has given to the issues he identified.  It is refreshing to see in the Department of Foreign Affairs, in that august building, Iveagh House, somebody who may be prepared to challenge some of the orthodoxies which are part of that building.  I would also like to applaud his openness to outside groups.  I think we will see a very unstuffy approach from the Minister of State and priorities which most of us would appreciate.  I wish him well.</P>
      <P>I will say a few very brief words about the committee system.  I regret, and it is not the fault of the Minister of State, that the representation of this House is so small.  Five Members will be part of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  This excludes 55 Members, many of whom have an interest in foreign affairs and would have a contribution to make.  If other Members of this House were part of other committees with the same wide terms of reference as this committee that would be a compensation but that is not the case.  I raised this matter this morning on the Order of Business.  I want to put it on the record again because I think I speak for all Members of this House and for all parties when I say that the committee arrangements proposed for this House are unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be argued that because we are a smaller House we have greater freedom to participate and be heard on Committee Stage debates but that is not compensation for the type of facilities and opportunities which this committee is offering.  I would like to see either greater Seanad participation or the possibility of interested Senators being part of sub-committees <Col N="358" /> of this Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs at a later date. Nonetheless, I welcome the decision to set up these four committees, with the reservation about the exclusion or lower representation of this House.</P>
    <P>The setting up of these committees is probably the biggest institutional change this House will face.  It is not enough to set up a series of committees, the culture underlying the committees must change. The culture of the two Houses and of Irish Government over the past 70 years has been one where Governments decide, backbenchers are occasionally consulted but more usually taken for granted and there is no genuine input. The establishment of the committees will demand that Ministers and their civil servants take the committees and the participation of backbenchers or non-office holders seriously.</P>
    <P>That will require a change because it has been the experience of all Government backbenchers that even the newest Ministers within a short time become impatient, feel they have all the advice they need and that they do not want their agenda delayed by backbenchers.  They grow away from the rest of us very quickly and develop a culture of their own.  Some people call it arrogance but it may be that they are too busy and in too much a hurry.  This certainly was the case when my party was in Government with Labour, in 1983-87, and a series of committees were set up which received scant attention from Ministers and, in certain cases, Ministers were prepared to work parallel with committees which had been set up to help them.  That is a test which will have to be taken seriously.</P>
    <P>A further test will be the willingness of Ministers to change their minds on the basis of what they hear in committee. One of the less attractive characteristics of Irish politics is the way proposals for legislation become cast in bronze almost as soon as they leave the Minister's office. A Minister will rarely say after hearing a debate in this House that the points made were valid, will be taken into account and that major changes may be made as a result of the debate.  The last <Col N="359" /> Seanad attracted great attention when Ministers on occasions changed their minds about proposals.  I am talking in particular about Bills which have been through the Dáil and the Ministers do not want them to go back to the Dáil.  They are often more flexible if the Bill is taken for the first time in the Seanad.  Otherwise there is not that openness.  Ministers must be willing to take on board points made in the House.</P>
    <P>My third point relates to the level of expertise available to members of these committees.  It will also be a test to see if the committees are given the backup and information to make it possible for members to participate fully.</P>
    <P>From my experience of the 1983-87 period of Government, I can say that the success of committees depends largely on their chairpersons.  There were good and bad chairpersons during that time.  The committees which worked were those with a committed chairperson who had an agenda and was prepared to pull rank if necessary to ensure that the concerns of the committee were taken seriously. Senator Roche was an excellent chairperson of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on semi-State Bodies.  People frequently disagreed with him &mdash; disagreeing with Senator Roche is a fact of life, making it more interesting &mdash; but at least people know about his committee.</P>
    <P>Between 1983 and 1987 committees folded because their chairpersons were too busy elsewhere, they did not have the necessary stamina, they were not prepared to fight, or they did not believe in what they were doing.  The quality of the chairpersons will, to a great extent, determine whether the committees are successful.</P>
    <P>Everyone who wants to see Irish parliamentarianism develop will watch the progress of the committees with great interest, because it is widely accepted that the parliaments which give the highest level of job satisfaction and produce the best legislation with the widest degree of consensus are those with the most developed committee systems. In the Swedish and German parliaments, <Col N="360" /> in particular, consensus based on rational discussion and good information is the objective.  These are the qualities we will look for in this new committee.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be a good reporting back mechanism from the committee; I do not want to find that because I am not on the foreign affairs committee I will not have the opportunity to speak frequently and at length in this Hosue on the major foreign affairs issues of our time.  I hope the committee will not be an excuse for diverting discussion on Northern Ireland from the plenary sessions of both Houses. This House had a constructive debate on Northern Ireland earlier this session and there was a consensus that we had made a contribution to the national debate on the subject: views that needed to be heard were aired here.  I would hate if the momentum were lost and the Seanad was unable to have regular discussions on Northern Ireland and on foreign affairs. The House will need to insist that the Government of the day does not use the existence of committees to prevent a proper debate on matters of this sort.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to comment on the substance of the committee's work as I will not be a member of it, but I wish it well. I will be watching carefully and I hope the Minister will take the committee &mdash; and I believe he will &mdash; as seriously as Senators wish.  As I said, I hope there will be a proper reporting back mechanism and that the existence of the committee is not used to preclude this House from holding full debates reasonably frequently on questions of foreign affairs and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Manning for his kind remarks.  He covered an extraordinary amount of the ground I wanted to cover myself.  As Members will know, I have been an advocate of committee system both here and in the other House and I have been extremely disappointed at the way the committee system has operated in both Houses to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning generously acknowledged that there were errors in the past when his party shared Government <Col N="361" /> responsibility; those errors were not confined to Governments of which his party was part.  As Senator Manning said there is not an appropriate culture for committees in the Oireachtas.  Something will have to be changed in order to maximise the benefit of the experience and expertise of both Houses.</P>
    <P>Let us remind ourselves briefly of the benefits that can flow from a proper committee system.  A proper committee system can allow Members of both Houses to participate and to specialise in areas of particular interest &mdash; that does not happen at the moment; to build up their own and to use existing expertise; and to involve independent expertise, as Senator Lee said earlier.  Committee systems operating in other European countries, if adopted here, would provide a more logical way of reviewing legislative proposals.  Senator Manning's comments are correct; Ministers have to start approaching these Houses as legislative Chambers.  There is an assumption within the ministerial culture that as soon as the Civil Service &mdash; and I served for a long time in the Civil Service &mdash; has produced the drafts of legislation and they have been endorsed by Cabinet &mdash; all the Houses have to do is rubber stamp it. That is a fallacy and must be changed.  As a consequence, debates on legislation, particularly in the Dáil and to a lesser extent here, take place in a gladiatorial sparring arena where people try to score points.  Opposition is inevitably sterile and Government is inevitably stubborn and unwilling to listen and to compromise.</P>
    <P>An appropriate committee system would allow more compromise.  It would allow Government to listen and to explain to the Opposition why particular decisions are taken.  It would allow the Members of both Houses to operate as something other than people who try to mediate in the myriad of administrative wrongs that happen to the citizens of this nation.  In other words, it would allow a more enriching role for Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to read the arrangements for the remit of this committee.  I believe <Col N="362" /> the Oireachtas has got it right for the first time, because what we will have is a functional committee which will look at a whole area of public policy.  It will have responsibility for legislation sponsored by the Minister; it will not be, as other committees have been, simply a talking shop.  It is obvious that if our committee system is to reap the same benefits as committee systems in other countries, each committee must be allowed look at a broad area of public administration.</P>
    <P>This committee will not only look at the general issues of foreign policy, it will also look at legislation sponsored by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It is not specifically referred to in the motion, but I hope that Department's budget will also be the subject of discussion by this committee.</P>
    <P>From experience I have to say that I await with trepidation what will happen to this committee.  Let us look at what has happened to other committees.  Senator Manning very generously argued that a committee's success depends on the energy of its chairperson.  I know from experience that there is nothing as debilitating as being the chairman of a committee which is starved of resources which is without staff and is being treated as an appendage and sometimes regarded as disloyal to your own side for deciding to uphold the interests of the committee rather than the interests of an individual Minister or Department.  When I was chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on semi-State Bodies I never shirked the responsibility of criticising Ministers, and rightly so because my responsibility was to the committee.</P>
    <P>Let us just remind ourselves what happened to committees in the past.  The funding was pitched at a derisory level.  I said yesterday at a lecture in UCD that the resources allocated to all the committees in the last Dáil and Seanad would not have been sufficient to pay for the tea and doughnuts at the tribunal in Dublin Castle, let alone keep the tribunal functioning for a day or two.  No matter how much energy the Members of this House and Dáil bring to these committees, they will be condemned to sterility unless they <Col N="363" /> are properly funded.  In addition, the issues of privilege and the right to subpoena witnesses will be important if the committees are to be other than public relations exercises.</P>
    <P>Staffing of the committees is an important issue that cannot be avoided.  The staffing of the committees of both Houses is derisory at present.  The staff who serve on the committees are the Clerk and the Clerk Assistants.  They have to work in the House and they have responsibility for other committees.  They cannot properly research the activities of the committees. Senator Lee spoke of the need to call on the intellectual community, the college staffs, the university staffs, people with experience but the problem is there are no mechanisms for doing that. For example, I remember making the suggestion in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies that if the committee lacked the capacity to engage in research it should request post-graduate students in the universities in this city to undertake such research.  It was pointed out to me that not only was it not the tradition, but there would be severe difficulties in having students working in the Houses.  There was always some insuperable problem put forward to overcome the lack of resources and the lack of staff.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning referred to the issue of time.  The political view in Ireland is that Members do nothing in this House and that the Dáil is filled with chancers and double-gangers.  It is an extraordinary view of those who are elected democratically; it is a negative view of politics.  There is a heavy demand on the time of politicians.  Senator Manning will recall that I did some research in 1981 to 1982 on the role of the Deputy, particularly as a constituency representative.  I concluded that Deputies worked an average of 80 hours a week.  The bulk of the work was put into constituency service. As Members know, today the demand for this work is even greater than it was in the early 1980s.  The commission on pay for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas recognised that in its last two <Col N="364" /> reports.  The constituency service role has expanded and grown exponentially.</P>
    <P>The big issue therefore is how is more time to be found to service the committees. I believe a fundamental examination of the relationship between our electoral system and the way we spend our time is required if there is to be proper reform of this House and of the Dáil.  True reform in either House cannot take place unless there is electoral reform.  What is required is an electoral system that will help break the treadmill that arises from competition within parties.</P>
    <P>We must be conscious of the amount of time that the demands of properly servicing an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs will place on Members.  On the last occasion, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies had 12 or 14 different investigations under way, I was very conscious of the extraordinary impositions I was placing on the time of Deputies and Senators, particularly those from a rural base.  If I scheduled a meeting every week it put severe hardship on Members as they could not sit on a committee, to legislate, as they were elected to do, and at the same time, serve on county councils, health boards, etc.  If we do not address this issue there will be no reform and we will establish committees that will become frustrations for those who serve on them.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning also mentioned the paucity of representation from the Seanad on the Oireachtas Joint Committee for Foreign Affairs.  I agree with him.  It would be a pity if Members of this House could not contribute to the committee.  The committee chairperson and the committee will be able to determine that.  I have a particular interest, and it is an interest I share with the Minister, Deputy Kitt, in the human rights issue and I would like to contribute to a debate on this issue.  I am the only Member of either House to have worked in the United Nations Human Rights section and I am the only citizen of this State to have been given a human rights fellowship from the United Nations.  There will be <Col N="365" /> only five Members from this House who can contribute to this committee unless there is some way of structuring different areas of specific expertise into the sub-committees. Perhaps the Minister could address that matter.  I hope that the committee will do so.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issue of human rights, I compliment the Minister, Deputy Kitt, on the work he has done in the Sudan.  I believe the Minister was not overstating the case when he said that Ireland has a unique role to play in monitoring human rights issues.  The human rights area &mdash; not just political rights, the area on which we in the west traditionally focus, but the human economic rights &mdash; requires people who have the experience of being ex-colonies.  We have the experience of being an ex-colony; we were not ex-colonialists.  I think we have a specific role to play in the human rights area.</P>
    <P>If there has been any failure in foreign affairs in Ireland it has been a failure of self-confidence.  We have not had the confidence in the history of this State to stand up for what is right, decent and appropriate in the area of human rights. As an example I refer to a case in which the Minister, Deputy Kitt, and myself received a knuckle rattling.  It concerned the representation of Cambodia at the United Nations.  We as a nation were slavishly following a policy which had been set down in Foggybottom in Washington and the Foreign Office in London. There was no good reason we were taking that particular viewpoint.  As a small nation we should always be on the side of the oppressed.  I am not saying we are models in human rights behaviour, because there is a series of areas where we are very deficient, but what I am saying is that there is a role that we as a nation could and should play.  Furthermore, there is a role that we as a nation, because we lack self-confidence, have been shying away from.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is established it will follow carefully the suggestion made by the Minister and other Members that the monitoring of human rights issues is a specific area in which we <Col N="366" /> could play a major role.  It is not that we, the Government of Ireland, will be playing a role in it but we, the representatives of the people.</P>
    <P>There are few nations that are as committed, on an individual citizen basis, to human rights issues as are the people of Ireland.  The concept of people being oppressed offends the Irish people in a way that it does not offend any other people.  I do not say that in a chauvinistic or xenophobic way rather I say it as a reality.  When we were involved in issues relating to Irish cases in Britain and when I went to monitor elections in Nicaragua with a small group from both Houses, I recall that the Irish people had a genuine interest and concern about these issues. This is an area of foreign affairs in which Ireland has a major rôle.  We have no historic reason for being shy about being to the fore on human rights issues.  We were a colony but we were never colonialists. We have no vested or commercial interest and no commercial attachments to ex-colonies which suggest that we should be anything other than to the fore in this area.  I speak for Members on all sides of this House and the other House in that regard.  There are people in both Houses who would have a very interesting role to play.  I will conclude because I do not believe in over-lengthy contributions and I know Senator Wilson wishes to speak.</P>
    <P>I wish this committee well.  It has been properly and appropriately structured and I ask that it be properly and appropriately staffed and resourced.  I also ask that the committee at an early stage be allowed to open its proceedings so that television cameras and radio can record them because there is an anomaly which prevents that kind of coverage.  There is a farcical arrangement that committee Members have to sit around a table before a meeting starts in order to give television cameras an opportunity to film. All these committees should be as open as both Houses have become since radio and television coverage was extended.</P>
    <P>These committees should cover as many areas as possible, particularly the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign <Col N="367" /> Affairs.  Ireland has much to offer. Senator Maloney said he hoped people from the Falls Road and the Shankill Road would be invited to speak to the committee about issues relating to the North.  I share this hope.  Senator Lee suggested that the prowess which undoubtedly exists in the intellectual community should be drawn on to give an independent input to these committees. This is not because we should mistrust the people in foreign affairs &mdash; I served in the EC section of the Department of Finance for a long time and worked in close co-operation with the Department of Foreign Affairs &mdash; but because a supply of alternative views is the very essence of working committees.  The chairmanship of the committee is important and if the person who is rumoured to get the chairmanship gets it, I wish him well.  I wish whoever is the chairman well as I wish the committee well.</P>
    <P>We are on the threshold of major change in the way both Houses of the Oireachtas work.  I anticipate that the Government will be open and willing to come to these committees, support them and be willing to listen to them.  Above all, I hope the Government will be willing to do the one thing that the committee system has allowed elsewhere and that is to draw on talent from all sides of the House.  There is no monopoly of wisdom in any of the political parties or on any side in these Houses.  There is experience, expertise and wisdom on all sides. Our job as lawmakers, the people who control Government and public policy, would be done far better if we recognised that we are here to combine all the talents of the people who have been elected to both Houses for the benefit of the Irish people.  I wish the committee well and I compliment the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to mention a number of issues the committee might discuss.  The committee has been universally welcomed as a necessary change. From now on instead of the old system of the Department deciding what foreign <Col N="368" /> policy should be, it will be debated within a committee.</P>
      <P>The right of MEPs to attend and participate in the committee is a very important development.  I have always believed that we do not fully utilise and it appears we cannot find a role for the MEP structure within the country.  I advocated that the British system of Privy Council membership should have been extended to Opposition MEPs so that they could be briefed by Government when matters of national importance are being debated in the European Parliament and in the European Commission.  We should have treated all the MEPs, irrespective of political party, as a resource for the country and briefed them accordingly.  This should have been done rather than transferring partisanship to Strasbourg or Brussels where MEPs ought to have a common purpose.  Perhaps in time we could invite MEPs from the other part of the island to participate in the committee. It might involve a quantum leap in attitude but it is worth considering.</P>
      <P>In relation to utilising talents, I have a view the Minister of State and the Tánaiste might take on board at some stage, as Ireland is a small country, it is vital that it utilises whatever talents it has. All the talent that is required in foreign affairs does not reside exclusively in Merrion Square or St. Stephen's Green. People such as Garret FitzGerald, Peter Sutherland and Jack Lynch would have been excellent ambassadors for Ireland after they finished their parliamentary careers.  If part of the purpose of appointing ambassadors is to gain access and establish better relations, who better than people such as these who command international respect and affection in many countries?  The day will come when we will appoint Irish men and women of international standing to represent us abroad and that will be a welcome development.  This does not take from the excellent service given to us by the career diplomats in our foreign service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the role of the committee in its dealings with the UN, it is a fact of life that the UN is becoming increasingly involved in disputes and in some cases <Col N="369" /> civil war disputes such as in Bosnia, the former Yugoslavia and Somalia.  It is becoming evident that this increasing role will necessitate a standing army of peace-keepers. At the moment, the Irish are well represented as part of the UN peace-keeping force.</P>
    <P>As I said in the past, there are only a number of countries that are acceptable as peace-keepers for various reasons. Ireland is one and Sweden is another. There are very few countries whose history allows them to participate in a peace-keeping role.  It has to be put on a permanent footing and Ireland is best placed to make that contribution to the UN. There ought to be a standing army here which is essentially a UN peace-keeping force.  Perhaps 5,000 or 10,000 troops could be trained in the business of peace-keeping and reconciliation and could be on stand-by for the UN to go anywhere. A number of countries could do the same rather than the present position where a request is made, trucks are sprayed from green to white, &ldquo;UN&rdquo; is put on the side of them and off they go.  It should be more formalised and better structured. The suggestion of a permanent force is worth considering.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas I would like to mention but I am conscious that other speakers wish to contribute and the debate is to conclude at 1 p.m. I suppose I will cause great consternation in the Department by suggesting that people other than the old club should be ambassadors but it is worth considering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Daly.  I welcome the Minister and I thank him for welcoming me to the Oireachtas.  I also welcome his statement which covers a wide range of topics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contribution this country makes in the area of foreign affairs is out of proportion to its size, population and resources and it is perceived that way across the world.  That is something we should treasure.  However, I have one criticism of his statement and that is that Northern Ireland was mentioned at the end.  Even then, it was raised only as a <Col N="370" /> detail.  I do not need to remind the House there is a war 60 miles from where we sit and blood is being shed.  While I do not decry the importance of the other issues mentioned, I hope Northern Ireland and what is happening there will be, to put it mildly, further up the Committee's agenda than it is in the Minister's statement.</P>
    <P>In so far as I may speak for them, the people of Northern Ireland doubt the Government's commitment to the North. One day we hear Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution are not set in bronze, the next we hear they are there for as long as they are needed.  This doubt is not healthy.  I hope the committee will devote ample time to Northern Ireland which is the most pressing problem on this island. I welcome the committee.  I wish it well and see nothing but good coming from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the committee and thank the Government for acting so speedily.  Setting up this committee has been talked about for some time.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, it is important to have a committee which will fully discuss, tease out and explain the Irish position on international issues of the day.  Often the public are not fully aware of this.  The committee will provide support for the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It will enlighten the public about the major issues affecting the international community, explain the Government's position and explain what the Government is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been about 20 Ministers for Foreign Affairs, or External Affairs, since the foundation of the State in 1922. Outstanding contributions by former Ministers were recognised not only here but internationally.  For many years, the late Frank Aiken made attempts in the United Nations to halt the spread of nuclear weapons.  The late Seán MacBride was chairman of Amnesty International and was internationally honoured and recognised for his outstanding achievements in many international organisations.  Dr. Hillery <Col N="371" /> completed our negotiations for entry into the European Community.  Deputy Collins, Deputy Lenihan, Deputy Barry and others were not only recognised here as people of outstanding ability and integrity but they were also acknowledged in international organisations, like the United Nations, as having made valuable contributions in this area.</P>
    <P>The present Minister of State highlights the needs of the Third World.  The Government is committed to increase funding to these countries and work is being done there by Government and non-governmental organisations.  This is not fully appreciated by the public.  The Irish Government contributes over £50 million a year towards the international effort for famine and disaster relief.  Voluntary contributions from the Irish people are the highest in the European Community.  The Irish Government, the non-governmental and voluntary agencies are helping to find solutions to the problems in the developing world &mdash; Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania etc.  These efforts are recognised by the United Nations refugee agency and other famine relief organisations.  The new committee will support the Government, the Minister and the Minister of State in their work in this area.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the new committee have the staffing and research personnel to enable it to do its work.  During my period on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, documents arrived on my desk almost daily from the institutions of the Community.  Without proper research and support facilities it was not possible to make a meaningful evaluation of the contents of these documents. The result has been that we are lagging behind when it comes to bringing our legislation into line with European Community Directives.</P>
    <P>I welcome this committee.  The Irish stance on international issues is admired and, in some respects, envied by many. I believe we can continue to give a lead on issues like overseas development aid. The work of the Government will be <Col N="372" /> strengthened and their position will be underpinned by the work of this committee. I hope it will be a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt) Tom Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Daly has reminded us of Ireland's active role in international affairs over the years.  I am proud to participate in this area from which I get tremendous personal fulfilment.  I am aware of the enormous areas of activity involved and they have been reiterated in this useful debate.  I thank all Senators for their contributions.</P>
      <P>Senator Wilson made an important point.  I wish to assure him that Northern Ireland remains the Government's top priority.  This has been spelt out time and time again by the Taoiseach and by the Tánaiste.  I expect this committee to devote much time to discussing all aspects of the Northern Ireland situation.  There is a huge commitment on the part of the Government and all parties in the Dáil and Seanad to a resumption of dialogue and this committee could play a role in improving communications.  I have always recognised the need for more contact between the people of the North and of the South.  Recently I spoke to some young students, Catholics and Protestants, in Ballymena and as a result I am much better informed of their views. Senator Magner referred to the role of MEPs.  There is a provision enabling MEPs from Ireland, including Northern Ireland, to participate fully in this committee. This is an important signal of our commitment to improved contact among all on this island.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn and others referred to the question of peace-keeping and peace-enforcing and Senator Taylor-Quinn was concerned about the confusion between the two.  There is no confusion whatsoever because the implications of the new United Nations mandate in Somalia were clearly explained by the Tánaiste.  This mandate is very specific and detailed so there is absolutely no confusion about the nature of Ireland's involvement there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee's powers and remit are <Col N="373" /> very wide.  I would like to see it examine in detail and make recommendations on UN structures and the question of peace-keeping and peace-making.  No Government can have all the answers.  The attitude of both the Tánaiste and I in promoting this committee is that its role is to facilitate the finding of answers to the many urgent problems that exist.  I assure Senators that no aspect of our relations with the European Community is closed to the new committee.  Ministers will attend meetings of the committee when Estimates and legislation are being discussed.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the Government's policy on the Third World.  We welcome the involvement of the committee in this area.  The Government's Third World policy has two main emphases which I know are shared by my predecessor, Senator Daly.  First, our policy is focused on the poorest of the poor.  Secondly, we have stressed the link between human rights and democracy on the one hand and development on the other.  These policy principles are very important.</P>
    <P>Our thinking on foreign policy will not be developed by the committee alone; academics will also be involved.  I welcome, and view as healthy, links between academics and practitioners.  I attended many seminars both before and after my appointment and having heard the views of several academics, I think they have much to offer.  In preparation for the plan which the Tánaiste and I hope to publish soon, I visited and had discussions with Ministers in other countries.  I discussed in detail with the Belgian Minister for Development the specific linkage he has forged with universities and I will establish an advisory committee which will have a broad membership, including NGOs and academics.  Although it is very difficult to achieve the right balance as regards advice, I will certainly draw on the advice offered by this committee and it may be useful for the committee to develop linkages with universities.</P>
    <P>The point was correctly made that other Departments will be affected by the work of the committee especially in <Col N="374" /> relation to the European Community.  I already referred briefly to attendance of Ministers.  Senator Manning and Senator Taylor-Quinn were critical of the fact that of the new committees established only the committee on foreign affairs has Seanad representation.  I am sure the Senators will understand that I cannot speak with authority on the role of the Seanad.  It is reasonable to point out, however, that the terms of reference of the new legislative committees focus on the proceedings of legislation and on Estimates.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of this committee include the provision that all Senators can attend its meetings and take part in proceedings.  I refer Members to paragraph (15) of the motion establishing the committee which states:</P>
    <P>That in the absence from a particular meeting of the Joint Committee or a sub-committee of a member who is a Member of Seanad Éireann, another Member of Seanad Éireann may, with the authority of the absent Member, take part in the proceedings and vote in his or her stead; and that Members of Seanad Éireann, not being members of the Joint Committee, may attend meetings and take part in the proceedings of the Joint Commitee and of its sub-committees without having a right to vote.</P>
    <P>That is an important provision and Senators should avail of that opportunity because, as I pointed out, not everybody can be a member of the committee.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to security issues in Northern Ireland.  The requirement that such issues be considered in private session has been criticised.  Advances have been made as regards the committee's coverage of Northern Ireland issues.  At the outset it was envisaged that the committee would have no role with regard to political and security issues there but after some discussion it was agreed that these issues could be considered in private session.  Finally, in the light of further consideration, it was agreed that only security issues would be discussed in private and political issues, <Col N="375" /> like all other matters dealt with by the committee, would be discussed in public session.  I suggest that given the sensitivity of the issues involved we have been as fair and forthcoming as possible. The committee now has ample scope to develop a meaningful role on Northern Ireland issues if it chooses to do so.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to emphasise the sensitivity of discussions on security matters which can involve literally matters of life and death.  We have an overriding duty, and I am sure that this is accepted by all Members here, to ensure that nothing in our proceedings or discussions can put at risk the personal safety of any individual or group.  I acknowledge, of course, the thin line between political and security issues in the Northern Ireland context.  Members of the committee will need to show sensitivity and good judgment in deciding the political issues appropriate for public discussions and the security matters which require private session.</P>
    <P>Senator Maloney referred to interest groups and I am very interested in his view because it is important to hear the views of those who live near Northern Ireland.  I agree with the Senator that the establishment of this committee will be welcomed by the many groups with views to express on the Northern situation who have often felt excluded.  In some cases Dáil debates can be quite sterile and stage managed.  Question Time does not meet the needs of certain interest groups and it is important that they be otherwise involved.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan referred to the need for language training.  I will remind Senators that APSO are doing much good work in this area and part of the programme in the development area is to increase the number of volunteers substantially from 400 to 2,000.  I know great emphasis is being placed on language training.</P>
    <P>Professor Lee spoke of the close relationship between the committee and the universities to which I already referred.  I also agree with him that the <Col N="376" /> Institute for European Affairs should be used to the full by the new committee. He rightly points out that there are many issues yet to be resolved, that the question of enlargement will create new areas for discussion and we will have a debate continuing to 1996 when there will be a real opportunity with this committee to shape the future of our institutions and our development in Europe.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee referred to my speech where I said:</P>
    <P>Ideological differences and an excessive emphasis on the doctrine of non-interference in the internal affairs of individual states have, in the past, been major obstacles to the human rights work of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>He agreed with the reference to excessive emphasis and I am pleased to hear that. What we are saying is that the individual whose basic human rights are being abused by a state should be able to look for assistance.  I made this proposal when I spoke recently in St. Patrick's Cathedral.  The Government is pursuing the establishment of a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. This initiative is supported by other countries and we will pursue that vigorously in Vienna in June of this year.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee and others referred to diplomatic activity concerning trade.  I suggest that the committee might also examine whether the country is well served by our current network of official representatives overseas.  The network includes not only our diplomatic and consular missions but also the overseas offices of State agencies.  We start from the principle that a small country like Ireland, operating within strict budgetary parameters, cannot have resident representation in every part of the world. We must be highly selective, focusing our resources in accordance with our best judgment of where our priorities lie.  We must also ensure that the limited resources available for all overseas representation are used to the maximum advantage.  Bringing together in one Ireland house, as it is called, all our official representation in a particular city <Col N="377" /> is an example of this; an Ireland house is being established in New York.  Other Ireland houses have been established in places as diverse as Seoul and Madrid.</P>
    <P>The committee could also consider if there are countries &mdash; I am thinking in particular of eastern Europe &mdash; where the lack of official representation may be damaging our national interests.  I have had personal experience of ambassadors being involved in promoting business. Recently I spoke at the Belgian-Irish Business Association.  They are involved in networking in the local business community and are supported by many State agencies.  I attended two very successful functions which indicate that there is a lot of good work being done.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning spoke about being serious when it comes to this committee. I can assure Senator Manning and others that we will take this committee seriously.  We are willing to listen and to take points on board.  I have always said that we are here to facilitate and that we do not have all the answers.  The Tánaiste and I are of the attitude that we want to listen to this committee and hear Members' views.  I assure the House we will give the committee the necessary back-up services.  Senators will have the opportunity to decide what kind of back-up services they require.  The role of the chairperson is, quite rightly, a critical and key role.</P>
    <P>Other issues were raised but I do not have the time to deal with them.  I thank Senators for their contributions and for giving me the opportunity to come before the Seanad once again.  This is the third time I have been in this House and I have always left this Chamber better informed.  I look forward to working closely with the committee.</P>

      <P>It is the Government's intention to introduce in the Seanad the Bill, which gives effect to the agency restructuring following the ratification of the Culliton report, where it will be debated for three to four weeks subject to the usual constraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The seriousness of the problem facing this country is evident from the figures contained in Appendix 7 of the report <i>Employment Through Enterprise</i>, which was published in response to the Culliton report.  This table gives a breakdown of the job numbers gained and lost in both Irish and foreign firms in the country over the six year period 1987 to 1992, inclusive.  During that period we managed <Col N="379" /> to create an impressive total of 118,500 jobs but unfortunately this was accompanied by total losses of 108,600. So effectively, the net change in the period was only just under 10,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>In a period when unemployment figures have grown to an unprecedented level of 300,000, this net performance was not good enough, especially as foreign owned firms were responsible for whatever net gains that were made.  In fact, Irish owned firms managed to lose 600 jobs in this period.  It was against such a background that the Government established a task force in February 1992 to report on the implementation of the Culliton report.  The Seanad will recall that it was within a period of approximately seven to eight months that the Culliton committee met and delivered its report to the then Government.</P>
    <P>The Culliton review concluded that the performance of indigenous industry had not been adequate and they identified the deficiencies that had to be overcome to address the problem.  As Culliton had considered industrial policy in a broader context than had been customary, the Government was set the task of responding in a more integrated way to ensure that our competitiveness was increased. Culliton advised that this be done by improving the working of labour markets, infrastructural services, ports, taxation and education.</P>
    <P>The task force was chaired by Dr. Patrick Moriarty of the ESB and it reported, over the period May 1992 to January 1993, on the different issues raised in or arising from the Culliton report.  The text of their deliberations together with the response of the Government was published on 3 May 1993 and this report in turn sets out the specific improvements that must be achieved in each policy area.</P>
    <P>Every change and reform brings gains to some interests, but losses to others. Unfortunately the losers can usually identify their losses better than those who might gain can identify their own potential to benefit, but in this instance, it is <Col N="380" /> my firm conviction that the gains &mdash; in terms of increased numbers of people at work &mdash; from doing better and more business will be so pervasive and in the interests of everyone, including the large numbers of people seeking work, that there must be a clear understanding now that these reforms and changes are to be carried through.  For that reason, those who read this document and fear that a change or reform mandate by Government will represent a loss to them should realise that they will benefit indirectly or indeed directly, from the improved performance of the economy.</P>
    <P>Of course, the reforms and improvements covered in the report, though essential, are not the entire public policy for business and enterprise.  For stability, growth and development, the &ldquo;macro&rdquo; policies are important.  Public expenditure, the exchange rate, the market for money, the wage formation process and the underpinnings of competitiveness are vital, as is the economic health and growth of our partner countries.  While this document gives assurance of positive and determined action in upgrading and improving goods and service markets and infrastructural factors, people and businesses need reassurance also in relation to the &ldquo;marco&rdquo; policies and directions I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>This Government is providing the economic policy and the stable environment for growth and improvement at home.  We will contribute to the evolution of co-ordinated EC policies for business investment and expansion in Europe.  Such things are not, however, the point of this document.  This document is about structural and &ldquo;micro&rdquo; policy initiatives at the level of particular markets, and for those who operate in markets, in order to improve our national performance.</P>
    <P>Ireland needs more entrepreneurs: people with initiative and ability to innovate and compete with the best in the international marketplace.  For this reason I attach a particular importance to the Culliton group's and Moriarty Task Force's recommendations on education and training.  With the Minister for <Col N="381" /> Education I will be seeking to add a new enterprise dimension that those two groups correctly identified as lacking in the system at present.  I agree with those groups also that a new enterprise orientation will not detract from the attainment of high academic standards or from the full, rounded, cultural, social and spiritual development of young people.</P>
    <P>This enterprise orientation is of great importance for our long term development. Without it, other policy changes now proposed will be less effective.  We need to take a clear sighted, long term view now on how to achieve a better economic performance.  Education must play a role in bringing into sharper perspective what is required so that people and enterprises will work successfully. Education for enterprise is one of the most far-reaching structural changes we can make.  It must be truly educating; mere learning of facts, current information or even up to the minute computer applications would be inadequate. Education for enterprise is only part, but an important part, of education for a better life in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Training and retraining are also crucial elements of industrial and employment policy.  A transition to standards based on higher skill levels will be introduced. The contribution which a highly qualified labour force can make to increase competitiveness, economic growth and employment prospects is well recognised. However, a high quality and flexible training system is also an instrument for promoting social cohesion.  It is a means by which vulnerable or disadvantaged groups, including those situated in areas of high unemployment, the disabled or the elderly can be provided with an avenue back into productive and sustrainable employment.</P>
    <P>A specific comment is appropriate on the responsibility of businesses for training. If we want to see the dynamic, innovative, competitive, expanding industry which the actions detailed in this report are aimed at promoting, then it is imperative that employees not only equal but surpass the skill levels of trade competitors. Primary responsibility for raising <Col N="382" /> skill levels and improving the technical competence of those at work rests with employers and company management.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report comments with respect to the skills gap between practice in Ireland and best practice in competitor countries, as well as the relatively low levels of training afforded to employees generally, indicate clearly a need both for a change of attitude as well as the development of new approaches in this sphere.  The Government will do its part in this task.  At the end of the day, however, if the deficiencies recognised by the Culliton report are to be put right, a more prominent and pro-active role will have to be undertaken by employers in their own self-interest in relation to training.</P>
    <P>Obviously, however, it is not sufficient to have people on the ground who are motivated and capable if the conditions for doing business are not right.  I believe, for example, that the Government decisions relating to the introduction of more competition into energy markets and for transparency in relation to industrial tariffs can only be good for business.</P>
    <P>Equally, the Government's commitment to accept the recommendations in relation to the movement of goods, people and information through all our networks &mdash; roads, rail, air, telecommunications, post and ports &mdash; will have the necessary effect of reducing transport and communication costs entailed by our peripheral location.  Bodies charged with overseeing these networks will be required to examine their operations with a view to increasing efficiency, introducing competition and cost reduction measures.</P>
    <P>As can be seen from the report the Government is also committed to enabling State owned businesses to operate as such.  We intend to implement the recommendations which will allow State enterprises pursue agreed strategies and business plans without excessive bureaucratic interferences.  These enterprises will, in turn, be required to meet absolute standards for the competitiveness of their prices and services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="383" /> A vigorous competitive environment was recognised by the Culliton report as being essential to the successful development of Irish industry.  Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, my Department is charged with the development of competition in all sectors of enterprise.  The Competition Act, 1991, has created an important vehicle through which competitive conditions can be created.  The emphasis in that Act was on putting mechanisms into the hands of business to enable it address anti-competitive behaviour in the market.  While there has been some use of these provisions by business, more might have been expected.  This is one of the reasons my Department is reviewing the provisions and operation of the Act.</P>
    <P>Legislation will not, of itself, remove all restrictions on competition.  The Culliton report highlighted the need to ensure that &ldquo;economic sectors not exposed to international competition should nevertheless be induced to operate in an efficient, low-cost way&rdquo;.  My Department is examining how, in particular terms and separate from the Competition Act, this can be done.  On the issue of taxation the Government accepts the overall approach of the recommendations in the Culliton report.</P>
    <P>What we want is clearly spelled out. We have undertaken to proceed with the changes needed to achieve the broadcasting of the tax base, the reduction of the incidence of tax on the low paid and those approaching average industrial wage levels, closer co-ordination of the tax and social welfare systems and the simplification of the tax code.</P>
    <P>These are the objectives set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government in response to the Culliton recommendations. These are the objectives, but no one can realistically expect that the detailed provisions of the coming and subsequent budgets can be laid before this House today.  We have set out what we intend to do in the Programme for a Partnership Government and we will follow through on those commitments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> There has been some criticism by the media and elsewhere concerning the delivery of services under the proposed new arrangement for our enterprise support agencies.  The logic behind those arrangements is straightforward.  The present structure of the agencies is not satisfactory as it does not place the necessary emphasis on the development of indigenous Irish managed firms.</P>
    <P>The Government concurs with the Culliton and Moriarty recommendations that all grant giving and advisory supports should be integrated in one agency for the development of indigenous firms.  Hence Forbairt, which will be organised sectorally with a strong regional base and an emphasis on developing areas of recognised weakness, such as marketing and innovation.  On the other hand, the business of attracting overseas investments to Ireland is a different operation.  It involves the selling of a location to companies which already have sufficient strengths in marketing, technology and business know-how.  This will be the function of IDA Ireland.  It will also operate to a wider brief than heretofore by seeking to attract internationally mobile investment to Ireland not only in the industrial sector but in many service sector areas also.</P>
    <P>The function of Forfás will be to play a co-ordinating role and to help ensure greater linkage between the indigenous and international sectors of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>I also accept that the Department of Enterprise and Employment has a special role to play in fostering the climate for enterprise in this country.  I have accepted the recommendations of the Moriarty Task Force and I am currently working on a programme of implementation covering all issues raised.  These include the continued move from grant aid to industry to repayable forms of finance via the agencies, the review of operations in my Department and the achievement of more effective restrictions on State aids for industry in the more developed regions of the European Community.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the Cabinet sub-committee <Col N="385" /> on the implementation of the Culliton report which has been retained for a three year period to April 1996, I will be happy to respond to this House on a six monthly basis on the progress made in achieving the implementations of the changes which have now been mandated by the Government.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to open the Oireachtas debate on the Culliton report in the Seanad and to confirm that it is my intention in three to four weeks, subject to the normal constraints, to move the legislation which will give effect to the agency restructuring.  I have also provided for the publication of the summary of the Culliton report, copies of which are available from my office for those Senators who wish to obtain the summary rather than the full report which costs £10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, to the House.  In the past he made an important contribution to the proceedings of the House.  I am glad to see him here in his role as Minister.</P>
      <P>I have listened to the Minister's speech and there is nothing in it with which I disagree.  I am concerned that certain proposals in the Culliton report are not included in the document, <i>Employment Through Enterprise.</i>  I welcome the Minister's statement that he will be happy to report to the House on a six monthly basis.  This will give us an opportunity to monitor progress and to look at further initiatives for creating a positive and effective climate for enterprise.  I also welcome the Minister's proposal to introduce legislation in the Seanad to give effect to proposals arising from this document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of developing a climate for enterprise and the encouragement of risk taking the Culliton report puts considerable emphasis on the necessity of tax reform.  According to a headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning, a worker earning £8,000 is better off than a worker earning £15,000.  A married man with four children earning £8,000 has £200 <Col N="386" /> more in disposable income than his counterpart who earns £15,000.</P>
    <P>We talk about job creation incentives, rewarding risk taking and the creation of a pro-enterprise culture yet we retain a tax and social welfare system which allows a person earning £8,000 to be financially better off than a person earning £15,000.  This calls into the question the sanity of this debate.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to an aspect of the employment situation and to our attempts to develop an enterprise and business culture.  The Minister represents the Government of this country.  He is answerable to this House and ultimately he is answerable to the people.  However, there is also in this country what has been described by other commentators as a permanent government which is neither affected by elections nor answerable to this House; perhaps to a certain degree it is answerable to the Minister and his colleagues.</P>
    <P>In my view, that permanent government has acquired over the years a far too powerful role in the determination of national affairs.  I am concerned that within that so-called permanent government, groups have come to dominate which are conservative and reactionary and which have little vision as to how this country should develop economically. Hence, we have that extraordinary anomaly highlighted in the morning newspapers in relation to the tax and social welfare system.</P>
    <P>When Culliton spoke of an Irish anti-enterprise ethos he was correct.  There is continuing opposition to the idea of rewarding enterprise and risk taking and hence, the more radical and worthwhile proposals made in the Culliton report have been doomed from the beginning. The 1992 budget and Finance Bill were anti-business and anti-enterprise to an unbelievable degree.  While the Finance Bill and budget of 1993 have made some grudging concessions, these have been restricted by so many conditions and red tape that their real value has been virtually undermined, reflecting the continuing power of the reactionary element <Col N="387" /> of the so-called permanent government of the State.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that it is time for the Government to challenge the power of some of the people to whom I have referred.  I am concerned about the influence which these people continue to exert, diluting and obstructing worthwhile economic progress.</P>
    <P>Some high profile events in recent times, notably the financial crisis and the subsequent devaluation and the quality of advice which was available to the Government over that period, call into question the competence of some of the people tendering this advice.  The additional apparent inability to police and uncover unacceptable practices in State and semi-State sectors confirms my point.  If further confirmation were needed, the undoubted undermining of much of what was worthwhile in the Culliton report reflects the power of the elements to which I referred.</P>
    <P>The motion asks us to approve the document, <i>Employment through Enterprise</i>, and to approve certain changes recommended by the Culliton report which the Government now proposes to implement.  First, the Government does not propose to implement the Culliton report in its entirety, it is implementing selected parts only.  Some Government decisions already taken are in conflict with the thrust of the Culliton report. Recommendations, particularly in relation to tax reform, have been deferred indefinitely.  The Culliton report gave a stark choice to the Government and people of this country &mdash; enterprise or emigration.  According to the report there are two fundamental national factors &mdash; the national debt and the unemployment figure which at the time was 270,000 and is now 300,000.</P>
    <P>The report spoke of an anti-enterprise bias pervading many sectors of Irish life and said it was particularly entrenched within the decision making apparatus of the State, which is illustrated by the fact it has taken 18 months to publish this response to the Culliton report.  There was an inevitable tug of war, if we can <Col N="388" /> believe reports, within the Cabinet about the individual responsibilities of Ministers and Departments.  That went on for four or five months and this response represents the most that the Minister could expect from that exercise.</P>
    <P>Time does not allow me to go through each recommendation of the Culliton report or the report of the Moriarty Task Force to see if it has been implemented. The reality is that the ideology of the Culliton report has been largely ignored.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister success with what is left of the Culliton report and I would like, on a positive note, to remind him of a statement which he made shortly after his appointment.  He said that he and the State, as far as possible, should stop obstructing business and enterprise and allow it to prosper, and I support that attitude.  I believe it represents a welcome change because heretofore the policy of the State was to surround business, particularly small businesses, with red tape and bureaucracy to a suffocating extent.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report recommended reduction, reorganisation and streamlining of State agencies involved in the development and promotion of industry. Despite what the Minister said in his speech this afternoon, the Government has largely gone in the opposite direction because instead of one IDA, as it were, we now have three, and instead of the regional bodies which the report recommended, we have a layer of County Enterprise Partnership Boards.  We have extended layers of bureaucracy which have no positive effect for the encouragement of risk taking in business.  I believe if we are to achieve economic progress and create employment, risk taking must be encouraged.  That is fundamental to progress.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill contains proposals for income tax refunds for people starting up new businesses, but it imposes so many conditions that few will qualify.  The Culliton report is direct in its proposals and Moriarty is clear in his recommendations. Yet, the Government response is neither Culliton nor Moriarty, but a few careful <Col N="389" /> and feeble steps in their general direction.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report repeatedly called for the current anti-enterprise culture to be changed to a pro-enterprise culture if real progress and employment is to be achieved.  That so many of Culliton's recommendations are being ignored shows that anti-business and anti-enterprise culture is still entrenched in the policy making machinery of the State.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to a question that has assumed headlines in the last few days, that is the so-called rebalancing of telephone charges.  I regret the Culliton report has been cynically used by the Government; in this situation what has happened is not what the report proposed. Telecom Éireann has been bailed out of competition on overseas telephone services and the Government has engaged in a subtle tax gathering exercise of substantial proportions.  Some of my colleagues will develop that point further.</P>
    <P>Irish firms doing business overseas will gain from the change.  However, small Irish businesses doing the bulk of their business on the home market, domestic phone users and other vulnerable groups which have been identified will be the victims of this decision.  Apart from the economic aspect, it is an appallingly stupid political decision, but that is for others to rectify.</P>
    <P>There is a demand for positive action in view of the massive current number of unemployed.  I suggest to the Minister that the Government build on this mood, before fatalism sets in.  Tax reform is vital.  A pro-enterprise culture will not develop unless risk-taking is encouraged, there has to be an acceptance that small businesses and the self-employed are entitled to share in whatever rewards are gained through their risk taking.  If part of the State apparatus continues to regard with envy, as it were, the rewards of risk-taking, and continues to strangle with bureaucracy the efforts of those prepared to take risks, then nothing worthwhile will be achieved.</P>
    <P>Again, I welcome the Minister's statement shortly after his appointment that <Col N="390" /> the State should get out of the way of business.  If the taxation proposals recommended in the Culliton report are implemented even in the limited steps envisaged in the Minister's proposals, and if we can get away from the anti-enterprise culture, we will create what the Minister described as an economic climate within which progress can eventually be made.  I believe we have the resources and the goodwill and there is now a mood for action on which we could build.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will succeed in extracting the other positive proposals contained in the Culliton and Moriarty reports and that, over the coming months, he will begin to put these into effect in addition to the proposals contained in the document before us.  I have never spoken in this House simply for the sake of opposing.  The situation we are faced with is far too grave for political arguments.  I genuinely believe much of what is valuable in the Culliton and Moriarty reports is not being put into effect. I strongly encourage the Minister to use what muscle he can to bring forward the remaining proposals contained in the Culliton report and supported by Moriarty.</P>
    <P>The most important proposals are those relating to the provision of tax incentives and the elimination within the State decision making apparatus of the anti-enterprise culture which looks down on risk taking as something to be discouraged. Unfortunately, in recent years that attitude has been sufficiently dominant to create many of the problems we now face.</P>
    <P>I do not find myself in major conflict with the Minister on this matter.  My concerns are simply that only bits and pieces of the Culliton report are being put into effect.  I will conclude by again appealing to the Minister to endeavour to bring into use to the advantage of the entire community the parts of the Culliton report that have been dropped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to the House on his first visit and I wish him <Col N="391" /> well in his new broadly based duties. Senator Howard mentioned that the Minister was a Member of this House in the past; I served with the Minister here some ten years ago.  Our respective positions now are a reflection of the fortunes of politics.  I wish the Minister well; he is charged in functional terms with helping to solve the most important economic, social and political problem facing the country, namely, unemployment.</P>
      <P>One could say that employment is the bottom line for this Government.  The primary aim of the Programme for a Partnership Government is tackling and alleviating the unemployment problem. In that context, I want to strike a somewhat positive note; the initiatives taken in recent weeks, like the Government response to the Culliton report before us and the Finance Bill, are steps in the right direction.  The Finance Bill has received a unique welcome from a wide range of interests groups in particular, the trade unions, the business community and the unemployed.  That should be encouraging for the Government because it needs positive thinking and encouragement, consensus and co-operation.</P>
      <P>I want to focus for a few minutes on education and training which are highlighted in the response to the Culliton report.  I am glad the Minister has highlighted the importance of these subjects in our discussion today.  I can think of no more apt quotation in this regard than from the Culliton report itself:</P>
      <P>Education and training are a most critical element of policy affecting not just industry but overall economic welfare. In an increasingly integrated and competitive world, skills and knowledge constitute one of the few areas where an economy can command a differential competitive advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the same theme, Michael Porter, the distinguished academic and international commentator in his recent widely publicised study on international competitiveness concluded that one of the most important ways in which Governments can help improve international <Col N="392" /> competitiveness is by education and training policies &mdash; and this is an important point &mdash; which are geared to the generation of knowledge and skills relevant to industrial performance.  Here we are in the midst of a technological age different from many earlier eras.</P>
    <P>We have a good education system.  I know that from my academic work in UCD and from the recognition, acknowledgement and encouragement given by academic institutions in other countries towards students who wish to study abroad.  Our system is not without its defects if it is considered from the perspective of international competition. There are shortages and deficiencies in skills and knowledge in the education system.  The top third of our educated young people, particularly those who go on to third level, who gain degrees and enter white collar employment generally do well.  However, economic competitiveness is as likely to be determined by the skill levels of the entire workforce as it is by the top academic achievers.</P>
    <P>This raises the question of broadening the syllabus at second level and introducing technical subjects.  This question was tackled in the early 1960s when Dr. Patrick Hillery, the then Minister for Education, took the initiative to implement the recommendations of the investment in education study.  The idea at that time was to broaden the curriculum to ensure &mdash; and I know this was Dr. Hillery's personal desire &mdash; that technical and academic subjects were granted equal status.  Regrettably that objective has not been achieved.  It has not been achieved in Britain either but it has in continental countries, and that is an important point.  The idea behind investment in education and subsequent studies was to accelerate the development of education.  Arising from that study the regional technical colleges were established, and these have been successful institutions.</P>
    <P>The intention at second level was that a majority of students who were not comfortable or not good at abstract teaching and a range of academic subjects <Col N="393" /> would acquire skills for productive employment.  Regrettably this has not happened in practice.  This is illustrated in a study undertaken for the Culliton report.  The Roche Tansey study found that the majority of pupils in comprehensive, community and vocational schools were taking academic type subjects in the leaving certificate.  However, the same study shows that by examining manpower needs in individual EC countries, there will clearly be a demand and jobs for technicians and for third level technical graduates.</P>
    <P>Some commentators believe that the Culliton report calls for a severe reduction in academic subjects amounting to a threat to these subjects. However, a close reading of the Culliton report does not support this view.  What the report calls for is a certain de-emphasis on academic subjects, not their neglect or exclusion.  If calls for a better balance between academic subjects, which have their valid place, and technical subjects.</P>
    <P>The Government accepts the need for an emphasis on vocational subjects leading in turn to practical and usable skills, especially at second level.  This is also the finding in the report, <i>Employment through Enterprise</i> which emphasises the importance of modern languages. Although matters are improving, there are still far too few pupils taking modern continental languages at second level.</P>
    <P>However, there have been important innovations in the deployment of language skills at university level, including University College Dublin.  For example, and I have first hand knowledge of this, the BComm (International) is a four year programme where students take four years of business subjects.  The third year is at a continental university business school in one of four languages, namely, German, French, Spanish and Italian. There are at present 80 students in that programme and there are already dozens of them in continental universities.  Not alone are these students getting valuable business subject training for three years in UCD but they are also attending business courses in continental universities. Furthermore, they take the relevant language <Col N="394" /> to degree level within the college and also have the invaluable opportunity of 12 months in the host country as part of their studies.</P>
    <P>Another positive initiative in the context of languages is the IBEC European Orientation Programme where placements are provided in industry on continental Europe.</P>
    <P>It is possible, and indeed necessary, to have the liberal arts represented on our curriculum at second level together with appropriate technical subjects, especially for those who are not in the 30 per cent of the top academic elite and who may have strengths that can be developed by the availability of these technical courses. We live in an age of technology.  Michael Porter's international study claims that investment in education has been a key competitive weapon in achieving the necessary standards in the goods and services of Germany, Japan and Korea, countries who devote substantial resources to technical education.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken of the need for more entrepreneurs.  There is still too much of the employee culture in Ireland. We rarely meet people who start up their own businesses.  I am sure Senator Quinn will have much to say about this later. He will be able to talk about his own experience because he is the case that proves the exception.  We should have more emphasis on programmes to encourage enterprise.  We are doing a certain amount at university level by supplementing the courses in the Engineering and Science Faculties with courses from the Faculty of Commerce, but we need to do more.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report identified a shortage of venture capital as a key requirement for indigenous industry where the need is greatest.  This was confirmed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment on which both the Minister and I served.  It is in this context that I welcome the imaginative initiatives and incentives in this year's Finance Bill, especially the new seed capital scheme which is targeted specifically at employees.  Those who may be in safe jobs, or in less than safe jobs, will now <Col N="395" /> be encouraged to start up their own businesses. In addition the scheme will encourage people who have become redundant and who are not employed but who have a range of skills to obtain critical money to start up.  They then can go to their banks who will be more accommodating, because one of the first questions any banker will ask is how much the individual is contributing.  In that context the business expansion scheme is being renewed for a further three years and the life time cap is removed which is another incentive in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The area of research and development was barely touched on in the short life of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment.  Research and development is the life blood of business activity, relevant for existing businesses and for new businesses.  We must invest a lot more in R and D if we are to compete internationally.  There is a specific provision in the Finance Bill whereby R and D projects can quality for BES relief.  In addition, county enterprise partnership boards will be geared to meet local initiatives and local start-ups, in particular where finance and other services such as training will be available.  In the case of the county enterprise partnership boards, £100 million venture capital has been arranged with the banks and other financial institutions on favourable terms together with the back-up expertise of these financial institutions.  I am optimistic about these boards and in particular the valuable capital that could follow the initiatives in the Finance Bill by way of further capital, because capital gearing and capital base are crucial for any enterprise.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to an area the Minister highlighted and this is the skill level in the workforce.  The Minister made particular reference to the importance of employer recognition of the value of training as an investment.  One of the problems, and this was raised at the committee, is that employers focus on cost, which is understandable after the recession of the eighties. It is good business to focus on cost <Col N="396" /> but many employers look upon training as a cost rather than an investment which would add value to what they produce.</P>
    <P>I am glad to pay tribute to Senator Quinn.  In his business investment and training are key components of his human resource policies.  This shows up in the performance of his employees, in their customer interaction and the quality of service.  We found last year, and it is still the case, that the problem is not skill shortages but skill deficiencies.  I am glad to see in the response to the Culliton report that there is a new emphasis on lifting skill levels to the highest international levels as, for instance, in Germany.</P>
    <P>The specific recommendation, with a time limit on it, that a new division of FÁS will be established within a matter of months to focus on training for those at work in addition to those not at work is welcome.  I am also glad &mdash; and I know the Minister had this in mind &mdash; that there is to be a certification process for various courses.  There is a need for a national independent certification board and I am glad that a time limit has been set &mdash; October 1993 &mdash; for its establishment. Ultimately the Culliton report and the Government will be judged on action and implementation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that, in the response to the Culliton report, employment and enterprise are considered and clearly stated to be the business of all Departments and agencies.  We need a new sense of urgency about the structures we are putting in place and the follow-through in all Departments.  Every Department and agency must put job creation and job maintenance at the top of its agenda.  It is in that context that I am very glad the Minister is the chairman of the Cabinet sub-committee to oversee the implementation of the Culliton report at the highest level.</P>
    <P>I am still concerned, as many are, about the level of bureaucracy for small and medium sized industries.  I welcome the charter for small businesses that was initiated recently but there are obstacles to start-ups of small companies.  Regarding indigenous industries, there are many <Col N="397" /> unnecessary hurdles to be crossed which hinder the development of small firms. Bureaucracy stifles initiative and devours time and effort and there is too much time spent on form filling and we need more streamlining as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>We need to urgently review all the State apparatus to see that it is enterprise friendly and responsive to the needs of people who are trying to engage in business and economic activities.  The real risk is that on the one hand we will offer more incentives, like the Finance Bill, and on the other we will frustrate those incentives if we do not smooth the path in that regard.  The scale of the unemployment problem is such that we must act now.  We need a new sense of urgency in the State apparatus and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister is the chairman of the Cabinet sub-committee on the implementation of the Culliton report and that there are dates for the implementation of specific steps which he will be overseeing.  In addition, he will be back in this House within a number of weeks with the restructuring proposals.  I look forward to his six monthly visits to report progress on the implementation of the recommendations in the Culliton report.  I wish him well in that task because it is that follow-up which is the key to our unemployment problem.  I wish the Minister well and he has the support of everybody in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. F. Quinn Mr. F. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I know he was here many years ago.  The crucial question in looking at the Government response to the Culliton report and to the Moriarty Task Force is how fully the recommended strategy is being implemented.  Will the Government implement a little of it, half of it or all of it?  Will it create, as the Minister described, the required change of attitude?  I wish to examine these details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The details of the Culliton report strategy come under four pillars.  The first pillar is to do with lowering costs and removing barriers to industry; the second relates to infrastructure and covers training, education and speeding up and initiating <Col N="398" /> legislation; the third deals with State agencies and the confusion and overlapping that occurs and the fourth and the most important, deals with taxation. If those are the four pillars of the Culliton strategy, how do the Government decisions match them?</P>
    <P>Under the first pillar, lowering the costs and removing the barriers to industry &mdash; the decisions are broadly good. They can be viewed as a real attempt to attack the cost of energy, transport and telecommunications and to remove bottlenecks and barriers in areas such as ports.  These measures will make an important difference when they are fully implemented.</P>
    <P>The specific proposals for rebalancing telecommunications are ill-judged and it is important that we do not blame the Culliton report.  It did not suggest reducing the cost of business telecommunications by raising the costs for domestic users.  The report stressed bringing down Telecom Éireann's cost structure which it considered to be out of line with international standards.  That is where Telecom Éireann should be looking for reductions in costs.  The reduction in the charges for international calls is necessary but the present proposals will not work.  They should be replaced by a gradual introduction of the changes in tariffs and accompanied by a massive and serious attack on Telecom Éireann's costs.  Overall the verdict on the first heading must be positive, and I welcome most of those decisions.</P>
    <P>Regarding the second pillar, the infrastructural issues have a good outlook. Senator Hillery referred to training and said that many employees regard training as a cost rather than an opportunity.  The Culliton report said we need to realign education and training with the needs of industry.  I was pleased to hear the Minister mention the need to promote social cohesion in training by helping those in disadvantaged areas, the disabled and the elderly.  The report proposed the creation of totally separate vocational and academic streams at second level education.  That has not <Col N="399" /> been accepted and I agree with the Government decision.  Instead, it is proposed to give more emphasis to the vocational dimension at a unified leaving certificate level.  That solution responds to the needs of Culliton, worldwide trends in education and the aspirations of parents and students.</P>
    <P>There are many good proposals under that second pillar, infrastructure.  I particularly welcome the proposals to speed up the legislative process.  The inclusion of this element in the Culliton strategy is a reminder to all in these houses that the need for Oireachtas reform is not merely a housekeeping matter.  It has a bearing on how well this country performs in the years ahead.  I hope that we as legislators will be to the fore in implementing our part of the Culliton strategy.  In relation to two of the four pillars I mentioned the Government has done well.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the bad news.  Pillar three is the streamlining of the State agencies supporting Irish owned industry. The Culliton report stated the multiplicity of State agencies meant support for Irish owned companies was diffuse in impact and confusing to the client companies. The Culliton committee believed that the IDA was split between its two roles, the first is the attraction of foreign industry and the second is support for Irish owned industry.  The report said the dual role was preventing the IDA doing either job correctly.  The committee also found it was inefficient and wasteful to have separate overlapping agencies to support Irish owned industry.  Instead of having the IDA, An Bord Tráchtála, EOLAS and FÁS tripping over one another, the committee recommended one agency.  Meanwhile the job of attracting overseas investment would be given to an agency dedicated solely to that purpose.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report suggested one agency to bring together all the support services for Irish owned industry.  That would be better for the State because it would provide one focused agency with a clear and simple mission.  It would be <Col N="400" /> better for the client companies to have one agency to deal with instead of a whole range.  What is proposed now is the reverse of what was suggested by Culliton. Instead of streamlining the system it is proposed to complicate it even further.  The important and essential simple proposal of Culliton has been held up by disputes over responsibilities and red tape.</P>
    <P>By far the most important amalgamation recommended by Culliton was the amalgamation of the Irish operation of the IDA and An Bord Tráchtála.  This is critically important because they are both in the business of helping companies develop.  An Bord Tráchtála is not merely an overseas sales office or a purely promotional agency, it is also a vital development agency.  A most important aspect of developing markets for Irish companies is developing the capabilities and strategies of the companies themselves.  In this function these two agencies overlap and it was correct to bring them together.</P>
    <P>Instead, it is proposed now to drive them further apart.  This has already been partly done.  Until the new Government took office in February both agencies were under the aegis of the old Department of Industry and Commerce.  Following the publication of the Culliton report the Department reorganised its handling of the two functions to ensure that the same people in the Department were looking after both agencies.  That was excellent co-ordination and a good preliminary step before a final merger.</P>
    <P>All of that went by the wayside with the new Government.  In a move that almost beggars belief An Bord Tráchtála was taken from the Department of Industry and Commerce and given to the new Department of Tourism and Trade. These two agencies whose co-operation is all-important now report to two different Ministers.  It was clear from that day the amalgamation envisaged by Culliton would never take place.  This is borne out by the Government decisions we are now discussing.  One of the vital parts of the proposed agency to support Irish owned industry will be dealt with elsewhere. Further, as if the Culliton report had <Col N="401" /> never existed, someone invented the county enterprise partnership boards, another set of support agencies for Irish owned industry.  While I am in favour of locally based effort, it is not a good idea to add an additional layer to an already top heavy bureaucracy, as referred to by Senator Howard.</P>
    <P>The problem with a multiplicity of State support agencies is that everybody concerned, including the agencies, spend much of their time co-ordinating their efforts rather than getting on with the job.  The people supposed to help companies are sitting on committees all the time.  The companies are wasting time and effort going to these two agencies when they should be focusing attention on the marketplace and on customers.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report called for a &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo;. Instead, we have given Irish industry a big shopping centre.  It is worse than that, for at least in a shopping centre everything is convenient.  The new arrangement will be anything but convenient for the companies it is supposed to help.  The report recommended the establishment of Forbairt.  The Government will do that but at the same time will maintain An Bord Tráchtála, the county enterprise partnership boards and will set up Forfas also.  Forfas is a new super agency intended as a holding company for the IDA and Forbairt.  It is nothing more than another unnecessary layer of bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>The Government decisions regarding the third pillar are wrong and fly in the face of the Culliton recommendations. They will make the situation worse, not better.  The most constructive thing to do is to drop them altogether.  If we are not to have the simple structure recommended by the report, we would be better off keeping what we have now.</P>
    <P>In relation to the fourth pillar, I am delighted the Government accepts the overall approach of the Culliton recommendations on taxation.  Those were the words the Minister used a few minutes ago.  Let us be clear about one thing.  The Culliton committee saw taxation as not simply one issue among many but as the central issue.  The personal tax system <Col N="402" /> was described as &ldquo;oppressive and unfair. It tends to stifle enterprise; high marginal tax rates apply to single persons with modest earnings&rdquo;.  The report also said the allocation of savings was misdirected by the taxation structure.  This has been made worse by the introduction of the special savings account at an unnecessary low rate of tax.</P>
    <P>On reading the Culliton report one can be in no doubt that it sees the present tax system as the most important set of barriers to growth and more employment. The Government's response to Culliton dodges, fudges and dilutes the tax issue.  It is not a response to Culliton but is, sadly, an attempt to evade it.  The Government's response has run off the rails, it contains fine talk about accepting the broad intent of the Culliton recommendations but the hard reality is that it intends to do nothing on the lines of the radical restructuring of the tax system recommended by Culliton.</P>
    <P>Tax reform is not a complicated issue. It does not mean lower taxes for all as it has been misrepresented by some of those who seem to rubbish it.  The concept, as Culliton reminded us, is very simple.  It means, on the one hand, broadening the tax base and, on the other, ending the system under which two out of every five taxpayers pay 55 per cent of their incomes in tax and PRSI.</P>
    <P>Broadening the tax base means sweeping away most of the plethora of reliefs and exemptions that have developed over the years.  It means raising revenue from areas which have been exalted into ritual no-go areas by people who wish to avoid making decisions which are even temporarily unpopular.  Broadening the tax base means abolishing or reducing tax relief on mortgage and VHI payments.  It means introducing a broadly based property tax and extending VAT at a low rate to, say, food and books.  That is the painful side.</P>
    <P>The positive side, in return for which I believe people would be willing and prepared to endure the negative effects, is the use to which this extra revenue could be put.  We could use it to lower dramatically the tax burden on the average <Col N="403" /> PAYE taxpayer by widening the standard band to the point where the overwhelming majority of wage and salary earners pay tax at no more than the standard rate.  We should aim for a situation where no more than 5 per cent of taxpayers pay at the higher rate. Everybody else would pay tax and PRSI at a rate no higher than 33 per cent.</P>
    <P>Such a tax strategy would help us create more jobs straightaway.  First, it would be cheaper to employ people in the middle range income, and second, we would have restored to the system a stronger incentive to earn more, an incentive that is now effectively destroyed for many workers.  It cannot be emphasised too often or too strongly that radical tax restructuring can be revenue neutral as far as the State is concerned. We can do it now if we have the political will.  &ldquo;Revenue neutral&rdquo; means it does not cost us anything, it balances out.  Tax reform does not have to wait for improved public finances as it need not result in any loss of income to the State.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the decisions of the Government on both the Culliton and Moriarty reports that this opportunity to sweep away the disincentive in our tax system has been avoided.  I deeply regret that and urge the Government to rethink its attitude even at this late stage.  There is now a national need to look beyond the narrow perspective of the mandarins in Upper Merrion Street and for the first time to consider our taxation system in the context of our employment and industrial development needs.</P>
    <P>Culliton gave us the option to fundamentally change our approach to industrial development.  It is clear from the Government decisions that the option has not been taken.  While applauding the decisions that have been taken and looking forward to their speedy implementation, I can only regret that the heart of the Culliton strategy has been ignored.  I hope this will not be the end of the story and that in the months ahead the Government will realise that the decisions announced last week are insufficient on their own.  I hope they will <Col N="404" /> agree that they are only scratching at the surface of the Culliton strategy and will give us the new start Culliton mapped out for us and which, I suggest, is more necessary now than ever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for discussing the decisions to implement the changes recommended in the Culliton report, which are also in accordance with the Moriarty Task Force report.</P>
      <P>Economic and industrial policy in Ireland has been a victim of paralysis by analysis; many Governments have come and gone without taking much action in the important area of job creation.  I welcome the fact that we have action now, and a promise, with timetables and targets, of further action in response to Culliton and Moriarty.  The timetable and target dates in this response from Government are crucial to this discussion because they provide a yardstick with which to measure progress.  The Government's response does not simply talk about what we may or may not do but specifically identifies when we will do them.  The Minister's assurance today that he will report on progress at six monthly intervals indicates the Government's intention to carry through these targets and timetables and answers Senator Howard's concern that there should be a sense of urgency in this area.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Hillery that support for employment and enterprise is the business not just of the Department represented by the Minister but of all Departments and particularly the Departments whose Ministers are members of the group set up to monitor progress &mdash; the Ministers for Enterprise and Employment, Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Finance and Tourism and Trade.  It is important that these four Ministers continue to meet and monitor the progress of the implementation of the report.  Culliton said that there were no quick fixes in this area and we have to recognise that progress cannot be immediate.  The Culliton report contained 60 recommendations.  The huge problem of unemployment, in many cases passing from one generation to another, has caused many families and communities to feel useless and hopeless and this cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the points made by Senator Howard about a climate for enterprise <Col N="406" /> and the importance of allowing risk taking.  It is important that risks taken are based firmly on a business and marketing plan and exact knowledge of the manner in which the business is to be made a success.  It is not enough simply to take risks without having that strong foundation.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the report is based on a clear understanding of what firms need.  The policy will have to be based on what firms need to be successful.  Many speakers referred to the division of the IDA, between IDA Ireland, which deals with foreign investment, and Forbairt which is to strengthen the home based and home managed industries and the umbrella organisation Forfas, which is to co-ordinate both organisations.  Marketing abroad will also be dealt with by An Bord Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn considers there is too much bureaucracy.  I know he has wide experience in this area but it seems to me that the different areas of responsibility are fairly clearly mapped out.  The Culliton report recommended that basic division between responsibility for foreign investment and responsibility for encouraging Irish enterprise.  The particular weakness to date has been in relation to Irish owned firms as the Minister spelt out clearly in his opening speech with the statistics he gave us.</P>
    <P>Direct State support for business in Ireland is high.  For example, in 1988 we had the second highest level of support in the EC in terms of gross domestic product.  Irish owned firms have had a bad record in terms of increasing their level of employment.  In 1992, for example, employment in grant aided Irish owned industry fell by 1,600 while it rose by 800 in foreign owned companies. The Minister also gave us figures in that regard.</P>
    <P>Another aspect to be taken into account is that the labour force increased by 60,000 since 1990, the same number as in the entire decade of the 1980s. Therefore, the increase has been dramatic since the beginning of the 1990s.  It is crucial that we strengthen our Irish based industrial jobs policy, which is the <Col N="407" /> purpose of Forbairt but the question facing us is how is it to be done?</P>
    <P>The Culliton report referred to an unhealthy dependency mentality but the Government's response has not produced jobs.  I had discussions with someone who advises small industries who told me that, when he discusses with small industries the problems that face them, usually it is not a cash injection that they need &mdash; although sometimes that is part of the problem &mdash; but advice on areas such as marketing, research, training, efficiency and management.  Those areas are pinpointed in the Culliton report and in the Government's response to the report.</P>
    <P>The decision to consider what is referred to as participative forms of finance rather than grants is crucial to the future proper use of Government money, which is limited.  The right response is to use equity and seed capital as the means of financial support rather than throwing money at problems.</P>
    <P>Approximately 80 to 90 per cent of Irish industry consists of enterprises of 50 people or fewer.  It is important that these small and medium sized firms get the support they need.  It is suggested that we have cluster industries, particularly in the food sector.  This will be crucial from the point of view of selling abroad especially where Irish industry is seen to have a competitive edge and where our image as a green producer of food can be positively used to develop markets abroad. The Government has responded positively to the suggestion in the Culliton report that we cluster industries and respond to their group needs, for example, by helping provide training, management efficiency, research and marketing, rather than expecting each industry to cope with those areas on their own.  One of the major problems in the past has been that industries have been too small to take on many of those areas on their own and, as Senator Hillery said, some of the incentives in the Finance Bill target that issue.</P>
    <P>The Moriarty report says that emphasis should be put on areas of recognised <Col N="408" /> weakness and it specifies marketing and innovation, to which the Minister referred in his speech.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Quinn's view that marketing is crucial.  We have a positive image and well trained young people who can sell our products abroad; we have a good reputation abroad as people who can be trusted.  We need to get into the markets and the distribution mechanisms abroad and we need to set up structures that will facilitate small firms who could not possibly sell their products themselves on the various world markets.  It is vital that they can channel into links that are already there.  The only way we can improve our productivity is to extend our markets abroad because the home market is limited.</P>
    <P>I will briefly refer to the education issues which have been covered by other speakers.  I support the decision to integrate rather than separate a vocational stream in the education system.  Mr. Culliton supported the Government decision to do this rather than the original suggestion of having a separate vocational stream. It is important that education produces for the jobs market people who have vocational and other elements of education. I also support the further emphasis on foreign languages.  As regards training, the division between on-the-job training and other areas of training will clarify the role of FÁS.</P>
    <P>I would particularly like to stress the importance of targeting black spot areas where unemployment is high &mdash; up to 80 and 90 per cent in some urban areas.  I know they will be targeted in the national plan in the application for EC Structural Funds.  It is important that we target incentives in those areas where, as I said earlier, successive generations are experiencing a culture of unemployment and we have to break that hold.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the points made earlier regarding the increases in and the restructuring of phone charges.  We all regret that there will be increases in certain areas.  It was proposed in the Culliton report that in order to reduce overseas charges there would have to be increases in domestic charges.  When that was an <Col N="409" /> abstract proposal, it was strongly welcomed by commentators and by other political parties.  Now that it is to become a concrete proposal, it is being criticised. I hope, when it comes to the taxation changes, people who now welcome the abstract idea of changes in taxation will be equally willing to welcome the downside of those changes.  There will have to be a downside since money does not come like manna from Heaven.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we have clear policy identified in this area, that we have targets and timetables and that the Government has indicated its intention to fulfil those targets by coming back to us at regular intervals and by continuing the monitoring committee of the Ministers involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House, Senator Wright, for bringing this motion before the House so promptly.  I also thank the Minister for coming in for the debate.</P>
      <P>The motion notes the publication of <i>Employment Through Enterprise</i>, which outlines the Government's response to the Moriarty Task Force on the implementation of the Culliton report. The report by the task force and the Government's response to it covers 16 chapters.  I wish to deal with some of them this evening.</P>
      <P>In the early 1950s the Whitaker report on economic recovery was produced. Many saw the Culliton report as a blueprint for industrial policy which would lead to the creation of jobs in the 1990s. Both reports were produced against a similar background.  In the 1950s 40,000 people emigrated annually and I understand that since the Culliton report was published, unemployment has risen by 40,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only valid objective of industrial policy is the creation of jobs.  What creates jobs?  Sustainable jobs can only be created by fostering enterprise and by encouraging people to take risks in business.  We must encourage the entrepreneurial spirit.  The Culliton report emphasised the creation of a culture in which enterprise could flourish.  Three <Col N="410" /> conditions were required to create that environment: first, tax reform; second, stiffer competition to make State enterprises more efficient in delivering low cost services to industry thus reducing industry's costs and enhancing competitiveness and third, the development of indigenous industries.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report stated that the basic engine to promote employment was tax reform: &ldquo;In no other single area does the Government have at its disposal the tools to make as far-reaching and effective a reform to support an enterprise economy as in taxation&rdquo;.  The Government shows no sign of implementing the radical reform of the taxation system. Culliton called for a new property tax and cutbacks in mortgage tax relief to pay for a large reduction in tax on income.</P>
    <P>The task force chaired by Mr. Paddy Moriarty appears to have taken a less radical view than Culliton.  The industrial policy review group, chaired by Mr. Culliton, did not include civil servants.  Its view represented the views of those at the coal face: industrialists, trade unionists and business people.  In sharp contrast, a number of public servants were members of the task force chaired by Mr. Moriarty &mdash; including the Secretary of the Department of Finance &mdash; and they ensured that no extreme tax reform appeared in its report.  The report merely offered a few bland paragraphs of support for broadening the tax base and reducing the burden of tax on low paid workers.  There was no mention of property tax or the reduction of mortgage interest relief, so the Government had no problem supporting its recommendations. The Government would have been given the benefit of the doubt prior to the introduction of the 1993 budget. However, the levy of an additional 1 per cent tax on the income of all those earning over £9,000 per annum together with higher VAT on indigenous industry, notably clothing and tourism, substantially undermines the Government's commitment in this area.</P>
    <P>The Government has accepted the Culliton recommendation that State enterprise should be reorganised as limited <Col N="411" /> companies.  Their access to capital from public or private sources would depend on their commercial merit and ability to provide a good return on investment. Changes in An Post, Telecom Éireann and Bord na Móna will improve competition and efficiency.</P>
    <P>The task force considered the concern expressed by Culliton about telecommunication charges to be soundly based.  It was pointed out that telephone charges to EC countries should be brought into line with cost based charges in Europe as the current telephone tariff discriminated against business users.  This appears to be the first recommendation of the task force that has been implemented.  It has met with strong opposition, and rightly so.  There are many small businesses in Ireland that employ four and five people.  Small businesses are crucial to economic growth.  The telephone costs of these small companies are just as important, if not more important, to the future development of this country as the telephone costs of larger companies which deal with international companies.</P>
    <P>The social aspect of telephone charges have not been considered; for example, the impact of the charges on elderly people.  The charges will also affect helplines run by such organisations as the Samaritans, the AA and the Rape Crisis Centre who depend on telephones to deal with their clients.  It appears the Minister has not given any concession on helplines and I would appreciate it if he would do so.</P>
    <P>The task force recommended a three year programme to achieve efficiency, improved productivity and economic stability in Telecom Éireann.  I accept this recommendation.  There was a dereliction of duty by Telecom Éireann when it bought the Ballsbridge site &mdash; in the Minister's constituency &mdash; without planning permission, for £10 million.  If semi-State bodies are to be competitive and profitable then ill judged decisions of that nature must be avoided.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the compulsory 35 per cent oil purchase from Whitegate will <Col N="412" /> end, as recommended by the Culliton report, and that the subsidy paid by the ESB to Bord na Móna, through the use of milled peat, will be indemnified to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I read with interest the task force's comments on port development as I was a member of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  The task force recommends that major commercial ports should be incorporated as limited companies registered under the Companies Act and that they should no longer have a status similar to that of local authorities.  The task force states that the effectiveness, efficiency and economy of the management of each port will be critical to their reform.  The Dublin Port and Docks Board, while I was a member, showed initiative in its attempt to sell some land for which it had no use, for a sum of £2 million. Unfortunately, it could not get sanction from the Department of the Marine to sell that land.  I am glad to see that the ports will no longer have to answer to the Department of the Marine.  As a result, they can make progress.  I am pleased that the Government, in its recommendations, has noted the transformation in labour relations in Dublin port and that the new, more competitive operation will achieve operating efficiency.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a tinge of bureaucratic madness in the reorganisation of State agencies.  The Culliton group proposes that there should be one organisation through which State support should be provided to industry.  This recommendation has been ignored.  It is difficult to understand how Forbairt, the proposed new agency for indigenous industry, will carry out its task as, depending on the location of businesses, such support is also available from the enterprise boards, the Enterprise Trust Shannon Development and FÁS.  The late John Kelly often said that the solution to problems of this nature offered by Irish politicians was to think of an Irish name for a company, put the nameplate on a wall and then the problem was solved.  I fear that the proposed unintelligible reorganisation <Col N="413" /> means that State support agencies will contribute less than their fair share to Irish industry in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Finally, today's motion calls on the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to report every six months on the progress made in implementing the changes mandated by the Government.  In fairness, the Government has chosen to respond in detail to the report and recommendations of the task force rather than attempting to bury them.  The decision to publish the recommendations of the task force will provide a bench mark against which policy actions can be judged.  It will be interesting to hear what progress the Minister will report in six months time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The scale of the unemployment problem is so enormous that any opportunity to discuss it is very welcome. My remarks will be brief.  I welcome the Minister and compliment him on the work he has already carried out in this difficult area.</P>
      <P>I hope that the momentum for industrial development and promotion throughout the regions is not lost between now and the time when the legislation for restructuring is introduced and passed.  We should try to avoid interrivalry between organisations and State agencies which, to some extent, has hampered development for some time. Although several changes have taken place in the organisational structure of industrial promotion agencies in the midwest region over the past number of years, the blame cannot be laid at the door of the agencies.  The blame should be laid at the door of the politicians because there were successive changes of Government, of Ministers and of direction and policy.  As a result, many of the agencies were not always sure from where the political mandate was coming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA was taken out of the midwest region by a Minister and the sole responsibility for industrial development was vested in the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  The regional tourism organisation, Shannonside Tourism, was disbanded and responsibility for <Col N="414" /> tourism development given to SFADCo. The county development teams in the mid-west region were disbanded and their responsibilities were given to SFADCo.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the change at the time because I felt it was important that the regional development organisation should be the central development organisation in the promotion of small and large regional industries and in the areas of county, regional and tourism developments. I believe it would be a retrograde step if we were to move from the regions and set up new structures which would create further confusion in the minds of industrialists, the public and the agencies. We will have an opportunity to discuss this matter fully when the Minister introduces legislation to establish these agencies.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the reorganisation which has taken place in many of the agencies and Departments in the last couple of years has not continued.  The policy documents were not put in place when the final legislation was passed and responsibility was not given, as was promised.  This led to confusion, duplication and a waste of human and financial resources.  Any impact on job creation was also lost.  It is important for the Minister to clearly define where the ultimate responsibility lies when introducing this new legislation.</P>
    <P>A sensible approach would be to set up regional development organisations, similar to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company in each of the six or seven regions which were accurately defined for Structural Fund allocations a few years ago.  They would report to a small national agency which would report directly to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  Bureaucracy and duplication of scarce human and financial resources in this area should be eliminated. This would indicate the success of the effort and would give greater momentum to enterprise development.</P>
    <P>Last night we had a debate on rural development and I referred to the work of the Leader programme and the success it has in County Clare under Fr. Harry <Col N="415" /> Bohan as can be seen from its record in job creation and the development of small enterprises in rural areas.  It would be possible to reduce the unemployment figures in Dublin city if a Leader programme, similar to that in County Clare, could be put in place.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on record our appreciation of the work done by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company in the development of the midwest region.  They have been criticised about enterprises which we felt they did not fully support.  However, in the 20 years I have dealt with the Shannon Free Airport Development Company it has not refused to put a project into operation because of lack of finance.  It rejected projects because it was not satisfied with the product's market opportunities, the company was incapable of meeting the proposed targets or it did not have the proper quality control.  I am talking mainly about small indigenous industry.</P>
    <P>It is now time for change.  It was almost impossible for the development agencies &mdash; the Industrial Development Authority, Shannon Free Airport Development Company or any other agency &mdash; to row against the tide of international recession which swept many industries out of existence over the past five or six years.  There is no question that, in spite of the difficult recessionary times many people managed reasonably successfully to avoid closure and to set up a number of enterprises.  The Minister has given figures which highlight the successes during the recession.  The recession, especially in the United Kingdom, is turning around and now is an opportune time to revamp our industrial effort.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to carefully consider his approach to the promotion agencies and to introduce appropriate legislation.  We should avoid infighting and disruption of the industrial drive in the intervening period before the new arrangements are put in place.  I have confidence in the Minister's ability to put proper structures in place which will meet the challenges of the next three years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> As I said now that the recession is turning around, there will be an opportunity to make steady progress over the next four or five years.  In addition, with the availability of substantial funding and an integrated approach to development, we should be able to reduce the number of people unemployed and restore the people's confidence in this country's ability to organise our affairs efficently and well.  We should avoid duplication of scarce human and financial resources and make the best use of the talented people in industry and in the industrial promotion agencies.  We will then be able to reduce the unemployment figures and give hope to the many thousands of people who are anxiously waiting for jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and the Government's response to the Culliton report.  The taxation changes recommended in the report have not been implemented.  I will welcome them when they are implemented because at present the unfortunate lower paid are heavily taxed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the measures introduced by the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin. Medical card eligibility will now be decided on gross pay rather than on net pay.  Sometimes getting people to take up employment has been difficult because a medical card is worth so much to people on a relatively low income that they are reluctant to lose it.  This was a worthwhile change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main area I would like to address is education.  I am glad the Government changed the emphasis from that in the Culliton report where there were two parallel streams, one stream including vocational and technological education. Although Senator Hillery said he thought there was more integration than separation, I felt the two parallel streams would rapidly become one superior and one inferior &mdash; the academic subjects would be considered superior and the vocational inferior.  It is said that if a student is good with his hands he is not academically inclined.  Very often, to be good with your hands, you must have a <Col N="417" /> good head too.  I find the two go together more often than not.  The contrary is often true as well.  People who are hopeless academically are often hopeless when it comes to working with their hands.  Unfortunately, skills are not shared out evenly.  Some people tend to be good in several directions while others have no obvious talents.</P>
    <P>I would like to have seen more emphasis on good, basic education at primary level.  Reading, writing and arithmetic are extremely important.  I represent the Dublin Institute of Technology.  We often discuss science and technology in this House.  There are science, engineering and computer science faculties in Trinity College but without a good basic knowledge of maths it would be impossible to pursue these subjects.  It is well known that, internationally, the standards in maths have been deteriorating.  Our standards are not as low as those in other countries.  However, I deal with people with third level education who while they know that ten is ten times one, they are not quite so clear that one is ten times 0.1. When I get results over the phone I sometimes say, that what I have been told is impossible.  The impossibility of a situation to these people with a good education is often not evident.  I am glad schoolchildren have left the Public Gallery because more stress should be placed on basic education, particularly in the mathematics area.  It is impossible for people to progress in science and technology without a strong mathematical base.  We should at least try to introduce the concept of science at primary level.</P>
    <P>The teaching of foreign languages, if possible, should be introduced at primary level, and certainly at secondary level. As a nation we have a good attitude to foreign languages.  We do not say, &ldquo;speak English, or else.&rdquo;  We are able to make the psychological jump to mainland Europe; we do not find it strange to learn German, Italian or French.  Senator Hillery spoke about commerce students learning a foreign language, but many engineering graduates are doing that as well.  I believe we should start stressing the use of foreign languages too in Irish <Col N="418" /> speaking schools.  Why do people like Senator O'Toole and Senator Fitzgerald, with their excellent command of the Irish language, not lead the way and learn a foreign language?  I am sure that they would learn it more easily than the rest of us who are not fluent in Irish.  We need to be careful not to dismiss the importance of an academic education, because, as Senator O'Sullivan said, it is extremely important.  The Provost of Trinity College made a plea for the restoration of courses in the classics.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that many schools do not yet provide a choice of subjects.  Many girls' schools do not teach honours maths, physics, or chemistry. The only science subject taught is biology.  If we are going to stress the importance of science and technology, we should ensure that 50 per cent of those who could be scientists or technologists receive a basic scientific education.  It is wrong to have home economics for one group only but not physics, chemistry, honours maths, applied maths or mechanical drawing.  Technical subjects are not on offer in a large number of schools; this is not a sensible approach.</P>
    <P>At third level not enough young people are getting into the science and engineering streams.  This may be because they look at future employment prospects and see that they are more likely to rise in a firm if they have a marketing degree than an engineering degree.  Not many company directors have a scientific, technical or engineering qualification.  This is an important point because it means not many people in the higher echelons of those firms have any technical expertise.</P>
    <P>Our standards of education are extraordinarily good when compared internationally. I never like to say that the best people leave the country, because we are still here.  However, we have one serious problem: the good people in technology and engineering, the movers and shakers always look ahead to their career prospects.  Are we encouraging them to take up employment in this country?  I address this question to Irish employers.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stressed in-service training but, as far as I can see, no money <Col N="419" /> is invested in this area.  People criticise FÁS.  There are many people whose ambition seems to be to get on a FÁS course.  This is not worthwhile if the course does not lead to a job.  It is a terrible indictment if what the <i>Employ ment Through Enterprise</i> report says on page 41 is correct &mdash; that FÁS should be divided &mdash; one section providing prework and apprenticeships education and training and the other concentrating on training for those at work.  All our apprenticeship schemes, on which we never put enough emphasis, should have certification to a high international standard and I welcome the remarks on that matter in the Government report.  There is little emphasis on management training, and the teaching of foreign languages is vital in this area.  If we are to sell our products abroad we must be able to speak to potential purchasers in their own languages.</P>
    <P>Another area of the Culliton report which is not addressed in the <i>Employment Through Enterprise</i> report, and of which I am critical is research and development.  During the debate in this House on Digital, I spoke of the importance of maintaining research and development in Galway in co-operation with the regional technical college and the university, because a good flexible research and development programme can often help other firms.  It is essential to have links with the universities.  The Culliton report seems to imply that research should be industry led.  This is a narrow concept but it could become company led if we were not careful, because, in that case, our research and development would not be versatile.  Culliton was critical of basic research and said that not enough application research for various industries was being undertaken. Programmes in advanced technology must not be geared to just one industry because advances in science and technology are rapid and we could be isolated if we remained in one specific area.</P>
    <P>There is an even worse situation on page 56 of the Culliton report which <Col N="420" /> states: &ldquo;As a small nation, Ireland cannot expect to develop world class research in the development and application of many modern technologies.&rdquo;  Why not?  That is a very narrow approach.  It is a deplorable comment.  Who wants to be in the second or third stream?  This matter has not been addressed in the Government report and I hope that defeatist attitude will not be taken on board.</P>
    <P>Irish science and technology graduates are first class and we want to keep them here.  I have just come back from America where I met people in excellent jobs.  I have conducted research myself for the pharmaceutical industry in tandem with people in America.  They constantly say that the experience of science personnel here enables high standard research to be conducted more cheaply.  I strongly object to any lowering of our sights in research and development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I ask the Minister to have St. Helen's House, Booterstown, preserved for the benefit of the State.  This house has a distinguished history.  It was formerly occupied by members of the aristocracy and other distinguished people. It is one of the finest Georgian houses in the borough and probably one of the finest in the country.  In the past far too many of these houses have been lost along with the historical perspective we can gain from them.  These days we lose much of our environment to progress. We should preserve our heritage.  We <Col N="421" /> have succeeded in restoring certain houses including Newbridge House in Donabate, Malahide Castle, Ardgillan Castle, Strokestown House, County Roscommon and Russborough House.</P>
      <P>It is important that we ensure that the house is preserved, and it is a list A building at present under the 1991 Dún Laoghaire Development Plan.  It is therefore an objective of the corporation as a planning authority to preserve both the structure and much of its interior, which is also listed.  It is good to have this as a stated objective and it is important that the objective be achieved.</P>
      <P>Large sums of money are raised by the national lottery, and a fraction of this money would go a long way towards preserving this building.  The State might then be able to purchase it and lease it to Dún Laoghaire Corporation, with a view to opening it as a local museum.  I ask the Minister to approach the present owners in order to find out what can be done about its preservation.  I am not asking the Minister to spend money needlessly. In recent times there seems to be a lack of a coherent policy with regard to the way in which some of our lottery funds are being spent.  Some small fraction should be targeted towards the development and preservation of our cultural heritage.</P>
      <P>St. Helen's House is a fine building.  I suggest the Minister should if at all possible visit it and see it at firsthand.  St. Helen's Preservation Society has suggested that an area of the house could be utilised as the first Irish military museum. Ireland has no such museum to commemorate the valour of the Irish who fought in foreign lands.  The history of these Irish soldiers is well researched yet it remains outside the reach of the public as there is no suitable location for its exhibition.  This type of museum would attract many thousands of visitors throughout the year and St. Helen's would be an excellent location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Gough family who lived in St. Helen's for many years have a distinguished history.  If the Minister visits he will be very impressed by the splendid garden which could be restored and <Col N="422" /> would be an additional attraction.  Restorations of this kind cost money but the cost would not be excessive.  I thank the Minister for coming here and I hope he will repond positively to what I have said. I understand the Minister cannot give me a commitment this afternoon.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister, Deputy Aylward, will have good news for you.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>First I apologise for the unavoidable absence of the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey.  I thank Senator Cosgrave for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>St. Helen's is an architecturally significant mid-18th century house set in landscaped grounds in the southern suburbs of Booterstown and is in private ownership.  It is representative of a number of such properties in the city suburbs and is listed for preservation in the 1991 Dún Laoghaire Development Plan.  The owners applied for planning permission to convert the property for use as offices.  Permission was refused by Dún Laoghaire Corporation and was later refused on appeal by An Bord Pleanála.  No further application has been made and the owners' intentions are not known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, given limited State resources, the future of such privately owned heritage properties lies with appropriate use being found for the buildings which are compatible with conservation objectives.  The State however contributes to the protection of such buildings not only by such measures as listing under the planning Acts but also by encouraging a conservation approach by providing generous tax relief incentives. For example section 19 of the Finance Act, 1982 provides for relief from tax in respect of the cost of the maintenance and restoration of buildings which are of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest and to which reasonable access is afforded to the public.  I am glad to say <Col N="423" /> that this year's recently published Finance Bill proposes to extend such reliefs to significant gardens also.</P>
    <P>In exceptional circumstances the State has intervened directly in acquiring unique properties in order to preserve them as prime examples of our architectural heritage.  The acquisition of Castletown House is a recent example. In the main, however, properties such as St. Helen's are best protected by remaining in private hands and put to appropriate modern use under the control of the Planning Acts and with the encouragement of the financial incentives I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I am not in a position to give a commitment to the Senator this evening.  I will ask my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, to take into account the points made by the Senator, to visit the property in the near future and do whatever is possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the Minister for having to bring him to the House on this issue.  I would not &mdash; nor would my colleague, Senator Ross &mdash; have raised the issue in this way was it not for the fact that there is something approaching a crisis in second level education in a part of north Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That second level crisis in the area I represent &mdash; Greystones, Kilcoole, Delgany and Newtownmountkennedy &mdash; has been known to the local community and to the school authorities for some considerable time.  At present, there are seven major primary schools in that area which with the exception of the two Church of Ireland schools, are serviced for second level purposes by St. David's school in Greystones.  That school has <Col N="424" /> been operating beyond its capacity for a considerable number of years.  Earlier this year, the school management was forced to inform the parents of pupils attending the schools at Kilcoole, Newcastle, Newtownmountkennedy and certain pupils in Greystones, that their children could not be accommodated in St. David's in the coming school year.</P>
    <P>Last October, the Minister of State, Deputy S. Brennan indicated to me in correspondence that he would consider the possibility of temporary accommodation at St. David's.  This option could not be taken up by St. David's because there is no space as the school is on a severely limited site.  At present there are dozens of parents in Kilcoole, Newcastle and Greystones who do not know where their children will be attending second level school this autumn.  The irony is that while the students cannot be accommodated in St. David's or in schools in Bray for which the parents have expressed a preference, there are second level places available in Wicklow town, particularly in the De Le Salle and Dominican Convent schools for which the parents indicated a strong preference.</P>
    <P>The problem is that while there are places in Wicklow needed by children in the Kilcoole, Newcastle and Newtownmountkennedy areas, there is no school transport to accommodate them. Under the existing school transport arrangements, the children are ineligible for transport to these schools from their home areas.  If the students in question do get places in Wicklow, the nearest collection point for them is Newcastle village, almost three miles from the nearest of about 25 children's houses.  It is inconvenient for many of the parents to get to that collection point.  There is a scheduled bus service into Newcastle village but, unfortunately, it will not connect with the school transport.  The reality is that we have excellent school places in north-east Wicklow and we have students who want to avail of those places but they cannot because of the inflexible school transport system.</P>
    <P>I accept that bussing the children to Wicklow is not the best solution.  The <Col N="425" /> best solution is to provide a second level school in the Kilcoole/Kilquade area, the figures attest eloquently to this need.  For example, in the five primary schools in the St. David's catchment area, 367 students will leave in 1993, 341 in 1994 and approximately 350 in each of the following two years.  St. David's could not accommodate half of those students. There is a mounting crisis there.</P>
    <P>I know the Department is trying to pressurise the parents into availing of some other schools in the Bray area for which they have not indicated a strong preference.  They have been discussing the possibility of their children attending the schools in Wicklow I mentioned.  The schools in question are excellent and would be willing, as far as I am aware, to accept these children.  I suggest that with some flexibility of the school transport arrangements this move could be accommodated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Roche for sharing his time.  I endorse fully what he has said.  It is another example of the fact that the infrastructure in north Wicklow is not adequate to meet the needs of the population.  We have seen this in the roads, footpaths, sewerage and transport services in Bray and Greystones and now, unfortunately, it is becoming increasingly evident in the schools.  The solution, as Senator Roche said, is not to improve the transport facilities, which is a temporary solution, but for the Minister to either provide better facilities in the existing schools or build more schools in north Wicklow.</P>
      <P>It is a great loss to Wicklow that we do not have a Minister from the area.  When Deputy Kavanagh and former Deputy Hussey were Ministers we had a large and more prolific school building programme. I suspect that this problem would not have arisen if we had a Minister, particularly a Minister for Education, from Wicklow addressing this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The immediate problem which has to be solved is the fact that people cannot get their children into schools of their preference.  The absurdity of this situation <Col N="426" /> is that there are places available in Wicklow &mdash; which is still a long way from Delgany, Kilcoole and Greystones &mdash; but the transport is not available.  I endorse what Senator Roche said and ask the Minister of State to make immediate arrangements to permit children to use the school bus facilties to travel to Wicklow town.</P>

      <P>First, I thank Senator Roche and Senator Ross for their contributions to this debate and to say I admire the level of co-operation which exists in the Seanad.  In reference to Senator Ross's point about not having a Minister from the Wicklow area, perhaps after the next election both Senators will be able to rectify that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>One of my areas of responsibility is to ensure the safe delivery of about 169,000 primary and post-primary pupils to schools throughout the country.  I also have the responsibility of ensuring that the State gets the best possible value for the money it expends on the provision of this service.  In the current year, £38 million approximately will be spent on the provision of this service.  This figure includes about £4 million which Bus Éireann receives in charges from those pupils who are liable for such charges.</P>
      <P>The post-primary transport scheme is organised in the first instance by the transport liaison officer &mdash; who is the chief executive officer of the vocational education committee of the county &mdash; in co-operation with the school authorities and Bus Éireann.  My Department is not involved with the day-to-day running of the scheme.  This is the responsibility of the transport liaison officers, in conjunction with Bus Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also explain that, for the purpose of the post-primary education scheme, the country has been divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary education centre. <Col N="427" /> Recognised post-primary pupils who live at least three miles from the education centre of the catchment area in which they reside are eligible, under the terms of the scheme, for transport to that centre.</P>
    <P>Pupils who are eligible for transport to the appropriate schools in their catchment area, but who wish to attend a school outside it, may be allowed transport only from the catchment boundary of the school attended.  Catchment boundary transport may be allowed, provided that there is room, after all eligible children have been accommodated and that no extra cost is incurred, either by way of an additional, or larger, bus or an extension of the route.</P>
    <P>The pupils in question here, who wish to start post-primary school in Wicklow town schools from September 1993, live in the Bray/Greystones school area.  They may then be allowed catchment boundary transport to Wicklow town, but subject to the conditions which I have already specified.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the increased demand for post-primary places in the areas of east Wicklow referred to by the Senators. My Department is currently examining the longer-term post-primary needs of these areas in this context, and in the light of a recent application by County Wicklow Vocational Education Committee for a new second level school in Kilcoole.</P>
    <P>It has been claimed by some parents that they applied to schools in the Bray/Greystones catchment area for <Col N="428" /> admission for their children and were refused due to lack of accommodation. However, based on up to date information, made available to my Department earlier this week, such would not appear to be the case.</P>
    <P>My Department has been advised that there are places available in at least two schools in the Bray/Greystones catchment area.  These are: St. Killian's community school, Ballywaltrim, Bray, and St. Thomas' community college, Bray.</P>
    <P>Of the 172 pupils due to start in St. Killian's community school in September next, four are from Greystones, five from Kilcoole and two from Delgany.  St. Killian's still has places available and has turned no applicants away.  St. Thomas' community college received 137 applications for places next September.  Of these, 117 pursued their application.  The 20 who did not all came from the Kilcoole area.  One of those 20 has since reapplied and has been accepted.</P>
    <P>The transport liaison officer for County Wicklow is currently examining applications for transport for the coming school year.  Until this examination is completed, towards the end of this month, he will not be in a position to say how many places will be available for pupils seeking catchment boundary transport.</P>
    <P>The Senators can rest assured that as soon as this information is available to the Department, it will notify them.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 19 May 1993.</P>
