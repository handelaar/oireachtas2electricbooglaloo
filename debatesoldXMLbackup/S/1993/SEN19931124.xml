      <P>I have notice from Senator Doyle that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to urgently provide funding for the building of the multi-denominational school at Ranelagh, Dublin 6.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to increase the prize fund limit for charitable lotteries from £10,000 to £250,000.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator McDonagh of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide funds through the Regional Co-ordinating Committee, with flexibility to allow the John Paul Centre in Galway, and other such centres in Galway city and county, to develop urgently needed additional services.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Sherlock of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide additional funding <Col N="714" /> and resources for voluntary groups addressing the serious problem of adult literacy.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Belton of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to refurbish Longford courthouse in accordance with the demand from members of Longford County Council and the general public.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to grant free travel to severely physically handicapped children (details supplied) attending St. Gabriel's Centre and school in Limerick city.</P>
    <P>I regard all the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for the discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Doyle's and Henry's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>I am sure the House will join with me in wishing the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, a quick recovery.</P>
      <P>I have asked each Minister to give me an outline of what they intend to bring before the House between now and Christmas.  I have a certain amount of information at the moment, but I will have all of it in another day or two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Item 1, the Matrimonial Home <Col N="715" /> Bill, 1993.  I understand that the motion will be taken without debate and we will then deal with section 7.  Item 2, the Irish Aviation Authority Bill, 1993, will follow; Item 33 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. tonight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, may I join with the Leader of the House in sending the good wishes of my group to the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, for a quick and full recovery?  May I congratulate the British customs authorities, in co-operation with the Polish authorities, on the enormous seizure of arms made this morning? These arms, one of the biggest consignments in history, were destined for Northern Ireland.  This seizure by British customs officials has saved many lives and it has saved Northern Ireland from potential destruction.  At a time of bad news in the North this is good news and we should congratulate those responsible.</P>
      <P>On the question of legislation, the Leader of the House said he is seeking further consultations.  Will he guarantee that it will not be Christmas Eve before he finally tells us the programme for this session, because it is shaping up that way at the moment?</P>
      <P>Could we have a debate on the confused status of the interpretative centres following the Government decision this week?  The public is confused, particularly about the time element and the amount of taxpayers' money which will be spent before this issue is resolved. Could the Leader confirm that this is the first time in history a senior member of the Cabinet has been overruled by a Junior Minister?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter could be covered in a video entitled, &ldquo;Honey, I Shrunk the Interpretative Centres&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Leader of the House on his pre-emptive strike about the idea <Col N="716" /> of consulting with the Ministers.  We have asked for information about the legislation which must be dealt with between now and Christmas, but it is not available. I think what the Leader is saying indirectly is that he is failing to get co-operation from Ministers.  This is unacceptable. We have sought this information in good faith and it is as necessary to Members on the other side of the House as it is to us.  It is not an Independent or an Opposition issue.  Perhaps it creates difficulties for members of the Government to obtain this information but I insist that we are told about the legislation.  It is not good enough that Ministers can decide if they will co-operate with the House.  I ask the Leader to show determination on this issue.</P>
    <P>I support the good wishes of Members to the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy O'Sullivan, who was recently hospitalised.  On his last visit here I said that, although I had many reservations about what he had done, the fact that Mr. Matt Murphy was part of his operation impressed me.  In the meantime, Mr. Matt Murphy has resigned from the marine enterprise at Sherkin Island and this has created problems for me.  I must remind the House about the commitment given by the Leader that we would have a further comprehensive debate on marine matters between now and Christmas.</P>
    <P>In relation to a debate on Northern Ireland, during the past week I had four telephone calls from people in the North who are concerned about the impact of the troubles on young children who may be left orphaned, etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Any small step, such as the arms seizure today, which helps to reduce the loss of life must be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every sympathy for Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan who has been a friend and colleague for the past 30 years.  I am sure the expressions of <Col N="717" /> goodwill by Senator Manning and others will be welcomed.  He is courageous to publicise the fact that he is suffering from cancer and this will be of help to present and future cancer victims. I applaud his bravery and I am sure his family will appreciate what has been said this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the good wishes to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan.  I have had dealings with him in the past few months and he has been an effective and honourable Minister.  He has the good wishes of everyone in the House.</P>
      <P>I thank the Polish and British security agencies for the arms seizure.  As has been said, it will save lives in Northern Ireland and, perhaps, in the Republic.  It underlines two points; first, that some people are deaf to the encouragement being given to the cause for peace; and second, how urgent it is for the constitutional politicians to maintain the momentum in trying to find a solution.</P>
      <P>In respect of the legislative programme and acknowledging the fact that the Leader has tried to deflect criticism, I ask him when it is intended to take Item 5, the Road Traffic Bill, 1993, and if he has any information on that matter?  Perhaps he could clarify another matter?  I understood that the arrangements for Private Members' Business were being modified and that there would be extra time available. Will that be the case this evening? I am not clear about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding at a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges was that we would continue the current arrangements until Christmas and subsequently amend them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. In relation to another matter, can we assume that the farmers who are waiting for their payments from the EC will soon be paid?  Perhaps it is a case that when they are paid we will know with certainty that there is about to be a general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the good wishes to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan and his family.  I hope they will all come through this successfully.  I also join the other Members in congratulating the British and Polish customs services for the seizure of arms.  It highlights what has been seen as an anomaly in the coverage of these incidents in that the arms in question were going to Loyalist paramilitaries.  It shows that the tertorists are not only on one side of the divide in the six north-eastern counties.</P>
      <P>Following on the recent find of cannabis resin off the west Cork coast, would it be possible to have a discussion with the Minister for Justice and the Minister for the Marine to find out what new plans will be implemented to cover drug importation into this country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I wish to raise only came to my notice at 1.10 p.m. today.  It relates to the deputation that went to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry this morning.  I understand that the Minister issued an instruction that the door should be locked against the IFA president, Mr. Alan Gillis.  I protest against this type of performance. The Minister did a shameful act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with the Order of Business.  A question to the Leader please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister to attend the House and give us an explanation why such an act was allowed to take place.  If not, could the Leader allow time tomorrow to debate this serious issue &mdash; apart from the £170 million owed to farmers.  Locking the door against any section of the community is a scandalous act and can only be described as such.</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated with the other Members in sending best <Col N="719" /> wishes to the family of Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan.  I wish him well.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to request the Minister for Education to initiate an investigation into the behaviour of the administration of Letterkenny regional technical college, especially the behaviour of the chairman of the board of governors, Councillor Bernard McGlinchey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business.  It is appropriate to raise it on the Adjournment or some other way, and I would prefer if the Senator would deal with it that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as I feel it is a serious situation in view of the fact that students have been harangued and tormented there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I also have been approached by some of the students about that matter.  If an Adjournment debate is granted, I will be very happy to take two minutes to support the Senator.</P>
      <P>I also join in the messages of goodwill to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan.  He is very courageous to disclose this personal information.  It can only do good because anything which demythologises a disease like cancer has to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I ask for a debate before Christmas on unemployment, particularly with regard to the social welfare implications so that we can ventilate our views about the comments of Mr. Maurice Doyle.  I would welcome such an opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the arms find, it is extremely significant that this happened <Col N="720" /> at this time because I have been concerned that, coming up to Christmas there might be a temptation for some of the so-called Protestant paramilitaries to bomb some of the busy shopping streets in Dublin.  I was particularly glad to notice that this major arms find, which included several tonnes of high explosives and a large quantity of guns, was welcomed by all sections of the Unionist community.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the interpretative centres, I am glad this matter was raised.  I ask the Leader of the House if we may debate on this issue in light of the fact that archive material is left lying around and we do not have museums where there is real material. Instead we are building these Disneylands because money is available from Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Members who want a debate on the negotiations and consultations which have taken place on the interpretative centres.  Given what Senator O'Toole called the new film, I hope my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, will not be known as the &ldquo;Shrink&rdquo;.  I am sure there are other names he could be called given his tours around the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the programme &ldquo;Tuesday File&rdquo; which was shown last night.  It reported on toxic dumps and the problems people have in Counties Donegal, Meath and Cork.  I ask the Leader of the House if time can <Col N="721" /> be made available for the Minister for the Environment to come to the House to state Government policy on these matters. It was evident from this programme that many, if not all, the local authorities involved have different ways of dealing with these problems.  They are not adopting a coherent approach to the way they look after the safety of those living in the immediate areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>I, too, send good wishes to the Minister of State, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan.  He is a kind and courteous Minister and I have great admiration for him.</P>
      <P>I too would like a debate on the proposed interpretative centres.  I have confidence in my colleague, the Minister responsible for this area; he is doing an excellent job.</P>
      <P>When will Item 22 be debated?  This calls on the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to set up a music council to cater for the needs of the live music industry in order to save existing jobs and to create further employment in this great growth industry.</P>

      <P>I would like to be associated with the best wishes being sent the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan He was courageous to make this announcement.  He promised to visit County Mayo and I look forward to meeting him there shortly when the roads have improved.  I concur with Senator Dardis's call that cheques be paid to farmers.  It is ridiculous that there is a delay in this regard.  Last year farmers were paid promptly because of the general election.</P>

      <P>I was about to say that, yes.  The Adjournment debate will take place at the conclusion of business.  With regard to legislation, it is only fair to put the following on the record: we will have further statements on Northern Ireland tomorrow, as all sides wanted; we will provide the extra time sought for the GATT debate tomorrow; we will have the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill and the Adoptive Leave Bill, both of which are being initiated in this House; we will take the Second Stage of the European Parliament Election Bill and the Road Traffic Bill before Christmas; the Local Government (Dublin) Bill is to be concluded before Christmas; we will also have a Bill relating to the new shareholding in Aer Lingus, the Merchant Shipping, (Salvage and Wrecks) Bill, and other legislation which is on the way.  The House will be dealing with seven or eight Bills so there is no shortage of legislation and no shortage of notice as to what is happening.  I will do my best to ensure that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="724" /> SECTION 7.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 9 (a):</P>
    <P>In page 10, subsection (2) (c), line 43, after &ldquo;acted&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and, in relation to persons contemplating marriage, &lsquo;spouse&rsquo; and &lsquo;other spouse&rsquo; include whichever of those persons is appropriate in the context&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Seanad for agreeing to accept this additional amendment on Committee Stage.  The Dáil has asked the House to consider an amendment to section 7 (2) (c) of the Matrimonial Home Bill which proposes that a person contemplating marriage who wishes to opt out of joint ownership of the intended matrimonial home, must obtain independent legal advice before doing so.  As the Bill stands, this requirement applies only to spouses who wish to opt out.  However, it is equally desirable that a similar requirement should apply to those intending to get married.  Indeed, it is precisely at this moment in their lives that many individuals may be especially vulnerable to pressures which might be exerted upon them to relinquish any ownership claim to what should be their future matrimonial home.  I would, therefore, ask Senators to approve the amendment in the terms which have been proposed.  It is designed to further safeguard the substantial rights which are being conferred by the Bill and I trust that the House will find it acceptable on this basis.</P>

      <P>We, in Fine Gael, do not have any problem with this amendment, in fact we welcome it.  However, I would like to say a few things about it.  Originally when this was highlighted in the Dáil, Deputy Shatter moved an amendment which would cover this area.  He used the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; in his amendment.  If that had been accepted at the time, this problem would not have arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> It is wrong to force somebody to accept joint ownership of a house if they do not want it.  Sometimes there are good reasons they should not accept it, for example, if the house was heavily mortgaged. I have reservations about people before marriage waiving their rights to joint ownership of the family home. Women are often very vulnerable before marriage when discussions about marriage are taking place, especially when it comes to property.  Sometimes where marriage is involved, sanity does not prevail and people can be very emotional.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  People can be very vulnerable and can be persuaded to abdicate their right under this section.  If there is a discussion about property rights and somebody waves an engagement ring in one hand and a matrimonial waiver form in the other, there might be a great deal of pressure on the woman to sign because of the emotion involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept a person must have the right to opt out if they wish and must have full protection and the Minister is providing for protection by making advice available.  It is very important, especially prior to marriage, that the person waiving their right to joint ownership of the matrimonial home fully understands the implications of this.  The difficulty with a subsequent court case is that on most occasions courts do not accept ignorance of the rules and regulations of the law as a basis for changing legal agreements.  While one has reservations about any opting out of joint ownership of the matrimonial home, prior to or after marriage, one would be more concerned about this prior to marriage because of the emotional circumstances surrounding marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On balance, we cannot force somebody to do something but it is important <Col N="726" /> that they get advice from an independent lawyer on the implications of what they are doing.  If this amendment had not been tabled the Bill would have been defective.  We fully agree with it but if the amendment moved by Deputy Shatter on Committee Stage in the Dáil had been accepted, this problem would not have arisen.</P>

      <P>The amendment is the best way to deal with this.  As Catherine McGuinness, SC, said, if one's fiance says opt out one should have a good look at him. If there is an engagement ring in one hand and a waiver in the other a woman would be well advised to have another look at her fiance.  Providing for independent legal advice is as much as we can do.  The amendment should be supported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to a point made by Senator Neville.  He has a reputation in this House for being extremely sensible and has introduced much positive legislation.  It is nonsense to suggest a waiver in one hand and an engagement ring in the other sums up the attitude of Irish women in the 1990s.  Has he visited any universities or secondary schools recently?  This cant about a man with an engagement ring saying sign this or I will not marry you is more in keeping with the 1920s.  One should remember that the Minister's title is the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  Treating people and their intelligence equally is a fundamental part of his brief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed and who indicated their agreement with the amendment.  As I explained on Committee Stage, initially I was not in favour of making it a compulsory requirement for legal advice to be <Col N="727" /> obtained before a person contemplating marriage could opt out; even now I have reservations about it.  It is an unusual provision in that it makes it compulsory for a person who is of full age and in command of their faculties to go to the expense and trouble of obtaining and paying for independent legal advice irrespective of whether they feel they need it. Nonetheless, I decided to take that point on board at the urging of Members on both sides of both Houses.</P>
      <P>It is an unusual provision.  I can think of no other case where it is made compulsory on a person of full age to obtain legal advice.  There are many cases where it is regarded as advisable or recommended to do so, but in no other case would it be compulsory to do so.  A person of full age and in command of their senses must now, if they wish to opt out, go to a lawyer and obtain independent legal advice.  Otherwise, the opt out would not be valid or recognised.</P>
      <P>The amendment before the House is to bring into line the position of people who are contemplating marriage rather than people who are already married.  I can confirm for Senator Crowley that the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, even in the event of an opt out, would still apply so far as the benefits in that Act are concerned.  It, of course, is quite different from the Matrimonial Home Bill in that it does not vest a property ownership right which the new Matrimonial Home Bill will do automatically.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see the Minister of State back in the House.  We were having a fruitful discussion on the Bill.  I ask the following question for the purpose of expediting matters.  Would the Minister, as a matter of courtesy, give me his conclusions on the review of section 41?  I withdrew an amendment to the section last week on the understanding that the Minister would examine it between Committee and Report Stages.  The Minister would like to take Report Stage this afternoon and I need to know if he is responding in a positive manner to the points I raised.  However, the Minister can indicate to me as the discussion proceeds.</P>
      <P>Section 65 deals with the powers of the company in relation to accidents and other incidents affecting aircraft.  The section empowers staff of the company or officers appointed by the company to do a number of things.  They can detain an aircraft, gain access to the aircraft and its equipment, examine and test aircraft and so on.  The company may authorise a member of the staff to obtain from any other person &mdash; it is this third person about whom I am concerned &mdash; information within his knowledge or procurement. It may authorise such a member to have access to such records as he may reasonably require and to enter any place where such entry is reasonably required for the purposes of his functions. I have no problem with that but what happens where this authorised officer meets with resistance?</P>
      <P>He may be dealing with someone who has information and refuses to disclose it or someone who has records but refuses to show them.  Where is the enforcement measure in the legislation to enable an officer of the company to obtain the information required?</P>

      <P>I appreciate what Senator Howard has said.  This Bill is structured in a way which shows the importance that the Government, the State, the parliamentary representatives and the people of Ireland attach to the <Col N="729" /> aviation industry.  This high responsibility and structuring is such that it puts major impositions on the performance and co-operation of staff.  Consequently section 74 is a clearly defined section dealing with offences.</P>
      <P>The section is strenuous and strict.  It is fairly extreme and harsh on the staff, directors and everybody involved in the company.  We do not think any other Bill in the history of the State has included such strong measures.  This is how we propose to deal with any infringements or the lack of co-operation to which Senator Howard refers.  I will be happy to deal with section 74 when we come to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification of this section because it deals with the powers <Col N="730" /> of the Minister to require the cancellation or refusal of registration of an aircraft.</P>
      <P>(1)  If it appears to the Minister that an aircraft does not comply with the standards specified in a direction under section 13 of the Act of 1988, he may give a direction in writing to the company requiring it to cancel the registration of the aircraft under this Act...</P>
      <P>I understood that it will be the responsibility and duty of the Irish Aviation Authority to carry out inspections and that it will be required to satisfy itself as to the airworthiness and safety of aircraft.  If that is so, why must the Authority refer back to the Minister in relation to the cancellation of the registration of the aircraft? If the aviation authority is the responsible body in this area and if it is doing its job, why is it necessary to refer to the Minister for authorisation to ensure the cancellation of registration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 66 replaces section 15 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1988, which is repealed by this Bill.  That provision enabled the Minister to refuse to register or cancel the registration of an aircraft if it appeared to the Minister that the aircraft did not comply with the security requirements specified by him in the direction under section 13 of that Act.  Under this Bill, the new company will become the agency responsible for the registration of aircraft while the Minister retains responsibility for security.</P>
      <P>This section provides that the Minister may direct the company to refuse or cancel the registration of an aircraft which fails to meet the required standards in relation to security.  Section 13 of the 1988 Act enabled the Minister to give to the operator of any aircraft directions as to the standards of security with which he must comply.  It is the duty of every such operator to comply with such directions as laid down in law and directed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have difficulty with this because the Minister, in the Second Stage <Col N="731" /> debate, emphasised that this new independent body, the Irish Aviation Authority, would be free from certain shackles and would be able to do an independent job.</P>
      <P>My argument is that if this body or its officers inspect an aircraft and they are not satisfied as to the airworthiness of that aircraft it would appear that before the Authority can act on its conclusions it must refer to the Minister.  The implication is that the Minister has an option to cancel the registration or refuse to cancel it.  If the Minister has such an option &mdash; it is only implied that he has such an option &mdash; he obviously must have advice.  As we have removed this advice from the Civil Service to the Irish Aviation Authority, the Minister is automatically obliged to do the bidding of the Authority and if that is so, I do not see why that power should not be given to the Authority.</P>
      <P>The Minister may tell me it is a safeguard to ensure that a second look must be taken at it.  This is a critical and technical area and, if the Minister proposes to have a second look at it, from whom does he seek advice to balance against the expert advice of the Authority?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with Senator Howard, if I understand him correctly.  This relates back to the powers of the board, where the board could not make a recommendation involving the safety of an aircraft without referring back to the Minister.  I, too, am puzzled why they must consult the Minister to see if they can refuse to register an aircraft.  Is this simply about safety?  Will it always be about safety?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we do not get confused about this.  I wish to make it quite clear that the Authority has the power to register or deregister an aircraft. The Authority has total control over airworthiness, licensing and so forth.  We are talking here about the right of the Minister in regard to security matters. I will take a simple analogy: an old <Col N="732" /> motor car can be registered; it becomes unroadworthy and is taken off the road but it is still registered with the local authority.  However the authority can choose to deregister it.  It can notify the registered owner that certain things must be provided and the local authority can take it off the register or leave it on the register.  The Aviation Authority is in the same position.  In matters of security, intelligence advice and that type of thing, the Minister can give a directive and it must be carried out.  That is what we are talking about.</P>
      <P>There may be times, if we stretch this to the limits of our imagination, where an aviation company operating somewhere else comes into our airspace to provide particular services, but because it is doing something illegal elsewhere and the international intelligence services are advising us of the situation, the Minister, in co-operation with the Ministers for Justice and Defence, may have to give certain directions to the Authority not to cooperate or not to provide services for this company.  That is an extreme example. This power seeks to take into account the information available to the Minister on security matters.  The rest, on the technical professional and registration side, is a matter for the company.</P>

I co-operated to the extent that, against my better judgment, I withdrew amendments.  In regard to the Minister's point, I am concerned about the interpretation I took from his remarks, that is, that this power is almost entirely related to the security area.  If <Col N="733" /> that is the case, why does the section not refer to security matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Law is a very complex area and that is why we have specialist people called lawyers to deal with it.  We, as legislators, try to create the law and perhaps we are to blame somewhat when we make it so complex, but the section under discussion refers to section 13 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1988.  I re-emphasise that the Authority can refuse to register an aircraft if it is not airworthy or otherwise fails to meet the Authority's requirements.  By the Authority's requirements we mean the requirements under Irish and international law and conventions and under the various treaties and conventions to which we are party, such as Eurocontrol, ICAO and so forth.  However, the Minister will be responsible for aviation security, that is the protection of civil aircraft against hijacking and so on.  Section 13 of the 1988 Act reads:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister may, whenever he is satisfied that the interests of the State or of the public so require, give to the operator of any aircraft (other than a State aircraft) directions as to the standards of security and safety which must be complied with&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  wherever the aircraft may be, if the aircraft is registered in the State, or</P>
      <P>(b)  whenever the aircraft is in, or is in flight into, or out of, or over, the State, if the aircraft is not so registered,</P>
      <P>and it shall be the duty of every such operator to comply with such directions.</P>
      <P>(2)  A direction pursuant to subsection (1) may relate to a particular aircraft or to aircraft of a particular class or description.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are doing here is transferring and dividing responsibility, giving certain responsibilities to the company for registration, airworthiness, technical management, professional standards, <Col N="734" /> international law, national law, etc., and we are separating from that and incorporating with it section 13 of the 1988 Act involving the Minister in security matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>We are into security and military matters and the designation of areas of Irish airspace for use by the Defence Forces as of now but I do not know if the Minister of State is free to tell us where and what they are.  Are the areas dealt with in this section permanent or are they subject to movement in size, area or direction from time to time? Second, in time of war or international conflict, bearing in mind the vast areas of the north Atlantic that would appear to come under the control of this Authority, has the Minister if he so decides under the provisions of this Bill the authority to designate that entire area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>My question on this section relates to the area of airspace being designated for use not only within Irish airspace but in the area controlled by Eurocontrol of which this country is a member.  What powers will be transferred to the new Irish Aviation Authority to represent this country at Eurocontrol level?  It is my understanding, and perhaps the Minister of State could clarify this, that as a result of the enormous amount of airspace that is at present assigned for military and defence use within Europe, commercial aviation has to accommodate this to the extent that the consumer is suffering.  The shortest distance between two points is a straight line but most commercial aviation traffic in Europe does not follow straight line paths primarily due to the significant amount of airspace that is currently designated for military and <Col N="735" /> defence purposes.  Could the Minister of State confirm that this is the case and, if so, that there is an anti-consumer bias in the existing situation?  What steps, if any, would he advise the new Authority to take in the interests of the consumer to ensure that the amount of airspace designated for military and defence matters in Europe would be reduced over a period rather than expanded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I was to answer globally, the answer to both questions would be yes.  This section provides that certain areas of Irish airspace would be set aside for the use of the Defence Forces.  Civilian aircraft may not enter those areas without permission.  The Minister for Defence will be responsible for air navigation services in those areas but may reach an agreement with the company to have those services provided by the company or jointly by the military and the company.  Orders under this section can be made and revoked or amended from time to time.  Only areas of sovereign airspace could be so designated. We could not exclude foreign civil aircraft from the airspace over the north Atlantic.  Designated areas would have to be over the land of this State and its territorial waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the designation of airspace, there would be some airspace in this country permanently designated as military airspace.  That would be in most cases the lower airspace around Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, around Gormanston College, Gormanston defence area in County Meath, around the Glen of Imall, where military exercises and training are carried out, and in one particular area in the midlands.  In most cases that was always in the lower airspace.  The Minister for Defence would have the power to make an order designating upper airspace at particular times as being applicable for military aircraft at a particular time.  However, in all cases there must be responsibility exercised and co-operation and collaboration between the civil authority and the military authority and consequent notice <Col N="736" /> given to both parties and agreement reached so that everybody would know exactly what the situation is in the airspace at any given time.  The areas under consideration are small and usually in the lower airspace.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney raised the question of military airspace on the continent.  There are large military airspace areas reserved in Europe which are not in the interests of the best use of our aviation routes and, indeed, the best commercial use of those routes.  Those involved in the European organisations, including ourselves, are constantly pressing for a reduction of military airspace areas so that we can maximise the options in the use of the airspace and minimise the costs.  There is a constant effort throughout Europe on this issue.  Obviously, as I have mentioned during the debate on the Bill in both Houses, the charge system always takes into account the routes being used. We are being very reasonable in this respect and consequently it is attractive to use Irish airspace.  That would be part of the guiding principle the new company would use to attract as much air traffic through our airspace as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's reply and I am especially grateful that he has clarified the position in relation to the amount of space that has been designated within the State, and within the jurisdiction of the State, for military overflying.  Obviously this has and will have a commercial impact.  I am sure the House does not need to be reminded that the main reason for such high air fares in Europe is due to the air miles travelled.  This matter has been at the forefront of discussions among the aviation authorities over a number of years.  My question, in essence, is: will this Government, as a matter of policy and in light of the end of the cold war and the reduced obligation for countries in Europe to have as much airspace as they previously took to themselves because of national and European security reasons, actively and aggressively pursue with their European partners a reduction in military airspace within Eurocontrol's <Col N="737" /> area?  If they do not, we will continue to experience high air fares on commercial traffic between this country and Europe.</P>
      <P>My main reason in raising point this is that as a peripheral country we need to continually reduce our access charges into and out of this country.  If airspace continues to be designated to the extent that it has been heretofore and there is no significant reduction in it, that means that air miles will be more expensive, the cost of aviation will continue to be high and this country will suffer.  It is mainly a twin pronged attack and it is based as much on the continuing economic prosperity of this country as it is on any defence or national security matters that may arise under this section.</P>

      <P>May I raise a question on this section which goes back to rates, local authorities and so on?

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> In page 47, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  Nothing in this Act or any order or other instrument made thereunder, shall prejudice or affect the rights, powers or privileges of the Irish Meteorological Service.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment has been put down in response to representations from people who work in the Irish Meteorological Service.  They are concerned the effect of section 70 will be to transfer gradually work they currently discharge to the Irish Aviation Authority.  This has already begun with the provision of certain pieces of equipment at Shannon, Cork and Dublin Airports to be operated by the present air traffic control staff.</P>
      <P>People working in the Meteorological Service are of the view that the work now being done by those instruments is more correctly in their field and should be done by them alone.  The fact that the equipment has been supplied and that the work is being done by air traffic control staff is to them the thin end of the wedge.  They feel more and more of their work will be done by the staff of the new Authority. It is to safeguard their position and to alleviate their fears that I put down this amendment.  It is not controversial and what it seeks to achieve is clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will re-emphasise the position and put to rest any doubts about the opportunities or the facilities for delivery of service afforded to the Meteorological Service.  As I indicated to this House on Second Stage, in the Select Committee and on Second Stage in the Dáil, the new Authority will not be taking responsibility for aviation meteorology. The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications is responsible for implementing Annexe 3 of the Chicago Convention which deals with the <Col N="740" /> meteorological services and he will continue to be the person responsible. Consequently the Bill does not change the position of the Minister in this regard and does not change the position of the Irish Meteorological Service, which is a part of our Department.  Therefore there is no need for this amendment.  Leaving it out of the Bill leaves the exercise of the totality of Annexe 3 of the Chicago Convention with the Minister and thereby gives permanent opportunity to the Irish Meteorological Service to continue providing the same services to the Irish Aviation Authority in the future, albeit in a modern way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, but this is where reassurance becomes necessary. Equipment has been provided at three of our airports.  Work that was previously done by employees of the Irish Meteorological Service is now being done by air traffic control staff.  It is pointless to say this will never happen because it has happened. The first step has been taken and the second step is sure to follow.  It was to protect the position of people in the Meteorological Service that I put down the amendment.  The Minister cannot deny facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some confusion which is perhaps my fault, despite my best efforts to clarify the position of the Meteorological Service and the meteorological equipment ordered in November 1992, purchased and delivered earlier this year.  I am fully aware that staff in the Irish Meteorological Service have been concerned <i>vis-à-vis</i> the aviation authority because ANSO acquired barometers.  Since barometers are meteorological equipment it was assumed ANSO were undertaking work appropriate to the Meteorological Service. This is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every aircraft must have an altimeter which tells the pilot the height at which <Col N="741" /> he is flying; it is a vital piece of safety equipment.  Altimeters are set at barometric pressure which varies constantly with the weather.  It is the responsibility of the Meteorological Service to inform air traffic control of the barometric pressure. They in turn pass it on to the pilots.</P>
    <P>In April last year the Meteorological Service had industrial relations problems during which the supply of barometric pressures to air traffic control was withdrawn without notice, <i>ex parte</i>.  Failure to supply barometric pressure to aircraft in flight was and is a highly dangerous and irresponsible action.  Stopgap measures were implemented last April during the industrial dispute.  However, because of continuing threats of industrial action, ANSO management bought barometers in November and December 1992 as a caution if the Meteorological Service cannot or refuse to supply these essential barometric readings.</P>
    <P>The acquisition of barometers does not mean ANSO or the new Irish Aviation Authority intends to set up alternative meteorological arrangements.  However, it does mean we will not be as exposed as we were to this type of irresponsible activity.</P>
    <P>Under Article 28 of the Chicago Convention each contracting State undertakes to provide meteorological services to facilitate international air navigation. Annexe 3 of the convention requires each contracting state to designate the meteorological authority which will provide or arrange for the provision of the meteorological service for international air navigation.  In Ireland that authority is and will continue to be the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and his servants in the Irish Meteorological Service.</P>
    <P>The meteorological services of all the contracting states combine to form a global network.  The Annexe sets out the international standards the contracting states have agreed to apply and the manner in which this worldwide system is to be co-ordinated.  The Minister is responsible for providing the service to the required international standard.  The Irish Aviation Authority will have the <Col N="742" /> function of transmitting meteorological service information to aircraft as part of its air traffic control responsibilities; however, it will not be responsible for the provision of the service.  That responsibility will remain with the Minister who will continue to provide the service both nationally and internationally through the Irish Meteorological Service.  I hope this puts the matter in context.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive response.  It has emerged during this debate that we are dealing with a Minister who is on top of his brief.

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 71.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 71 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this section for valid reasons.  I do not intend to speak at length and anything I say will be repeating arguments made effectively from both sides of the House.</P>
      <P>The effect of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977 to 1991, was to establish certain practices and principles that have shown their value and effectiveness over time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I recall the debate in earlier times, there was the concept that giving workers representation on the board of State companies, created an atmosphere in which there was a sense of participation from the ground floor up; it also created a sense of being a part of the enterprise and therefore, more conscious of contributing to its ultimate success.  In practice, <Col N="743" /> there are many examples which have shown the accuracy of these predictions.</P>
    <P>Worker participation at board level, through directors representing them in various State enterprises, is a long standing principle and practice in State companies and because of that, there is no way I could allow this section to pass.  By doing so, I would be acting contrary not alone to my own convictions, but to the views expressed with an amazing sense of unanimity by all sides of the House over the years on this issue.</P>
    <P>What is sought here is a reversal of what we stood for on this matter.  It is a turning back from what was once regarded as enlightened and progressive practice.  We are not dealing now with what may happen &mdash; we moved on from that stage 17 or 18 years ago &mdash; we are in a different era now.  We have practice and experience behind us which tell us that it would be a retrograde step to persist with section 71.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am puzzled by this section and maybe the Minister could elaborate on it.  On Second Stage, the Minister eloquently talked about the conflict of interest between the operational and regulatory areas.  For some reason, he said that allowing or authorising worker participation on the board will involve that worker in a conflict of interests.  That may be true but I would like the Minister to expand on that before we go any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went on to say &mdash; which seems to be contradictory &mdash; that: &ldquo;We have removed from the Bill a prohibition on a ministerial appointment of a staff member to the board.&rdquo;  I do not understand that.  On the one hand, we have a section in the Bill which excludes the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977-91, and on the other, the Minister has the power to appoint a member of staff to the board.  That conflict of interest will exist if the Minister appoints a member of staff to the board. These two sections in the Minister's speech and his statement that he will appoint a member of staff are in direct <Col N="744" /> conflict with the section and I would like the Minister to explain that to me.</P>
    <P>If, as the Minister says, there is a conflict of interest in this case, are there not similar conflicts of interest on all State boards, or on all boards?  There is worker participation on the board of Aer Lingus and it has what the Minister calls an operational and a regulatory function.  Is the worker or staff on the board of Aer Lingus caught in this bind?  Does this mean that the Minister is setting a precedent where he does not believe that worker participation on the boards of State-sponsored bodies will be possible in future because there will always be a conflict of interest?</P>
    <P>The Minister said there is a safety element here, but there is a safety element in every business.  There are safety elements in Aer Lingus &mdash; they have rules there &mdash; Telecom Éireann, Bord na Móna and other semi-State bodies.  There is certainly a greater safety element in this body, but if there is a conflict of interest here, there are similar conflicts in all other State bodies &mdash; possibly in every company &mdash; and I cannot understand the contradictions in the Minister's statement with what is in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to outline the reasons he is opposed to having worker representation on the board of this new Authority.  I am disappointed with the attitude of the Labour Party &mdash; the junior members in Government &mdash; on this matter.  Surely they are going against every principle they have stood for over the years.  I call on the Minister to accept the amendment which will be put forward by Senator Taylor-Quinn and myself on Report Stage, to save him from any embarrassment that may arise from Senator Howard's proposal. I fully support Senator Howard's statements and I can see why Senator Magner has left the Chamber.  He had an answer for us on every section.</P>

      <P>I accept what Senator Mooney said.  I am disappointed.  This evening the Minister will embarrass his junior partners in Government because they will have to vote with the Government and against every principle for which the Labour Party have stood.  Only a few minutes ago, the Minister complimented Senator Howard for his constructive approach to the Bill when he withdrew his amendment to section 70.  I ask the Minister to save his junior partners embarrassment and agree with the constructive approach suggested by Senator Howard.</P>
      <P>According to a trade union publication IMPACT, one of the biggest unions in the country, is actively pursuing worker participation on the board.  The Minister knows this well because he has had representations from them.  I ask him to accept Senator Howard's proposals and to save the Labour Party from any further embarrassment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I too oppose this section. As a nominee of the Labour Panel in the Seanad, I am disappointed that the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act does not apply.  This progressive legislation was introduced in 1977 by the then leader of the Labour Party and Minister for Labour.  It indicated a change which was expected from the industrial relations area and suggested that workers should have participation and that their knowledge, concern and involvement in the industry should be recognised by their involvement at board level.  A company or organisation was seen not only as a social institution owned by the shareholders but as an institution where workers, customers, suppliers and the public had an interest in its survival.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Workers are a key to a company's survival and success and I am sure the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) <Col N="746" /> Act, 1977, recognised that.  Commentators and everyone who spoke on the Bill at the time said it was progressive legislation.  They recognised that the workers could play a key positive role in the management and directorship of companies.  Unfortunately, however, this Bill implies that workers would have a negative impact on a company and, for that reason, should not be involved.  I do not accept this.  Workers have a right to a say in a company's policies.  This would be a positive approach.  If the Minister did not think the inclusion of workers on a board would have a negative impact on a company, he would have included them.</P>
    <P>The old approach was that management had a prerogative as to what happened in a company because it received a mandate from the shareholders. However, the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, and industrial relations Acts throughout Europe have recognised that workers also have a role to play and a right to a say in the management and policies of organisations.</P>
    <P>It is important that workers' knowledge, experience, commitment and expertise, gained from working in an organisation, should be represented on the board of directors of private and public companies.  We should support this principle and, as a member of the Labour Party in the Seanad, I support it; I apologise, I should have said the Labour Panel.</P>

      <P>The workers in any organisation should have a role to play and their involvement would be positive.  Provision was made for this in 1977. However, since then workers' participation in companies has decreased. Perhaps this is related to economic circumstances, but it is unfortunate because workers' participation could have a positive effect.  If people are given responsibility, they will act accordingly.  We should not be shy about giving workers responsibility for the management and direction of companies.  This amendment is trying to ensure that this principle is adhered to.</P>
      <P>If the State does not legislate for this, how can we expect private industry to recognise it as a principle in its own right? In 1977 the Leader of the Labour Party, Mr. Michael O'Leary, gave that leadership and this is an opportunity to continue to do so.  It is important to uphold the rights of workers.  The House should support the objection to this section and perhaps the Minister would reconsider his views in the light of what has been said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the points made.  Senator Neville has struck a broad political chord.  The contributions from Senator Neville, Senator Burke, Senator Ross and Senator Howard have been positive and meritorious and I can concur with a lot of what they said.  Now that Senator Gallagher is here, she and I can ensure Senator Magner and his colleagues in the Labour Party are aware of the impact &mdash; no pun intended &mdash; the Senators on the other side of the House want to make and, second, the regard they have for the Labour Party, that they would not embarrass them in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This situation is not like the one covered in the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, which <Col N="748" /> makes it mandatory that at least one-third of the board of directors should be elected by the workers in the setting up of a new semi-State company.  This Bill is drafted in a different way for special reasons.  The Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, is not being applied to this company because the company will be responsible for licensing most of its own staff, including air traffic controllers, pilots, aeronautical engineers and others.</P>
    <P>Worker directors would often find themselves facing an obvious conflict of interests if they were obliged to take part in board decisions which would involve their own or their colleagues' licences. Moreover, international aviation law and, indeed, normal prudence dictates that board decisions are taken in the interests of aviation safety.  There has been a lot of adverse comment about this provision, but I do not propose to change it.</P>
    <P>The staff in the Air Navigation Services Office and the offices throughout the country are aware of the situation and they are positive about it.  I am happy to say that we are involved in positive discussions with the staff bodies at this time about the transfer into a new commercial body.  There is a positive environment at these discussions because everyone understands the reasons for this decision.  I believe it is in the best interests of aviation safety and we must give a clear signal that this is our priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response.  These provisions already exist when it comes to State boards and they have been referred to from time to time.  There is a well established practice of a declaration of interest by the relevant board of directors where there is a conflict of interest; there is also non-participation in decision-making in regard to specific matters.  That is standard practice and would take care of this <Col N="749" /> situation.  There are penalties if the provisions for a declaration of interests or participation in decision-making are avoided.  That takes care of the central and only argument the Minister put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also disappointed with the Minister's explanation because he mentioned a conflict of interests.  We were given a similar explanation by a member of the Committee of Public Accounts in relation to membership of the board.  On that occasion, the Minister gave other reasons workers should not be on the board.  There would be no conflict of interests.  Senator Howard is correct and I accept what he and Senator Ross said about the declaration of interests.  The Minister should accept this point.  We know it will be the Minister's sole prerogative to elect the board members but he should accept Senator Ross' point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Senator Ross' point about how we could split rights, it is simply not practical.  One is either a member of a board or not.  I am happy with the Minister's explanation as to why that is excluded in the legislation. It makes sense.  There is nothing to prevent worker participation at a later stage.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to hear Senator Neville's praise of the Labour Party and the argument for worker participation in all aspects.  He should be on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is marvellous to hear that what we have always said makes Senator Neville's point.  This legislation does not allow for worker participation but there is no cast or slur on workers in that regard.  It has been properly explained by the Minister and I accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind Senator Gallagher that I was elected on the Labour <Col N="750" /> Panel.  Perhaps she was not here when I said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that we are representing the Labour Panel.  I also remind Senator Gallagher that the Leader of the Labour Party who brought in that Bill later saw the light and joined Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>First, the worker directors would not have a majority on the board.  They would make up a third of the board and would not be the deciding factor.  Second, and contrary to Senator Gallagher's view, it is regular practice for members of a board who have a vested interest not to participate.  Most boards elect people with vested interests.  I am member of Foynes Harbour Trustees and two of our members are members of the harbour operators, the employers.  If we have to make a decision in that area, they sit back and allow us to make it because they have a vested interest.  This is not unusual; it is common practice.  I would be very disappointed if somebody said the two people representing the operators in the port were not allowed to sit on the board because they had a vested interest.  Those people contribute very well to the activities of the board but they have a vested interest in many of the decisions taken and they stand back from them.</P>
      <P>We should not under-estimate workers.  At present some of them have vested interests in existing State boards and in many of the decisions made.  By virtue of the fact that they represent labour, workers have a vested interest in any board and those now on State boards are very responsible when it comes to making decisions.  I have confidence that if they were on this board they could stand back when a conflict of interests was involved but even if they did not, I believe they would accept responsibility for their actions.  Even if a third of the board decided to go a certain direction, they could be overruled by the majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should maintain the principle of worker participation on all State boards. We should encourage it in all areas of enterprise, private, semi-State and State. <Col N="751" /> The Government is indicating that it does not accept that worker participation should apply in all circumstances and this is a retrograde step.  How can we persuade industry and commerce to accept worker participation if the Government does not?  It is allowing excuses elsewhere when we as the Legislature, as citizens or trade unionists, should be encouraging employers to accept the benefits of worker participation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more concerned now than when I spoke earlier.  The Minister's sole argument is the conflict of interests.  I outlined that there are well established mechanisms, in State boards and in the private sector, to deal with a conflict of interests.  The members declare it and the director concerned does not participate in the decision making process in that regard.  Senator Gallagher had difficulty with that interpretation but that is the position.  That safeguard is there but the Minister said there can be conflict of interests and the risk cannot be taken.  I put it to the Minister that there is no State board which can offer a 100 per cent guarantee that a conflict of interests will not arise sometime. At some point it is inevitable that in the performance of its duties there will be an area in which the personal interest of a board member will be to some degree in conflict.  That position is protected by the declaration of interest and withdrawal from the decision making process.</P>
      <P>Since 1977, when the first of these Acts saw the light of day, there has been steady, successful progress regarding worker directors on every State board. This is the first occasion I can recall that we have hit the block on the road.  The justification given is unsustainable.  I fear that if we incorporate section 71, the precedent will be created to deny worker participation in future State enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past 16 years there has been steady progress and now we have hit the block.  If the justification is the explanation the Minister gave us, clearly that signals a wider decision.  Having created <Col N="752" /> the precedent, any Minister so inclined can say that because there is the risk of a conflict of interests, the effect of the worker participation Acts cannot apply in a particular case.  This is a fundamental issue and we have reached the crossroads. As I said, I am more concerned now than I was when I initially opposed the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <P>Senator O'Toole.  I know the Senator has just arrived but we have spent half an hour on this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I have a lot to say on this section and I have discussed this at some length on previous occasions in this House with previous Ministers, once when the then Minister for Labour, Deputy B. Ahern, brought in legislation to increase the participation at board level and when he brought in another Bill, to increase participation at sub-board level.  I recommend that the Minister look at the commitments given by the Government during that period.</P>
      <P>The commitment given by the Government and the indications in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> for worker participation and the move on management and union sides to get workers to have an appreciation of the importance of their product and company, are being set aside in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I want to know why the 1991 legislation which contains a regulation allowing the Minister of the day to extend the Act to other companies as designated by the Minister cannot be applied to this company. The elimination of this section would not diminish the Minister's responsibility.  This section is exclusive, it excludes and alienates workers from the operation of the board of the company. It is true that workers have a vested interest, but it is unacceptable to say it is negative to the development of the company.  Workers have no vested interest other than ensuring the company works efficiently and effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that workers are less responsible than those who have <Col N="753" /> been promoted to management.  Many of us in management have been workers and we have not changed.  Workers do not become irresponsible when appointed to a board.  I ask the Minister to trust the worker' judgment in electing responsible people to the board and to trust those elected.  I also ask him to reflect on the Government's approach which is an open one and to allow participation at all levels.</P>
    <P>Lack of information and participation creates tension in industrial relations. Those of us working in this area have encountered small and major disputes relating to organisation, rationalisation, cutbacks and development.  If people do not know what is going on and are not part of the consultative or decision-making process, they will suspect something is going on which is not above board and they will not be able to go along with it.</P>
    <P>This section is unacceptable and unnecessary because the point is covered in the 1991 Act.  One of the Schedules to that Act states that the Minister may, by regulation, increase the number of companies included in worker participation at board and sub-board level. I ask the Minister to reconsider this and to give a vote of confidence to workers at a time when they badly need it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the contributions.  I believe in a practical approach to the question of worker directors.  Worker directors can and do make a notable contribution in many commercial semi-State bodies.  However, it would be wrong for a number of reasons to apply the full provisions of the worker participation Acts in this case. The right of workers to participate is not in question here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On earlier sections of this Bill the potential for conflict between the company's operational and regulatory roles was raised.  Those separate roles I believe could be seriously complicated by the presence of elected worker directors on the board.  Inevitably such elections would involve people who, in addition to being employees of the company in its <Col N="754" /> operational role, would also be licensed by the company's regulatory function.</P>
    <P>I must re-emphasise that I have the utmost faith in the integrity of ANSO personnel and I have no reason to doubt but that worker directors would be equally upright and trustworthy. However, the probity of staff, management or board members is not the issue.  As I said in the debate in this House and the Lower House, the primary role of this company is safety.  That role is discharged at operational, regulatory and board levels.  While we all hope and pray that accidents will not happen, the fact is they do.  In the event of an accident involving the company and loss of life, the propriety of having operational employees who are also licensed by the company involved at the highest level would inevitably and justifiably give cause for concern and criticism.  Where decisions must be made about safety matters, whether at board level regarding regulatory or operational functions, there should and must be clear lines of responsibility and accountability.  In my view the election of worker directors in this case would inexorably fudge this clarity.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I took a practical approach to these matters.  Under the terms of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, there is provision for sub-board level participation.  I am anxious that the Irish Aviation Authority should have arrangements which will meet the requirements contained in the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill was introduced, we amended section 17 so that there is no barrier to the Minister appointing a staff member to the board.  The Bill was published and was put through Second and Committee Stages in the Dáil and I listened to contributions from all sides.  I amended section 17 in everyone's interests.  I believe this approach fairly addresses the concerns expressed in this House and, at the same, will ensure the probity of the company in safety matters is never in doubt.  It would be wrong for this House to tie the hand of any Minister <Col N="755" /> on this matter.  Ministers must have discretion in appointments to boards and the approach I have adopted should be to the satisfaction of the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard said that for 16 years we put through legislation based on the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977.  That is not a fact.  We put through similar legislation and we made changes which were accepted.  Those changes now operate in other semi-State organisations and they have been successful. The Minister has the right to appoint a staff member to a board and that practice has worked well.  The same will apply under this legislation and I ask the House to accept this in the interests of safety and clarity and to ensure there is no conflict of interests in the operation of the aviation business.  Neither we, nor the board members could find a simple way around the question of a conflict of interests.  It is always possible to find a way around it, but there is no simple or certain way.</P>
    <P>The board is responsible for safety standards which are implemented by licensed staff.  In the event of an accident it must be clear that board members were not setting standards while at the same time judging whether they met those standards.  That would be a conflict of interests which nobody could justify.  It would be a clear case of being judge and jury.  I do not believe the House wants such a situation to prevail.  The issue is not whether we can find a way around a conflict of interests; the fact it could arise would irreparably damage the credibility of the organisation and public confidence in the organisation.  We must maintain public confidence and ensure clarity in regard to the safety of the travelling public.  This must be at the back of our minds at all times.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been changed.  Staff members may be appointed; that is a new departure which must meet the wishes of Members on the other side of the House who want worker participation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>We must accept one principle I strongly believe in &mdash; that all workers want to work for a successful organisation that carries out its objectives to the maximum efficiency.  Since the people who will work for this organisation will want it to be successful and to carry out its objectives, they should be involved in ensuring that that happens. They can be involved by participating in management at the highest level.  I have every trust in the workers to ensure that the objective is carried out.</P>
      <P>The Minister listened to the speeches of those who opposed the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act in 1977; this Minister is trotting out the same arguments that were put forward against the Bill at that time, arguments that were overcome by the then Government with the support of his party in Opposition.  Deputy Lenihan spoke very well in this House on the issue and the Minister is now putting forward the same argument.</P>
      <P>It is important that people are involved in decision making, and that they should feel involved.  I would have every confidence that if they were on the board they would ensure that the objectives of the organisation were carried out to the best of their ability.  The Minister does not trust them to do so but I think he should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be said that if you have worker participation there is a conflict of interests.  The two levels, management and workers, are inherent in any organisation, <Col N="758" /> and people who say otherwise are not accepting reality.  There are different interests in any organisation, including the present semi-State bodies with worker participation.  There is a coalition of interests; workers have one interest, management have another but they can still co-operate effectively on boards.  It is important that workers have a role to play and I do not see why they should not do so in this organisation.  The arguments the Minister has made about the success of this organisation can be put forward against worker participation in any organisation because any working environment is a coalition of interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  That is the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who feels that one can have a unitary approach between workers and management is not facing reality.  The workplace is a coalition of interests and these coalitions must be involved in all areas of an enterprise. That should be our ultimate goal.  Those issues have been set back over a number of years, probably because of the economic climate.  The Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts indicated another way, a coalition of interests that would be involved in the management of a company at the highest level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I understood the Minister correctly, he said they could be involved at sub-board level within this organisation.  The lower you go in any organisation the further you are from the key decision making area.  The higher you go the more policy orientated you are.  If you can have participation at sub-board level, you are nearer the decision-making process and the granting of licences than you are at board level which is more a policy area. I cannot see why somebody can have sub-board level participation without compromising their position, without having a problem about their vested interests, and that is acceptable to the Minister but moving up to a higher level one is remote from decision making, and one would have a vested interest: it is contradictory. If I accepted the Minister's argument, I <Col N="759" /> would have more of a problem about participating the further down I went in an organisation, rather than going up to the key decision making levels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the Minister's response to be a mish-mash of contradictions. It does not stand up to logical assessment.  The Minister raised more questions than he answered.  He has raised a serious issue here.  I would like to make one comment, and I hope his officials will back me.  In the areas of safety, I have never yet found a situation where a conflict between management and workers' interests on safety was the result of management wanting to implement more safety regulations than the workers.  Throughout Europe the reverse has always been true.</P>
      <P>In the area of health and safety legislation the Minister for Finance will confirm that the implementation of health and safety regulations is being resisted by management and their interests at every level in Europe.  If one wants to implement safety measures one has a far better chance with workers than with management.  I could quote chapter and verse on the current position in Ireland a year or two after the implementation of the Health and Welfare at Work Act which in many instances has been ignored by management despite every effort by the ICTU, unions and workers' associations, to have the safety measures implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister explain how he can appoint a worker who will not have a conflict of interests but the workers cannot elect a worker without having a conflict of interests?  It appears that the Minister's lackey does not have any conflict of interests because his loyalty does not have a bearing on the workplace. The Minister is hardly suggesting that he would appoint somebody to the board who would have a more responsible or loyal attachment to safety regulations than a person elected by the workers.  It does not make sense.  If a worker can be appointed to the board, then section 17 must be changed.  I do not see where <Col N="760" /> that fits into section 17 but I take the Minister's word that there is no exclusion.</P>
    <P>The other issue with which I find some contradiction is that the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977-91, deal with sub-board participation. Section 71 of the Bill states that: &ldquo;The Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977 to 1991, shall not apply to the company&rdquo;.  There seems to be a contradiction there considering that one of those Acts deals with sub-board participation, yet the Minister is telling us that sub-board participation is not excluded by this section.  I have not read the Act in detail so if the Minister tells me that there is nuance of difference in what I am saying, or that I am taking a slightly unsophisticated approach to the interpretation, then fair enough. However, what it is in this section is against the spirit of those Acts.  The Minister has still not said why it is necessary to exclude them seeing as the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977-91 are specifically inclusive, and all the companies to which it applies are named on the orders determined by Schedules to those Acts.  Why is it necessary to specifically exclude the workers in this Bill?  Why do we not put it into every Bill?  It is outrageous, and not in line with your style of approach, to give the impression that a worker will be less concerned than management about the safety of air passengers.  I want to be clear that I do not believe management would be irresponsible in relation to safety.  Any air traffic management personnel I have known have been over responsible, if anything.  However, it is outrageous to suggest workers would be less than careful in relation to safety.</P>
    <P>The Minister argued there would be a conflict of interest, that people would set standards and then sit in judgment as to whether those standards were maintained. Would the Minister explain how this would differ from the board of a company, the chief executive of which is sacked?  There are companies throughout the country with executive directors who implement board decisions.  Any of us <Col N="761" /> who are involved in an organisation, who sit on its board or central committee and are charged with implementing its decisions, are in precisely the same position. Such persons sit in judgment, as the Minister puts it; or, to put it a better way, explain themselves to the other members of the board of directors.  They are answerable to the board.  In many ways it is far easier for them to insist that the position of workers is put to the board so that the implementation of safety regulations can be examined in the company from top to bottom to find out where the gap is.</P>
    <P>There is no conflict of interest.  The fact that the Minister says there is does not mean that is the position.  Words do not mean what he says they mean, although I have no doubt his view is well meant and well held.  If I am a worker in a company and on its board of directors when an investigation is taking place into the implementation of safety regulations, the fact that I am on the board and that the investigation may refer to some aspect of my involvement should not result in a conflict of interest.  Most boards of directors have a standard and clearly stated position on this.  An example was given in today's <i>Irish Times</i> where the position of a member of a board was found to be untenable because of other interests and activities.  He had to resign because of this stated conflict of interest.  It is acceptable that a person may have to leave a board while a matter is being investigated.  If a matter closely related to the operation of safety regulations was being discussed by a board and a member of the board was responsible for that matter, it would not be beyond the bounds of normal practice for the board to discuss the issue in that person's absence.</P>
    <P>I wish to put three points to the Minister. First, some aspects of the legislation to which we referred deal with sub-board activities.  Excluding them, even though the Minister says workers may participate in such activities, is a contradiction.  Secondly, workers may not elect a responsible person because there would be a conflict of interest, whereas the Minister <Col N="762" /> may appoint a worker, for whom apparently there would not be such a conflict. If the Minister could explain this it might go a long way towards understanding the thinking behind this section.  Finally, all safety regulations of which I have knowledge have been proposed by workers rather than management.  This is not a reflection on management who very often have other interests.  I ask the Minister to respond to these three points.</P>

      <P>If the words I use do not mean what they say, we can take it that Senator O'Toole's words mean exactly what they say.  I infer from his contribution that he thinks management would be less responsible than workers with regard to aviation safety despite his best efforts to put a different emphasis on it.  It is not fair or right that he should cast this reflection on either the management or staff of ANSO or any authority. I refute it entirely.</P>

      <P>I made clear that the board would license people.  If we were to use the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977-91, in the selection of the board, a certain percentage of its members would license themselves.  In the event of an accident they would make decisions in relation to their own actions and those of the people they have <Col N="763" /> licensed.  There must be absolute clarity and transparency.</P>
      <P>When this Bill was first introduced there was a total bar on worker participation of any type at board level.  As a result of the contributions of Members of the Oireachtas, I removed this prohibition so that staff could become members of the board by ministerial appointment.  I went more than half way to give an opportunity to the staff.  At the end of the day we must be absolutely clear on the safety and conflict of interest issues.  It is not a case of mistrusting staff. ANSO staff are very conscious of the need for safety.  Their integrity, probity and skills are not in question.  They know this.  Like me, they know how valuable and essential it is to have a clear, objective board whose independence and probity are without question.</P>
      <P>I have listened with great interest to contributions on this issue on Committee Stage in the other House and on Second Stage and now on Committee Stage in this House.  We have come a long way. We have given this opportunity to staff. We have been very fair.  Legislation relating to other boards has not provided for the full effect of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts.  This is not a new departure but is replicating what has been done in other situations.  We should be consistent.  We should look at what has been done in the past, the changes that have been made, the interests of the travelling public and the need for independence of decision making.  We should accept the legislation which is proposed as a result of the changes we have made.  I rest my case and leave it to the House to make its decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering that the legislation referred to in section 71 deals with sub-board activities and that the Minister has said that participation by workers of this company in sub-board activities is acceptable, is there not a clear conflict here?  The 1991 legislation deals with sub-board activities.  Why is the Minister excluding such activities?  This has not been replicated anywhere.  It is true &mdash; this is a specious argument &mdash; that not all companies have worker participation. If this is a replication of other legislation which specifically, by section, excludes workers, such legislation is new to me.  Workers have neither been excluded nor included.  The 1991 legislation is inclusive, this Bill is exclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>All workers have a personal interest in the companies in which they work.  However, applying this to the board is entirely different.  If we appoint persons to the board under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts a conflict of interest may arise.  We do not want such a situation to prevail. Consequently, to take into account the interests of workers and the representations that have been made, we have enabled the Minister to appoint a member of staff to the board while not taking into account and excluding from force the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977-91.  This gives the board a totally different dimension.</P>
      <P>On the other question which Senators O'Toole and Neville raised about sub-board level, there would be no conflict of interest at sub-board level.  If that was to be taken to its logical conclusion, no operational decisions could be made at any time.  People would have a conflict of interest in every decision they take. Policy and absolute decisions are taken at board level.  The operational decisions are taken at sub-board level and down the line.  That is the normal commercial environment in which people operate and how normal management decisions are taken.  I do not see any difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 81 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>We need quite a bit of clarification on this section.  Senator Ross raised a question on section 76 as to whether any claims or legal actions were pending.  Section 81 deals with liability for loss occurring before vesting day.  It is quite extraordinary that:</P>
      <P>where a claim in respect of any loss, injury or damage arising out of the exercise before the vesting day of functions transferred to the company by or under this Act has not been made before that day or, if so made, has not been satisfied or otherwise disposed of, the claim shall, after that day, lie against the company and not against the Minister, any other State authority or the State.</P>
      <P>This inflicts an unfair burden on the new body.  It should start with a clean sheet. It is equivalent to a person selling a house and saying to the purchaser that he or she is unaware of any claim, but should one arise it is the purchaser's responsibility and that this will be included in the deed.  It is a very unfair burden to place on the new company.  It is unreasonable and I ask the Minister to explain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Howard would agree that if we are to compare this to the purchase of a house, we would have to consider whether it was a new house carrying a six year structural guarantee or a second-hand house without a guarantee. It is the same situation here, but we have an insurance policy.  As I said on a previous occasion, ANSO carries a large insurance policy to cover all liabilities. This section seeks to maintain the continuity of the situation.  If there were liabilities against ANSO, they would transfer to the company, who would have a similar policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="769" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine.  ANSO has the insurance policy at present and will have it until vesting day.  What happens on vesting day and the day after?  Should this insurance company say that its deal was with ANSO and that the Irish Aviation Authority must make its own insurance arrangements, the Authority would have to do so from the first day. Where in the legislation is there a provision that this insurance will transfer from ANSO to the Irish Aviation Authority without out any diminution of its benefits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 81 states:</P>
      <P>.....</P>
      <P>(6)  This section does not apply to a claim by one State authority against another.</P>
      <P>(7)  The Minister shall pay to the company a sum equal to the amount of any payment made by the company in respect of a claim referred to in subsection (1) or (3) including any payment in respect of costs necessarily incurred in relation to the claim by any party.</P>
      <P>The company would handle these cases because it would have the expertise and the relevant records which it will receive from ANSO.  However, the section goes on to provide that &ldquo;the Minister shall pay to the company an amount equal to the amount of any payments made by the company in respect of costs necessarily incurred by it in relation to the claim.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the story not changed somewhat?  Before the Minister's last response it was ANSO's insurance company which carried the risks and responsibilities.  In the Minister's last response the insurance company has disappeared and the Minister has come in to pick up the tab.  My question was: to what extent do the responsibilities of ANSO's insurance company transfer to the new Authority on vesting day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We must differentiate between ordinary claims, which ANSO <Col N="770" /> and the Minister might have to pay, and major claims which the insurance company would pay.  There is a marked difference and this section is included to clarify that situation.  Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) shall not apply in relation to a loss or an injury or damage referred to in subsection (1) if there is in force a policy of insurance under which the Minister is insured against any sum which he is liable to pay by way of damages or costs in respect of the loss, injury or damage.</P>
      <P>If there is insurance cover is provided; if there is no insurance the Minister is responsible.  We must have some protection for the travelling public and for the operation of the system so that any change would not affect continuity between the responsibilities of today and those of the new company after vesting day.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 28, after &ldquo;company,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;save in relation to charges for the use of services provided by the company,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="771" /> The purpose of this amendment is to ask the Minister to clarify something which was mentioned on Committee Stage and about which the Minister has given confusing signals.  There is a minor conflict between what the Minister said and what is in the Bill and the purpose of the amendment is to clarify this conflict and enshrine it in the law.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated on Second Stage that he can intervene and give a direction on anything.  I quote from the Official Record &mdash; which is open to correction if it is wrong &mdash; column 251.  I said: &ldquo;The Minister has the power to intervene or to give a direction on anything.  Is that correct?&rdquo;  The Minister replied: &ldquo;That is correct&rdquo;.  Therefore, in the Minister's words, he can intervene on any matter to do with the Bill.  However, at column 249 he said: &ldquo;The Minister would not be able to give directions down to minute detail.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One cannot give directions on anything and not be able to give directions down to minute detail.  This must be clarified because there is a contradiction here.</P>
    <P>I believe what the Minister means is the difference between &ldquo;will&rdquo; and &ldquo;would&rdquo;, &ldquo;can&rdquo; and &ldquo;would&rdquo;.  The Minister continues at column 249:</P>
    <P>The Minister is empowered to intervene. However, he would not give directives in the normal day to day running of the organisation, ........  He can issue a directive, but in the normal commercial operation and management of the Authority the Minister would not be involved in specific detail.</P>
    <P>I wish to change that &ldquo;would&rdquo; to &ldquo;will&rdquo; or &ldquo;can&rdquo; to ensure that he does not intervene in the day to day activity of the Irish Aviation Authority.  The only way to ensure that is to enshrine it in legislation because my understanding of what the Minister said is simple: that he can intervene but he would not.  Let us make sure that he does not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I was not clear enough in my response on that occasion.  I thought it would be concluded that I was referring to policy and not detail.  I said we would not go into detail.  It is the same situation.</P>
      <P>Section 7 gives the Minister power to direct the company to comply with general policy decisions made by the Government in relation to aviation.  The purpose of Senator Ross's amendment would be to exclude the Authority's fees and charges from the ambit of ministerial directions.  However, we must be clear about this section.  It does not give the Minister the power to intervene in matters of detail.</P>
      <P>The company will not be required to have its fees and charges approved by the Minister.  The main user charges imposed by the Authority are determined internationally and by reference to an agreed formula.  That formula, which is highly complex, essentially relates our unit charges to the costs we incur, the weight of the aircraft and the distances flown in our airspace.  I made that clear on my second last visit to the House.</P>
      <P>These internationally agreed formulas are standard detail arrangements and do not come within the ambit of section 7.  I must emphasise that the Authority's fees and charges would have relatively little impact on the Irish economy or on the Irish aviation industry.  Over 80 per cent of ANSO revenue &mdash; and this will become Authority revenue &mdash; comes from foreign airlines who fly in transit through our airspace.  Given that the bulk of the Authority's charges are determined internationally and that they do not impact to any great extent on the Irish economy, we have specifically excluded any question on the Minister's involvement in the fee charging process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances I have outlined, the amendment proposed by Senator Ross is redundant and would be neither necessary nor acceptable.  As some Senators have remarked, it is appropriate that the Irish Aviation Authority &mdash; which will be part of the public sector &mdash;<Col N="773" /> should be subject to general Government policy control.  This section provides for that.  I repeat, I will not be able to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  His concluding remarks do not surprise me. They are not satisfactory because they are in direct conflict &mdash; I will put it on the record again &mdash; with what he said on Second Stage, where he said that the Minister has the power to intervene or to give a direction on anything.  He was asked whether that was correct and he said &ldquo;That is correct&rdquo;.  That is still my understanding of how&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;this Bill will be interpreted. If that was correct, the Minister could happily accept this amendment.  He could take it on board just to reassure us.  It is in direct conflict with what the Minister said on Second Stage so I am not reassured.  I reassure the Minister, however, that I am not going to embarrass the Government by calling a vote on this.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 17, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) (i) the Minister shall appoint the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee as a director,</P>
      <P>(ii) the Minister shall appoint a worker-director to represent the Irish Aviation Authority workforce;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House feel very strongly on those two points.  We have outlined already why there should be worker participation on this board. Nobody would be a more suitable director of a company than a member of the workforce who would always have the interests of the company uppermost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts should also be a member of the board.  We need a watchdog on <Col N="774" /> the board because we have given this company and subsidiaries of this company the power to raise considerable amounts of money with State guarantees. The participation of the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts on the board is a small thing to ask the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. There is considerable merit in this amendment.  In relation to the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, experience in the past few years has shown that if there had been a better system of observing their performance, keeping a closer eye on certain activities, the problems and embarrassment which arose in certain State companies could have been avoided.  This proposal is no reflection on the integrity of the people in ANSO or those who will lead the new body.  It is an essential safeguard of the interests of the citizens and we, as Members of the Oireachtas are very conscious of our duty in this respect.</P>
      <P>We debated at length worker participation on the board and the wording in the amendment is that the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, leaving no doubt that there will be a workers' representative on the board of the Authority.  On Committee Stage the Minister indicated that he was providing for the power to do this, he may do it, but the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that there is no ambiguity.</P>
      <P>Having failed to get the provisions in the worker participation Act implemented in relation to the appointments to the board, the next best option is to ensure that the Minister shall appoint a worker as a director.  We do not want any ambiguity here.  I do not wish to prolong the discussion.  The points we made are obvious and I hope the Minister will respond in a positive manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confused about these two amendments.  Listening to the evolution of the debate over the last few occasions I thought that we were trying to remove the aviation authority from the slightest hint of political interference. These amendments do not take account of the Bill as it is constituted at present. <Col N="775" /> There is no reference in the amendment to section 37.  I presume the amendments are in order but I am not absolutely certain.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke and Senator Howard are trying to have the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts appointed to the board of the Authority.  I fully appreciate their desire for public accountability.  However, mechanisms for ensuring the public accountability of the Authority already exist.</P>
      <P>As the House will recall, we have placed time limits on when the Authority must report to the Minister and a time limit by which the Minister must submit the Authority's report to the Oireachtas. To place the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts on the board of the Authority would conflict with section 37 of the Bill, which provides that Members of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament may not serve as directors or members of staff of the Authority.  This is to ensure that the Authority remains independent and that its directors and members of staff are not influenced by any party political considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Conversely, if the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts were a member of the Authority, his or her position and independence could be seriously compromised.  For example, there will be significant cash flows involving millions of pounds between the Department of Finance and the Authority and between the Department of Communications and the Authority.  Disbursement and accounting of these funds on the Department's side will eventually be matters for scrutiny by the Committee of Public Accounts.  If the amendment was accepted, the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts would inevitably be involved in the Authority's decisions on these matters.  When the departmental accounts come before the committee, the independence of the chairman could validly be questioned.  I will go no further than that.  I am sure the House will recognise that it would be ill advised for me to accept this amendment <Col N="776" /> on behalf of the House and the Legislature.</P>
    <P>The second part of the proposed amendment seeks to require the Minister to appoint a member of the Authority's staff to the board.  While it is open to the Minister to do so, I do not agree that he should be compelled to appoint staff members to the board.  I believe in a practical approach to the question of worker directors.  These worker directors can and do make a notable contribution in many commercial and semi-State bodies.  However, I believe that the appointment of a member of staff to the board must be handled with a degree of sensitivity on both sides.  As the House is aware, this arrangement where the Minister can appoint a member of staff, but is not obliged to do so, works very successfully in other cases.</P>
    <P>Placing an obligation on the Minister to appoint a member of staff would unnecessarily compromise the degree of sensitivity required.  It is the Minister's responsibility to appoint the best people to administer the Authority and his choice should not be circumscribed. Based on our present situation, on section 37 of the Bill and on the fact that the right must be given to the Minister to take his decision without requiring him to execute that decision, the attitude in the Bill is flexible and practical.  This decision is best left with the Minister.  It will give more credibility to the legislation, require the Minister to take a positive and responsible attitude and ensure that the sensitivities involved in the appointments are taken fully into account by both the person making the appointment and the person executing the appointments thereafter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 29, line 53, after &ldquo;unpaid&rdquo; to add &ldquo;provided that such rate shall not be lower than the prevailing Dublin Inter Bank Offer Rate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I propose this amendment due to lack of assurance from the Minister of State on Committee Stage about the payments that have to be made for the superannuation fund.  What alarmed me most was that the Minister for Finance would be able to decide the interest rate which he gave to the superannuation fund.  We identified a distinct conflict of interest here, where the Minister on behalf of the taxpayer is making a decision about the interest rate that the taxpayer will pay. This cannot be fair to the superannuation fund and fair to the taxpayer.  It is impossible. The Minister for Finance is, as the Minister of State knows, one of the fairest men in the world; but if he has this power and exercises it, he will come in for criticism about the interest rate he strikes when he pays the necessary into the superannuation fund.  It is too much to ask any Minister to set the interest rate on such an extraordinarily large amount of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know of any precedent where the Minister has this power, but in future it could be open to abuse.  I do not know when this money will be paid; the Minister of State does not know and was not specific about it.  It could be open to an unscrupulous Minister to pay nothing, an interest rate of zero; or it could leave it open to an unscrupulous Minister, who was compromised, to pay an interest rate which was way above the prevailing rates. It is a discretionary power which should not be left in the hands of any particular person.  That is why I looked for a suitable formula for the Minister to use.  If he uses the Dublin inter bank offer rate nobody could question that he is using an impartial independent yardstick for an interest rate of this sort.  The Minister could use the one month money rate of the money markets, or plus or minus 1 per cent; or he could use the Central Bank's short <Col N="778" /> term facility rate, plus 1 or 2 per cent, rates over which he has no power.  It is invidious to the Minister to give a discretion of this sort to him and it is open to abuse.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment and support the arguments put forward by Senator Ross.  This section is one about which some of us expressed considerable concern as to the capacity of the superannuation fund to survive, if it had to, for a period of seven years.  I proposed an amendment on this section on Committee Stage, which I withdrew on the understanding that the Minister of State would positively respond on Report Stage.  I take it by the Minister of State's silence so far that he does not intend to do so.</P>
      <P>Many issues were debated at length last week on this section and this amendment is a simple safeguard that the interest rate would not be lower than the Dublin inter bank offer rate.  It is reasonable, considering the options or the opportunities available to a Minister should he decide to play rough with the superannuation fund and the provisions for it in section 40.  Therefore, I support the amendment.  I regret that the Minister of State did not see fit to respond in kind to my withdrawn amendment on Committee Stage, which would have sought to reduce from seven to two years the period in which the Minister would make the contribution to the fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

      <P>Senator Ross and Senator Howard propose to amend section 41 to ensure that the interest rate paid by the Minister for Finance on the outstanding balance of his superannuation liability shall not be less than the Dublin inter bank offer rate.  Senator Ross has argued that the Minister for Finance would be pressing for a low interest rate while the trustees would look for a high interest rate.  That would be normal.  Clearly, the Minister for Finance can set the interest rates to suit his concerns.  However, that will not deter or debar the trustees from negotiating the best rate which they can get from the <Col N="779" /> Minister.  The Minister for Finance has a wide range of responsibilities, which I outlined previously.  These include the need to adopt an evenhanded and equitable approach in matters such as this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Such situations are resolved through a normal and common negotiating process.  It must be recalled that if the trustees received the full £60 million on the vesting day, they would be required to invest it in various interest bearing instruments.  Thus the interest rate to be paid by the Minister for Finance can be likened to the interest rates the trustees would have received had they had the £60 million from the outset.  The objective of all pension fund trustees and their investment managers is to maximise the return on fund investments.  Neither I nor, I am sure, the trustees will be dismayed by a difference between the interest rate agreed with or even imposed by the Minister for Finance and that he may pay, and that which might have been earned by the trustees in alternative instruments.  That difference for the relatively short period of less than seven years will be well within the normal spread of investment returns that any pension fund will have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dealt earlier and at length with these issues which the Senators have raised in detail.  I did so because, as always, when I visit this House I am anxious to be as helpful, co-operative and informative as possible.  Superannuation and the vast range of issues involved in the funding and financing of pensions, though complex, is an issue of vital concern to all of those involved.  I would be dismayed if in discussing these abstruse matters we were <Col N="780" /> to undermine the confidence ANSO management and staff have in these arrangements.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the erudition Senator Howard has brought to the Bill.  As I have made clear on a number of occasions, our strategy in this section goes beyond what has been agreed in relation to other bodies.  In this Bill we are providing that the Minister for Finance will discharge his accumulated superannuation liabilities to ANSO staff over a seven year period. We have also, as the House is aware, provided that the Minister for Finance will be liable for interest charges on the outstanding balance.  For comparison, let me remind the House that in the case of most other bodies &mdash; for example, Telecom Éireann, Coillte, An Post and others &mdash; there is no time limit set in which the Minister for Finance must discharge his liabilities.  By contrast, here we are setting a strict time limit for the Minister for Finance and we believe that the proposed seven year period in the Irish Aviation Authority Bill is a reasonable arrangement.  The Minister for Finance would happily discharge his liability in a shorter period but for the amounts involved.  They are not insignificant sums.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard is concerned that the Minister for Finance might defer paying anything to the superannuation fund until the seventh year.  As I said the last day, this is theoretically possible.  By then the Minister's gross liability, including interest, would be of the order of £100 million pounds.  It is important, however, to realise that there is no question of the Minister evading his responsibilities and I am sure that no Member of this House would make any such suggestion.</P>
    <P>Because of concerns that the Minister for Finance might defer meeting his liability until the seventh year, it was proposed that we should have specified the amounts or proportions to be paid each year.  While we were sympathetic to this approach, we could not find a formula that on the one hand was sufficiently tight while also was reasonably flexible.  In any case I can assure Senators that we have done the necessary calculations and have confirmed that, even if the Minister for <Col N="781" /> Finance does not make any payment for seven years, we will be able to fund all pensions arising in that period.  The superannuation element of the user charges that the Authority will receive amounts to 20 per cent of payroll.  This, as the House will appreciate, provides a superannuation fund cash flow of up to £3 million per annum.</P>
    <P>I might remind the House also that the final liability cannot be specified until the actuarial valuation is carried out on vesting day.  As the Act must be passed before we can have vesting day, clearly it would not be possible to include a specific annual amount in the Bill.  There is also the added complication of the interest payments.  Clearly, specific arrangements would have to be made each year between the Department of Finance and the trustees of the pension fund about the Exchequer payment and the discharge of the outstanding interest. The arrangements will include such matters as the amount of principle and interest being paid over, the dates on which payments will be made and the rates of interest applicable.</P>
    <P>Given the seven year payment period included in the Bill and the number of variables involved, it would clearly be impractible to cover every possible permutation of circumstances in the Bill itself.  Conversely, the approach we have used in the Bill is practicable.  It sets a framework within which the trustees and the Minister for Finance can adequately discharge their respective responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I may have been mistaken, but I had the impression that Senator Howard felt that the Minister for Finance might or would make payments of principle only but defer paying interest until the seventh year.  That would be highly unusual, as, I am sure, the Senator would appreciate. It is most unlikely that the Minister for Finance would adopt such an approach. I have had discussions with the Minister for Finance; my colleagues in the Department and in ANSO have had discussions with the officials in the Department of Finance.  We are satisfied that there is a positive attitude on all sides and that <Col N="782" /> obligations will be discharged reasonably and fairly over a seven year period, thus putting into position a sound and solid superannuation fund and a pension trust to be administered by the trustees in the interests of the staff of the new Authority.</P>
    <P>As I have already made clear, the approach we have adopted is innovative. It is was not done in law before and, despite some misgivings that Senators may have, I am satisfied that the arrangements as set out in the Bill are a sound, practicable approach which will work to the satisfaction of all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that the Minister would expect me to find his response that satisfactory.  Throughout the progress of this Bill the Minister is getting good at his adjectives but not so good on detail.  His reply is full of words such as &ldquo;equitable&rdquo; and &ldquo;an equitable approach&rdquo;, which means pretty well nothing.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;mean little in terms of detail.  Throughout the progress of this Bill I have begun to admire the capacity of the Minister for obfuscation and for not answering questions.  It is something which has stood the Minister in good stead throughout the last few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this amendment the Minister has excelled himself.  It is totally unsatisfactory that we should be asked to give the Minister for Finance <i>carte blanche</i> of this sort.  The Minister said, in response to some of the points made by Senator Howard, that it would be highly unusual &mdash; a negative rather than a positive, but a negative to describe unlikely behaviour &mdash; rather than a positive to describe likely behaviour, if the Minister waited for the last day to make that payment.  Of course <Col N="783" /> it would be unusual, but that is exactly what we want to stop.  As the Minister quite rightly says in this case, which is a magnificent paradox in view of what he has said so often, this is a new piece of legislation establishing a new principle in which he has great confidence.  We have been reassured throughout the Bill that other clauses in other Bills have stood the test of time.  One cannot have it both ways.  I would put it the other way.  I believe that this clause is doubtful because we do not know whether it is going to work or not and the past clauses should perhaps be questioned because they have been there for so long.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of a positive attitude. The bottom line here is quite simple.  The Minister can pay the superannuation fund zero per cent at the end and nothing for seven years.  That is what we are entitling him to do in this Bill. The Minister assured us that there will be negotiations.  There will be no negotiations. One cannot negotiate if the power all rests on one side.  That is not negotiation; it is dictatorship.  Of course the Minister will meet with the trustees of the superannuation fund, but he will meet to tell them what he is going to pay them.  He will not meet to ask them because at the end of the day the Minister is going to decide, not the trustees.  We can have all these wonderful reassurances of reasonableness from the Minister on this issue.  I have no doubt that the Minister would be reasonable and would pay a current commercial rate or would pay a rate which would satisfy the superannuation fund.  This Minister would. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern would, as he is one of the most agreeable Ministers in the Government.  One of his problems is that he is being too agreeable in this Government.</P>

      <P>On my own behalf and on behalf of my Department, the staff of ANSO and the Minister, Deputy Cowen, I thank all Members of the House for their tremendous contributions.  I have the utmost confidence, respect and faith in the ability of Members of this House and my colleagues in Dáil Éireann to take a positive and flexible attitude to legislation.  We have a great responsibility and I think we discharge it well.  There are those outside of this House who decry it and some in political life have also done so, much to my amazement.  One great aspect of Seanad Éireann is that it gives an absolute transparency to the legislative effect proposed in the various Bills coming through.  I appreciate that as a member of the Government.</P>
      <P>I am grateful for the positive attitude taken and the interest shown by the Members of this House in all the legislation, and most particularly this Bill.

I enjoyed handling the Bill and I am grateful for the input of individual Senators and for their positive contributions.  I am also grateful for their attitude.

      <P>People realised that this Department would require a Minister of courage and vision and in Deputy M. Higgins they knew that they had such a Minister.  The repeal of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, which removed the cap on advertising from RTE, was of immense importance in restoring to RTE the scope to provide the revenues which, in effect, they had lost.  It also greatly distorted their market.  The appointments of people of the calibre of Leila Doolin and Niall Stokes have been heralded as new, exciting, brave and courageous.  If ever we need needed bravery and courage we need it now and the Minister is providing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government sets out clearly the priorities of this Government for Irish broadcasting. It set out to repeal the advertising cap on RTE, which I have already mentioned. This was to provide for improvements in the range and quality of the public service broadcasting system.  It also sought to breathe life into the independent <Col N="788" /> film production sector, where we hope to increase jobs and output in the audio-visual industry, giving companies a firm home base to enable them to compete internationally.  We wanted to ensure that commercial local radio stations remain viable.  We wanted to ensure that Irish advertisers had access to a strong Irish domestic television advertising medium.  While other channels, such as Sky and BBC, have been transmitted to the east coast for a considerable period, it was important for advertisers to have a strong Irish medium through which to reach those viewers who could not tune into these channels.</P>
    <P>It is satisfying to note that progress has been made.  The Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1993, lifted the advertising cap.  It also gave RTE clear instructions on budgeting for independent productions.  I am sure that the results of that decision in the amendment to the Broadcasting Act will be outlined by the Minister in the House this evening.</P>
    <P>Some £5 million is to be spent on programmes commissioned from the independent sector in 1994, increasing annually to £10 million in 1998.  After that year RTE will have to make 20 per cent of television expenditure available for this purpose, or £12.5 million, whichever is the greater.  This is to be welcomed because, certainly in the film sector, there was a great need to encourage those who had the courage to put up their own money and try to survive in a hostile environment, which Ireland then was.  As I said at the outset, when I was lauding the Minister &mdash; Senator Ross referred to this &mdash; at least we have someone who recognises that while this is the land of Beckett and Wilde, it is also that of U2 and Roddy Doyle.  That is the combination the Minister embodies and that sort of knowledge and vision makes the difference.  Who would have the nerve to substitute Niall Stokes for a judge?  You would not.</P>

      <P>The Senator would not have the guts to do it because people like my colleague, Senator Ross, proceed along long-established tram tracks. Senator Ross could not make courageous decisions in relation to such appointments. The Minister for the Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy M. Higgins, has the type of vision necessary to improve this Department for the people. The £12.5 million available after 1998 will boost the industry and will allow us to tap into the wealth of talent available in this country, not only in terms of films but also in terms of music, the arts and so on.  This is a welcome development.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was appointed he undertook to carry out a full review of many aspects of the communications area. This review resulted in the changes I outlined, but it is an ongoing process and no aspect can be looked at in isolation.</P>
      <P>In relation to section 31 and the illegal organisations, the Opposition has tabled an amendment to renew the statutory order banning television coverage for members of illegal organisations contained in section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, 1960.  This amendment is irresponsible at this time.  Given the climate which exists in this country and the momentum for peace, the inclusion of this amendment is, to say the least, unhelpful to the peace process at present. While the Labour Party has said that section 31 should be repealed, this fact is not contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  As a result the Labour Party has no right to impose its will.  Whatever decision will be made by this Government, it is unhelpful and irresponsible for Fine Gael to try to preempt an important decision by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of the Northern Ireland debate, we are not living in normal times. There is a particular mood in this country at present.  This was expressed by Senator Manning when he asked the Tanáiste to come into this House so that statements could be made on Northern Ireland. <Col N="790" /> Some people call this mood the window of opportunity for peace, something we all want.

      <P>Of course, and the Government is dealing with this.  There were plaudits today for the British Government for capturing the consignment of arms.  This Government has been extremely active, as have other Governments, in curtailing the activities of the IRA in this part of the country whenever possible.  This motion deals with the arts, culture, the Gaeltacht, films and broadcasting.  However, the amendment deals solely with section 31, although the Opposition knew the context in which it would be discussed at Government level.</P>
      <P>The move towards peace in Northern Ireland involves many factors and none of these should be dealt with in isolation. One cannot isolate anything in this process at present; everything must be in the pot.  People may say it should be removed or retained as an issue of principle. However, on this occasion it is necessary for everyone to take a step backwards. This attempt to embarrass us will not succeed.</P>

      <P>Section 31 was put in place in the mid-seventies at a time when there was a need for such legislation. During this time there were many atrocities, including Bloody Sunday and the bombings in Dublin, and the perpetrators had open access to the airwaves.  Section 31 was brought in to deal with this. People, including members of my party, had different views on this issue. However, it is public knowledge that the Minister is preparing an <i>aide memoire</i> for Cabinet and it is being discussed at that level.  A decision will be taken according to the circumstances which pertain at the time of the decision.</P>
      <P>Since taking office the Minister has shown great courage and clarity of thought.  The appointment of Mr. Niall Stokes as chairperson of the Independent Radio and Television Commission board and the board members indicates his understanding of the communications industry and the need to move the process forward.  People who have worked in the area are best equipped to guide it through the waters of ever changing technology and increasing competition. The demands of a sophisticated audience can only be met by experts.  Mr. Niall Stokes and other are experts in communications as they are involved in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of the separate television channel, Teilifís na Gaeilge, is welcomed by people who have been involved for many years in the promotion of the Irish language.  Those people who wish to preserve and extend the use of Irish throughout the country are entitled to this service.  However, it is an additional facility which we could use to create a service such as the Open University which was established by Mr. Harold Wilson in the late 1960s.  The Open University has proved its worth in Britain over the years.  It has opened the windows of opportunity for people from all walks <Col N="792" /> of life, not least those in prisons.  It is a waste to lock people away for 14 or 15 hours because of staff reductions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be, but that involves a dispute about the content of programmes which RTE makes.  I am talking about using the new Teilifís na Gaeilge channel.  There would be adequate time to cater for the people who wish to have programmes in the Irish language.  In the wider context it would be a welcome development to introduce second chance education, that is, the Open University channel.  It has been proven that this is one of the cheapest ways to reach a large audience, particularly those in prisons and those who want to avail of second chance education.</P>
      <P>This new channel should be aimed at children.  Children seem to forget the Irish they are alleged to have learned when they move from primary to secondary schools.  Those who learn more Irish in secondary school have forgotten it by the time they go to third level education because of lack of use.  There are few places in an urban society where one may learn Irish and there are few programmes one may watch.  Therefore, its use is restricted.  The establishment of this channel by the Minister will foster the language.  I am one of those who did not benefit from the system, because peeling potatoes on a ship at 15 years of age is not a good beginning.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day I respect the views of those who wish to have that sort of facility.  I applaud the Minister for having the courage to introduce it.  I urge him to consider the point I made in relation to the Open University element of that broadcasting system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I am pleased and delighted that somebody of the courage and vision of the Minister, Deputy M. <Col N="793" /> Higgins, heads this Department which is so important to us and our children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister to the House.  He is one of the people in the arts in this country who has an outstanding character.  He will be long remembered after he has left his present Department by the people interested in the arts and broadcasting in this country. However, we are lucky he is there at the moment.  I second Senator Magner's motion.  The development of telecommunications services in this country and worldwide has been phenomenal over the last number of years.  We must have certain controls over broadcasting and I have no doubt that the matter will be well looked after by the present Minister. Broadcasting and television today is a way of life.  When one looks at the present worldwide satellite services, it is important that controls exist to make sure that the proper type of information is broadcast.  The satellite services are there for profit.  One can have unpleasant and unsavoury programmes, but there can also be choice programmes such as those dealing with sport.  This country is sports mad and it is nice to have the satellite service to fill the gap that was there for a long number of years.</P>
      <P>For the first time we have had to sit down, look at the values of home life and consider what is being beamed into it. Unfortunately someone other than parents is getting the message through to our children.  Parents no longer make a big impression, but rather what is being sold on the screen.  Children are very much interested in television and broadcasting and we must be sure about what they are watching and listening to.  Some of the material being turned out by some of the satellite and foreign stations is frightening. Sometimes it amounts to an attack on our culture, and we must be on our guard in relation to what is shown.  I welcome the Minister's controls in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>International viewing is here to stay and there is little we can do about it.  We must not just think of those who are able to watch television, enjoy what they have <Col N="794" /> seen and carry on from there.  There are many others to think about, such as the elderly, people who are in hospitals and the disabled, who spend much time watching television.  It is important that Irish culture continues to be reflected and that something other than international material, in which people have absolutely no interest, is shown.  Irish television and radio is of the highest quality.  I prefer listening to the radio rather than watching television.  What we are getting at present is first class.  It is important that controls are there for the benefit of Irish viewers.</P>
    <P>The Irish film industry was mentioned. Given the success of films that were turned out in this country in recent years, such as &ldquo;My Left Foot&rdquo; and &ldquo;Into the West&rdquo;&mdash; fabulous films with a strong Irish background &mdash; it is important that money be given to this area.  This country will benefit dramatically through the input of people like the Minister.  The legislation in this area is probably 30 years old and needs to be upgraded.  It is very safe in the hands of the present Minister.</P>

      <P>After &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; to add the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;; and following his current review, calls on the Minister to ensure the renewal of the Broadcasting Act, 1960 (section 31) Order, 1992.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I heard Senator Magner's speech I had a very unhappy feeling of <i>dejà vu.</i> I felt that not only had the Minister possibly resigned but perhaps that there was a ghost in front of us.  I have never heard so many tributes paid in this House to a Minister so short a time in office.  While I share the Senator's admiration for the Minister, it is inappropriate to use the House for such personalised tributes.  I should have known that the Minister had not resigned.  Early on in his career as a Minister I thought he would resign and I was horrified when I heard that he had been allocated the bed of nails which was <Col N="795" /> section 31.  I felt that might be the end of his career, but the Minister ploughed through that and bravely decided that he would not resign as a result of having to implement Government policy on section 31.  Early this week I felt that perhaps the Minister would resign&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When the Minister was in Opposition his great babies were the interpretative centres.  His promotion of the fact that they were a hindrance and damaging the environment was destroyed by a junior Minister this week and I felt the Minister might resign. Unfortunately, he did not do so.  I understood why when I heard this morning that he had got his way with Teilifís na Gaeilge and that he would be able to go ahead with this scheme at an extraordinary cost to the taxpayer.  I completely accept his assurances that there will not be taxes on videos, but it will mean that there will be increased taxes for a station for which there is a very small minority demand.</P>
      <P>I wish to address the question of section 31 and the fact that it is coming up for renewal in a few weeks.  I resent and reject Senator Magner's statement that it is unhelpful to discuss it at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the business of Oppositions to be helpful to Governments. It is healthy that this should be discussed at this time, because exactly the process which Senator Magner so eloquently described as a peace process is also encouraging a very dangerous mood developing in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an acceptance of the terrorists and their apologists, who have been rightly kept off our screens for so long.  One <Col N="796" /> does not have to watch RTE to realise that there is a growing acceptance of people like Mr. McGuinness and Mr. Adams, and people on the Loyalist side also, in the media in this country.  It would be absolute folly for the Minister or this Government to encourage that acceptance by saying &ldquo;They are all right. We will repeal section 31.  We will let them on like everybody else&rdquo;.  They are not like everybody else and there is no point in pretending they are like everybody else.</P>
    <P>There is a debate opening in the media, which apparently is discouraged in this House, about putting these people on the air.  That is a very dangerous debate in the sense that there are many people saying they would be acceptable on the air.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that after every bad tragedy in Northern Ireland terrorism, for some perverse reason, becomes more acceptable in this country rather than less.  After Enniskillen they started talking to terrorists.  After Warrington Mr. Hume started talking to terrorists.  There was Greysteel last week and the Loyalist arms find this morning and they are still talking to terrorists.  For some amazing, perverse reason we are now talking about putting these people on the air when things are worse.  It is not as if things have calmed down.  There was the Shankill bombing and they are talking about putting terrorists on the air.  It is absolutely unacceptable.  The Minister's public agonising about this has not helped the situation because, whether he likes it or not, it gives genuine credibility to these people.  I accept the Minister's concern about this matter.  He is on record as being against the renewal of section 31. It is a pity someone in authority expresses such public reservations because it gives tremendous succour to terrorism and those who want to get on the airwaves.</P>
    <P>There are two schools of thought on this matter.  The first, the intellectual school of thought, wants to puts murderers and those responsible for Warrington and Enniskillen on the air.  They want to argue with these people to make them look stupid and answer for bombings <Col N="797" /> in Belfast and elsewhere.  That is a highly intellectual argument, put forward by those who are conceited about the strength of their argument; but they do not consider the power of others to use the media to promote themselves in a lethal way.  Television is as much about technique and cosmetic tricks as it is about content.  It is unrealistic for anyone to say these people can be made to look stupid on television.  These people will use television to recruit.  Even if they appear in restricted circumstances &mdash; for example, after tragedies and atrocities &mdash; they will successfully use it to recruit.</P>
    <P>There second school of thought is more dangerous.  There is a group of people would like to see these people on the air because they support what they are doing.  They use disingenuous arguments as to why they should be allowed on air. The interview of a terrorist would make exciting television, but it would be irresponsible. This is what the &ldquo;freedom of speech for Mr. Adams' brigade&rdquo; wants and that is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I want to achieve a balance in this regard.  As the Minister knows, section 31 is fairly balanced.  It outlaws the IPLO, the IRA, Sinn Féin, the UDA and all &mdash; I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; prescribed organisations in Northern Ireland.  Presumably, it outlaws the UFF, the UVF and all Loyalist paramilitary organisations from the airways and that is correct.  The one thing these people have in common is they all advocate violence, murder, bombing, kneecapping and other unacceptable activities. That is the bottom line.  I have no quarrel with those who want to put Sinn Féin on the air when they renounce violence, but we must be sure they do so. We cannot put them on the air when they have the ballot box in one hand and the armalite in the other.</P>
    <P>I expect the Minister to say he received a submission from RTE and to suggest other ways of dealing with this matter. RTE could be left to implement the policy of not putting terrorists on the air. It could be left in an invidious position because it would have to make unacceptable decisions and there would be a <Col N="798" /> row each time one of these individuals went on air.  Violence is the bottom line. Freedom of speech is not an absolute right and I am sure the Minister would accept that.  The Minister's party supported the Incitement to Hatred Bill when it was put through this House.  It was rightly supported because there are standards in society for which we must make sacrifices.  We must sacrifice freedom of speech in order to protect ourselves against evil, and the Incitement to Hatred Bill is an example of this.  This order curbs incitement to violence and crime.  I congratulate the Minister for implementing it and I hope he will do so on 19 January.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I welcome the Minister to the House and on behalf of Fine Gael Members I support Senator Magner's expression of thanks and appreciation. No Member of either House has been as committed to arts, culture and the Gaeltacht as the Minister and he has our support in this regard.  His involvement in this area is well know and acknowledged.</P>
      <P>Regarding the arts, culture and broadcasting, I hope the Minister will improve the lot of those involved in these areas.  I hope he will accept the amendment put down by Fine Gael.  In this season of self-congratulations by the Labour Party, we would be happy to join in if the Minister accepts our amendment and gives a commitment to renew section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross asked who are the people who want to abolish section 31.  As Senator Magner said, the people and organisations included in section 31 are responsible for the Dublin and other bombings over the years.  Terrorism is terrorism whether it is in Dublin, Enniskillen or the Shankill Road.  Some of the individuals who certain people would like on the airways carried coffins after the Shankill Road bombing despite talks which had taken place.  Whatever happens as a result of further talks, we urge restraint in the days to come.  We hope a system will emerge which will bring peace and a solution to this problem.  However, <Col N="799" /> I urge a note of caution in relation to media hype about these matters.  We in Fine Gael will not hinder or politicise any aspect of this.</P>
    <P>Section 31 applies to the self-styled individual who would benefit from the removal of censorship, but this person would have difficulty explaining mistakes or and how he or she &ldquo;censored&rdquo; the right of a murdered victim to live.</P>
    <P>It is important for the Minister not to pussyfoot around with this.  He was quoted some weeks ago as saying that it would not be a resigning issue for him. He may have his own personal ideas on the issue, and I know he has always been against certain forms of censorship; but I think he has a duty as a Minister and in relation to his Cabinet colleagues.  Of course, it should not be a resigning issue for the Minister.  But it is important that in the weeks ahead he ensures that the ban remains in place.  I am sure that will have the full support of all Members of this House, including the Minister's own party colleagues.</P>
    <P>When discussing section 31 it is important that we do not allow certain people to sway our judgment.  I saw the &ldquo;mass rally&rdquo; in Molesworth Street just before lunch and all eight or ten people there wanted section 31 abolished.  It is important to look at this seriously, to look at the consequences and realise why it has been there for many years, going back to when the Minister's former colleague, Dr. Cruise O'Brien, reintroduced it in 1976.  I would hope that the House would not divide on the issue and that the Government will accept the motion as amended.</P>
    <P>We obviously support the various developments in relation to arts and culture. I, for one, question the recent announcement of an Irish language TV channel.  The Minister has not yet fully explained how it is going to be paid for. Will the licence fee go up?  Will there be a further charge on video rentals?  People are already being charged quite a lot for the licence, Cablelink, etc.</P>
    <P>In the light of the awards made to John Rocha, the Minister should be looking at <Col N="800" /> the situation in RTE where, after Christmas, a very topical programme like <i>Head to Toe</i> is being axed.  As Senator Maloney said, there are many good people in RTE producing various programmes; some of these people are second to none.  We have seen tremendous sports programmes and, hopefully, the World Cup coverage from America next year will be great.  While I wish the Minister well in what he is planning to do, I would ask him to tell some of the RTE people in cosy jobs to examine where improvements can be made, and to ensure that extra Irish programmes are made.  That is where I would like to see the £17 million going.  Our priority should be to give people a wider choice of channels than the currently restricted choice.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by reverting briefly to the amendment moved by Members on this side of the House.  I would ask the Minister not to pussyfoot around.  I am sure he is brave enough to make the decision and stand over it.  It is not a resigning matter; it is something which the Minister has supported in the past.  I think the Minister sees the need for it still and recognises why it is there.  A message needs to be sent out from this House that the people who say violence can perhaps be stopped can stop it if they want to.  We should not have to pull and drag them; it is up to them to renounce violence and then they can come on the airwaves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and support the motion, which states:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the measures which the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has introduced to strengthen the film and broadcasting sectors in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister has only been in office for a short time.  I said on his first visit as Minister to the Seanad that he was a man who had the right attitude.  He has vast experience in the world of publishing and I knew we would make a lot progress with him in charge of that portfolio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> I also welcome the repeal of section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, which, Members will recall, removed the advertising cap from RTE.  This was a significant move and took place within a short time of the Minister taking office.  I also welcome the significant increase in commissions from RTE to the independent film production sector.  This amounts to £5 million in the first year, rising to £12.5 million in the fifty year. That is a magnificent gesture to start an industry that has massive job potential, not just through films but also through their role in promoting a new and extended tourist industry, which the country is ripe for.  The potential that exists in this private sector is enormous.</P>
    <P>As we are all aware, RTE has undertaken to advertise and examine what future programming opportunities exist in the private sector.  They had over 200 applications for an experienced broadcaster and I welcome the fact that Claire Duignan has been appointed to the position. One can see the enormous job potential and wealth of talent that exists among those 200 applications.  The Minister should consider extending this scheme to the music video sector, where costs are very high.  The eight to 18 year olds have already formed their attitudes and tastes.  We are living in the age of video promotion for songs and books.  In view of this, future legislation should be amended to include this sector, which every month creates a new fashion and a new product in the marketplace.  There are real jobs in the creation of music videos.  This has been proved in America and is now being proved across Europe.</P>
    <P>The reactivation of the Irish Film Board is a welcome move which should provide a boost to the local film industry, particulary in development and production funding.  Everyone involved needs expertise to guide the industry in the right direction.  I hope this idea could be extended to a music council where the opportunity for employment is tenfold and a whole new growth industry is available to young people.  The great thing about the film and music industries is that they attract young people, school-leavers <Col N="802" /> with magnificent ideas and small budgets. For instance, we have seen the <i>Crying Game</i> filmed on a small budget, yet receiving international acclaim.  The quality and talent per head of population here makes us the envy of many nations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendments to section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987, which should ensure a favourable climate for tax-based investment in Irish films, with consequential benefits for the economy and job creation.  The expansion of Ireland's involvement in the European film industry through our membership of Eurimages is welcome.  We are highly thought of because of the successes, though few, we have had in the last three or four years.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the expansion of Ireland's involvement in the European film industry, particularly through the membership of Eurimages.  We are very highly thought of because of our few successes in the last three or four years. How many people have seen the great receptions given to Irish talent at the film festival in Cannes?  Film makers throughout the world have shown enormous warmth towards our expertise.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to consider the following issues to further enhance his programme. A training plan should be prepared for the provision of skills needed to enhance the infrastructure of the Irish production sector but these skills cannot be provided without training. There is an enormous opportunity for hundreds of young people to be trained year after year in preparation for an industry which will definitely expand.  An example is the achievements of the Australians over a short period.  They have come from practically nowhere to be one of the top five states in the film industry. The same opportunity exists for us in Ireland.  I know the Minister shares this outlook and I look forward to a programme to expand the industry and develop skills.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to consider the collection of economic data to ensure maximum benefits to the Irish economy. Plans should be prepared to market Ireland as a film production centre.  We <Col N="803" /> have only to look back over the years at the world's greatest producers, such as John Ford, who chose Ireland as a location, even though there was very little cultivation on our part of Ireland as such a location.  As previous speakers have said, we are now in the world of the satellite.  We see live everything that happens in the world.  There are greater opportunities today in this industry than ever before.</P>
    <P>I welcome the appointment of Niall Stokes as chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  He has been involved in the music industry at many levels.  He has a vast knowledge which will help him in the responsibility given to him by the Minister.  He has a knowledge of the entire music industry. He knows the pitfalls.  Everybody knows the pluses and kudos but I respect a person who has struggled and worked hard to keep his profession going.  He can now lend his experience to legislation.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the creation by him of an alternative radio station for Dublin, which has the biggest listenership.  Legislation was enacted to provide alternative radio but we have never had such a radio station in Dublin.  The existing stations &mdash; 98 FM, FM 104 and Radio 2 &mdash; provide wall to wall pop music and compete with each other.  Radio 1 broadcasts chat shows from 8 a.m., with the exception of one programme in the afternoon, until 8 p.m.</P>

I ask the Minister to consider an alternative radio station for Dublin.  No such station was provided.  Perhaps Mr. Stokes and his commission would be asked to provide one.

      <P>Ní haon saineolaí mise ar chúrsaí craolacháin ach ceapaim gur cóir tréaslú leis an Aire ar an sár-obair atá déanta aige ar son Teilifís na Gaeilge. Obair fíor-thábhachtach atá idir lámha aige agus tá súil agam go bhféachfar siar amach anseo ar an mbeartas ar Theilifís na Gaeilge mar an beartas is éifeachtaí a thug Rialtas ar bith i bhfeidhm i leith na teanga ó bunaíodh an Stát.</P>
      <P>Dá bhrí sin, déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire agus tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go geal le gach a bhfuil beartaithe aige i gcúrsaí craolacháin a chur i gcrích.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom cur leis na focail atá ráite ag an Seanadóir Lee, mo chomh-oibrí atá in aice liom anseo. Tréaslaim leis an Aire as an sár-obair atá déanta aige go dtí seo san job atá aige. Fáiltím roimhe chuig an Seanad, mar ní raibh mé ag caint leis sa Teach seo cheana.</P>
      <P>Tá dhá bhliain imithe ó luaigh mé don Seanad na deacrachtaí a bhain le bunú Theilefís na Gaeilge.  Ag an am sin bhí argóintí agam leis an Aire mar go raibh geallúint tugtha do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus do mhuintir na tíre go gcuirfí £500,000 ar a laghad, agus níos déanaí ná sin, £5 mhilliún, in áirithe chun an tseirbhís a bhunú.  I gcónaí bhí an tAire i bhfábhar an mholta sin agus anois, nuair atá sé tagaithe isteach sa job, tá áthas orm go bhfuil an méid déanta aige agus atá.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Le déanaí bhí mé i rang scoile i nGaeltacht Chonamara do naíonáin a bhí díreach cláraithe inti.  Ní raibh ach ceithre no cúig bliana sáraithe acu.  Bhí an scoil seo i gceartlár na Gaeltachta ach is é an deacracht a bhí ag na múinteoirí ná nach <Col N="805" /> raibh focal Gaeilge ag na leanaí agus iad ag tosnú ar scoil.  Bhí fonn orthu bheith ag breathnú ar an teilifís ach ní raibh ach teilifís Béarla acu sa bhaile, agus mar sin ní raibh an tacaíocht ann don Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Má táimid i ndáiríre i leith cúrsaí Gaeilge, caithfimid an tacaíocht sin a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus dóibh siúd i dteaghlaigh tríd an tír go bhfuil fonn orthu dul chun cinn a fheiceáil in athbheochan na Gaeilge nó fiú amháin go dtabharfaí an Ghaeilge ar ais mar theanga labhartha nó go mbeadh taithí ag daoine óga ar an nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá an-job déanta ag an Aire, and I congratulate him on that.  I also welcome the progress made in the film industry.  I am not <i>au fait</i> with the arrangements being made under the Finance Act to encourage investment in this area.  The Minister has brought a sense of openness and progress to the film industry.  I recently saw an RTE programme on the advancement of this industry.  A commercial opportunity exists which the Minister recognises.  I encourage him to go forward with his plans to strengthen the film element of the broadcasting sector.</P>
    <P>I wish to focus on the amendment to the motion calling on the Minister to ensure the renewal of the broadcasting Act, 1960 (Section 31) Order, 1992.  We are all aware of the difficulties the Minister has in dealing with this and I do not envy him.  I will not take the virginal approach that everybody but myself is wrong on this issue.  I am opposed to the renewal of the order under section 31 and, therefore, oppose the amendment. However, I do not take from the value of the arguments put forward by people who take the opposite view.  There is no self-righteous approach to this.  Nobody is completely right or wrong.  The arguments balance.  I must confess that I have vacillated on many occasions as to whether opening up the airwaves will be effective.  However, I have come to the conclusion that the strengthening of other legislation, such as legislation on incitement to hatred and so on, allows checks to be put on people who are <Col N="806" /> speaking publicly or through the media.</P>
    <P>My objection to section 31, and what finally convinced me to oppose it and encourage the Minister not to renew the order, is that it is a blunt instrument to deal with a complicated, sophisticated and complex situation.  I do not think it is effective.  It distracts the focus of discussion in the wrong direction.  The strengthening of other legislation and other restraints which are put on people are far more important than simply a blanket renewal of the ban on members of Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>I am trying to avoid the old clichéd arguments of what an enlightened community we are, how we do not need to be told how to make up our minds and how we can listen to and balance arguments and come to the right conclusions. I could go through many of those arguments but there would be a doubt in the back of my mind about whether I really believed what I was saying.  Too often, I have seen a demagogue sway an audience with fine words and emotional arguments.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I believe we need to address this issue, is that there is a huge level of ignorance about the North in the South.  People do not know what is happening in workplaces, on the ground and in communities.  People were shocked last week when they saw the palpable hatred coming from Windsor Park.  The members of my organisation in the North say that this is there all the time on both sides.  There is a lack of understanding of other points of view and positions which is encouraged and grows stronger in a culture where the answer is total censorship.</P>
    <P>I have made this point before.  I suspect that perhaps I have a different view to the Minister on this.  I do not oppose censorship.  I tried to have this argument here on various occasions and I have opposed, for example, Senator Cassidy's views on various satellite television programmes and have differed with the Minister on the elements of censorship. I believe that a democracy has the right <Col N="807" /> to protect and defend itself against, for example, pornography.  Similarly, incitement to hatred is not acceptable in a democracy.  People who encourage racism, xenophobia or hatred should not be given a platform in a democracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Or violence.  I would support legislation which would restrain and criminalise people who took such courses of action on the airwaves or elsewhere.  I am not talking about giving people <i>carte blanche</i>.  From what I believe and know about section 31 it is a blunt instrument. Taking these people completely off the airwaves does not do what we set out to do.  I would like to have some of these people in the glare of publicity to deal with these issues.  I would say to the Minister that it is not an easy decision to make, and whatever decision he makes, there will be criticism.  This is a no win situation.  The Minister will incur contempt if he does and abuse if he does not &mdash; he cannot win.  That is not the way the decision should be made.</P>
      <P>I appeal to people on both sides of the argument not be self-righteous about this.  People have strongly held views, to which they are entitled.  A decision must be made.  I am saying that we need a more refined instrument than section 31 in order to remove from the airwaves incitement to hatred, violence, &mdash; as Senator Belton said &mdash; racism and xenophobia. For example, there are growing signs of neo-fascism in all parts of Europe at present which is just as worrying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to look at this in a sophisticated way and I trust the Minister to come forward with a proposal which will deal with the issue in a precise and focused way, rather than the blunt instrument of section 31 which does not have a place in a democratic process.  It denies the right to speak rather than simply keeping one particular group off the airwaves and makes martyrs of them.  I urge the Minister not to renew section 31 but I also urge him to replace it with more precise legislation which will ensure that <Col N="808" /> people may not incite to hatred, violence, racism or cultivate such an aura.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we are having a debate on arts, culture and the Gaeltacht because have taken part in various debates here in relation to enterprise and employment, where we talked about the importance in job creation of building on our strengths.  Our creativity and what has been achieved in the arts by Irish people throughout the centuries is probably our greatest strength.  If one was to ask somebody from any country with what they would associate Ireland, they would probably first say our writers.</P>
      <P>Film is the most modern method of cultural communication and is what we are discussing this evening.  However, we are as capable of being successful in the area of film as we have been over the centuries in the written arts.  This debate is important in the context of employment and how the arts can contribute to job creation and the development of the image of Ireland generally.  I would like to focus on that angle.</P>
      <P>However, before doing so, I wish to speak about the amendment proposed by Senator Ross.  I share the view expressed by Senator O'Toole that it is a difficult area and there are strongly held views on either side of the debate.  I am not going to come down on either side this evening because the Minister is reviewing the whole area and I trust his judgment to make a decision on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross said that there was greater acceptance of terrorists after atrocities.  I think I am quoting him correctly because I wrote it down when he said it.  I thought it was a most extraordinary statement.  There is not greater acceptance of terrorists after atrocities, in fact, the opposite is the case.  The peace movement, which is so strong at present in the North and South, was strengthened following the recent atrocities in the North.  The situation is the opposite to what Senator Ross said &mdash; terrorists are being rejected following the recent atrocities. I will be speaking again tomorrow on the debate on Northern Ireland so I <Col N="809" /> will not expand on this point now, but I think his statement was totally out of order and out of touch with reality.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to section 31, the Minister is reviewing the situation at present.  Senator Magner was right in saying that it is not helpful to ask us to vote on it until that review is completed and the various views and the fluctuating and changing situation have been taken into account.  It is a knife-edge situation at the moment.</P>
      <P>I would like to concentrate my remarks on the film aspect of the motion.  Senator Cassidy already referred to this and particularly the re-establishment of the film board and its funding which is most important.  As I said, there is great potential for job creation in this area.  There is also potential for training &mdash; also mentioned by Senator Cassidy.  I understand that there is a possibility of EC funding for training in the area of film.</P>
      <P>There are many technological as well as creative aspects to film.  We already have a record in many of those areas. Irish people have worked in Hollywood and other places and won awards for costumes, lighting and the other technological areas of film making.  There are not just jobs for directors and actors. There are also jobs for people in areas in which we already have a certain amount of expertise but which could be developed further through training schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned writers at the start.  We obviously have an edge in the field of creativity.  We have shown it in many areas in the past and have begun to show it in film recently.  The success of Irish people in the area of film &mdash; actors, directors and technical people &mdash; is extraordinary, considering that it is such a new industry in Ireland and which attracted little financial investment in the past.  The <Col N="810" /> injection of funding will create huge potential in that area.</P>
    <P>The visual media generally is becoming very popular.  One has only to watch one's children playing computer games with video screens to see that young people are tuned into the mixture of the visual and the verbal and this is the area in which film works.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy referred to the international links and mentioned Eurimages. There is also a body called Eureka Audiovisual and other bodies with which it is important that we be connected.  The possibility of co-productions with organisations in other countries has much potential.  It does not necessarily have to be in the fictional area of film making. There is much potential for development in educational film making and documentaries. It is important that distribution be examined.  There is a network of film distribution around the world and if one is not in this network or if the films made in this country by Irish directors are not linked to the distribution system, one does not get the necessary exposure.</P>
    <P>Hollywood has dominated the film industry but there is also a strong European &mdash; both eastern and western European &mdash; film making community.  It is important that we play our part in that because countries such as France, Sweden and some eastern European countries have dominated.  We have the potential to be one of the major players in that area.  It is important that Europe counteracts the dominance of the American view of life and that the European perspective is given.  The Irish film industry has a strong role to play there.</P>
    <P>I noted that the work of the Film Board will be reassessed at various stages.  The Minister mentioned this would be done after two years and again after five years. When discussing other legislation I have stressed the importance of reassessment Regardless of what we are setting up, we need to monitor it and ensure that it is doing the job it was set up to do.  I welcome the fact that the work of the Film Board will be reassessed on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="811" /> I welcome the setting up of Teilifís na Gaeilge, which was recently announced. The increase in the number of gael-scoileanna is one of the main reasons I welcome it.  The gael-scoileanna have been very successful throughout the country and there is much demand for places in them.  It indicates a concern on behalf of Irish parents to nourish the language in a way children will enjoy and from which they will benefit in contrast to the system many of us experienced where we saw Irish in school as a chore and something which was not of great interest.</P>
    <P>This will introduce children to Irish at an early age in a way that is user friendly and which encourages children to be interested.  It will result in a future generation who will genuinely tune into Teilifís na Gaeilge as a medium that is natural to them.  One can see it in Welsh media and in the Breton system where they have a number of Breton total immersion schools.  The Irish language is as much a national treasure as other matters.  If we are going to maintain it we have to do it in a way that is effective, and I think Teilifís na Gaeilge will be effective.</P>
    <P>I support the motion from my party and stress again that there is much potential for job creation particularly in the area of film but also in television.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and I welcome the Minister.  There is no doubt but that the Minister has brought a fresh approach to the area of arts, culture and the Gaeltacht. He has contributed to this area in a private capacity and much was expected of him when he became Minister.  Thus far he has been seen to use his influence in the area of funding, his imagination in finding new approaches and his experience in developing the area.  This motion could to a certain extent be premature backslapping, but on the other hand one could see it as an encouragement to the Minister to continue on the road he has chosen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> Local radio has highlighted aspects of rural life which previously were not brought to the attention of households and individuals in rural areas.  A vast amount of knowledge, information and news comes through the medium of local radio.  We could not expect national radio to deal with matters relating to each region.  Shannonside-Northern Sound has done a fantastic job in broadcasting all forms of entertainment.  Elderly people now have an opportunity to listen to items of local interest which were never broadcast on the airwaves in the past.</P>
    <P>I realise that some local radio stations have fallen by the wayside, but those which have survived are strong, vibrant and enthusiastic in developing the medium of local radio.  I ask the Minister in the future to give the necessary encouragement to local radio to develop, strengthen and broaden in all aspects of broadcasting.  I have no doubt that local radio with national support can develop in the area of arts and culture which we are discussing tonight.  Local radio can develop in that area by broadcasting programmes related to such matters.  It is essential that local radio be encouraged and given extra funding to enable it to develop.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposed amendment, the Minister's feelings in the past on this issue are well known.  People do not fully understand what section 31 means.  They hear about section 31 and it is often seen or believed to be something different to what it is.  It is no harm to analyse and evaluate why this measure was taken at the time.  I am somewhat disappointed to hear Senator O'Toole, who represents the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, say that section 31 should not be retained.  I wither to think of the educational approaches we have.</P>
    <P>Section 31 is there to prevent access to the airwaves to people who do not have the interest or faith to pursue their ideas through the democratic system.  We believe in democracy and the development of democracy.  The cornerstone of any democracy is how that democracy <Col N="813" /> allows its airwaves to be used.  Let us face the fact that in any form of oppression, invasion or reign of terror the first item to be seized is control of the airwaves. This democracy, elected by the people, uses the airwaves for the common good and that is the issue that any Government and Minister must face.</P>
    <P>It may be trendy to support the abolition of section 31.  Perhaps, as the last speaker said, it is a deeply held conviction on the part of some people.  I do not quibble with their ideas but we are talking about the common good, democracy and the retention of that democracy.  That is why we are here.  It is why we have the opportunity to speak in this assembly. We believe in democracy and we must honour the democratic system that gives us the opportunity of free speech.  We believe in democracy and we do not believe in violence and its ways.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish the Minister well. I have known him for a number of years. Perhaps this support tonight may be a little premature or perhaps it will give him encouragement.  I hope he continues to work on the areas he is currently developing.</P>

I also congratulate him on his announcement regarding Teilifís na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The film and broadcasting industries have huge potential for both direct and indirect job creation.  The Irish film industry has gained a widespread reputation abroad and I would like to see this developed further.  The members of the film industry have called for further funding because of the lack of technical facilities in this country.  Some film companies have recently had to do some of their filming abroad because we did not have <Col N="814" /> the technical facilities.  I would be grateful if the Minister, who is favourably inclined in this regard, would increase funding to that area.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that I do not have much time to speak on this issue.  With regard to section 31, the Progressive Democrats are of the view that so long as Sinn Féin uses violence as a means of political change, we as a democratic society are entitled to operate sanctions against its members appearing on the radio and television services.  It is a deliberate policy of censorship and exclusion to indicate our rejection of them.  They have an opportunity to renounce violence and to join the democratic process.  The Government has outlined this in relation to the talks on Northern Ireland and the same policy should be pursued in relation to section 31: that it should not be repealed until they lay down their arms.  Then they will have the opportunity to be on our airwaves.</P>

      <P>I also thank the Senators who welcomed me to this House for their kind remarks.

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the matters which are embodied in this motion, beidh a fhios ag na Seanadóirí go bhfuilimid ar tí céim mhór thábhachtach a ghlacadh maidir le <Col N="815" /> cúrsaí craolacháin agus an Ghaeilge. Táim ag caint, dar ndóigh, ar dhearbhú an Rialtais maidir le bunú Theilifís na Gaeilge ar chainéal ar leith.  Seo comhlíonadh ar dhearbhú tábhachtach atá sa gClár Rialtais Comhpháirtíochta maidir le Teilifís na Gaeilge á bheith á bunú mar thríú cainéal.  Tá bunú an chainéil nua ar an mbeartas is tábhachtaí a rinne aon Rialtas ar son na Gaeilge, b'fhéidir, ó bunaíodh Radió na Gaeltachta bliain is fiche ó shin.</P>
    <P>Léiríonn sé go soiléir go bhfuil an Rialtas seo, agus mé féin ach go háirithe, chun deimhin a dhéanamh de go gcothaítear agus go neartaítear an Ghaeilge mar theanga bheo.  Beidh ar chumas tuismitheoirí a thaispeáint dá bpáistí gur rud beo, bríomhar, nua-aoiseach í an Ghaeilge and gur cuid dá saol laethúil í freisin.  Tar éis an tsaoil caithfimid a admháil go bhfuil tionchar an-mhór ag meán na teilifíse ar ár saol agus ar ár n-iompar.  Cé gur féidir leis cur isteach orainn ar go leor bealaí tá an deis againn anois leas a bhaint as an meán an-chumhachtach seo chun ár gcultúr agus ár n-oidhreacht féin a shaibhriú agus láimh a bheith againn in ár gcinniúint féin mar phobal.</P>
    <P>Stáisiún ar leith a bheidh ann nach bhfuil a leithéid ar fáil cheana.  Stáisiún náisiúnta a bheidh ann do phobal na Gaeilge ar fad, sa Ghaeltacht agus sa Ghalltacht, do chainteoirí líofa agus dóibh sin atá ag iarraidh a gcuid Gaeilge a fheabhsú.  Ach beidh a cheanncheathrú i nGaeltacht Chonamara, rud a léiríonn an tábhacht a thugann an Rialtas seo don dílárnú agus don fhorbairt réigiúnach. Tá sé i gceist go mbeadh an stáisiún ag craoladh ar feadh trí uair a chloig sa ló ar dtús agus iarrfar ar RTE tuairim uair a chloig sa ló den méid sin a sholáthar.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfaí cuid den soláthar cláracha seo a chur ar fáil trí chláracha Gaeilge atá á gcraoladh faoi láthair ar chainéil RTE a chur ar an mbealach nua.  Ach beidh cláracha breise ó RTE i gceist chomh maith.  In aon chás níl sé i gceist go laghdódh na socruithe seo an fhreagracht atá ar RTE maidir le soláthar sásúil cláracha Gaeilge ar a chuid cainéil teilifíse féin.  Níor laghdaigh bunú Raidió na <Col N="816" /> Gaeltachta an fhreagracht seo i gcás Ghaeilge ar Raidió Éireann agus sé an cás céanna anseo é.</P>
    <P>Tiocfaidh formhór na gcláracha don chainéal nua ó léiritheoirí neamhspleácha agus tá dóchas agam go gcruthóidh an borradh nua san earnáil seo ar a laghad 250 post nua.</P>
    <P>The transmitter and link infrastructure for the new service which will be built to the highest broadcast standards will be constructed on a phased basis over a three year period.  Phase one of the construction will be designed to provide coverage to 60 per cent of the population and in all the Gaeltacht areas.  I regard it as important that the service should be available to a significant proportion of the population from the outset in recognition that the service is indeed a national one. The first phase of the construction process will take at least 15 months to achieve and one must bear in mind that this forecast assumes that, for example, the weather on the exposed transmitter sites will be kind to us.  The new headquarters from which programming will originate will also have to be constructed.</P>
    <P>In the pre-transmission phase, there will be much more than construction activity.  It will be necessary to put in place the organisation structure for the new channel so that staff can be recruited, the ethos and character of the station developed and, most importantly, so that programming can be commissioned. Senators will appreciate that one cannot launch a television service without a stockpile of programmes.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government, the capital cost of establishing the station will be met from the excess cap money earned by RTE.  The running costs will be met from Exchequer sources.  Contrary to recent newspaper speculation, an increase in the television licence fee is not being contemplated at present.  I have seen reports in newspapers that are close to some Senators here that a licence fee increase of £20 or £10 would be introduced to fund Teilifís na Gaeilge.  I want to make it clear to the House that no such increases are contemplated <Col N="817" /> for the funding of the new service.</P>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government gave the following commitments in the general areas of broadcasting and film:</P>
    <P>Our policy will be to ensure that Irish TV and Radio Programming is of the highest quality and that it remains the preferred choice of a majority of Irish viewers by:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Repeal of the &ldquo;cap&rdquo; contained in the 1990 Broadcasting Act, thus enabling RTE to improve the range and quality of the public service broadcasting that it can offer to the Irish public;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Provision for access to broadcasting for the independent sector, thus enabling them to increase output and jobs in the audio-visual industry and giving them a firm home base to enable them to compete internationally;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Measures to ensure that commercial local radio broadcasting remains viable;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Ensuring that Irish advertisers have access, at a reasonable cost, to a strong domestic TV advertising medium.</P>
    <P>With regard to the film sector, the programme recognised the importance of the film industry in Ireland both in terms of its immediate employment potential and also its enormous downstream benefits for the arts in general, to which many Senators have referred.  Specific proposals were written into the programme to provide a coherent approach to the development of the industry.  These included: a White Paper on the Film Industry to identify the areas of greatest potential and the support measures needed; consideration of the reintroduction of the Film Board; consideration of increasing and extending existing tax incentives for the film industry; and creation of a new regulatory framework for broadcasting, which will include opportunities for the independent <Col N="818" /> production sector to feed into the national station.</P>
    <P>These commitments, given less than a year ago, have formed the basis of my programme during the first year of my Ministry and I can report to Senators that all targets have been met on schedule. Indeed, such was the urgency of the task I faced that, drawing on the comprehensive recommendations of the Special Working Group on Film, I reactivated the Irish Film Board without recourse to the intermediate stage of publishing a White Paper.  The needs of this industry were then and are now well known and with initiatives such as those I have mentioned, I intend to ensure that it receives the resources and support it deserves.</P>
    <P>The main initiative I have taken has been the re-establishment of the Irish Film Board which will primarily focus on the all important area of the provision of development or &ldquo;seed&rdquo; money for film projects.  This has been underpinned by the amendment, with the full co-operation of the Minister for Finance, of the tax regime as it applies to the industry, involving a substantial raising of the limits for section 35 relief, the extension of section 35 relief to individuals and the waiving of the 75 per cent Irish production test in the case of co-productions where at least 10 per cent of the production work is carried out in the State.</P>
    <P>Of course no initiative is of value unless it is backed by adequate funding and to this end I succeeded in having a Supplementary Estimate for the Irish Film Board passed, making £1.145 million available to the board in 1993.  In addition, I will shortly be bringing before the Oireachtas an amendment to the Irish Film Board Act, 1990, which will increase the aggregate amount which I, as Minister, can advance to the board from £4.1 million to £15 million.</P>
    <P>While I am, of course, anxious that the measures which I have taken will be for the benefit of those industry practitioners who have operated under very difficult conditions for many years, I am equally anxious that the measures will also benefit the many talented and committed <Col N="819" /> men and women who are graduating from our dedicated educational institutions each year.  These initiatives must serve to bring along a new generation of film and television practitioners who will produce projects of quality and of interest to the cinema going and television viewing public, both at home and abroad.  I intend to function as a catalyst for ensuring the emergence of this new generation.</P>
    <P>I have concentrated my remarks so far on the four main policy initiatives which I have taken and which represented the main recommendations in the report of the Special Working Group on the Film Production Industry.  But the report contains other recommendations which I will be addressing.  For example, I have approached the responsible Ministers and established a formal high level committee comprising all the State-sponsored bodies which serve the industry.  I see this committee as being essential in putting structures in place which will ensure an appropriate response from these agencies, particularly our training agency, as economic activity in the industry picks up and develops.  I would also see this committee having the function of promoting our country more aggressively as a location for film making.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation I am implementing refers to the payment of Ireland's international contributions in relation to film.  These international obligations include Eurimages, the EC Media Desk and Eureka Audiovisual, but may also involve contributions to a proposed English Language Cinema Plan.  The Supplementary Estimate which I have obtained for the Irish Film Board this year includes a provision for Ireland's contribution to Eurimages and Eureka Audiovisual.  In a demonstration of co-operation between key State agencies, RTE pays part of Ireland's contribution to Eurimages.  Apart from this, the board will be taking on all such international commitments for the future.</P>
    <P>Among other recommendations of the report which I hope to address in the future are the question of co-production agreements with countries such as Australia. <Col N="820" /> France and Germany, and the question of the development of further flexibility within the industry itself which would require the approval of both sides of the industry.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons the report of the Special Working Group on the Film Production Industry was and is of such value is that it represents the outcome of a healthy partnership between industry practitioners on the one hand and the State and semi-State sectors on the other. I believe it is crucial that this partnership be continued if the economic and social objectives which have informed my policy initiatives in relation to the industry are to be achieved.  I also wish to underline the fact that the Special Working Group on the Film Production Industry identified significant economic benefits and employment potential for and from the Irish film industry.</P>
    <P>In particular a report undertaken by Coopers and Lybrand revealed that there are upwards of 1,000 people permanently employed in this industry, not including the approximately 670 unionised free lance workers or the 1,400 actors, actresses and extras in the State not the employees of RTE.</P>
    <P>An indicator in this report suggested that for every £1 million spent on film and television production, some 50 fulltime job equivalents are created for one year if one is speaking of documentaries, 48 if one speaks of features.  The existence of so-called seed money injection is of vital importance to ensure the success of the industry.  The injection of, say, £13 million by the Irish Film Board representing, let us be conservative, approximately 15 per cent funding of film projects &mdash; more usually it is closer to 10 per cent &mdash; could generate over £86 million of film production activity or 4,300 jobs.  Such positive and tangible benefits will be developed to the full.  I am confident that such benefits will flow from the initiatives built into the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, where RTE will be actively seeking out new independent projects to benefit from a fund dedicated for such purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> I need to repeat what I said at the first meeting of the new Irish Film Board.  I contend that the obstacles which hindered the growth of the film and audio-visual industry in this country have now been removed and the film community has acknowledged this.  It is now the responsibility of the industry itself to respond to these favourable conditions and to deliver on their commitment and their promises in submissions to the special working group.  This is the second opportunity for the industry to contribute significantly and transparently to the economic, social and cultural development of this State.</P>
    <P>The report of the special working group envisages an interim assessment of the Irish Film Board after two years and a full assessment after five, after which the board will be discontinued unless it is proved a worthwhile exercise in terms of stimulating employment and creating value added for the economy.  I intend to implement this recommendation which I know will not be necessary should it happen.</P>
    <P>Turning to broadcasting matters, Senators will recall that during the debate in the House on the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, I had the opportunity to share with you to some degree the shape of my thinking with regard to broadcasting developments both in its own right and in its relationship with film making.  It is useful to take this opportunity to take stock of the developments I mentioned and indicate the direction I propose to take in the future.</P>
    <P>To begin it is worth recalling the situation which faced us all when I assumed responsibility as Minister.  The cap on RTE imposed by the provisions of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, was causing fundamental damage to broadcasting and broadcasters, to advertisers and advertising agencies and to the independent television programme production sector. Jobs had been lost and more were under immediate threat in all these areas.  When responsibility for broadcasting was transferred to me in January of this year I quickly realised that the removal of the cap was a matter of the utmost necessity. <Col N="822" /> Equally, despite the spectacular success of Irish film makers in recent years, there was a danger that the sector would stagnate without a stable domestic base on which to build further international success. It was imperative that the role of RTE as the national television broadcaster in developing the independent film industry be formally recognised in statute and that the opportunity created through the success achieved by the film makers be grasped quickly.  Out of these immediate pressures I formulated the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1993, which had two essential elements &mdash; the capping provisions were repealed and RTE was required to make specific amounts available for the commissioning of programmes from the independent sector.</P>
    <P>As I explained to the House during the debate on the Bill, the legislative framework for broadcasting in this country is over 30 years old and is in need of a careful review but the urgency of the problems caused by the cap did not afford me the time to address them in the context of a fundamental review.  Accordingly, the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, should be seen as a first step in the comprehensive review of broadcasting legislation and structures upon which I am now engaged.  The Act simply delivered on two of the key commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government and at this time it is necessary to carry out the comprehensive review that the larger subject demands.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about Teilifís na Gaeilge and indicated that it will broadcast initially, I hope, for three hours a day. This will leave us, as Senator Magner and others said, with an invaluable resource of available airtime for the rest of the day.  This will give me the opportunity to consider in the context of my review a wide range of public service broadcasting options with which, for a variety of reasons, RTE cannot deal or only on a restricted basis.  I pay tribute to RTE for fulfilling its role as a successful public service broadcaster, a success achieved in the face of perhaps the stiffest competition in Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> One of the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government related to the independent broadcasting radio sector to which Senator Belton in particular referred.  I intend to address this issue in the course of my review. However, let me say now that I am not convinced of the argument which says give us a share of the licence fee and everything will be all right.  I recently appointed a new Independent Radio and Television Commission and I hope that body will be able to provide assistance to the independent sector within the constraints of existing legislation to enable it to develop and prosper further pending completion of my review.  I hope the new commission will be able to address imaginatively the issue of community radio without undue delay.  The absences of such services in general represents a significant gap in the totality of our broadcasting services.  Sa chomhthéacs seo, is breá liom go bhfuil Raidió na Life, an raidió sainspéise Gaeilge do chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath, i mbun craolta le dhá mhí nó mar sin agus bhí áthas ar leith orm mar Aire tús a cur le cláracha an stáisiúin.</P>
    <P>To turn to the future, it is no exaggeration to say that the future represents a major challenge to regulators and public service broadcasters.  As we all know the revolution in telecommunications and broadcasting technology has changed the broadcasting map for every.  The old argument that the number of broadcasting services must be small because of the limited availability of frequency spectrum is largely becoming irrelevant.  Satellites, fibre optic cable, digital technology and signal compression mean that in the foreseeable future there will be the possibility for hundreds of radio and television programmes beaming across Europe.  It is even suggested that in the near future the old copper wire that provides telephone service to our homes could provide video on demand.  One must be concerned that this multiplicity of choice will erode the financial base of traditional public service broadcasters like RTE.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="824" /> The reality is that for RTE to survive it must complete with an ever increasing range of television stations, most of which are entirely commercial with no roots in the traditional public service ethos of broadcasting.  Even when classic broadcasters such as RTE and the BBC and UK independent terrestrial stations were the only services available, concerns were expressed at the rise of cultural imperialism given the apparent preponderance of bought in American programmes which were appearing on our screens.  These days we are not so much in danger of being force-fed with the values and culture of other countries.  The real imperialists are now conglomerates who would wish to sell us lifestyles based on the acquisition of their goods and services.</P>
    <P>Broadcasting is much more than an industry; it is a carrier of values with social impact.  In the ideal world purveyed by such as I have described, the television viewers are not there to be challenged but to be reassured that everything is all right with the world so long as they have the right car, are the right weight and wear the right clothes.  The success of a programme is determined only by the audience rating it achieves and its ability to sell particular products. Viewers are surveyed, researched, chased and segmented so that programmes can be produced to formulae designed to get no negative reactions from the viewer.  RTE as a public service broadcaster must continue to be regarded as a mainstream broadcaster by its viewers if it is to be able to provide an antidote to this type of programming and if it is to remain relevant to Irish audiences.</P>
    <P>In this context the outcome of the current negotiations in relation to the conclusion of the general agreement of trade and services in the context of the audio-visual sector could be critical.  I fully support the approach that guarantees the European producers and broadcasters adequate space for European programming on our television screens.  I am also anxious to ensure that the various national and European Community initiatives that are now in place to stimulate a vibrant European audio-visual <Col N="825" /> industry should not and will not be put at risk and that Europe should have the freedom to develop further these initiatives if it is considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating subsidy of the European audio-visual sector for subsidy's sake.  However, Europe has to have the space to catch up.  The facts speak for themselves.  In 1991 some 71 per cent of American exports of audio-visual programming came into Europe, of which nearly 60 per cent went to the European Community.  In the same year the market share of films from the USA in Community cinemas reached an average of over 80 per cent.</P>
    <P>With regard to television, it was estimated that 54 per cent of television drama transmitted by European broadcasters originated in the USA.  In 1992, American audio-visual revenues in Europe reached $3.66 billion.  European audio-visual revenues in the USA in the same period reached $288 million, that is less than one-twelfth of American revenues. American broadcasters are the only ones in the world that regard dubbed material as unsuitable for transmission to their audiences.  I give these figures not in the sense of any &ldquo;USA bashing&rdquo;, to be somewhat colloquial, but rather to illustrate the extent of the problem that has to be satisfactorily addressed in the current negotiations.</P>
    <P>In the light of the prospects for television channel choice, whatever about television programme choice, I see a need for some radical thinking in Europe as a whole in order to satisfactorily address this problem for the future.  It may be necessary to beat the opposition at their own game and for public service broadcasters to adopt the new technology to this end.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility to imagine that a pan European satellite channel programmed by public service broadcasters might be established.  Provided the orbital position of the selected satellite was right and cable operators across Europe could be persuaded to take the service, I see no difficulty with this.  The service, I imagine, would be free to them and this compendium of public service broadcasting <Col N="826" /> would be available to viewers as easily as the existing satellite services.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment put down in the names of Senator Ross and Senator Manning, I have listened attentively to their views.  The question of renewing or not renewing the current statutory order under section 32 of the Broadcasting Authority Acts is being considered by the Government.  I have not had a kneejerk reaction to the issue of renewal or non renewal of the order. I publicly committed myself to a review. I undertook that review and I have almost completed the fine detail of the review. I have presented all the options in the documents which I am submitting to the Government and the Government will decide.  The current order remains in force until 19 January 1994.  It would be presumptuous of me this evening to anticipate what the considered view of the Cabinet will be in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>I thank the Members who spoke and for their many kind remarks.  Senator Magner, in introducing the motion, I have thanked already.  I will be addressing all the issues raised by Senators.  In my preparations for the expenditure of considerable sums in structural funding in film, I hope to address the issue of training and skills.  I will also take up the practical issues of perhaps extending the same exciting regime as has been established in film into aspects of the music industry, because it is in this area that we have had so much good, sustainable and imaginative employment for creating.</P>
    <P>I have expressed my personal regret that somebody would suggest that because I was doing what I said &mdash; reviewing the history of section 31 &mdash; I was, and I quote, &ldquo;by my agonising giving tremendous succour to terrorism&rdquo;. People will know that that has never been my belief.  I am the Minister with responsibility for broadcasting.  On this issue I have to consider what is good for broadcasting and the balance between broadcasting and the criminal law, the points of intersection between the criminal law and broadcasting.  After careful consideration I have to bring my views <Col N="827" /> to my colleagues in Cabinet.  I am not operating in any tempestuous way.  I do not propose to seek to convert those who have suggested that I should have resigned or that it is a pity that I had not resigned earlier this week.  I find it regrettable that dear and good friends, who represent, as I said, immensely historic and intellectually valuable constituencies, have turned to this kind of personal abuse which I regard as offence rather than intellectual argument.  That is their right and I am far more liberal than they.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Cosgrave for his demand.  The Senator will appreciate that the very people who have just criticised me would, if I interfered to bring back &ldquo;Head to Toe&rdquo;&mdash; Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien, a distinguished predecessor of mine &mdash; would be quick to point out that I was interfering in RTE.  I prefer to have responsibility within the broadcasting legislation.</P>
    <P>Regarding all the points made by Senators, I will consider these.  I welcome the views of those Senators who spoke for and against Telifís na Gaeltachta.  Telifís na Gaeltachta is about cultural regeneracy. It is about cultural diversity at a time when we are threatened by cultural domination.  It is about rights.  There is a philosophical argument, a cultural argument, a linguistic argument and a practical argument for it.  We will have an exciting new channel beyond the three hours to do things we have not yet been able to do in relation to broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I also thank all of the Senators who spoke about particular issues, which, I assure them, I will examine, because there are issues of local radio and there also issues in relation to quality and programming. I appreciate the attention of the House, and my apologies for exceeding my time.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I support the introduction of Telifís na Gaeltachta and I believe it is a real effort towards bilingualism in this country rather than the token efforts that have been made to date.  I am pleased to note from the Minister's remarks that he is going to make use of the time on Teilifís na Gaeltachta for other programmes.  I am not asking for programmes as Béarla, but as we have the best linguists in the country watching at that time perhaps we could use the channel to encourage people in other European languages by simple programming such as news bulletins in French, Italian, Spanish and German in the course of an evening.</P>
      <P>Under the heading of broadcasting, may I ask the Minister &mdash; and this is something I have raised with him previously &mdash; to urgently consider obtaining an agreement from the British Government to have RTE 1 and Network 2 transmitted to those parts of the North of Ireland where they cannot be received, especially in north County Down and in County Antrim.  Nothing is worse than dealing with this faceless group down here.  I believe it is a most important concept to bring forward, because lack of knowledge of our culture down here is a major problem with people in that part of the North of Ireland and I believe that it would be a good idea if they got a look at us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the film industry, I say to the Minister that encouraging this burgeoning film industry is wonderful and we have had notable successes.  However, miracles do not occur without planning and I suggest that the Irish Film Board would be well advised to endeavour to concentrate on producers because one must get the whole act together.  We have trainee producers, but it is an area where learning by doing is essential.  There is a good European film industry.  I strongly agree with the Minister's remarks about <Col N="829" /> the whole American culture which has taken over much of the television and film production and transmission within Europe.  I urge that we should make contacts with European film producers and I ask that the Irish Film Board make this a high priority.  It is a complex business, but I believe that this learning by doing is essential.  I would be grateful if the Minister would take this up with the Irish Film Board.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on his work in the arts, culture and broadcasting sector of Government.  He has brought to such work a dedication which we can see here tonight in his address, from which it is evident that he is fully in control of the situation.  I am pleased that the vast majority of Senators complimented the Minister on his work.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Irish Film Board, I am pleased to see the role that the Minister is bringing about the revitalisation of the board, because there is tremendous opportunity for Irish workers in this sector.  In my area two films have been made in the last 12 months, in the villages and towns of Skibbereen, Castletownshend and Tragumna and, more recently, in Castletown and Kinneigh. Not only was there work available locally but local talent was expressed, which is all to the good.  The costumes made for the film also came in useful when President Robinson visited Dunmanway yesterday to celebrate Dunmanway 300.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  Yesterday's celebrations were broadcast live by both RTE and local radio.  This was good to see.  They both did a fine job.</P>
      <P>I welcome Teilifís na Gaeilge.  As a former teacher I hope there will be many school-based programmes which would be of assistance in the educational sector. It should also be of benefit in the Gaeltachts in my area, Béal Átha an Gaorthaigh agus Oileán Cléire.  Oileán Cléire is the only island off the coast of County Cork that is still a Gaeltacht.  The main language on seven other islands in that area is English and consequently Údarás na Gaeltachta does not handle their affairs.  The broadcasting sector should record the way of life on those islands, because we often do not appreciate island life.</P>
      <P>I commend the cultural work of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  It should figure prominently on Teilifís na Gaeilge, because the work it has done for Irish dancing, song and culture is without equal.  Set dancers from my town, Dunmanway, have travelled to Ballycastle to represent Munster in all-Ireland competitions on several occasions.  This can be further developed by Telefís na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Visitors from Moyle District Council in the northern part of County Antrim attended the Dunmanway 300 celebrations yesterday.  They also met the western council of Cork County Council to discuss the hope of twinning.  They said they could not receive RTE 1 or Network 2 in the Glens of Antrim.  Because of the set dancing and other Irish cultural activities in that area, they asked if something can be done about that.  I am glad the Minister is here this evening to hear this request.  There may be problems with international links but it would be of great benefit to these people if they could receive the stations.  Perhaps Teilifís na Gaeilge could be made available to them also.</P>

      <P>There could be few more appropriate nights to bring up this motion than tonight because the prize fund for the National Lottery tonight is £2 million. Before one goes out to buy their card &mdash; it is now too late &mdash; this constitutes only the top prize.  Although there are numerous other prizes as well, the top prize will entice many punters to buy the cards.  The whole prize fund for charitable lotteries is limited to £10,000.  This means that the best one can have for a top prize is approximately £6,000-£7,000.  No matter how altruistic people are about supporting charities, they are bound to be swayed by the huge prizes offered by the national lottery.</P>
      <P>The charitable lotteries constitute an important method of fund-raising in the voluntary sector.  In the report, <i>Charitable Giving and Volunteering in the Republic of Ireland,</i> published in 1991 by the National College of Industrial Relations, the charity lottery ticket was one of the six most popular means of fund raising for the voluntary sector.  The same report states that public donations to charities are approximately £250 million per annum.  Of this amount, 6.5 per cent, or £16 million, is raised by charitable lotteries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important role of charitable lotteries has always been recognised by Government.  Conscious that the voluntary sector relied on this form of fund raising for decades, the Government increased the prize fund for charitable lotteries before the launch of the national lottery in 1987 so as to enable the charitable lotteries to compete with the new <Col N="833" /> national lottery.  Prior to 1987 the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, imposed a limit of £500 on the weekly prizes.  However, in 1987 the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Dukes, increased the limit to £10,000 by statutory instrument. The Minister was empowered to do so under section 33 of the National Lottery Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>In 1986 the then Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, gave two commitments to charities when the national lottery was instituted.  First, he stated that the national lottery would not affect the general fund raising activities of other charities and, secondly, that charities which were fund raising by means of lotteries would be allowed to compete with the national lottery.  Neither of these commitments has been honoured.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that £20 million to £25 million of the £252 million spent by the public on the national lottery in 1992 was at the expense of charities.  These charities have been unable to compete on an equal basis with the national lottery, which now accounts for 94 per cent of the Irish lottery business, because of the restriction on prize funds in charitable lotteries to £10,000 per week.  Charities have not been major beneficiaries from the national lottery.  In 1992 the annual report of the national lottery stated that the total cumulative grants to voluntary bodies in the social welfare area was just over £8 million for the period 1987-92. This figure represents 2.4 per cent of the national lottery's surplus during the same period, or £350 per charity of the 4,000 charities in the voluntary sector in Ireland.</P>
    <P>When the national lottery was launched in 1987, it was evident that it was having a negative impact on the voluntary sector.  Six years have passed since then and the matter has now reached crisis proportions.  Some 16 of Ireland's leading charities who depended on lotteries as a means of fund raising made a submission to the then Taoiseach in June 1991 to increase the prize fund.  These <Col N="834" /> charities included the Alzheimers Society of Ireland, the Central Remedial Clinic, The Cheshire Foundation in Ireland, Clashganna Mills, Galway Association for Mentally Handicapped Children, the Mater Foundation, Multiple Sclerosis Care Foundation, The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland, Cerebral Palsy Ireland, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children Research, The Polio Fellowship of Ireland, the Rehabilitation Institute, St. Michael's House, St. Patrick's Hospital in Cork, St. Vincent's Hospital Educational Trust, and Special Olympics Ireland.</P>
    <P>While the charitable lotteries would like to see the prize fund based on a percentage of the lottery income rather than on a finite sum, in the long term they would like the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, to increase the prize fund limit from £10,000 to £250,000 in the interim.  This could be done immediately by statutory order, as the Minister knows.  This would allow the charitable lotteries to give other large prizes as well as a top prize of £100,000.</P>
    <P>It is worth making the point that the British Government increased the top prize money in their charitable lotteries from £12,500 to £100,000 when drafting their new national lottery legislation.  The British Government made this decision after studying the negative effect which the national lottery in Ireland had on our charities.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to remind the Minister that if the voluntary sector did not exist, the funding for the services would have to be provided by the Exchequer.  Consequently, direct support from the public to these charities is a substitute for Exchequer funding in the same way as the national lottery supports art, culture, the health services and so on.</P>
    <P>This is an important problem and the Irish charitable lotteries, which have only a small share of the lottery in Ireland &mdash; it is only 6 per cent &mdash; should be helped immediately so that its existing share is <Col N="835" /> not further eroded.  Otherwise, its fund raising money will be negligible.  This would be a great Christmas present for the charities.  I ask the Minister to give it favourable consideration.</P>
    <P>I forgot to ask if I could share my time with Senator Belton?</P>

      <P>I want to add my voice to the call made this evening by Senator Henry to increase the prize funds for charitable lotteries to £250,000.  The charitable organisations referred to are different groups who cater for needs in many areas.  I want to specifically mention the Rehabilitation Institute. Recently, I had the opportunity to visit one of their centres.  I want to put on the record of the House the areas which this centre deals with, including courses in agriculture, horticulture, upholstery, industrial skills, confectionery skills and professional cookery and catering courses. This is a voluntary organisation which is catering for the needs of special individuals.  It is one of the charitable organisations referred to this evening.  As Senator Henry mentioned, the Rehabilitation Institute has taken over a State responsibility.  However, the State has a responsibility to support the institute's fund-raising activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This request is a reasonable one, especially when one considers that someone could have won £2 million this evening in the national lottery.  I do not know the numbers yet, but I hope I have won it.  However, someone could have won £2 million for £1.  The full prize fund per week in other lotteries is £10,000. One must agree that this is not a fair balance.  If this happened in the trading world, many people would be annoyed. Therefore, we ask the Minister for Justice to raise the prize fund to £250,000 and allow these charitable organisations to <Col N="836" /> give an opportunity to young people and people in need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry and Senator Belton for raising this matter.  I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Justice, who has asked me to reply on her behalf.  As Senator Belton said, I would also like to win the £2 million tonight, but I would be prepared to share it.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice is conversant with the request received from the Rehabilitation Institute and a number of other charitable organisations for an increase in the value of prizes which may be awarded in a lottery licence under the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  She had a meeting with representatives of the Rehabilitation Institute in relation to this issue.  Under a provision introduced in the National Lottery Act, 1986, the Minister for Justice is empowered to make a statutory order fixing the total value of prizes in lotteries under the 1956 Act. Such lotteries are confined to charitable and philanthropic organisations.  The limits originally fixed under the 1956 Act remained unaltered until 1987 when, at the time of the launch of the national lottery, the charitable lottery prize limits were substantially increased by an order of the then Minister for Justice.  The Senator already mentioned this.</P>
      <P>The operation of charitable lotteries was <i>inter alia</i> considered by a committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Declan Costello which reported to the Minister for Justice in 1990.  Senators will also recall that the Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to introduce tighter controls on charities and street collections in line with the recommendations of the Costello report.  Work on the preparation of the requisite legislation is proceeding in the Department of Justice.  The Minister's proposals will be announced in the usual way in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> The Senator has contrasted the position of charitable lotteries with the national lottery.  It must be borne in mind, however, that the purpose of the National Lottery Act, 1986, was to establish one national lottery whereas the intention of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, was to allow for the operation of local private charitable lotteries.  It is accepted, however, that many charitable lotteries are now operating on a nationwide basis on foot of High Court decisions over the years brought to challenge the validity of provisions in the 1956 Act.  This aspect will be considered in formulating the controlling and regulating mechanisms which are to apply in the future.</P>
    <P>The Senator's motion mentions an increased prize fund of £250,000.  The Minister will be carefully reviewing the various submissions and representations she has received on the matter before making her decision on new prize limits and her decision will be announced in due course.  Further matters which the Minister will examine, and to which reference was made, are the difficulties encountered by charitable organisations in complying with Garda administrative regulations which set out the accounting and other records that a lottery licensee must keep and the returns which must be submitted to the relevant Garda superintendent who licences the lottery.  Since charitable lotteries are now generally run on a nationwide rather than a local basis, compliance with the current regulations imposes a considerable burden on that particular organisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister accepts that the regulations, which were drawn up over 30 years ago by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána with the consent of the Minister for Justice, are outdated.  The Minister proposes accordingly to contact the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána with a view to revising the regulations. In view of what has been said this evening, with much of which I agree, I <Col N="838" /> will bring those representations to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope &ldquo;in due course&rdquo; is not even longer than &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;.  This is most urgent and the charities are badly in need of money.  The administration costs of running lotteries are high.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me to discuss the need for the Minister for Education to urgently provide funding for the building of a multi-denominational school at Ranelagh.  I wish to give two minutes of my time to Senator O'Toole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The multi-denominational school at Ranelagh was established in 1988 in the former Church of Ireland premises at St. Columba's national school, Ranelagh.  It has grown from a two classroom school with 55 pupils in 1988 to a six classroom school with 180 pupils in September of this year.  Despite its rundown appearance and obvious shortcomings in terms of facilities, the Ranelagh multi-denominational school continues to attract a growing enrolment. This may be due to its educational policy, its multi-denominational ethos and its strategic location in a popular inner city suburb.  The purpose and spirit of the school do not vary from those of other primary schools.  As a multi-denominational school it seeks only the opportunity to provide a new strand within the national school fabric.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The multi-denominational school at Ranelagh is essentially a local school and 140 families have requested places in 1994, of which 120 want to place junior infants and the remainder older children. The waiting lists for the following years are: 1995,90; 1996,67; 1997,45.  I believe from these figures that the viability and social demand for the school has been <Col N="839" /> firmly established.  The pre-enrolment list indicates an increasing demand for places in the school.  In order to accommodate the waiting list, an eight classroom school is required by 1995.  All the existing classrooms are substandard and undersized. The prefab temporary constructions are well past their viability span.</P>
    <P>The extension of planning permission on these premises expires in 1995 under an An Bord Pleanála planning decision of November 1990.  These temporary timber frame structures do not comply with the current fire regulations and will not be acceptable to the planning authority after 1996.  A new eight classroom school on the existing site, which is owned by the board of management, is required.  I understand the feasibility study has been completed.  The management committee are ready with their plans for the building of a new school and their primary goal is their inclusion in the new school building programme in the Estimates for the 1994 capital programme.</P>
    <P>It may come as a surprise to the Minister and his officials that a new national school is required in this area because I know the Department has to deal with the problem of an ever increasing number of empty classrooms in schools that were built in recent years in certain parts of Dublin.  I wish to reflect on the catchment area which is served by the school.  I know it well as I represent it on Dublin City Council.  A new eight classroom school was built on Belmont Avenue recently serving the Donny brook area.  This is an excellently run school and has a long waiting list.  Recently a new national school was built at Sandford and it also has a waiting list.  Tonight I am making the case for a new multi-denominational school at Ranelagh.</P>
    <P>The need for the multi-denominational school at Ranelagh may be due to its education policy or its multi-denominational ethos but there are other factors which affect the area.  The three schools <Col N="840" /> in question have long waiting lists and one might ask why.  One reason is that a number of younger people with children of school-going age have come to live in the area.  Second a growing number of family houses that were previously converted into multi-flats are now once again being restored to family dwellings.  This puts pressure on the school places available in the catchment area.  There are also a number of secondary schools in the area which previously had junior schools attached to them but, due to a lack of staff and the difficulty for parents in meeting their financial commitments to fee paying junior schools, these schools are being phased out.  This puts added pressure on the waiting list for the excellent national schools in the area.</P>
    <P>When the Minister gives the green light to the board of management to build the new school, they will be faced with the problem of finding alternative accommodation for the pupils and teachers during the reconstruction programme. However, suitable alternative accommodation may be available during 1994. The owners of the premises in question have looked favourably on the application of the board of management of the Ranelagh multi-denominational national school and indicated that they have alternative proposals for the premises but they are not in a position to give a long term commitment to the Ranelagh school's board of management.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the three main reasons funding for the building of the multi-denominational national school is so urgently required: first, the long established waiting lists; second, the present prefabs are temporary constructions and extension of the planning permission on these buildings expires in 1995; and third, suitable alternative accommodation will be available to the teachers and pupils while the building programme is taking place but it is unlikely to be available after 1995.  For these reasons I ask the Minister to include this school building programme <Col N="841" /> in the 1994 capital programme Estimates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my appreciation to Senator Doyle for allowing me two minutes to make an intervention on this issue.  This is one of the schools the INTO assessed over the last year or so and it is included on the list of priority schools, submitted to the Department of Education, which require an immediate response from the Department.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons this school needs to be helped immediately. First, it is unsafe and unhealthy.  That is a reality of which the parents, teachers and board are aware.  It is impossible to implement the curriculum correctly in the present circumstances.  My office has been in contact with the Department over the last two days about this school.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the school received a written commitment from another local facility which has offered accommodation during 1994.  This school must be included in the 1994 list because they must evacuate the site when building work is being carried out as it would be unsafe to remain.  This is an urgent matter and must be dealt with.</P>
      <P>I am slow to say one school is more important than another, but in order to accommodate the change with minimum disruption to the operation of the school, it must be done during 1994.  The Minister said there is to be an increase in the building grant for primary schools next year.  The Estimates are being compiled at present and this school must be included; it is needed because of overcrowding in this area.  There is co-operation between the community, the board of management and teachers.  This school would be an investment in this area.  I urge the Minister to take immediate action in this regard.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Doyle for raising this matter.  He was ably supported by Senator O'Toole. <Col N="842" /> I am familiar with the priority list which his organisation has forwarded to the Department and I assure him it is being seriously considered.</P>
      <P>This school was established with three teachers in September 1988.  The Ranelagh Multi-denominational School Association acquired the premises of the former St. Columbus Church of Ireland school in Ranelagh for the purpose of the new school.  Accommodation consists of the former church building and hall and two prefabricated classrooms on the site. Since the school was established enrolment has increased to 177 pupils with a staff of six teachers.  An extra classroom was provided for in September 1991 by converting part of the hall into one classroom and toilets.  A further classroom was provided for in September 1993 by partitioning another area of the hall.  An inspector of the Department has indicated that further classrooms will be required in 1994 and 1995.</P>
      <P>The school authority seeks the provision of a new eight classroom school to replace the existing school.  Officials of the Department met a deputation from the board of management to discuss the long term proposals for the school.  The Department confirmed in writing to the school authority that there is no option in relation to the long term accommodation requirements of the school but to provide a new purpose built school premises.  The feasibility of providing the new school building on the site of the present premises is being investigated in order to initiate architectural planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will be aware that, because of the large volume of major building projects on hand and limitations on resources, it is only possible to allow a certain number of projects to proceed to construction in any one financial year. However, I assure Senators that the Department accepts this project is a high priority one in the context of projects to be allowed to proceed to construction when architect planning has been completed. The priority list submitted by <Col N="843" /> Senator O'Toole's organisation will be favourably considered when decisions are made in the near future.</P>
