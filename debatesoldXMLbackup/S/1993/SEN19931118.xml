      <P>I have notice from Senator Roche that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to urgently clarify the situation regarding the extension of the DART system to Greystones, as work is in progress interdepartmentally on the operational programme giving effect to the transport proposals in the National Development Plan 1994-99.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to allocate more funding to Co-operation North.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Burke of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to upgrade to national primary status the routes from Swinford to Ballina and Castlebar to Westport, County Mayo, as a continuation of the N5.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Doyle of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> The need for the Minister for Education to urgently provide funding for the building of a multi-denominational school at Ranelagh, Dublin 6.</P>
    <P>I regard all the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Roche's and Senator Ross' matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>I am sure the House will want to be associated with congratulating the Republic of Ireland soccer team.  Perhaps you would send a letter of congratulations to the team, through the FAI, and state what a great night it was for this island.  The Tanáiste deserves great credit for the work he has done to ensure that certain personnel will be in place to look after those who intend to travel to the US.</P>

It is the only sad note that I touch on and it is not a day for sad notes but if people listened and watched closely last night they will have noted that there is a huge amount of bridge building to be done on this island.  Many people will have learned much last night about the division between the communities on this island and the need to bridge it.  Discussion to addressing those issues is the first step, and that is why such a debate is overdue.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House for a discussion on the implications of the take-over of Cooley Distillery by IDG?  This has serious implications for any company which tries to get involved in international trading. Cooley Distillery produced a product which could be sold internationally but <Col N="608" /> because Irish Distillers is an international trading group, it would not allow Cooley Distillery to sell their product.  It took over the company and in doing so potential jobs and a huge potential for an increase in the sales of an indigenous whiskey have been lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Lanigan on the subject of the Cooley Distillery. I realise we cannot talk about it today.  I would have like to have said a few words about it last night but because of the queue of speakers I was not able. May I make a point which could be transmitted to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges?  We have spoken about the machinery of the Seanad and facilitating people as much as possible to speak, particularly when they have prepared <Col N="610" /> material.  We suggested a number of times that perhaps the ministerial contribution in a two hour debate could be taken outside that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. You have an excellent representative in Senator O'Toole and I am sure he will bring forward that suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wanted to back him up.  Regarding the Northern Ireland match, I listened to the radio this morning and I was horrified by the comments of a man who was there as he spoke about the absolute blast of hatred that came from the people next to him and the obscenities.  There is much bridge building to done, and it has not even begun.</P>
      <P>Since we are reprimanding the media, may I make a point to RTE?  There are two Chambers in the Oireachtas.  They refer consistently to the Dáil.  They publish an election report which talks about the election and deals only with Dáil Éireann.  They appear to be unaware that this House exists and this morning they referred, on a number of occasions, to the fact that Dáil Éireann would observe a minute's silence at 1 p.m. I would like RTE to take note of the fact that there are two Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Finally, has the Leader any further news about the debate on drugs in the inner cities?  I know that he is trying to get a date for us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I say to Senator Gordon Wilson that the Northern Ireland team frightened the life out of us and were of no help whatsoever last night.  In relation to Cooley whiskey, there was a bigger contribution made to Irish Distillers last night than there has been for many years.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to convey to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste the appreciation of the House regarding the successful implementation of the Programme for a Partnership Government in Windsor Park last night.  We got money from Europe and we are now in the World Cup.  Things are progressing very well.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris mentioned Private Members' Business.  My understanding is that there may be a proposal to extend Private Members' time by an extra half hour and, by agreement of the Whips, I hope that will be soon.</P>
      <P>Finally Senators will note this morning that another piece of legislation has been initiated in the House.  We may take that next week or if other Bills are available, it will be the week after.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No.1:</P>
      <P>In page 10, paragraph (a), line 10, to delete &ldquo;day&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Sunday&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. The intention of my amendment is that, on a trial basis, we should have polling day for the presidential election on a <Col N="612" /> Sunday.  Polling is the exercise of the democratic system and it is important that as many people as possible vote.</P>
    <P>If there was Sunday voting, there would be a greater turnout.  There have been difficulties in relation to traditional voting days.  Other countries such as France hold elections and run-offs on a Sunday.  Sunday voting would ensure a greater turnout and it would cause less disruption to schools. Although students like the day off, we must take a practical look at this.</P>
    <P>If one looks at voting patterns in the last presidential election, there was a 64 per cent turn out.  While this figure is not bad, less than two thirds of those entitled to vote did so.  In certain areas, particularly in Dublin this figure dropped below 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>Sunday voting should perhaps be introduced on a trial basis.  It would be more democratic as it would enable more people to vote.  Difficulties arise where polling stations are only open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. or 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., particularly during winter when people have work commitments.  If Sunday voting was introduced, there would be a greater turnout.  That is what we should aim for. Regardless of the election or the result &mdash; most Members have seen good and bad days in this regard &mdash; it is important that those who have the right to vote do so.  It is a cherished right which people fought and died for and it should not be taken lightly.</P>
    <P>I advocated this in relation to other elections, including local elections where the turn out is often dismal, approximately 30 to 50 per cent.  If we want a democratic result and people to vote, we must have Sunday voting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. In regard to accessibility, many people lose out.  Many people are unable to vote without upsetting their daily routine. This also relates to a number of issues which we discussed during the electoral Bill.  No provision is made for travellers of any description.  Other European countries such as Belgium make provisions for people who are out of the <Col N="613" /> country for a short period &mdash; I am not talking about emigrant votes &mdash; to make arrangements to vote either before or after the trip.  That does not happen in this country.  Sunday is a day when people are at home, close to where they would vote.  Many people work up to one hundred miles from their home.  They may work in Dublin during the week and return home at weekends.  Sunday voting would eliminate difficulties for these people.</P>
      <P>In the 1989 general election, the present Tánaiste won by a majority of four votes.  Although the Tánaiste was happy with the result, some people who were on their way home to vote were unable to do so.  I use this as an example because if people are unable to vote on a particular day, the election result may be affected.</P>
      <P>I refer to a point made by Senator Cosgrave.  Each time there is an election schools are disrupted.  I know a day off is appreciated, but it diminishes the State's view of primary education because elections must take place during the school week.  It is a day off for pupils and teachers who, like other workers, enjoy a day off.  Teachers would not be pleased with me for raising this matter.  I also raised this with my union and congress on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>If an election must be held mid week then so be it, but there should be an opportunity to hold it on a Sunday if that is appropriate.  This matter concerns me because each time there is an election somebody rings Gay Byrne to say teachers are off again and people like Senator Lanigan will say: &ldquo;I suppose they will be paid for the day as their salary is assured.&rdquo;  I support this amendment because we should be able to use a Sunday now and again and this legislation would provide an opportunity to try this out.  Although we should not slavishly adhere to European practices, it would bring us in line with other European countries.  Business people who are abroad and people who work in other parts of the country usually return home at weekends.  These people are losing out and they would welcome this change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="614" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>While I support the philosophy behind the amendment, I am not sure I support the wording as proposed. It makes it a condition that elections be held only on a Sunday and that is undesirable. However, we should be able to hold elections on a Sunday if we wish.  I live beside the Newbridge bypass and each weekend a considerable number of buses travel along the motorway to the country. These buses carry students and people who work in offices, civil servants, etc.  On the Electoral Reform Bill the point was made that democracy should be as inclusive as possible.  It is the responsibility of legislators to ensure no impediments are put in the way of those who wish to exercise the franchise.  This has been provided for in the Electoral Reform Bill. For example, people with disabilities are catered for.  We must do the same in this legislation, which should be as inclusive as possible.  Students, people working in Dublin, etc. who wish to exercise their franchise are excluded.  That should not be so.  For that reason the amendment should be supported.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of section 7 relates to the opening hours of polling stations. Polling stations should open for at least 12 hours.  Discretion is allowed and they may open at 8 a.m. and close at 10.30 p.m. While I would favour a specified period, it is a matter which we will not press.  Sunday voting should be possible.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage, Senator Norris suggested that some members of the Church of Ireland might object to voting on a Sunday because of Sunday observance.  I asked some members of the Church of Ireland about this and there seems to be a difference of opinion.  Some would certainly regard it as undesirable that polling should take place on a Sunday, but I think they would still vote.  There are others who are indifferent or think it would be quite a good idea.  That is another aspect of the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>My reading of section 7 is that it does not exclude Sunday and there is no reason Sunday could not be polling day, just as any other day.  People <Col N="615" /> who travel to the country in buses for the weekend were mentioned.  Students consider their homes to be in the country and that is fair enough, but if somebody works in an office in Dublin, Cork or Limerick and happens to come from Roscommon, Carlow or elsewhere, their home should be where they actually live and work.  That is where they should vote rather than the place they originally come from.  It is not desirable to be living somewhere for years and yet consider that you should take your political allegiance back to your home place.  People should take an interest in the area they live in and follow the political scene in that area.  It is not necessarily a good thing to encourage people to vote where they originally come from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> The Electoral Act, 1992, removed the statutory barrier to voting on Sundays and there is now no statutory reason any election or referendum cannot be taken on a Sunday.  It is a matter for decision by the Minister which day should be appointed as polling day and further legislation on the point is not required. There are many different views on the merits of Sunday polling.  The possibility of Sunday voting is not excluded but a decision on this must, among other things, take account of reservations on religious grounds.  As Senator Dardis said, there are mixed views on that point.</P>
      <P>The provision of section 7, as drafted, strikes the correct balance in my opinion. It gives the Minister flexibility and discretion in appointing a polling day.  It would enable Sunday voting to be tried out on an experimental basis in the first instance and, if this proved unsatisfactory for any reason, it would be possible to revert without any change in the law.</P>

    <P>The amendment which would make Sunday voting obligatory would, I think, be the wrong approach.  Arguments have been put forward to suggest that more people might vote on a Sunday.  I am not so sure that more people would have an opportunity of voting if elections or <Col N="616" /> referenda took place on Sundays rather than mid-week as at present.  Neither is it clear that voting on Sundays would be the only way, or the best way, of facilitating those for whom voting under existing arrangements is not suitable.</P>
    <P>I take on board the points made by Senators, and I will refer them to the Minister.  If there is an election between now and the end of this Government's term of office, the Minister would certainly be in a position to consider whether Sunday voting would be suitable.  Under this Bill the Minister is quite entitled to have Sunday voting and that is the way it should be.  To tie the hands of the Minister to having polling only on Sundays would be the wrong approach.  For that reason I would ask Senator Cosgrave to withdraw his amendment and allow the flexibility provided for in this Bill.</P>

      <P>There could be a Wexford match on, I suppose.  I have taken the Minister's points and it would certainly not be my intention to be dogmatic about the issue.  I would have liked the Minister to be slightly more positive and say that he would seriously consider having one of the forthcoming elections on a Sunday, even though there may not be a general election for a while.  I understand that for next year's European Parliament elections the plan is that we will have polling here on a Thursday but counting will not start until the following Monday.  It might be an idea to have polling on a Sunday for something like the European elections on a trial basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Dardis that there would be merit in having the poll at fixed times.  However, while polling has sometimes spanned 13 hours &mdash; from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. &mdash; it would help quite a number of people if they could vote before they went to work, and an 8 o'clock start should be seriously considered for that purpose.  Many people have to be at work by 9 o'clock, or shortly afterwards.  An 8 o'clock start should be <Col N="617" /> considered, with the polls being open for 12 or 14 hours.  There are many hours during the day when few people exercise their franchise, and there tends to be a rush later on.  Many people would appreciate it if they could vote earlier.</P>
    <P>I will withdraw the amendment on the basis that the Minister will consider Sunday polling on a trial basis at an early date and see what the result is.  I think there is merit in it but obviously we will have to wait and see the turn out.  Less than two thirds of the electorate voted in the last presidential election.  We might get that figure up to 80 per cent if voting was on a Sunday.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (1) (a), line 44, to delete &ldquo;20&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;10&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 15 (1) (a) provides that not less than 20 Members of the Oireachtas shall nominate a person to be a candidate at a presidential election.  I would submit that that is too many.  The effect is to limit to the major political parties the choice of whom might run for the presidency.  In the last presidential election there was a Member of this House who wished to run and who would have been a suitable candidate, but could not find the required number of Senators to sign the nomination paper.  I think I am correct in saying that.  It comes back to the point about democracy being inclusive.  It should be open to a citizen in good standing to run for our most senior constitutional office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we discussed the procedures for general elections there was much debate about the type of candidates one might get if it was made easy to run.  In a general election we could do with a bit of the <Col N="618" />&ldquo;monster raving loony party&rdquo; type of people.  They add colour to the occasion and bring a certain levity which I do not think is any harm.  We all take this business far too seriously at times, and we are a bit too pompous about the whole affair.  I accept that the Presidency is a different matter from a general election. It is our most senior constitutional office and the candidates have to be people of quality and merit.  Fortunately, we have such a person as the President today.</P>
    <P>The minimum figure of 20 Members of the Oireachtas required to nominate a presidential candidate is too high.  It should be open to the smaller parties, like my own, and to the independents, if they find a candidate whom they regard as being of sufficient merit, to nominate a candidate.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> The requirements in relation to the nomination of a person to be a candidate at a presidential election are set out in Article 12 of the Constitution.  That Article provides, in relation to nomination by Oireachtas Members, that a minimum of 20 Members of the Oireachtas must subscribe to such a nomination.  Any change in this provision could only be effected by means of a constitutional amendment and is not appropriate for ordinary legislation. I appreciate the sincerity of Senator Dardis in attempting to change this requirement.  It would simply not be possible to do so in the context of this Bill.  The matter could only be considered in the context of a possible constitutional amendment.  I appreciate and sympathise with Senator Dardis's argument but change can only be considered in the context of a constitutional amendment. Therefore, we cannot consider the matter in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister is correct.  It brings me back to a point which was made on Second Stage. Repeatedly, on this and other legislation we are delimited in a serious way by provisions in the Constitution, which may have been appropriate when the Constitution was drafted but are no longer <Col N="619" /> so.  If we abolish this House, which I hope will not be for some time, we will be faced with around 80 constitutional provisions relating to it.  The Constitution needs revision but that is perhaps not relevant to this matter.  I agree with the Minister that we are delimited by the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 15, before section 17, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;17.&mdash;(1) A nomination of a person to be a candidate at a presidental election may be made by petition of not least than 20,000 electors.  Nomination shall be made in accordance with the following provisions, that is to say:</P>
      <P>(a) the nomination shall be in writing and shall be signed by the persons by whom it is made,</P>
      <P>(b) the petition shall form part of the nomination papers which shall state the names (the surname being stated first), address and occupation (if any) of the person thereby nominated to be a candidate and shall also state all such matters as are required by the nomination paper to be stated therein&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This revolves around the point I made earlier.  In addition to the procedure whereby Members of the Oireachtas and county councils nominate candidates, it should be open to citizens to nominate candidates, to make democracy as inclusive as possible.  I visited Hungary when it was in transition from a communist regime to democracy.  On a Sunday morning outside the parliament building <Col N="620" /> in Budapest there were queues of people at tables signing a petition to require the Government to hold a referendum.  The petition was successful.  The main news bulletin in Hungary that evening showed wads of papers being presented to the officer who was to decide on the matter. A referendum was held.  That is the way true democracy should work.  It should be open to citizens.</P>
    <P>I am flexible as to the minimum number of persons which should sign such a petition but, in the event of there being sufficient popular support outside the political system for somebody to stand for the Presidency, this vehicle should be available.  As it stands, it is virtually impossible for somebody outside the established political system to be nominated to contest the election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is merit in Senator Dardis's proposal.  In Ireland we would not be able to have a Ross Perot type candidate.  If Jack Charlton contested the election I would not like to have my name on the same ballot paper.</P>
      <P>I can see practical difficulties in implementing such a proposal.  If stringent conditions were imposed to prevent abuses, whether the minimum number of nominating persons be 10,000, 20,000, or 25,000, it should be possible for a person who does not belong to a main political party, but might be eminently suited for the office of President, to contest the election.  We should consider having the nomination procedure outside of the stranglehold of the main political parties.</P>
      <P>There would be logistical difficulties in implementing such a procedure.  When petitions are circulated some people sign for their whole households.  The petition may contain names of persons who did not sign it.  However, there is merit in the proposal and it should be considered.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> As Senator Dardis outlined, there are three ways of nominating a candidate for President.  A candidate may be nominated by 20 Members of the Oireachtas or by the councils of at least four county councils or county boroughs.  A former or retiring <Col N="621" /> President may nominate himself or herself. Any change in the method of nomination of a candidate for election as President would require a constitutional amendment and is not appropriate to ordinary legislation.  While we might have sympathy with the argument put forward by Senator Dardis, it would not be possible to proceed on the basis he has proposed.  The matter could only be considered in the context of a constitutional amendment.</P>
      <P>If this proposal were considered in the context of a future constitutional amendment or a review of the Constitution, there would be problems, as Senator Cosgrave pointed out, in operating the system. We would have to consider a way of ensuring signatures were in order and people were not signing for others.  Because of the constraints in the Constitution we cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>We find ourselves in the same difficulty again.  I would like to be told which specific provision of the Constitution prevents the operation of the procedure outlined in the amendment.  I am not sure it is delimited by the Constitution as the Minister suggests.  I accept the practical difficulties the proposal entails but we introduce legislation all the time which overcomes practical difficulties of this nature.  It is not beyond the wit of the Houses of the Oireachtas to devise a system which would be as foolproof as the existing electoral system and might not have some of its defects. It is important people participate to the maximum extent in the political process. I say this because it is becoming increasingly evident people are contemptuous of the political process, do not wish to participate in it and feel excluded by it. We should do anything we can to reverse this trend.</P>

      <P>In page 25, subsection (2) (a), to delete &ldquo;and descriptions of&rdquo; and substitute, &ldquo;descriptions and photograph of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is returning to the point made earlier about making democracy as inclusive as possible and ensuring that everybody who wishes to vote can do so.  We are attempting to ensure by the inclusion of a photograph on a ballot paper, that people who are illiterate can vote in a presidential election without having to do so in the manner which is prescribed already.</P>
      <P>References were made on Second Stage to the fact that this could turn into a beauty contest and that people would look at the quality of the pictures on the ballot paper with a view to deciding how they would vote.  I submit that would not be the case because people see candidates on television and in newspapers for months before an election.  They know what the candidates look like and the photograph just makes it easier for people who cannot read to identify them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was also made on Second Stage to the secrecy of the ballot box, an important part of our democratic process. People should be able to vote in secret.  All of us who have participated in elections have been in polling stations where we heard this so-called shouted vote.  It is easy in those circumstances to <Col N="623" /> be directional in terms of how somebody might cast their vote.  I am not saying it always happens or that it happens often, but it is possible for a certain degree of direction to enter into the so-called shouted vote.</P>
    <P>Given modern technology and the ease with which communication can be made, I do not see why this cannot be done. There could be a standard, black and white photograph showing the candidate's full face, head and shoulders or whatever.  It would only be there to identify the candidates on the ballot paper, nothing else.  It is not proposed that it should be a beauty contest.  It is proposed that we make people aware of how they can vote.</P>
    <P>We have done this before in the Bill on electoral reform, where we ensured to the highest degree possible that people who suffer from disabilities or are incapacitated in some way would be able to exercise their franchise.  This is intended to extend that facility one stage further. A presidential election would be a good place to begin where everybody would know what the candidates look like.  It is not the same as a general election or a European election.  This would be a good place to start and would bring us into the twentieth century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle, I support the amendment.  It might give a certain credibility to the whole process of voting. People would see the picture and would not make a mistake.  Where there is a long list of candidates&mdash;in Tipperary, for example, there are often several Ryans running &mdash; identifying the candidate for whom one wishes to vote can be difficult, particularly for older people.  When candidates are listed in alphabetical order on the ballot paper is there an advantage for candidates at the top of the list?  In my constituency this has never harmed the Minister for the Marine and for Defence, Deputy Andrews, although he would probably do well anyway.  Some people might think they have to start at the top rather than the bottom, thus omitting myself in the middle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> I hope further identification would not turn into a potential beauty contest because some of us might not fare as well as others.

        <i>(Wexford):</i> Under existing law restated in this Bill, a voter whose sight is so impaired that he is unable to vote without assistance may have the ballot paper marked on his or her behalf by a companion or a presiding officer.  A voter who is illiterate may ask to have the ballot paper marked by the presiding officer.  Under this provision, the presiding officer may assist the voter by reading out in full the details in relation to each candidate on the ballot paper and then mark the ballot paper as instructed by the voter.</P>
      <P>While the inclusion of photographs of candidates on ballot papers might assist some voters, the effectiveness of the measure overall is likely to be limited. Under our system of proportional representation, which allows the voter to vote for the candidates in the order of his or her choice, certain categories of voters would still require assistance in marking the ballot paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inclusion of photographs would give rise to practical difficulties.  For example, it would put extra pressure on the resources of the returning officer at a time when he or she is already operating <Col N="625" /> under pressure.  At an election little time is available for preparing, printing and issuing ballot papers.  Ballot papers have to be printed as soon as practicable after the closing of nominations to ensure maximum time for delivery and return of postal ballot papers.</P>
    <P>The extra time required for checking photographs, ensuring that they are of suitable standard and quality and making certain that the photographs match the names on the ballot paper would add considerably to the demands on the resources of the returning officer.  In the political party I represent, when we are trying to get photographs for the three or four candidates who are standing in Wexford, we usually spend two weeks trying to make sure that one is not brighter or darker than the other.  I can imagine what the problems would be if this was a nationwide requirement.</P>
    <P>Photographs on ballot papers could assist some electors in identifying the candidate for whom they wish to vote but only, of course, if they already know what the candidate looks like.  Thus, there would be a built-in bias in favour of well known candidates at the expense of lesser known ones.  Our electoral system is already criticised for putting undue emphasis on personality rather than on policy.  Including photographs would exaggerate this tendency and could have the effect of, as some speakers said, turning the election into a beauty contest, although Senator Dardis does not agree. People might be more inclined to vote for a high profile candidate if their photograph was on the ballot paper.</P>
    <P>The points I have made up to now refer mainly to general elections.  It would be correct to say that the arguments might be different for a presidential election, where there is a longer lead-in, only one ballot paper for the entire country and the number of candidates is substantially less.  However, in a presidential election there are usually only two or three candidates &mdash; there has never been more than three and, up to the present, the number had normally been two.</P>
    <P>Wide publicity is given to the candidates in the news media, an extensive <Col N="626" /> and effective campaign is conducted by, and on behalf, of the candidates and a free postage facility is provided under which the election addresses of the candidates are delivered to every elector. The candidates in the last presidential election &mdash; President Robinson, Deputy Currie and Deputy Lenihan &mdash; had high profiles and were well known.  I do not think a photograph on the ballot paper at that presidential election would have been of any advantage because the candidates were all well known.</P>
    <P>In the light of this, it is difficult to maintain that there is a genuine need for the measure proposed in the amendment. The proportion of spoilt votes in the 1990 presidential election was 0.5 per cent, which is very low by any standard.  The argument that substantial numbers of illiterate or semi-illiterate electors do not turn out to vote because of embarrassment or fear that they would spoil their ballot paper is difficult to maintain.</P>
    <P>In my experience, the major problem with people not turning out to vote concerns young voters.  The majority of young people are highly educated, intelligent and would not be regarded as illiterate. This is an area we have to examine to see how we can get young people to vote.  The existing regulations for presidential or general elections are adequate and there is no need for photographs as suggested by Senator Dardis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made an important concession when he said that the presidential election is different from other elections.  That is precisely the point.  I have not said it should be done in general elections but that this is the place to start.</P>
      <P>The candidates are, by definition, high profile people.  There is an extensive campaign and when we get to the point of voting, everybody knows what the candidates look like.  However, not everybody can read what is on the ballot paper and those who cannot should be facilitated when voting.  It is as simple as that and that is what is being requested here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is probable, God willing, that our President will hold office for a second <Col N="627" /> term.  It is unlikely that the next presidential election will be contested as far as we can judge at present.  I can say with a reasonable degree of certainty that by the next presidential election where ballot papers are issued, we will be voting differently.  We will probably be voting electronically at that stage.  Technology is moving at such a pace that some of this legislation is likely to be out of date within a few years, and possibly for the next presidential election.  Considering that advance in technology, a provision like this is very sensible.</P>
    <P>The point may at some stage arise in the context of a general election.  The Minister has made a reasonable statement about the difficulties in getting pictures. However, I guarantee that if the candidates knew their pictures would not be on the ballot paper if they did not have them submitted by a certain date, they would make absolutely sure they were there.</P>
    <P>One can always leave a blank if one does not show up on the day and a picture does not have to be included.  The candidate who does not have his photograph on the ballot paper may get the most votes because there is a blank where his photograph should be.  Somebody like Senator Cosgrave who does not feel beautiful may feel it better not to submit their photo but that is a different argument.</P>
    <P>I accept that we have a good record in terms of the number of spoilt votes at elections but that does not deflect from the central point which is that some people may be discouraged from voting because they must call out their preference. The secrecy of the ballot box is not maintained to the extent it should be and this provision would help.  The Minister made a reasonable point when he stated that certain categories would still need assistance.  That is correct but we are saying this would ensure that fewer categories would need assistance.</P>

      <P>Mr. Ernie Sweeney is involved in the literacy campaign which has been in operation for many years. <Col N="628" /> We now have an opportunity to deal with this problem in presidential campaigns and presidential elections.  The literary organisation got commitments from all political parties that consideration would be given to this area.</P>
      <P>A presidential election would be an appropriate place to start as there are usually no more than three or four candidates. To a certain extent the Minister appears to be in agreement that recognition has to be given to this problem. It has been admitted that an enormous number of people in this country are illiterate. The Minister said that many people will not go to the polling booths because they do not understand the system.</P>
      <P>It is a sad reflection on us that we are not availing of this opportunity to be adventurous and to give a commitment to the electorate that at the next presidential election, photographs of the candidates will be included on that ballot paper.  I do not see any great problem or cost.  We would be recognising what the Department of Education is saying about the large number of people who are illiterate. I do not wish to embarrass anybody but everybody, in one way or another, has difficulty understanding the procedure and the use of a picture may make things simpler for everyone.</P>
      <P>We are always talking about helping the handicapped, restructuring buildings to facilitate wheelchair access, etc.  We did it in this House.  Floors were raised and people in wheelchairs can now visit parts of the building which were previously inaccessible.  Why can we not do something for people who are illiterate, particularly for the presidential election? What would it cost?  This change would benefit 400,000 adults, the figure provided by the Department of Education. Half of these people do not come to the polling booths and we are degrading them further by not catering for the fact that they cannot read.  It is sad enough that about 1 per cent of our population cannot see but let us not embarrass the 400,000 who can see but unfortunately cannot vote because they cannot read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> We should consider this innovation in the context of the presidential election and, if it is successful extend it to urban and local elections.  I can understand that there may be problems with general elections because of the number of candidates involved, but that can be changed.  If the form of voting in general elections is changed there would be fewer candidates.</P>
    <P>This new system could be introduced at little cost.  We are trying to help the handicapped so why not help those who cannot read?  The Department is prepared to say that we should be recognising this problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that 0.5 per cent of all the ballot papers in the presidential elections were void.  That is sad.  Many people do not vote 1, 2, 3, etc., in order of preference; instead they put an X opposite their choice and this means their ballot paper is void.  If there is only one X on the ballot paper it should be valid because only one name is marked.  This is another question which should be addressed.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and his Department to consider the inclusion of photographs on ballot papers.  It would not cost very much and Ireland could be to the forefront in this area.  This new system could be in place for the next presidential election. As the previous speaker said, there may not be a presidential election for some time if the President wishes to remain in office for a second period and the House and people agree that she should stay.  We are very proud of her and she is serving the country well.</P>
    <P>The President and the Tánaiste have replied to letters from people involved in the literacy campaign saying they will investigate and consider this idea, and that they agree with it in principle.  It would be strange to hear in Government circles that it should not be done because whenever Ministers make statements they ensure that their photograph is included.  This is important because there are many people who would look at that photograph and think the Minister is saying something of importance, even though they cannot read it.  Every opportunity <Col N="630" /> should be given to the voter.  We must remember that in other countries a person must vote and may have to pay a fine for not voting.  There is a lot to be said for making voting compulsory.</P>
    <P>We spend thousands of pounds every year advising people to register and to ensure that their voting papers are in order.  How much does that cost?  How many people over 18 years of age cannot read those advertisements and do not want to register because they cannot read or write?  We should give these people an opportunity.  If we can spend so much encouraging them to register, why can we not make it possible for them to understand what they are doing?  It is vital that we consider this possibility.  It would be an exceptionally good move and would cost very little.  With computerisation the ballot papers could be printed quickly and only one ballot paper would be required on the day.  This is a great opportunity for us to put the photographs of presidential candidates on the ballot paper and, if successful, we could use the system in other elections.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what Senator Cregan is saying and the thrust of Senator Dardis's remarks.  However, I oppose putting photographs on the ballot paper. For months, and sometimes years, before an election the candidate tries to influence the voter.  The voting booth is the only place where the voter is free from any pressure.</P>
      <P>I know people who cannot read must be helped but the art of professional photography is so advanced and sophisticated that certain photographs could look better than others.  I could show Senator Cregan two photographs of the same person and he would automatically choose one because the pupils have been highlighted.  If a photograph is to be taken of every candidate, who will be the photographer?  Will the same photographer photograph every candidate?</P>

      <P>For example, we could say that some Taoisigh look better than others but it does not necessarily imply that they will get more votes.  Some people look taller than others but they will not necessarily get more votes.  I could continue in that vein.</P>
      <P>We are discussing the possibility that one person may look better than another but we are ignoring the most important statistic from the Department of Education, that is, that 400,000 people are illiterate.  If half of them do not vote because of that, we are doing them an injustice.  We are prepared to give justice to other people.  We are prepared, for example, in our national plans and at Government level to give extra money to the handicapped.  Although it is not enough, at least there is a commitment and we recognise that problem.

      <Col N="632" /> It is important that the Minister read these statistics from the Department of Education.  The estimated number of adults with literacy needs and unlikely to be able to attain literacy is 44,000; nearly literate 110,000, sub-illiterate, 286,000.

      <P>When a person knows the candidate but cannot write down their preference, we have a duty to give them the right to see the person for whom they wish to vote.  It is very embarrassing for voters when somebody has to accompany them into the ballot box.  It is bad enough that a person in a wheelchair must be brought up a stairs in order to vote because the ballot paper cannot be brought downstairs but it is a sad reflection on us that so many do not vote because they cannot read what is on the ballot paper.  If they can see the candidate they can vote and we have a duty &mdash; irrespective of the candidate for whom they wish to vote &mdash; to consider that.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 5 gives wide discretion to the returning officer in the presidential election to prescribe the manner in which the photograph would be published on the ballot paper.  As a practising journalist, I know something about printing and it would be impossible, on the quality of paper used in ballot papers, to achieve the degree of sophistication mentioned by the Senator.  In any event, even if it was possible for one candidate to have a better picture on the ballot paper than another, the fact is that before a presidential election people are bombarded by posters showing the picture of the candidates.  They see them on the television, day in, and day out. They know exactly how the candidates look.</P>
      <P>People who know the presidential candidates' faces but who cannot read the ballot paper should be facilitated to vote. That is what we are seeking and it is possible to frame a procedure in the legislation which would preclude abuses of that facility.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> This matter was discussed on Committee Stage and <Col N="634" /> again today and there are mixed views on the issue of photographs.  As Senator Cregan has pointed out, many people are illiterate, but under existing law, which is restated in this Bill, a voter who is illiterate may ask to have the ballot paper marked by the presiding officer, so we are catering for those people.  We should not tie down in law the provision of photographs.  If we read section 32 carefully we see that the ballot paper will be prescribed by the Minister.  In the future the Minister of the day could consider amending the form of ballot paper to allow the inclusion of photographs. Suggestions have been up to me that instead of having photographs on the ballot paper, photographs could be shown on posters displayed in the polling station.  This could be another solution to the problem that would not require a change in the law.</P>
      <P>I assure Senators that I will bring their views to the Minister and see if at some stage in the future under section 32 he could consider the provision of photographs. Let us allow him to see what he can do at some future election to operate this system as suggested.</P>

      <P>The Minister is very sympathetic. He can see the merits in what we are saying.  Let us go a little further. He says we should not tie it down in legislation.  At the presidential election, 10,000 votes were spoiled.  I wonder why. Voters could not be opposed to the three parties.  What percentage of these votes was marked with an &ldquo;X&rdquo;?  That happens because voters do not know which candidate is which.  A photograph would help these people to recognise the candidate they want to vote for.</P>
      <P>The Minister is going further in suggesting that the photographs could be displayed outside the doors.  No more than 18 months ago we passed legislation to ensure that no canvassing or electioneering may take place outside polling stations.</P>

We did not have television.  We did not have access to the high technology material that is available to us now which will ensure that every voter will know exactly what the candidate of their choice looks like before the day of the election. All we are asking is that when they go to vote they should be facilitated.</P>
      <P>Remarks made by Senator Cregan give rise to a question in relation to the postering aspect of elections.  Am I correct in thinking that the provisions which we introduced on postering for general elections apply equally to the presidential election?  Is it the case that we cannot have these posters displayed all the way into the polling booths at a presidential election?  These posters were at one time used to influence voters on their way into the polling station.  We have stopped that but we should still facilitate those people who are excluded and we should include them in the democratic process.  This is one very effective way of doing that.</P>

In most countries some form of seal or other device is placed on the ballot paper at the time of issue.  In the past an embossing instrument was used at elections here. Disputes arose occasionally as to whether there was a faint embossed mark on a paper.

    <P>&ldquo;40.&mdash;Section 7 of the Act of 1992 is hereby amended by the deletion of subsection (1) and the substitution of the following:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(1) A person shall be entitled to be registered as a presidential elector in a constituency if he has reached the age of eighteen years and if he was, on the qualifying date, a citizen of Ireland, and&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) ordinarily resident in that constituency, or</P>
    <P>(ii) residing outside the State but was ordinarily resident in that constituency within the period of the preceding five years.</P>
    <P>(2) The Minister shall make regulations providing for</P>
    <P>(i) the inclusion in the register of presidential electors resident outside of the State, and</P>
    <P>(ii) a scheme of voting for presidential electors resident outside of the State.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment would have the effect of extending the franchise to emigrants. We have had a long debate on this matter and there are practical difficulties with regard to a general election.  In a presidential election there would be reasonable notice of its being held and the candidates are the same in all constituencies. We must do something to extend the franchise to emigrants.</P>
    <P>What is proposed here is that it would be extended to people who within the preceding five years would have been ordinarily resident in that constituency but who are now residing outside the State.  This is a realistic attempt to extend the franchise for the primary office in the State to people who for various reasons are no longer living in the country and have only been gone a maximum of five years.  There has been much talk about giving votes to the many emigrants throughout the world, particularly in America, Australia and England.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> There are practical difficulties relating to the question of general or local elections but this would be easier to manage in presidential elections and I ask the Minister of State to accept this amendment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Senator Cosgrave has said.  This is not a novel idea but is one that has been accepted in other countries for many years.  It is a sad reflection on us that we give the impression of being a nation of the future and readily claim that we are more advanced than other nations which may be older than us.  American citizens, irrespective of where they are in the world, are entitled to a postal vote in their presidential elections.  They take particular pride in that.  I know people in the Cork area who have dual Irish American citizenship and they are entitled to vote in the American presidential election.  Why should we should not allow the same facility to our emigrants? We want agreements with other countries and we want to get more of our exports into other countries, yet we are not prepared to extend these rights to our emigrants.  We have talked about our democracy, about being broadminded and liberal but that is questionable. Senator Cosgrave's amendment is constructive and sets an example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the last election one party claimed that all emigrants would have the vote as soon as possible.  That seems to have been smothered and has gone out of date like other promises.  I have no objection to it.  The opportunity is in our presidential election.  If the Minister was prepared to consider it for another election, such as a by-election, this would be awkward because people could request the vote who may not be from the constituency. However, a presidential election where two or three people are being considered for one position is an opportunity which we should not be afraid of. I am surprised that under this Bill the matter was not included for consideration by the Government parties.  It was the <Col N="641" /> commitment by one of the parties in Government.  This matter should be considered, although I readily admit the opportunity of putting it into effect may not arise for another 11 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been dragging our feet on this matter for several years. As the Senator has remarked, there was a general view among several parties that this matter should be dealt with.  I remember that it was trenchantly argued when similar legislation was brought before the last Seanad.</P>
      <P>We all accept the practical difficulties of implementing this measure, but other countries have done this successfully and there is no reason we should not be able to learn from them.  We are not saying everybody is going to vote.  People have to register and there is the restriction that they would have had to live within the constituency within the preceding five years.  Personally I would extend this provision, but if we even began with five years I would regard it as a positive step.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that the President has a light burning in Aras an Uachtarán to remind her of our emigrants and to indicate that there is a welcome for them in our country.  We have exported our people over a long period.  If those people feel such an attachment to the country, as they do, that they wish to vote in a presidential election, then they should be able to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must also be remembered that the President, more than anybody else in this country, has visited our emigrant groups around the world and has had contact with these groups.  From this viewpoint also these emigrants should have an input into who should be President.  I do not believe that every person who has left this country will wish to vote in a presidential election.  I am sure that many of them would wish to have nothing to do with the political process in this country. However, it is the same point as was made about those who are illiterate, namely that if they wish to do so, the responsibility of the State is to facilitate them.  Those people who are spread across the world, who still look to us and <Col N="642" /> are interested in what is taking place in the country and who would like to have their input into who should be President should be entitled to do so.</P>
    <P>We should not get hung up about the effect these people might have on the outcome of an election.  That is an irrelevancy. If that argument was to be pursued to its logical conclusion, one could say that all the members of Senator O'Toole's teaching trade union should not have a vote because they might have an influence on the outcome of an election. Of course they have an influence on the outcome of an election.  Let them exercise their franchise.</P>

      <P>I support the intention of the amendment.  There may be problems with the details.  The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to moving towards votes for emigrants.  As far as I am aware a revue committee has been established which has not yet reported.  There are many details which have to be considered fully and there has to be expertise involved in considering the detail of drafting legislation. I would be willing to wait until the revue committee reports to ensure that we proceed correctly.  We have been waiting for votes for emigrants to some degree for quite a long time and many people have been calling for this measure.  However, it has to be undertaken properly.  I await the Minister's view on the detail of the situation and I defer to the expertise of whoever is reviewing the question.</P>
      <P>In principle I am in favour of extending votes to certain categories of emigrants, especially those who have emigrated in the recent past and have the intention of returning to Ireland, not those who have gone for life but only for a short period.</P>

      <P>The first refuge always is the Constitution.  The second refuge is drafting and we go steadily downhill from there and we are all in favour of things in principle.  I have the utmost confidence that the gentlemen who sit behind the Minister are able to devise a form of words which will allow us to achieve the <Col N="643" /> objective, which is to give people the vote.  It is easy to do so and let us proceed. There are models all over the world to consider.</P>

      <P>The point was made that we should wait for the Department to define the type of person who is entitled to a vote.  I am not sure what is meant by that.  Over 18 years of age is enough for me.  One does not then define who is and who is not an emigrant.</P>

      <P>Five years.  The opportunity is there for anybody who has gone for the last five years.  If the Senator wants to change that to life, I will agree.  I would accept a proposal from the Government side today that any person over 18 years of age who was born in Ireland and had to emigrate will have a vote in a presidential election.  Such a proposal will be acceptable to this side of the House.</P>
      <P>However, let no one say to me that they are waiting for the experts to suggest that one person should be entitled to something but another person should not.  How is this to be defined in law? How do we say that one person is entitled and one is not?  How do we define, for example, that certain people can play for the Republic of Ireland team?  Is that not the same situation?</P>

      <P>As Members will note from the second part of the amendment, which we had the foresight to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister shall make regulations providing for</P>
      <P>(i) the inclusion in the register of presidential electors resident outside of the State, and</P>
      <P>(ii) a scheme of voting for presidential electors resident outside of the State..&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am sure the officials in the Minister's Department will, at an early stage if this amendment is passed, be able to bring forward such regulations.  Senator Dardis is correct in saying that we are great at putting off measures.  Parliamentary draftsmen appear to be a rare species and difficult to find.  Even when they are found it is difficult to get them to bring forward certain Bills.  This amendment specifies a certain number of years.  The period of time might be debated but at least it takes the initial step towards giving emigrants the franchise.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> In the last six weeks there have been many debates in both Houses and in committees on votes for emigrants, on the Presidential Elections Bill, the Electoral Reform Bill and the European Parliament Elections Bill. The issue has been widely discussed and opinions have varied, even within a political party.  The Fine Gael Party today supports this amendment and on Committee Stage in a Select Committee recently Deputy Doyle, Fine Gael spokesperson on the Environment, favoured Seanad representation for emigrants. The difference of opinion exists not alone in Fine Gael but in my party, the Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats who have consistently expressed the viewpoint put here by Senator Dardis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Despite what Senator Dardis says, the legal advice available to the Government is that under the relevant provisions of our Constitution it would not be possible to extend voting rights to citizens who are not part of the population of the State except to limited categories, such as those who are only abroad for a short period.</P>
      <P>In response to Senator Cregan, the right to vote for emigrants will not be decided by officials nor by the Minister for the Environment or myself.  It will be decided by the people at a referendum. Article 12.2 of the Constitution clearly outlines who is currently entitled to vote.</P>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government accepts in principle that there should be constitutional change to give voting rights for emigrants.  That acceptance in principle is not confined to the two Government parties.  All parties think emigrants should have some voting rights.</P>
      <P>The issue is being examined at present by the Minister.  The examination will be comprehensive and all options will be fully considered, including those put forward today and previously by other Members of the Oireachtas.  The examination will be thorough in that it will explore the detailed technical arrangements required to give effect to each option and the nature of the constitutional amendment each might require.  When the review is completed the Minister will bring it to Government and will then have to decide on a referendum and what system will be put to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are significant differences of opinion on this matter.  While there is a desire to establish a link between emigrants and the Oireachtas, no consensus has emerged as yet as to what form the link might take.  The Government's examination will clarify these matters and we should be prepared to allow time for this to be completed.  It has been widely acknowledged that within the lifetime of this Government a formula will be <Col N="646" /> devised to give votes to emigrants.  It has yet to be decided whether that will be for a presidential election, a general election or a European election.  Senators should await completion of the review when we will put in place a system which will be satisfactory to everyone.  The Irish people will have the right to accept or reject the proposed system.</P>
    <P>The examination is departmental and is being carried out on the same basis as the examination of a policy in any other field but that is not to say the examination may not be broadened at a later stage. Consultations with other Departments will be required, especially the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General.  I hope we will be able to make adequate arrangements for emigrant voting but matters are at an early stage.  The question will only be clarified when it comes before Government and is put before the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is sad that the Minister says some form of consensus will be considered in the future and that the Irish people will have to decide whether to change the Constitution.  Not all the Irish people will decide that question because the several thousand Irish people who leave each year will not receive consideration because they are not long living in this country.  How many people leave Ireland each day?</P>
      <P>The consensus should be that anyone born in the Republic of Ireland who is now over 18 years of age should be entitled to vote in an election.  I resent some parties saying all emigrants will have the vote because it is part of the Programme for Government.  I would not agree with &ldquo;some form of consensus&rdquo; but I would agree with a consensus that everyone be treated equally.  All the Irish people should agree to a change in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a sad reflection on us that when our Constitution was written it said those who did not live in Ireland were not entitled to anything.  No other country has lost more people to other lands in proportion to its population than Ireland. Who drew up the Constitution and <Col N="647" /> decided emigrants do not have rights equal to those who live here?  The consensus which should be put before us is that those over 18 born in the Republic of Ireland are entitled to vote here, irrespective of where they live.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has already admitted that approximately 700 ballot papers in the last presidential election did not have the official mark.  Seven hundred ballot papers may not be a large amount when one considers the 1.5 million votes cast, but we must not forget that certain Presidents would not have been elected if one ballot paper in every ballot box had been invalid.  Therefore, every vote is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has admitted there are problems with regard to ballot papers which are not officially marked.  Why is this happening in a technological world? Has consideration been given to the introduction of a pilot scheme, particularly in urban areas, so that we can ascertain who wants to vote at a particular time of day, because delays annoy people?  People have the right to vote.  In <Col N="649" /> other countries one must vote.  Does the Minister suggest that every person over the age of consent should vote?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is not about the official mark, although I agree with what has been said about it; I am concerned about the ruling on the validity of papers and the first preference and the intention to have, on the one hand, a national returning officer and, on the other, to do this Dail constituency by Dail constituency.  In the last European election ballot papers which were marked four, five and six or five, six and seven were ruled as being valid in three of the four constituencies because two elections were held on the one day.  The returning officer in three of the constituencies said there was a clear preference indicated if one started at five or six, etc.  However, in Leinster the returning officer ruled that the papers were invalid.  I am not disputing their right to do that, although that ruling was challenged in the court and the returning officer's point of view was upheld.</P>
      <P>There could be discrepancies across the board if local returning officers in each Dail constituency have a different point of view.  Can the Minister say what procedure could be put in place to prevent this happening because it could be crucial in an election?  For example, in Leinster the margin between the last candidate elected and the succeeding candidate was quite small.  Uniformity is needed across the board because returning officers should not be allowed to make decisions in this regard.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> As I said the last day, the Government is concerned about the need for uniformity across the country.  For that reason, discussions will take place with the local returning officers about how uniformity can be achieved.  Concern has been expressed that in various counties returning officers deal differently with matters.  I assure Senator Dardis and all Senators that discussions will take place about how uniformity can be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> In relation to Senator Cregan's point, the Government is looking at a range of possibilities in relation to security arrangements for ballot papers.  I agree with Senator Cregan that 778 ballot papers had no official mark at the last presidential election, and that is too many.  The Government is trying to eliminate mistakes and it is examining different procedures and regulations to see how this position can be improved.  If a presiding officer makes a mistake, the returning officer can replace him.  The Government is considering improvements in this area and I take on board some of the points made by Senator Cregan.  I agree that we should look at ways to reduce the figure of 778 to 78 and my Department is doing this at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 48 (1) (b), (c) and (d) must be highlighted because they are important.  Section 48(1) reads:</P>
      <P>(c) on which the figure 1 standing alone indicating a first preference, or the word &ldquo;one&rdquo; or any other mark which, in the opinion of the local returning officer, clearly indicates a first preference, is set opposite the name of more than one candidate, or</P>
      <P>(d) on which anything is written or marked which, in the opinion of the local returning officer, is calculated to identify the elector,</P>
      <P>shall be invalid and not counted, but the ballot paper shall not be invalid by reason only of its bearing the words &ldquo;one&rdquo;, &ldquo;two&rdquo;, &ldquo;three&rdquo; (and so on) or any other mark which, in the opinion of the local returning officer, clearly indicates a preference or preferences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point we made earlier is relevant to these sections.  A photograph would solve this problem.  This Bill, particularly this section, is contradicting the argument which has been made about photographs. I ask the Minister to consider this idea for forthcoming elections because, as one Senator said, there may not be a presidential election for 11 years.  This matter <Col N="651" /> should be dealt with now.  There would be no problems if a photograph was included on the ballot paper.</P>

If there are two or three candidates and the candidate with the lowest amount of votes is eliminated, in a PR system are the votes divided proportionally?

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a statement to the Seanad today on the very important Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations.  The debate is timely in view of the likely imminent conclusion of these long-running GATT negotiations and their potential impact on the world trading system in the coming years.  You will be aware that the Lower House debated this issue earlier this week when the Government's handling of the negotiations was endorsed.  This is, of course, not the first time the issue has been addressed in this House and Members will be familiar with the background and history of the negotiations. Nevertheless it would be useful to recall very briefly the main events.</P>
      <P>The negotiations commenced in September 1986 and were scheduled to conclude in December 1990 but did not do so because sufficient progress had not been made in many areas, including agriculture. Agriculture is, of course, but one of 15 different subjects under consideration in these negotiations.</P>
      <P>The Uruguay Round is the most ambitious series of negotiations ever undertaken in the GATT and it is the first time that an attempt has been made to bring areas such as services and intellectual property rights under GATT rules and disciplines.  It is also the first time agriculture is being dealt with in a comprehensive way in the GATT.  This is because ever escalating budgetary costs, structural surpluses and trade disputes involving agriculture products had convinced the major contracting parties that some action was necessary in respect of agricultural trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> However, while there was agreement on the need for action, there was no consensus on the extent of the adjustment necessary.  In particular, the US and CAIRNS Group, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Argentina and Brazil, were initially insisting upon the elimination of almost all agricultural support and protection measures.  They have modified their position considerably in the interim, in recognition of the fact that the Community was not willing to undermine the CAP, but, nevertheless, differences remain to be resolved before an agreement can be concluded.</P>
    <P>In the absence of consensus on a number of issues, including agriculture, in December 1991 the then Director General of the GATT put forward proposals known as the Draft Final Act for the conclusion of the negotiations in all areas.  The Community was unable to accept these because it believed they were unbalanced especially with regard to agriculture.  The Council instructed the Commission to participate in further negotiations with a view to securing a more global and balanced package.  After lengthy discussions, the US and Commission negotiators reached an outline agreement on some elements which modify the Draft Final Act and which together now form the basis of the current draft outline agreement on agriculture.</P>
    <P>The main elements of such an agreement, which would be implemented over a six year period beginning in 1995 are: domestic supports other than CAP reform compensatory payments and similar payments elsewhere would be reduced by 20 per cent; border measures such as variable levies would be converted to tariff equivalents which would then be reduced by 36 per cent; minimum access commitments of up to 5 per cent of domestic consumption would be provided for and current access would be maintained; average 1986-90 subsidised exports would be reduced by 36 per cent in budgetary terms and by 21 per cent in <Col N="657" /> volume terms with volumes falling to the 1986-90 average less 3.5 per cent in the first year.  The Commission has agreed that existing limitations on exports to South- East Asia would be continued; and finally, a &ldquo;peace clause&rdquo; which the Commission claims would protect the CAP system from challenge.  The essential modifications secured compared to the Draft Final Act were the exclusion of various direct payments agreed under CAP reform from support cuts, a reduction in the export volume commitment from 24 per cent to 21 per cent and the introduction of a peace clause.</P>
    <P>It is important to make clear that the draft agreement has not yet been put to Council and as such has not been endorsed by the Community.  Neither has it been accepted by the US nor by other contracting parties.</P>
    <P>Before commenting on the draft agreement in detail I would like to state that the Government is committed to a successful and balanced conclusion to the negotiations.  Such an agreement would provide a much needed boost to the world economy and also bring stability to the world trading system.  This could be very beneficial to Ireland.  We have a small open economy and it is of major importance that we have a stable economic trading environment for our future economic development.  In this regard, almost two-thirds of Irish output is exported and a similar proportion of our manufacturing jobs depend on exports. Our reliance on export markets is even more pronounced in the agriculture and food sectors.  This does not mean, however, that we are prepared to accept an agreement at any cost.  We have always insisted that an agreement must be balanced and must not impose a disproportionate burden on any country or sector.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware that we have major concerns with certain elements of the proposed outline agreement and that we expressed these concerns from the outset.  In this regard I draw your attention <Col N="658" /> to the following extract from the statements issued by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, on 20 November 1992, the day the Blair House agreement was concluded:</P>
    <P>He remained very concerned at the outcome in regard to volume limitations on subsidised exports, particularly insofar as they will affect the beef and dairy sectors.  He will need to be clear that these can be accommodated within the CAP reform arrangements before there can be any question of his acceptance of the agreement in the Agriculture Council.</P>
    <P>We have continued to express those concerns at every opportunity and in all appropriate for a since then.</P>
    <P>Our main difficulty is with the proposed commitment to reduce the volume of subsidised exports by 21 per cent, the timescale for applying this, the absence of arrangements to deal with intervention stocks and the continuation of the restriction on subsidised exports to South-East Asia.  We have other difficulties with the draft agreement, including those relating to the scope and duration of the peace clause and the need to ensure the Community's approach to market access, particularly aggregation, if fully secured in any final agreement.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, some positive elements in the draft agreement, in particular the exemption from GATT disciplines of CAP reform compensation and the safeguarding of Community support arrangements from GATT challenges. The Commission has also given specific assurances that it has agreed with the US that disadvantaged areas payments would be exempt from the support reduction commitment.  We are seeking to ensure this understanding is legally underpinned in any final agreement.</P>
    <P>Our view is that the current proposed commitments would create difficulties for Community and Irish agriculture in a number of sectors.  This is the case particularly in the beef sector where exports <Col N="659" /> would have to be reduced substantially in the first year of an agreement compared to the average levels for 1991 and 1992, although the position may not be as bad when compared to the estimated export levels for 1993.  There could also be problems, but on a smaller scale, in the milk, pigmeat and poultry sectors.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to assess in any detailed way the likely impact of the proposed commitments for individual sectors or the economies of member states.  The position is that commitments would be undertaken by the Community as a whole and the actual impact in the different sectors or economies will depend on a range of factors, including any necessary adjustments to internal mechanisms to implement the agreed undertakings.  This would be a matter for the Council.  In any discussions within the Community, we will, of course, be seeking assurances that the internal arrangements agreed will take full account of the particular importance of agriculture for Ireland, especially in the livestock sector.  In anticipation of this we sought and obtained an explicit undertaking from the Council, when the Community's offer on agriculture was being finalised in November 1990, that any adjustments would be shared out equitably, taking account of the particular difficulties of certain categories of farmers or regions.  The economic and social cohesion provisions of the Treaty of Rome would, in any event, necessitate this being done.  We will continue to press that particular interests in this area will have to be addressed in a meaningful way before we could give our consent to any agreement.</P>
    <P>As I indicated already, the Government has taken every opportunity, both bilaterally and multilaterally, and in all relevant fora to raise our concerns.  Most recently the matter was considered in great detail at a Joint General Affairs/Agriculture Council on 20 September 1993, when the council re-examined <Col N="660" /> the compatability of the draft agreement with the CAP in the light of the Commission's acceptance that some circumstances had changed since the agreement was negotiated.  More specifically, cereals stocks levels were now higher and the agrimonetary situation had partially eroded the expected impact of CAP reform.</P>
    <P>Ireland and France expressed serious reservations on the agreement while various other delegations raised specific points of interest to them.  The issues raised included the peace and safeguard clauses, the timing and phasing of commitments, disposal of intervention stocks, aggregation, growth of world markets and cereal substitutes imports. In its conclusions, the Council confirmed the Community will ensure its international engagements are compatible with the CAP and that the result of the Uruguay Round for agriculture will not, directly or indirectly, jeopardise the durability of the CAP or its basic principles. The Council also underlined the need to maintain the Community's export vocation and to ensure the presence of its agricultural products on international markets.</P>
    <P>In the light of the discussions, certain general guidelines were defined for the Commission for the conduct of further discussions on a bilateral and multilateral basis in the search for an agreement which is balanced and acceptable to all parties.  These guidelines, which include our concerns, were reconfirmed by the Council on 4 October, by the European Council on 29 October and the Agriculture Council on 17 October.</P>
    <P>The Commission held discussions with the US on 27 September and on 13 October at which it raised the reinterpretation of the draft agreement as directed by the Council.  The public US response was that it was not prepared to modify or reinterpret the agreement.  This was not unexpected as the US has been preoccupied with the North-American Free Trade Agreement &mdash; NAFTA &mdash; and was <Col N="661" /> unwilling to negotiate seriously on agriculture or, indeed, on other aspects of the round until this issue was out of the way.  As Senators will be aware, the favourable vote in the US House of Representatives last night will now allow the Administration to focus on the GATT negotiations and will have increased the prospects for concluding the round.</P>
    <P>I expect the US will be prepared to agree to some adjustment of the draft outline agreement on agriculture.  It is expected that Sir Leon Brittan will meet again with US Trade Secretary, Mr. Kantor, next week when the situation should become clearer.</P>
    <P>The agricultural aspects of the negotiations were considered at this week's meeting of Agriculture Ministers when our Minister, Deputy Walsh, again outlined our concerns and the conditions on which he will insist before he can accept an agreement.  The Commissioner again undertook to seek solutions to the problems indentified.</P>
    <P>In assessing our approach to any final agreement on agriculture account will have to be taken of the consequences of failure to reach an agreement.  The negotiations have long exceeded their original time scale, and while this has not caused any major disruption in trade up to now, it cannot be assumed this would continue to be the case.  There is a limit on the number of times the negotiations can fail to conclude without a significant loss of credibility in the world's multilateral trading system.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, agricultural products have been at the centre of several trade disputes during recent years and this would almost certainly be the case again.  It is also expected that some contracting parties would challenge the Community's agriculture support systems in the GATT.  There would also be an increased tendency towards regional and bilateral trade agreements which would not necessarily be in the Community's interests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="662" /> The Government remains committed to achieving a global and balanced agreement on agriculture and will continue to urge the Commission to seek solutions to the problems identified.  If the outcome cannot be contained within the reformed CAP, then we will be seeking appropriate arrangements to ensure our agriculture sector and farmers' incomes are maintained at levels envisaged when the CAP reform package was agreed.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset, agriculture is only one of the areas under discussion and there are serious problems in other areas which have yet to be resolved.  Much work remains to be done in the short time remaining if a comprehensive and balanced agreement is to be reached by 15 December.  The view is, however, that, given the political will, it should be possible to agree the broad outlines of such an agreement within the deadline with perhaps the details to be concluded later.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision on a final agreement covering all areas will be taken in the light of whether, and to what extent, our problems have been addressed. I reiterate once again our commitment to concluding a comprehensive and balanced agreement and that the Government will make every effort to ensure this goal is achieved.</P>

      <P>I was complaining about the overall time.  I understood that we were to get four hours to make statements on this matter.  However, this is not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity, particularly at a time when negotiations are at a critical stage.  It is obvious that the other <Col N="663" /> countries involved in the negotiations such as the US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia are dragging their feet and taking up intransigent positions in the discussions with the EC, as we get closer to the deadline, in the hope that the French and Irish will concede to their demands.  They also have the comfort of knowing that some of our partners in the EC, particularly the more industrialised nations, favour these proposals.  I believe that the visit of Leon Brittan to Washington was no more than shadow boxing. I do not believe that any progress was made in view of the intransigent position which the US are taking at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister must make this a veto issue.  Ireland is relatively more vulnerable to the export cuts in the proposed GATT agreement than any other EC country.  Cuts in EC markets, prices and production &mdash; especially in our vital beef and dairy sector &mdash; as proposed under the Blair House agreement are likely to be magnified in Ireland.  If we examine these proposals, one important issue arises &mdash; the capping of the volume of agricultural production in the EC while the US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia are preparing for expansion in all areas of agricultural produce.  It puzzles me how Ray McSharry allowed it to happen, I do not know the explanation. This is the key issue.</P>
    <P>In such important negotiations, as far as this country and Irish agriculture is concerned I do not trust Mr. Peter Sutherland, the director general of GATT, simply because he is now playing on the world stage which is far removed from the Irish farmer.  I know him extremely well, he is a good friend of mine and I have great regard for him. However, his knowledge of agriculture and its problems was limited even before he became the director general of GATT. Having examined his progress to date, it seems that he is intent on railroading through the draft Blair House agreement under the threat &mdash; and this is what I do <Col N="664" /> not like &mdash; of a world economic disaster if the deal is not accepted as it stands. This seems a most unreasonable attitude and cannot be accepted by Ireland under any circumstances.</P>
    <P>Effectively, Mr. Sutherland is saying that European agriculture should lie down and accept all the pain of a GATT deal in order to appease the US agritrade corporations.  Mr. Sutherland should learn from his rebuff, particularly from the French government, that the Blair House deal went too far for the EC as a whole to accept.  The draft accord on agricultural trading is a flawed deal which neither respects the principles of GATT nor the values of the European countries towards family farming.  There is a grave doubt in my mind about how neutral Mr. Sutherland is in respect of European farming.  I would question whether he is a pro-active agent on behalf of world trade interests rather than European farming.</P>
    <P>As the GATT negotiations stand, the European Community will be obliged to lower its internal agricultural prices to world price levels; to reduce, accordingly, the level of export refunds and import levies required to sustain the target international price levels; to substantially dismantle price support arrangements &mdash; this is the one which I and many other people do not like.  The EC will also be obliged to guarantee expanded access to Community markets for meat, dairy products and other key products by exporters in other GATT partners, while itself suffering a reduction in its ability to export.  That is the crunch issue.</P>
    <P>Finally, the EC will be obliged to accept that its meat exporters will continue to be excluded from the rapidly growing Japanese market for meat.  We do not understand this.  The Japanese must import almost 50 per cent of their meat requirements.  They are big sellers in Europe of cars and other products, yet the Americans believe that they have the right to exclude the EC from this market. <Col N="665" /> As far as we are concerned, we are building up our trade with the Japanese in several areas, including fish.  This exclusion is unacceptable in every respect to Ireland.</P>
    <P>At the same time, GATT partner countries, particularly the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, will benefit from new opportunities to increase their exports.  They will not be obliged to accept any discipline or restriction on their production levels.  Neither will they be obliged to give any reciprocal guarantees of market access to EC producers. These provisions are seriously unbalanced. The EC must suffer restrictions as its partners gain opportunities for expansion. No such imbalance can be seen in any other part of the emerging agreement. No other sector will lose as much as agriculture in the EC generally, and in Ireland in particular.  The Minister of State mentioned that there are 15 other areas but agriculture is the important one to Ireland, and to a certain degree to France and some other EC countries.  We have not seen restrictions in other areas such as we have seen in agriculture.  The battle has been fought since 1986 and it is still going on.</P>
    <P>The last time the Minister for Agriculture was here I pointed out the figures in respect of the different areas.  I am going to restate those figures because they are important and should be taken into the equation.  I will deal with beef first.  It should be remembered at the outset that the price for beef is 40p per pound in Argentina and in Australia it is 50p per pound carcase weight.  Those are the prices at the moment.  EC beef output is about eight million tonnes per annum. As consumption stands at about 6.8 million tonnes, this leaves a surplus of 1.2 million tonnes yearly.</P>
    <P>The proposed GATT limit on beef exports for 1994 will be less than one million tonnes.  This means a reduction in exports of over 200,000 tonnes compared to the 1992 levels.  The proposal to cut export refunds by 36 per cent over six <Col N="666" /> years will mean a cut of approximately £32 on a 100 kilogram live bullock or a cut of 24p per pound on beef sides.  Those are the figures issued by the Minister of State's Department.</P>
    <P>If the EC has to live with a beef export limit of 800,000 tonnes there will be horrendous consequences for this country. At a minimum, there will be extensive calf slaughtering and early intervention for cattle, which we do not want to let happen.  This would have consequences in respect of money earned for the country and the loss of jobs in factories.  Those are the two issues which we must watch.</P>
    <P>The situation will worsen if EC beef consumption declines.  As Ireland exports 80 per cent of its beef, we will be the most exposed member state.  The EC beef intervention intake for 1992 was in the order of 900,000 tonnes.  Under the CAP reform agreement this was to be reduced to 350,000 tonnes by 1997.  Those are the figures from the Minister of State's Department.  Where will this unwanted beef go?  The simple and stark prospect for Irish farmers is that there will be some 200,000 unwanted cattle. This unavoidable surplus could devastate Irish agriculture and cause an unprecendented crisis.  There has never been, and probably never will be, intervention for heifers.  We all know that when the market is overloaded the price of heifers will collapse, as has happened on numerous occasions.</P>
    <P>It seems that the full extent of these decisions has not been acknowledged by the Government in its response to date. I am somewhat disappointed because it is not so long ago since the Minister was here and these things were pointed out to him.  I am not blaming the Minister of State for his speech today but these issues have not been dealt with on a product by product basis.  We asked the Minister during the last debate to do this.  He did not.  It is incredible how the Americans can have such cheek regarding access to the Japanese market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="667" /> With regard to milk, the proposed 21 per cent cut in the volume of EC dairy exports will mean a cut of 24 per cent to milk producers on the 1991 levels of production.  The CAP reforms for dairying outlined two 1 per cent quota cuts. This will not be sufficient to meet the GATT requirements.  It is proposed that dairy imports will rise to 5 per cent of the domestic market.  The combination of both will result in the necessity for a 5 per cent cut in our national milk quota. That 5 per cent cut is on top of a 2.5 per cent cut and a 4.5 per cent cut.  The figures seem to indicate another 5 per cent cut if we accept the present proposals.  The position will be especially critical for cheese exporters.  GATT may allow an increase in EC butter exports both inside and outside Europe but unfortunately there is no market available.</P>
    <P>Ireland is now facing the prospect of following Danish dairy production history. Over the past 30 years in Denmark, the number of milk producers has dropped from 185,000 to less than 15,000. Their goal is to have one dairy co-operative. At present one co-operative controls 85 per cent of the total Danish milk production and they are heading towards their goal at high speed.  That gives some indication of the strength of one co-operative representing almost 100 per cent of milk producers in their country and the advantages it brings.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, it is little wonder that the New Zealand dairy board has welcomed this GATT deal. Their price of 40p per gallon of milk is uneconomic here.  Their production cost per gallon is approximately 17p per gallon which leaves a profit of 23p per gallon.  The Minister must make clear in this debate what confirmation, if any, has been given that the US will allow Bord Bainne and others access to 5 per cent of the domestic consumption of dairy products. As 50 per cent of our dairy exports go to Third World countries, we are <Col N="668" /> particularly exposed under these proposals.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to point out to the Minister the price per gallon of milk in this country.  It is 17p per gallon in the countries about which we are talking and, depending on the level of borrowings in our own country, it works out at 85p per gallon approximately.  How does one bridge a gap like that?  How does one reduce our cost of production and compete in the same markets as these people?  That is where a serious problem will arise.</P>
    <P>Despite improvement in the efficiency of the pig meat sector, a crisis currently prevails for pig producers.  Since May 1992, there has been a 30 per cent reduction in price.  Early 1992 saw a level of profit of approximately £7 per pig. This has now changed to a loss of £8 per animal.  The critical issue for this sector is the aggregation of imports.  If more than 3 per cent of the total meat market is supplied by imports, pig meat, poultry and beef can be put together.  As current beef imports exceed the requirements, this could avoid the need for any additional pig meat imports into the Community.  The Government must clarify whether pig meat is to be separated from beef both on the export and import markets.</P>
    <P>The GATT changes could result in an extra 480,000 tonnes of pig meat in the EC market.  This is because in 1986 and 1988 EC imports of pig meat accounted for 0.5 to 0.8 per cent of consumption.  If this has to rise to 3 per cent in 1994 and 5 per cent in 1999, the surplus will have to be disposed of on a different market. I understand the Commission are proposing a 25 per cent reduction in the basic price of pig meat.  Further losses cannot be sustained in this sector if we are to ensure the survival of the pig industry.</P>
    <P>While sheep meat does not seem to have been extensively debated in the present round of GATT talks, we have a vested interest in minimising imports of New Zealand lamb.  At present there is a <Col N="669" /> voluntary restraint agreement governing such imports which is up for renewal this year.  New Zealand can sell up to 205,000 tons of lamb into the EC without any tariff.  New Zealand has been filling its quota early in the year and arguing for an increase.</P>
    <P>The Government must ensure a tough stance on this issue or the viability of our 52,000 sheep farmers will be put in jeopardy.  New Zealand is looking for a further increase of 40,000 tonnes of sheep meat in the new agreement.  This is outlandish because, particularly in the last three years, we have seen sheep producers pay dearly for the flooding of the French market.  I have always argued and will continue to argue that sheep meat from New Zealand should come at a particular time in the year and not when the markets are loaded.  They collapsed the French market in 1990, 1991 and 1992.  It has been a slightly better this year because there has been some regulation.</P>
    <P>The primary focus of attention in relation to cereals has been the oil seed crop.  The GATT proposal is that Europe's acreage cannot exceed 5.2 million hectares.  This entails a future cut of just 750,000 acres.  The French are set to lose far less in this sector than we are in overall terms.</P>
    <P>Under GATT, the volume of cereals exported must be reduced by 21 per cent. It is not yet known to what extent the CAP set aside programme will succeed in reducing grain tonnage.  The targeted grain reduction of 17 million tonnes and the level of grain exports will depend on the level of internal consumption of community grain for animal feed as against cereal substitute imports.  It is fundamentally not in the Irish interest to have a cheap grain feed policy to undermine our grass-based production system.</P>
    <P>The Minister must clarify the likely effects of set aside on specific crops. Some experts have argued that the 15 per cent requirement will have to be doubled to 30 per cent of tillage land.  This can only result in further imports and job <Col N="670" /> losses.  Winter grain production will disappear if a national average is used for individual base areas.  The effects on wheat and feeding barley, which both have growth potential in this country, need to be assessed so Teagasc can give the best advice to our efficient producers.</P>
    <P>It should be highlighted that this year the US is abolishing all set aside requirements for wheat and setting only a 5 per cent level of set aside for maize.  This is amazing.  How can they come here and negotiate caps on everything we have while they themselves are increasing their volume of production?  That is the main argument I have with these negotiations. They have consistently done that and they are doing it this year again.  I think those figures are correct.  I tried to get some documentation to that effect but I could not.  My information is that all the set aside is gone on one area and only about 5 per cent on maize.</P>
    <P>Ever since the Dromoland Castle affair, in which I think Ray MacSharry did a bad job for European farming, the whole area has been dogged with uncertainty and misinformation from both the current Government and its predecessor. It is no wonder that the US negotiators are fortunate enough to find themselves hoping they can maintain their position. No doubt we can also state at this stage that the brief given to Leon Britton was only half hearted and meant nothing as far as European and Irish agriculture is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Tanaiste, Deputy Spring, made an appalling tactical error in suggesting that internal EC compensation could solve the Irish problem.  It cannot solve the problem.  This is a dangerous road to go down because after so many years it is only a way of phasing out levels of production by giving some compensation and at the end of four or five years phasing it out, with a serious loss in production and loss of jobs.</P>
    <P>That is the position, as I see it, in relation to these negotiations.  The Minister's speech contained the phrase: &ldquo;conclusion <Col N="671" /> of these long running GATT negotiations and their potential impact on the world trading system in the coming years.&rdquo;  What they are saying is that they are using the other 14 areas to force the agricultural issue.</P>
    <P>I would rather the veto was used even if we were to wait until this time next year to get a trade agreement.  The trade agreement was to be made two years ago and was not.  There is no great disruption on trade; it is running nicely.  If we get the imbalance the Americans are hoping we will get, we will be in a serious situation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a statement on GATT.  I am delighted to note from the Minister's speech that the Government remains committed to achieving a global and balanced agreement on agriculture and will continue to urge the Commission to seek solutions to the problems identified. Being an agricultural country, it is important that the Government and its negotiators would treat agriculture as a priority in the GATT negotiations.</P>
      <P>GATT was established a long time ago and this Uruguay Round &mdash; the eighth round &mdash; was launched in 1986 with the objective of liberalising trade and extending the scope of the agreement to a number of new areas.  The objectives of the round for agriculture included, <i>inter alia,</i> bringing stability and balance to agricultural world trade through the correction of massive restrictions and distortions which have become an increasing feature of the trading regime in that sector.  This objective was further refined during the April 1989 mid-term review of the negotiations when it was agreed that a fair and market oriented agricultural trading system was to be achieved through negotiations on support and protection levels and the establishment of more effective GATT rules for the agriculture sector which is the only element in these negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> Agricultural trade featured in earlier rounds of negotiations but the Uruguay Round is the first to deal with agricultural trade in a comprehensive way.  The discussions on agriculture and certain other areas in GATT have proved very difficult. The difficulty has arisen mainly from different interpretations of the stated objectives of the negotiations particularly between the EC and the US and CAIRNS group.</P>
    <P>In an attempt to conclude the negotiations, the then Director General of GATT, Mr. Dunkel, put forward proposals covering all areas in December 1991, known as the Draft Final Act.  The Community was unable to accept these proposals because it believed they were unbalanced, especially with regard to agriculture.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Senator D'Arcy say that he did not trust the present Director General of GATT who is an Irishman and a former member of his party.  I have confidence that he will do a good job and deliver the goods for Ireland.  In this respect I compliment the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and his Ministers of State.  This is my first time to speak to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, and I congratulate and compliment him.  He is doing great work.  He is a former Senator and I wish him, the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, well especially in these GATT negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Commission was instructed by the Council to participate in further negotiations with a view to securing a more balanced and global package.  After prolonged negotiations, US and Commission negotiators reached an outline agreement on some elements of a possible agreement on agriculture in November 1992.  The essential modifications secured, compared with the Draft Final Act, were the exclusion of various direct payments agreed under CAP reform from support cuts, a reduction in the export volume commitment from 24 per cent to 21 per cent and a peace clause.</P>
    <P>The main elements of the draft agreement as it currently stands, which would cover a six year period, are: the CAP <Col N="673" /> reform compensatory payments and similar payments elsewhere would not be subjected to GATT discipline but the total support for each sector would be limited to 1992 levels under the peace clause; other internal supports would be reduced by 20 per cent; border measures &mdash; variable levies &mdash; would be reduced by 36 per cent; minimum access commitments of up to 5 per cent of domestic consumption would be provided for and current access would be maintained; average 1986-90 subsidised exports would be reduced by 36 per cent in budgetary terms and by 21 per cent in volume terms with volumes falling to that average less 3.5 per cent in the first year; the Commission has agreed that existing limitations on exports to east Asia would be continued; and a peace clause which the Commission claims would protect the CAP system from challenge.</P>
    <P>The draft agreement has not yet been approved by the Council and as such has not been endorsed by the EC.  It has not been accepted by the US Senate or Congress or by the other contracting parties. Given our small open economy, Ireland accepts that there is merit in a successful conclusion to the round which should promote international growth and lead to the strengthening of the multilateral trading system.  We have, however, insisted that the final package must be global and balanced and not impose a disproportionate burden on any sector or region.</P>
    <P>In general, our position has been that for agriculture the final outcome must not require the Community to take additional restrictive measures over and above the CAP reform decisions of 1992. I am pleased to note that Eileen Magner, Principal Administrator of the European Commission, &mdash; who hails from New-castlewest which is ten miles from where I live &mdash; said:</P>
    <P>The essential change represented by CAP reform is the break in the link between price support and production and the new emphasis on direct aid to farmers.  European agriculture will become much more competitive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> On a more recent occasion she stated that the CAP compensatory payments will not be subject to the commitment to reduce internal supports and neither will payments from agreed policies, such as headage payments.  She pointed out that if the Community imports reached a level which would undermine CAP reform consultations would be held with a view to finding a mutually satisfactory solution. She insisted that the GATT agricultural proposals fully complied with the objectives of CAP reform.  We need have no worry that the outcome from GATT will interfere with CAP reform which is important to this country.</P>
    <P>In that regard Ireland's analysis of the impact of the proposed agreement was that its commitments could not be contained within the parameters of the CAP reform decisions and that it would create serious difficulties for a number of sectors. In the case of the beef sector, for example, the analysis showed that the Community would be required to reduce output by 5 per cent, which was considerably in excess of what CAP reform would deliver.  In addition, there was a serious risk that the Irish beef sector would suffer disproportionately because of its reliance on export markets.  Moreover, the methodology for implementing the export restraint commitment and the existence of large scale intervention stocks would create enormous difficulties in the early years of the agreement.  The analysis concluded that difficulties would also arise in other sectors of importance to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Following the November 1992 agreement, a considerable amount of time was devoted to internal Community examination of the draft outline agreement regarding its compatibility with the reformed CAP and its general acceptability as a part of a final GATT agreement.  The Commission which negotiated the Blair House aspects contended that, apart from the beef sector where it claimed difficulties existed with or without a GATT agreement, the arrangements were compatible with the reformed CAP.</P>
    <P>In the case of beef, the Commission contended that the problems would be <Col N="675" /> dealt with under CAP mechanisms.  A majority of the member states either did not oppose the Commission viewpoint or were prepared to accept the draft agreement as the best attainable in current circumstances.  However, Ireland and France, and Belgium to a lesser extent, consistently rejected the Commission's analysis on compatibility.  Ireland and France consistently outlined the serious problems which they had with elements of the proposed agreement which they contended would require the Community to take additional restrictive measures over and above the CAP reform decisions of 1992.  In Ireland's case, the problems for the beef sector were highlighted, while France concentrated on the potential difficulties for cereals.  In both cases, the proposed volume restraint on subsidised exports was identified as the most potentially damaging aspect.  Both sides also highlighted other aspects which would be pursued in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>Following commitments in various fora to conclude the Uruguay negotiations by 15 December, attention has again been focused on the draft agriculture agreement.  Both France and Ireland again drew attention to the potential difficulties which the draft agreement poses for Community agriculture.  Both repeated their earlier concerns and stressed that development since the conclusion of the Blair House agreement &mdash; monetary fluctuations, increased stock levels etc. &mdash; had heightened these concerns.</P>
    <P>Against this background and with an implicit acceptance by the Commission that some circumstances had changed, a joint General Council on agriculture was held on 20 September 1993.  That Council re-examined the compatibility of the draft agreement with the CAP as reformed in 1992 and various delegations raised other specific points including the peace and safeguard clauses, cereal substitutes imports, the timing and phasing of commitments, the disposal of intervention stocks, aggregation and the growth of world markets.  In its conclusions, the Council confirmed that the <Col N="676" /> Community will ensure that international engagements are compatible with CAP and that the result of the Uruguay round for agriculture will not either directly or indirectly jeopardise the durability of the CAP or its basic principles.  It is very important for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to an important statement in the Minister's speech.  He said, &ldquo;the favourable vote of the United States House of Representatives last night will now allow the Administration to focus on the GATT negotiations and will have increased the prospects for concluding the Round.&ldquo;  Senator D'Arcy said that he would not mind if negotiations continued for another year.  It is important to conclude these negotiations on 15 December 1993.  I appreciate his point that we have done well without the completion of the round but nevertheless it is important for the future that these negotiations would be concluded fairly soon.  The work being done by our Minister and by EC officials will ensure that there will not be a damaging effect on agriculture.  The Minister states that there are of course positive elements in the draft agreement, in particular the exemption from GATT disciplines of CAP reform compensation. This is important and I am confident that the Minister will ensure that the exemption from GATT of the CAP reform compensations will be safeguarded and that the trade agreement under GATT will be acceptable and will be of benefit to agriculture in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak and to have the Minister present to hear us talk about GATT and not, as Senator Farrelly said a few moments ago, to speak about agriculture.  I stress that there is a difference.  There are now four weeks to go before time runs out for the GATT negotiations.  December 15 is three weeks from next Wednesday.  It is time, now that the American Congress vote on NAFTA is out of the way, for everybody to get down to the serious business of reaching agreement on the future of world trade, not just on agriculture. That includes this country. Ireland's contribution to the debate so far has not been very constructive.  That we have tended to identify our national interest with that of our farmers only is wrong.  Our national interest is considerably wider than that.</P>
      <P>I was delighted that the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland reminded us that the Government is committed to a successful and balanced conclusion to the negotiations.  I am not sure that we as a Government have been acting in that way.  In supporting the interests of Irish agriculture we have joined the French in wrecking tactics.  As a result we have made the reaching of this agreement considerably more difficult within that tight deadline of December 15.  Now that we have reached the fifty-ninth minute of the eleventh hour, we should give careful thought to what is likely to happen if that agreement is not reached.  Many people are labouring under the illusion that failure to agree will not change the present situation.  They believe it will simply be a lost opportunity to expand world trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Failure of the GATT negotiations would be much more serious than that. There is no question of continuing the present <i>status quo</i>.  Failure to conclude a GATT agreement would immediately change the face of world trade for the worst.  Without being sensationalist, I believe that failure would have consequences for Ireland that would be nothing short of catastrophic.  Failure <Col N="679" /> would signal a return to the protectionist philosophies of the 1930s, the &ldquo;beggar my neighbour&rdquo; attitude that created a win-lose situation in world commerce rather than the win-win situation which the GATT agreement is aiming to stimulate. We would end up with an economic trade was such as was experienced in the 1930s and in which we did not thrive.  We could not look forward to a repeat of that.  Failure would point the world in the direction where the biggest countries and the biggest trading block will do well but the smaller ones will not.  The world would withdraw into its national trading blocks and would treat those blocks as offensive bases in an aggressive trade war.</P>
    <P>As of early this morning the EC is no longer the world's largest trading block. That position is now taken by the new NAFTA which includes Canada, Mexico and the United Sates.  Let us remember that within hours of getting the NAFTA through Congress, President Clinton went to a summit meeting of the 18 nations of the Pacific rim, another block that is rapidly coming together and in which the US also intends to be the dominant partner.  What a GATT agreement can do is help make these regional blocks a springboard to wider world trade.  Without the agreement these blocks will just become warring factions.  Let nobody be in any doubt that it will be a dirty war. The United States has proved in the past that it knows well how to play &ldquo;hard ball&rdquo; on trade and it seems that it would nearly prefer to play that way.</P>
    <P>Why is this crucial to Ireland?  We hear people say that since three quarters of our trade is internal in the EC we would not be too badly affected by a trade war. That is nonsense.  We would be devastated. The reason is that in a world trade war Europe would come off badly and we have to realise that our ability to grow and to create jobs in Ireland is directly related to the prosperity of the countries we trade with.  If the countries of Europe are in recession as they are now our trade cannot grow.  If Europe loses out in a &ldquo;beggar my neighbour&rdquo;<Col N="680" /> type trade war then our trade will not only not grow it may even begin to contract. One of the big potential advantages of a GATT agreement for Europe is that it can improve the Community's trading performance with the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>The fallout in Ireland from a GATT failure will be real and will cost us thousands of jobs.  There is also a direct fallout for us.  A failure in GATT will affect our trading relationships with the United States, which is our fourth largest market overall and the most important market for many Irish-owned firms, the indigenous companies of which we talk so highly. We need to grow in the US market also and we will not do that in the context of a trade war.  Let us not be foolish enough to think that the Americans will treat us kindly because we are small or because so many of them have Irish grandmothers. The Americans see us as the soft underbelly of the EC and when they want to make a point in Europe they often home in on the products of the smaller countries in the community like Ireland.</P>
    <P>A further way in which we would be directly affected by GATT failure is in the vitally important area of services. Last evening in this House we had a debate focusing on this issue.  I argued that our economic future lies more in services than in manufacturing and that is where the jobs will come from.  It is in our own vital interest that world trade be opened up for services and that is what is being sought in these GATT negotiations. That is why I react strongly to the assumption that GATT is only about agriculture.  If there is agreement it will create new potential markets directly for Ireland by opening up services in this way.  It will be up to us to grasp that potential but we cannot do it if the potential is not there in the first place.</P>
    <P>These are some of the issues we should be thinking about in the next few weeks. We should stick up for our farmers but not at the risk of jeopardising the whole agreement.  There are many people around the world who will be only too happy to see the GATT talks fail and are also happy to be able to blame the EC <Col N="681" /> for letting that happen.  It would suit them well.  Let us be a part of putting a GATT agreement in place, not part of pulling the rug out from under it.  Our national interest points in that direction.  We badly need a GATT agreement immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if I will need the ten minutes that Senator Quinn has kindly given me and I feel a little humbled &mdash; an unaccustomed feeling for me &mdash; speaking after somebody who has such a wide experience of this area.  With regard to economics I am naive and I am almost totally innumerate, thanks to the Irish educational system.  When I contemplate a subject such as finance I look on it almost as a theological exercise as it does not seem to be a profoundly accurate science.  A former Member of the Oireachtas and Taoiseach once described the science of economics as a &ldquo;gloomy science.&rdquo;  To me money is just the symbolic representation of energy.  I would regard myself still as a socialist and there are certain things about this agreement that I do not like.  I regard it as part of a developing process and if Senator Quinn is correct in saying that it is a move toward a more general world view, then I hope that there is a civilised, decent and compassionate vision ultimately underlying it.  I doubt it, as it seems to me that all these negotiations are the incarnation of selfishness, the promotion of self interest and what Senator Quinn described as &ldquo;hard ball&rdquo;.  I will come back to that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in the Minister of State's speech particularly having read Deputy Dukes's speech a day or two ago in the Dáil in which he made a blistering attack on the Government's performance. Although I did not agree with all of it, it was most interesting to read. In his speech the Minister of State talked about the US and the CAIRNS group &ldquo;...initially insisting upon the elimination of almost all agriculture support and protection measures.  They have modified their position considerably in the interim...&rdquo; I thought this was &ldquo;hot&rdquo; news from the Government for the Seanad. When I looked at my notes from Deputy <Col N="682" /> Dukes's speech I realised that the Minister of State was saying exactly the same thing.  The only advantage as far as I am concerned is that it is a lot easier to read the Minister of State's script than to read my handwriting.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said domestic supports other than CAP reform compensatory payments and similar payments elsewhere would be reduced by 20 per cent and that variable levies converted to tariff equivalents would then be reduced by 36 per cent.  Deputy Dukes said he found it &ldquo;tariffying&rdquo; that this should happen.  There is a list of these things and the Minister of State is indicating that they are still in place.  I am not sure of the extent to which they have been modified and perhaps the Minister of State could let us know to what extent they represent an amelioration of our position.  I note that this group, the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, is permitted to increase its exports into the Community whereas our exports are frozen or have to be reduced.  That does not represent a level playing field.</P>
    <P>I have some sympathy for New Zealand and Australia as I know that they were caught out when Ireland and Great Britain joined the European Community and part of their traditional market was shorn away.  As a consequence, as Senator Quinn said and as I noticed when I was in Australia recently, they are no longer interested in Europe and are developing strong ties in the Pacific area, which is a significant and potentially extraordinarily wealthy region.</P>
    <P>Significantly, while we are pulling back in terms of dairy products, New Zealand has started to increase the levels of production because they are anticipating penetration into our market.  That is something which farmers have a right to be concerned about, although I agree that it is not simply a question of agriculture when considering the GATT. There are far more areas involved.  Perhaps the agreement is a little unbalanced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes mentioned the fact that he sat in on a meeting in Brussels which was addressed by Sir Leon Brittan. Deputy Dukes is a shrewd observer of <Col N="683" /> the scene and he suggested, in fact he bluntly stated, that Sir Leon Brittan could not give a damn about this country or its interests or the CAP and that he went to Washington for a meeting with Mr. Mickey Kantor in order to be able to say that he had done his best and had failed.  It is obvious that the Minister himself is aware that the preparatory discussions leading to the signing of the NAFTA agreement meant that the American interest was principally diverted to that matter and they were not especially bothered about this issue until NAFTA had been agreed.</P>
    <P>The NAFTA agreement divides people, and not just on a left, right basis. People like Mr. Ross Perot have come out strongly against the agreement and there is a significant feeling that it may lead to a drift southwards of jobs out of the USA because of the cheaper availability of labour in Mexico, which represents in a way a kind of exploitation. We are well aware of that here with the closure of computer firms, for example, and the way in which research and design is often repatriated back to the parent company in America, despite the fact that the Irish element may, as an individual component, be more profitable. The jobs are repatriated to America in their own interest.</P>
    <P>One of the significant elements in this agreement which I do not believe has been much addressed is the issue of patents, such as intellectual property rights, copyright in the music and video industry and so on.  I would like to see Irish native intelligence and ingenuity properly protected and not exploited in a transnational transfer of Irish ideas.</P>
    <P>There are certain areas where one must look a little sceptically at this agreement. For example, take the phrase &ldquo;free trade&rdquo;.  What is free trade?  I am putting on my naive act; I am not quite sure what is meant by free trade.  I wonder about some of these terms.  If, for example, one looks at the agreement on multi-fibre textiles, it is obvious under the bland language in which it is dressed up that this is a vehemently defensive arrangement <Col N="684" /> on the part of the wealthier nations of the European Union and the Americans under the GATT to try to prevent the development of these kinds of industries in the deprived areas of the Third World.  How happy is the Minister, a good socialist, about that?  It appears that Government policy and certainly the policy of the larger trading nations is in conflict with the ethos of the Irish people, if one can determine the nature of that ethos.  I believe one can, for example, if one looks at the way the Irish people contribute to famine appeals and the way that they feel strongly about the issues of marginalised and deprived peoples all over the world.  This appears to indicate the way the people feel.  On the other hand the Government is colluding in a situation where it is deliberately intended to continue to discriminate against the weakest sections of the world in order, perhaps understandably, to protect jobs in this country.  I believe there is a moral conflict here and I wonder what the Minister has to say about this.</P>
    <P>Ireland is in quite a good situation at present.  I researched some figures and I note that exports grew from £5.7 billion in 1982 to £16.6 billion in 1992.  That is a remarkable performance.  The Irish economy appears to be performing remarkably well.  The problem is that it does not appear to be producing as many jobs as one would like.</P>
    <P>I was intrigued by Senator Quinn's description of American &ldquo;hard ball&rdquo; tactics. We have already had experience of that.  I dealt during the symposium that we had last year on James Joyce with one of our major industries, Bailey's Irish Cream, and they were most generous in their sponsorship.  I got to know a certain amount about the way business was going.  I am sure everybody knows, I am not telling stories out of school.  I remember having lunch with some of the senior executives of the company and they were chasing around the world trying to hire out jumbo jets so that they could flood the USA market with Bailey's Irish Cream before tariffs were imposed.  The USA had clearly indicated that Bailey's Irish Cream was on a target list.  The <Col N="685" /> USA was picking the most vulnerable items out of various countries where it would hurt and pinch.  As I recall, 70 per cent of the manufacturing capacity of Bailey's Irish Cream is absorbed in the USA market.  If they were walloped with this massive levy they would be in serious trouble.  The same is true of Waterford Glass where the figure is something like 80 per cent.  I am less worried about Waterford Glass because it is now so diluted that it is scarcely worth while.  I should not say this but I feel it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave Waterford Glass aside.  The issue of services has arisen and I immediately thought of the financial services centre.  Will the Minister confirm my opinion that this is a disaster?  It has not worked.  It is an interesting indicator that if we are looking at this area in terms of international agreements, how successful are we already?  It appears that unfortunately the financial services centre is a white elephant.  There was much fuss about it for some time and then it simply disappeared out of sight.</P>
      <P>With regard to agriculture, I agree with Senator Quinn.  It is not the most important aspect, but it is still significant.  I am a little worried about the kinds of arrangements that our farmers have.  I like the idea that we are still an agricultural country to a certain extent. However, if one looks at the figures, farmers in the USA are subsidised to the tune of £8,000 per year, while farmers in Europe are subsidised by £13,000 per year.  It is almost twice as much.  If we are honest we must admit there is a disparity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that some kind of agreement can be properly put together and signed. I very much doubt that there will be any shred of morality attaching to such an agreement.  I hope that Ireland, as a former colony and an independent State, might make its position known with regard to the way in which we treat our less well off neighbours on this planet. <Col N="686" /> The day will come when we will need them and when we will all be part of a kind of global economy.

      <P>When one speaks of the GATT from an agricultural perspective, it is impossible not to mention CAP reform.  They are interlinked.  If the CAP had been properly reformed, the problems which we have with the GATT would not be as severe.  One of the reasons the CAP was reformed in 1992 was because of pressure from the GATT countries and the EC to curtail dumping of farm produce.  This was mainly done through a system of export refunds.  It is surprising that this pressure was not imposed earlier when one considers the size of the export refunds on agricultural produce.  In the case of livestock exports, many animals were able to attract up to £500 each in export refunds.  This left the exporter in a position where he could sell <Col N="687" /> below world market prices and I do not believe it is reasonable to expect GATT countries to allow this situation to continue indefinitely.</P>
      <P>Meat factories and livestock farmers are believed to be receiving large sums of money from the CAP.  The meat factories admitted at the beef tribunal they were given huge amounts in export credit insurance.  One company confessed to exporting intervention meat when it should have bought animals from farmers and sold that meat.  When questioned about this at the tribunal the answer given was that everyone was &ldquo;at it&rdquo;.  That phrase is often used by Mr. Gay Byrne on his programme but it may not have been used in his sense.</P>
      <P>Intervention meat has been bought by the EC and put into storage.  It is then the property of the EC, not of the factories. To call a spade a spade, the meat was stolen in container loads.  The factories then proceeded to get export credit insurance cover for that meat and collect sizeable refunds.  That money is called agricultural transfers when the figures are added up and people think it goes to farmers.  It is worth noting that when the EC was almost dumping meat, consumers here could not afford to buy meat.</P>
      <P>When Mr. Ray MacSharry put forward his CAP proposals in 1991 he was under pressure from the countries involved because the CAP was not working properly. He stated 80 per cent of CAP transfers were going to 20 per cent of farmers, mostly larger ones.  He also explained why that was so.  It was hoped the reformed CAP would change that position. The chance was missed because his advice was not heeded.  Some farming organisations vigorously opposed Mr. MacSharry's plan to redistribute CAP resources.  By doing that they have forfeited the right to speak on behalf of most of the small farmers of this country. Rather than help, they have made matters worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent surveys have shown that because of the way CAP was reformed under pressure from GATT, 3,000 small producers in Clare and 3,500 in north <Col N="688" /> Cork will have to give up farming.  We cannot claim farming is doing well.  It has been said there has been a 20 per cent increase in farm incomes but a recent study by Teagasc found 58 per cent of farmers had an income of less than £5,000 per year.  It also concluded that only 50,000 farm units in the country were economically viable.  The ICMSA, which represents dry stock farmers, claims many of the 40,000 farmers it represents will be unable to survive because of CAP and GATT.  All these bodies cannot be wrong.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn said recently a conspiracy on our handling of CAP and GATT had worked to the detriment of the Irish consumer.  I believe he has a point.  In the case of small farmers there is a conspiracy to make them believe they are earning a proper living while a large number of them are on the poverty line. Farmers are also consumers.  Surveys have also shown the high-cost food policies of the EC costs the average family £20 extra per week.  In that case the extra cost of food would cancel out the subsidy given to a small farmer for 50 ewes, the first 18 acres of his area aid for grain or for his first five suckler cows.  The CAP has failed in one of its primary aims, that is, to keep the maximum possible number of families on the land.</P>
    <P>There is no use burying our heads in the sand on this issue.  As sure as night follows day CAP, as we know it, will be radically changed.  This will happen because of a reaction from the taxpayer to the subsidisation of agricultural production, which is maintaining high food prices, and by pressure from international trading arrangements such as GATT.  I do not have a crystal ball but it will be one of the paradoxes of our time if an international trade agreement like GATT reduces the price of food to the consumer and at the same time stops the flight of small farmers from the land.</P>
    <P>The Government has a tough task when dealing with this area.  It should not go unnoticed that a GATT agreement will have to deal with 14 other items as well as agriculture and the Government will have to take them all into account. <Col N="689" /> We are lucky to have Deputy O'Shea and Deputy Hyland as Ministers for State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  They have the interests of small farmers at heart.  The Minister, Deputy Walsh, has taken a major step to help small farmers by placing the responsibility for the allocation of the free milk quota with the Department and the Department intends to give the quota to producers of less than 13,000 gallons.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Townsend for giving me the opportunity to address this matter.  GATT is the most significant economic issue currently facing this country.  I am delighted we are having this debate because there has been no discussion in the public domain. GATT does not only concern agriculture, it relates to trade, tariffs and a general agreement.  I blame the lack of a public debate on politicians, the social partners, the press, the media and Irish society as a whole.</P>
      <P>The only people discussing GATT at present are those involved in agriculture and that is why the public perception is that GATT is solely about agriculture.  As the Minister said, GATT encompasses all forms of trade and this fact must be brought home to the people.  I appeal to the social partners to spend the next few weeks bringing this issue into the public arena.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trade is vital to this country.  We are an open economy, effectively exporting <Col N="690" /> two-thirds of our produce in agriculture and services.  The service sector has created a great deal of employment in Ireland in the last number of years.  I welcome last night's debate in this House on the service industry and we should highlight this as the growing area in our economy.  Manufacturing is not expanding at the same rate and will not solve our unemployment problems.</P>
    <P>Despite the lack of debate, all is not lost.  The farming community has sensitive and genuine fears and the Minister and the Government are working hard on its behalf.  However, our American partners have put the gun to our heads. They effectively dismissed the GATT until the NAFTA debate, which came to a successful conclusion for them last night, was over.  This sends us the signal that they seem to be dictating the pace with regard to the GATT negotiations. The American farmer is currently experiencing serious problems and it would benefit him more than his Irish counterpart if the present Blair House agreement was implemented.  We must immediately reject certain elements of that agreement because I have no doubt that in the years to come we will have to answer for the social and economic problems that this agreement will cause for Ireland.</P>
    <P>GATT must be agreed because we are now effectively a global trading economy, but this must not be at the expense of our people.  We are isolated in our arguments because we effectively stand alone on that issue.  When it comes to trading, Ireland is the most open economy in Europe.  We must be steadfast on this issue.  It was already pointed out that the French have supported our arguments for changes in the present GATT negotiations but, at the end of the day, it will be down to our own Ministers.  We have few friends left in Europe on this issue.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the service industry. In Ireland, It has grown from 42 per cent in 1968 to 57 per cent in 1991 and since 1988, there has been a net increase of 33,000 people employed in that sector. From that point of view, it is vital to get a GATT agreement.  However, an <Col N="691" /> agreement is not so important for our agricultural sector until the difficulties are ironed out.  I am hopeful that, if we reach an agreement, the present CAP reform proposals that have been implemented will go ahead and I am delighted to see that there is a peace clause there to allow that.  However, I am worried that our agricultural industry will suffer greatly if this does not come about and if it does suffer, the service and manufacturing sectors will not benefit us either.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be steadfast and work towards a conclusion of the GATT but not at the expense of our agricultural population.  From a rural point of view, it would create serious problems.  It has already been seen from the American system that open economies are the way forward, but we need time to adjust.  We have been isolated in the world market because we were effectively trading solely to the EC.  Any product exported was funded by the EC, and this is the problem.  We have not had time to adjust, we have been thrust into this situation; we have not had a proper public debate on GATT, yet a conclusion has to be reached by 15 December.  This issue is of vital importance.  The Minister, the Government and the social partners will be responsible because the people are unaware of what is happening.  The farmers on the ground are not aware of the issue because they are doing well this year, but in two years time we will have to answer to them and tell them why we betrayed them.</P>
    <P>We have few friends and I hope the Government and the Minister get the full backing of everyone to conclude this debate, but they must do so without sacrificing our agricultural sector.  The service and manufacturing industries have developed in a closed economy and I am confident they will expand if the world economy opens up.  GATT must conclude and I am confident it will within the next three to four weeks.  I hope the Minister will take this on board and use all options available to secure a successful conclusion for Irish agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The agricultural provisions in the so called Blair House Agreement are seriously unbalanced to the disadvantage of the EC in general and Ireland in particular.  We are to contend with quotas and other restrictions on production together with substantial price cuts over a six year period.  The combination of reforms of the EC agricultural policy and the GATT proposals will place Ireland at a severe disadvantage compared to other GATT members.  The United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada will find that their trading will improve substantially while the EC's will deteriorate.  In addition, the EC is being asked to give guarantees of access to its markets to its other partners without receiving any such guarantees itself. The so called interpretations and clarifications of the Blair House Agreement will consist, at best, only of changes in the timing of the disadvantages to the EC and not in its substance.</P>
      <P>Since the cave-in by Commissioner MacSharry in August 1991, the EC negotiators have been consistently out-manoeuvred by their American counterparts.  Even today, we find the US Administration claiming to be so taken up with the North American Free Trade Area Agreement that it cannot devote any attention to GATT.  This is no more than a negotiating ploy and it is criminally negligent of the EC authorities to fall for such tactics.</P>
      <P>As the GATT negotiations stand, the EC will be obliged to lower its internal agricultural prices to world price levels, to reduce the level accordingly of export refunds and import levies required to sustain the target internal prices and to substantially dismantle the price support arrangements.  Under the negotiations, it will be obliged to guarantee expanded access for exporters in other GATT partners to EC markets for meat, dairy and other key products while itself suffering a reduction in its ability to export.  It will also be obliged to accept that its meat exporters will continue to be excluded from the rapidly growing Japanese market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="693" /> At the same time, GATT partner countries &mdash; particularly the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand &mdash; will benefit from new increased opportunities for export.  They will not be obliged to accept any disciplines or restrictions on their production levels. Neither will they be obliged to give any reciprocal access to EC producers.  These provisions are seriously unbalanced. While the EC suffers from such restrictions, its partners gain opportunities for expansion.  No such imbalance can be seen in any other part of the emerging agreement.  No other sector will lose as much as agriculture in the EC generally, or in Ireland in particular.</P>
    <P>The consequences for rural Ireland will be catastrophic.  Rural Ireland has suffered greatly over the past 20 years with the loss of 30,000 jobs from farming and related industries.  I believe provisions in the GATT agreement will accentuate the decline in the rural population and affect people who depend on agriculture for a living.  This situation is unacceptable and the EC should restore equity.  The EC must play hard ball with the US.  We need reciprocal guarantees of access to markets in GATT partner states and reciprocal undertakings to control levels of production of key agricultural products. Without these, the GATT agreement will spell the end of rural Ireland and the agricultural community as we know it.</P>
    <P>Today's farmer is limited by quotas and restrictions.  Application forms must be completed for everything the farmer does.  There is often uncertainty as to whether the Department's computers will complete the job or if a technical hitch will eliminate, reduce or delay the payment.  Those of us who are regularly contacted by farmers in difficulty are often frustrated by the bureaucracy surrounding grant payments; I am sure the Minister has experienced this also.  For example, one may be told by the Department that because one digit is wrong the farmer will be eliminated from the beef premium scheme for one and, perhaps, two years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> Under the slaughter beef premium scheme almost half the payments which should have been completed by the middle of this year have still not been paid and, in the meantime, farming families do not have enough to live on.  Many farming families are dependent on premium payments, such as the suckler cow premium, beef premium and so on.  Families become frustrated when they have to wait for payment, and as a result, they are obliged to ask politicians to lobby the Department to pay these premiums. Politicians are frustrated because it is often difficult to obtain information about a specific payment.  If one reads the Official Dáil Reports one will see that those who have the facility probably table more written questions on grant payments to farmers than on any other issue.</P>

      <P>To add insult to injury, livestock farmers are now being told they must pay £9 million for the privilege of being swallowed by this insane bureaucracy. They must now produce maps and pay up to £25 per map if they apply to the Ordnance Survey Office by 17 December; after this date it will cost £42 per map.  The Department has refused to accept photocopies; I cannot understand this.  The Minister should review this and the Department should consider accepting photocopies of maps.  There is no reason farmers who already have maps should pay for photocopies.  This is bureaucratic nonsense and exploitation of farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make some brief observations about GATT.  This is not something new as my party, the Progressive Democrats, put down a motion in this House more than three years ago warning about the consequences of GATT on farming incomes and the national economy.  However, it did not attract a lot of attention at the time.  In this House it always seems that <Col N="695" /> when we have a debate on homosexuality, condoms or a matter of that nature the press are interested in what we have to say, but when we discuss the economy and the effects measures such as GATT will have on the people it attracts little attention.  This is regrettable.</P>
      <P>If this deal is concluded in December it will have profound implications for the Irish economy, the future welfare of farmers, people in the processing industries, etc.  The fact that the US House of Representatives agreed to President Clinton's stance on the North Atlantic Free Trade Area Agreement yesterday puts increasing pressure on us to conclude a GATT deal.  It must also focus our minds on future tactics.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn said recently on the radio that when we debate matters such as GATT in this House the emphasis is on the effects on farmers while the consumer is often ignored.  I do not agree with this view.  We accept the impact which GATT has on the consumer, and it is not a positive one.  If the price of farm produce falls the main beneficiaries will probably be European consumers because we derive a lot of our foreign earnings from agricultural exports.  In addition, if there is a reduction in the money we get for our exports it will not benefit our economy but it will benefit European and other consumers.  This point must be stated because there is a perception abroad that if a GATT agreement is concluded in the morning, consumers everywhere will benefit.  This is not the case, particularly as far as Irish consumers are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The doctrine of trade liberalisation and free trade across national boundaries is an attractive one to which is easy to subscribe. However, we should not have any illusions about the US proposals because they are in the United States' selfinterest. The structure of agriculture in the US is totally different to that in the EC, particularly in Ireland.  The scale of agricultural operations in the US and the EC is different and it gives the US a great competitive advantage on world markets. <Col N="696" /> We cannot deny this and we must protect our position in that market.</P>
    <P>In relation to compensation, should it be allowed under the terms of a GATT agreement?  We discussed green, red and blue boxes until everyone lost interest in the argument and did not understand what was happening unless they were well tuned in.  It would not be sustainable if GATT allowed compensation in Europe.  The EC budget is already overloaded and it will become increasingly so as a result of the MacSharry CAP reform package.  Therefore, the ability of the Community to finance compensation is highly questionable, even if it was allowed under a GATT deal.  This raises serious questions about the deal.</P>
    <P>I was also disappointed that Commissioner Brittan was sent by his political masters from the EC to visit his counterpart, Mr. Kantor, in the US to try to redefine or adjust &mdash; we were not allowed to say renegotiate, but we could adjust or define or seek clarification.  He was sent by his political masters in the almost certain knowledge that he would return to the European Community and inform them that he was unsuccessful and that they, in turn, would go home and tell their electorate: We are very sorry.  We put our faith in Mr. Brittan's negotiating powers.  He did our bidding but unfortunately he was unsuccessful and there is not a great deal we can do about it. That is washing our hands of political responsibility.  This is a political matter at the highest level and this Government and others cannot absolve themselves from their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I wonder how much the Tánaiste discussed this matter when he was in America over the past few days.  The future welfare of and peace in this island must be the overriding priority for everybody in this House and in this country but the other matter is also highly significant.  It is worthy of discussion at that political level because at the end of the day, it is a political deal.  Did the Tánaiste express this country's concerns about GATT to the United States Administration?  We considered it appropriate to send a Minister to the United States when the future <Col N="697" /> of Digital was at stake but this is much more important than Digital.  We are talking about a thousand Digitals.  It is a vital national interest that must be defended, not just in the interests of farmers but of consumers and the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>What is the state of play at the moment?  Will we find ourselves in mid-December sitting down to the table and saying we did our best but unfortunately, in the interests of free trade and what we perceive might be the benefits of free trade, we will go along with it, despite our reservations, for the greater good. That will not be good enough.  It may be possible to devise an agreement as we would in a contract if we were buying a business, where there were heads of agreement and, over an extended period of months or a year we would fill in the detail.</P>
    <P>We should remember &mdash; and this has been ignored &mdash; that we are already, to some degree, locked in what we can do because we agreed under the terms of the original Uruguay Round to substantial progressive reductions in support and protection.  The question is, how do we measure the degree of support and what is the extent of the reduction?  The Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, gave us figures about tariff equivalents and what we have committed ourselves to.  The Blair House agreement needs to be looked at, particularly in an Irish context, so that we can get the best deal possible. Senator Townsend made the point that farmers are consumers and I emphasise that point again.</P>
    <P>I fully accept the overall need for a GATT agreement.  That is not the issue. As a small open economy we need a GATT agreement and it can be to our benefit.  The issue is the nature, content and detail of the agreement.  Several references were made to Mr. Sutherland and his role in this matter.  I think he is fulfilling his role professionally.  I do not share the criticisms that have been made of him &mdash; that he is almost ignorant of Irish agriculture.  Nobody who served in the capacity in which he served, either <Col N="698" /> within the European Community or banking circles in Ireland, could be ignorant of its significance but he has a different remit.  He is now the Director General of GATT and his remit is to get a GATT deal.  It is not for us to say that because he wants a deal that is not in favour of Ireland, he is unpatriotic.  That is like saying that the European Commissioner who has taken an oath to act in a collegiate sense is not doing his job because he is not looking after Ireland's interests.  I might, in other circumstances, criticise the European Commissioner if he was not looking after Ireland's interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that he should not be so sectoral about it.  We were told frequently that there was no connection whatsoever between the CAP reform and GATT, but that is not the case.  There was every connection between the CAP reform and GATT.  If we were to achieve the targets in terms of reduction in support that we have to achieve under GATT, then CAP reform was inevitable. It was inevitable anyway because of the surpluses and the budgetary constraints. However we are now getting rid of the surpluses but the budget appears to be on the increase.  There appears to be some contradiction there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have another big difficulty about what a GATT deal would do to us.  What will happen if we have to compete on world markets and the markets improve and we are constrained by limitations on our output by European rules?  In other words, we have quotas and restrictions on our output but the other countries, &mdash; the CAIRNS group, New Zealand, Canada and America &mdash; can turn on the tap and increase production over night, as New Zealand are doing with dairy products at the moment.  If there is an upturn in the market we cannot increase production and if there is a downturn we <Col N="699" /> suffer.  Where is the attraction of free trade there?  Can somebody explain satisfactorily to me how the food industry benefits from free trade?  I cannot see it.</P>
    <P>We face a serious situation in that vast areas are being progressively depopulated. We are to build super highways with Structural Funds to facilitate our people to the airports.  There are many initiatives on rural development, such as the Leader Programme, global grants and the Interreg Fund.  They are all welcome and necessary but what is the point if behind them we are adopting a policy which says they are only palliatives?  The fundamental problem of trying to earn a living in a rural area is not being addressed. We must safeguard our farming and food industries.  This is a vital national interest.</P>
    <P>This brings us to the question of whether the veto should be used at European level.  I would be very reluctant to use the veto.  I do not think it is the proper way to conduct negotiations, but it may get to a stage where the consequences are so significant from a national point of view that the veto has to be seriously considered.  Perhaps that would concentrate some European minds which appear to be less than concentrated at the moment.</P>
    <P>The question of Bailey's Irish Cream was raised by Senator Norris who had visions of jumbo jets going across the Atlantic with Bailey's.  I do not think that would be a very satisfactory way of shipping it.  However, the point is, will there be a trade war in the event of us not reaching an agreement?  That stick will be held over us by the United States and others.  My view is that it is much more likely to be targeted products, such as Bailey's Irish Cream, and what will happen is that the US and other countries in CAIRNS group or elsewhere, will go to the GATT panel and say this particular practice is contrary to GATT rules.  The GATT panel will rule and we may or may not find ourselves in the position of <Col N="700" /> having to get our act together.  The GATT panel seems to be like the European Court of Justice: sometimes it makes a ruling, which is against us or others, but it is never implemented.</P>
    <P>There must be action at the highest governmental level, by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, to instil in people the significance of this particular deal to the Irish economy, to agriculture and to Irish life.  It is not good enough to absolve oneself of political responsibility and say it is down to the European Commissioner to find adjustment, clarification or amendment.  This is a political deal and a political responsibility.</P>

      <P>When the first proposals for rail electrification were published in the 1970s, it was envisaged that the southern terminus for the rail electrification system now known as DART would be Greystones.  When the plans were published and put on public display in 1978 and 1979, the southern terminus of DART was shown as Greystones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" /> From the outset, it was not envisaged that the service would run only from Bray to Howth.  However, between the original plans and the detailed implementation of those plans the extension of the line from Bray to Greystones was omitted.  At the time I said, and I still believe, the decision was one of the most crass and unforgivable blunders in public transport since the decision to close the Harcourt Street line.  Since the DART service was inaugurated my views on the omission of Greystones from the line have been confirmed one hundredfold.</P>
    <P>The Greystones area is one of the most rapidly growing urban areas in the State. Indeed, for a period in the 1980s it was one of the most rapidly growing urban areas in Europe.  There is long tradition of commuting by rail from the town.  The decision not to extend the DART line to Greystones, coupled with the running down of the Bray-Greystones shuttle service, has led to a switch by commuters from rail to road.  This is an unwelcome change for the people of Greystones, who must put up with an inadequate road network around the town, and for the taxpayer who must invest millions of pounds in upgrading roads.  Economically and ecologically it is at best a second best solution.</P>
    <P>The interim report of the DTI recognised the logic of extending the DART to Greystones.  The only definite proposal for DART extension made in the report was for the extension of the line to Greystones.  Iarnród Éireann, which as CIE contributed to the original crass error in not running the line to Greystones, also recognises the logic of the extension.  The managing director of that company is on record as saying the extension of the DART line to Greystones is the most logical and cost-effective solution to Greystones transportation problems.</P>
    <P>Some £20 million has been allocated in the National Development Plan for the upgrading of suburban rail services in the greater Dublin area.  It is unclear what is included in the proposals for this expenditure. The DTI list of proposals for upgrading suburban services, as augmented <Col N="702" /> by some proposals from Iarnród Éireann, will cost approximately £28.7 million.  The shopping list definitely includes the extension of the DART line to Greystones, additional DART stations on the southside, new rolling stock for the DART line, upgrading the Maynooth line and a new ticketing system.  Each of these items of expenditure could be defended on its merit, but the most pressing and logical one which will make a positive return on investment in a reasonable period is the extension of the DART line to Greystones.  The case for Greystones is more cost-effective than any other item on the shopping list.  When we get down to detail it is the only item on the shopping list which will make a positive return and that could be regarded as additional capital input.</P>
    <P>In looking for the extension of the DART line to Greystones, public representatives and people from Wicklow are not looking for anything new.  When the DART line was first commissioned in 1983, we had nine direct trains per day from the town.  By 1993 the figure was reduced to one.  In contrast, the number of trains from Bray to Pearse Station, the chosen Dublin terminus, has increased from 26 in 1983 to 83 in 1993.  Consequently, usage of the line from Greystones has declined dramatically, in fact one could say disastrously.  During that period the commuter line services to Malahide, Clondalkin and Maynooth have been improved as a result of substantial capital input by Government.  The DART line from Bray to Howth has received over £100 million during that period.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 £20 million has been allocated to upgrading the Maynooth line and the Maynooth-Drogheda line in terms of rolling stock.  There is a proposal to spend £100 million on the Belfast line which will upgrade the Maynooth portion of the line.  Since 1998 approximately £15 million has been allocated to new stations along the Maynooth and Clonsilla line. The list goes on.</P>
    <P>The Greystones line is the only one with a history of commuter usage which has been downgraded in the past ten <Col N="703" /> years.  This is unacceptable.  Logic, economics, common sense and political honour suggest this extension should be recognised by the Minister and the Minister of State as the number one priority. All political parties, including my party have given undertakings about the extension to Greystones.  I am old fashioned in regard to politics.  Once undertakings have been given, they must be honoured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Roche for sharing his time.  Greystones is a town stranded in north County Wicklow.  It is a commuter town, but for some extraordinary reason successive Governments have failed to recognise this.  It was stranded because the shuttle was cut-off and the DART was not extended to it.  The town is full of frustrated commuters who face difficulty and discomfort in getting to work each day.  It is inexplicable that other towns and suburbs of Dublin &mdash; Greystones is a suburb of Dublin &mdash; have received preferential treatment, given the number of people who commute from Greystones each day.</P>
      <P>I and Senator Roche, who has been in the area longer, are aware this is a long running sore.  One of the most extraordinary features of the problem is that we have been frustrated at every turn by Government.  Last year people from Greystones took part in a march to this House and the Department in an unprecedented show of solidarity, yet there was no response.  We now have an opportunity following the DTI report, to remedy this wrong with EC funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is probably unaware of difficulties encountered by people from Greystones.  A shuttle from Greystones to Bray was cut.  People must seek alternative forms of transport to Dublin.  They must travel by car or overcrowded bus to Bray.  The increase in traffic on this road is in nobody's interest.  It is bad for the environment, it causes traffic jams and is frustrating for people who are often late for work.  A lot of time is lost.  I would appeal to the Minister, at this opportune time when EC funds are available for infrastructure of this sort, to give this <Col N="704" /> matter the priority it merited many years ago, remedy this wrong and facilitate the long-suffering commuters of Greystones in getting to Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Senators for giving me the opportunity to respond to this very important motion. The National Development Plan includes provision for an EC-assisted investment programme of £220 million.  Up to £200 million of this expenditure is proposed for the development of a light rail transit system for Dublin.  A further £20 million has been included in the plan for other important public transport projects including the development of public transport interchange facilities, integrated ticketing and the upgrading of suburban rail services, including possible extensions of the DART to both Greystones and Malahide.  These issues are being further evaluated under the ongoing Dublin Transportation Initiative process and the outcome of this evaluation will be reflected in the final report of the DTI which is expected shortly.  It would not be appropriate for me to preempt the final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative in relation to specific transport options which may be recommended for Greystones or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>In general terms, the overall cost of the main priorities which have been outlined above would exceed the level of funding available.  Accordingly, it is essential that the expenditure of £20 million in non-light rail transport work is carefully allocated to the most effective projects in overall public transport terms.  In this context we are fully aware of the concerns of residents in Greystones concerning the extension of the DART to that town. When final decisions are being taken every consideration possible will be given to Greystones.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for the prompt way in which you are conducting the proceedings. This concerns the need for the Government to give more funds to Co-operation North.  The Minister will be fully aware of the existence and activities of Co-operation North but maybe I could put one or two of them on the record of this House.  It is possibly the most worthy and practical of the non-sectarian groups which work both north and south of the Border.  I say it is practical because the Minister and the House will be aware of the enormous amount of visible work that Co-operation North has done in both parts of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time of immense tragedy and great tension it would be appropriate if the Government were to make a significant contribution to this group, and indeed other groups if it sees fit, to promote the work of conciliation and cross-Border co-operation in a practical way.  As the Minister <Col N="706" /> will know, Co-operation North runs residential conferences, exchange schemes and the well publicised maracycles. It concentrates as far as it possibly can on communication and exchanges between young people.  The results of these activities have been tangible.</P>
    <P>The problem for Co-operation North has been funding, as it is with many voluntary organisations.  It is a mystery why funding from the Government has decreased so much in the last ten years. To quote the figures, in 1982 Co-operation North received £50,000 from the Government and in 1993 it received only £20,000.  That is inexplicable given the extraordinary cross-community work that it has done in that time.  It is not a recognition of the great work it is doing.</P>
    <P>In comparison to that, the British Government, which always used to fund Co-operation North on a pound for pound basis, paid £40,000 sterling in 1982 and in 1993 that contribution has risen to £100,000 sterling.  The disparity between the Irish and British Governments' contributions is clear.  I cannot understand why the Irish Government has decided, at a time when the situation is not getting better but worse, that this is not a priority.  It has decided that this is one of the programmes it will cut by £30,000. Last year Co-operation North only got £20,000 but in 1991 it got £50,000.  In the last two years a decision was made at Government level that this particularly worthy organisation should get less money.  The Minister should look at that in the light of what the British Government is giving, and adjust the figure for the 1994 Estimates.</P>
    <P>It is always dangerous to anticipate what the Minister is going to say but I have to because one of the procedural problems of this House is that we do not get a chance to reply to the Minister.  I imagine he will say that Co-operation North has been very successful in getting IFI funding.  That is true, but IFI funding is project based.  When a plan is presented to do X, Y and Z, the IFI <Col N="707" /> will evaluate it and approve funding.  Co-operation North and others are extremely grateful for that IFI funding, which is a tremendous boost for them. The Government's money is needed, however, because outside that project base it is impossible for Co-operation North to expand on only £20,000 per annum.  In other words, it cannot plan ahead.  It has no idea what funding it is to receive from year to year because it has to apply to the IFI which, by its nature, takes a long time to decide.  Co-operation North does not know if it will receive funding for a particular project or not.  Neither does it know whether it will be able to fund more staff, projects and cross-Border activities or whether it will be able to expand co-operation and cross-community work.</P>
    <P>The Government ought to guarantee a minimum figure which is much more than £20,000.  At the very least, the Government should go back to the 1982 figure and link it to inflation since then, which it has done with other activities.  Alternatively, the Government should match the British Government's £100,000 per annum.  In that way it would allow Co-operation North to plan its activities for the years ahead.  We all have great respect for this organisation and pay it verbal tribute but we do not all contribute in financial terms, including the Government. It is impossible to expect such an organisation to have a bright future if it does not have a reasonable, guaranteed sum from the Government.</P>
    <P>Co-operation North has done some wonderful work in both communities. One of its great successes in recent times has been to hold two media conferences north of the Border.  These are spontaneous efforts to get journalists from North and South to meet each other.  One of the most striking aspects of the media here and in the North is that nobody ever reads each others newspapers.  It is extraordinary how few people here read the <i>Irish News</i>, the <i>Newsletter</i> or other <Col N="708" /> northern newspapers.  Very few people north of the Border read the Southern newspapers.  This conference brought people together from North and South, without any press coverage, in quiet surroundings, to exchange views.  On both occasions the conference was tremendously successful with over 80 people attending.  It is a vital means of exchanging ideas.  Tomorrow Gilbeys are going to sponsor a young enterpreneurs conference in the Davenport Hotel which will be attended by 100 people as part of a business training programme.</P>
    <P>It is essential the Minister realises this is more than just a voluntary organisation. The findings of several independent surveys have recognised the great work Co-operation North has done. The concrete, tangible results are there for everybody to see.</P>
    <P>It might be appropriate to mention the reaction north of the Border to the recent Shankill bombing.  There was an extraordinary and new spirit of reconciliation after it.  The sight of priests walking along the Shankill in gestures of reconciliation and the sight of people from both communities making gestures of reconciliation to the other offended community, in the aftermath of atrocities on both sides, is a tribute to Co-operation North and other reconciliation movements with which it works in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Independent assessments show progress has been made.  Such progress, by its nature, is slow because extremism cannot be countered overnight.  In recognition of that work it would be a tremendous gesture if the Minister acknowledged reducing funding for Co-operation North was a mistake and agreed that in the future such funding will be at parity with that provided by the British Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ross for his contribution and am grateful for this opportunity to pay <Col N="709" /> tribute to the excellent work being undertaken by Co-operation North in the promotion of reconciliation and better understanding between people in both parts of Ireland.  Since its foundation in 1979, Co-operation North has made an important contribution to efforts to break down prejudice and change attitudes throughout Ireland.  Co-operation North has a continuing and significant role to play in helping people everywhere in Ireland to increase their knowledge of, and respect for, the different traditions represented on the island.</P>
      <P>Co-operation North is grant aided under the North-South and Anglo-Irish Co-operation subhead of the Vote of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This subhead was set up in 1982 to assist organisations involved in reconciliation work and in efforts to create better understanding between people in both parts of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain. Since the subhead was set up, Co-operation North has received grant assistance totalling £525,000, including assistance of £20,000 in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs maintains regular contact with Co-operation North and advises it on a wide range of issues relating to the objectives which it is pursuing.  In addition to Co-operation North, a wide range of organisations are being assisted under this subhead in 1993. These include Anglo-Irish Encounter, established by the Irish and British Governments to contribute to the improvement of understanding between the peoples of both islands; the Irish School of Ecumenics, which promotes enumenical contact between North and South and between Ireland and Great Britain; the Between organisation, based in Cork, which seeks to relieve distress in the deprived areas in Northern Ireland by sponsoring holidays in Cork for children from both nationalist and unionist communities; and the secretarial and administrative expenses of the International Fund for Ireland, which the two Governments committed themselves to <Col N="710" /> paying in the agreement setting up the Fund.</P>
    <P>Due to the very difficult budgetary situation, the allocation to the subhead was reduced from £200,000 in 1991 to £115,000 in 1992.  Because of continuing budgetary difficulties it has, unfortunately, not been possible to increase the overall allocation to the subhead this year.  As a result of the reduced allocation, assistance to Co-operation North totalled £20,000 this year.  I am, however, pleased to note that Co-operation North has received substantial assistance from the International Fund for Ireland since 1989.  Senator Ross said he would like to see a greater long term commitment to allocating funding to Co-operation North rather than a commitment on a year to year basis.  The International Fund for Ireland has agreed in principle to assist Co-operation North in 1994.</P>
    <P>In addition to the budgetary restraints, we are, at the same time, faced with growing demands on the limited resources available under this subhead. The allocation to the other organisations assisted under the subhead have come under similar pressure.  In this situation, endeavours have been made to spread as equitably as possible the necessary cuts across the grants being made.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the invaluable work being sponsored under this subhead, it is the Government's intention to allocate resources in 1994 and subsequent years to this subhead at the highest possible level consistent with the budgetary constraints which apply in any given year.  I hope the budgetary situation next year will offer greater flexibility in regard to assisting Co-operation North and the other organisations assisted under this subhead.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the reductions in 1992 and 1993 were because the very difficult budgetary situation and in no sense implied any diminished appreciation of the importance and value of the work being done by Co-operation North.</P>

The Senator's views have been noted and I have put on the record that we will do our best within budgetary limitations.  I said we would endeavour to achieve the highest level of funding consistent with budgetary restraints.  This sounds like a formula.  I appreciate the points made by the Senator and in my response I was as forthcoming as possible.</P>
