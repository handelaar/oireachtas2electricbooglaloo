      <P>I have notice from Senator Roche that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to make provisions to address the problem of coastal erosion in County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Enright of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to carry out improvements on an extension in Clonmacnoise national school, County Offaly.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to carry out an immediate investigation into the life threatening explosion at Balleece Quarry in Rathdrum, County Wicklow and to suspend its operation until <Col N="1762" /> appropriate safety measures have been put in place.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Roche, Enright and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Roche's and Enright's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Ross may give notice on another day of the matters he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>I am happy to agree the Order of Business.  Yesterday I raised the current problems in Aer Lingus and I again ask the Leader to allow time for a discussion on them.  Both Government parties have been briefed but Opposition parties have not.  It is my contention that all Members of both Houses are entitled to a briefing &mdash; there should be no discrimination. I would appreciate if the Leader could organise a discussion in this House as that would be helpful.</P>

      <P>It is important to pick up on a number of issues that have been raised &mdash; Aer Lingus, the Opsahl report, East Timor and former Yugoslavia.  I get letters every day on the latter issue from international colleagues about teachers in Kosovo, one of the provinces of former Yugoslavia where they are not even allowed to speak their own language.  I ask that two or three of those issues be taken one day the week after next to allow people make an input and put their views on the record.</P>

      <P>In reply to Senator Manning and Senator O'Toole on the issue of the Department of Foreign <Col N="1763" /> Affairs, the Tánaiste was away yesterday but the Chief Whip has been in touch with his office on the issues raised.  We on this side of the House are keen to ensure that we debate all the issues mentioned, including former Yugoslavia and the Opsahl report.  Hopefully, we will have some information on that next week.  The debate may be the week after next as next week's business is more or less in place at the moment.  Next week's business will be the Broadcasting Bill and the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill.  The main Opposition spokespersons were briefed on Aer Lingus yesterday.  I accept what Senator Manning said; it is a situation of which everybody should be well informed. The Senator can be assured that I am as keen as he, that we would have a chance to discuss the tragic situation in Aer Lingus.</P>

    <Title>Statistics Bill, 1993: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office, or the CSO as it is commonly known, was established in 1949 as a separate office under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach.  It is now time to redefine its position within the overall institutional structure of the public service, and generally to overhaul the legislation governing the compilation of official statistics in the State.</P>
      <P>The CSO currently operates under the provisions of the Statistics Acts, 1926 and 1946.  The principal 1926 Act is now almost 70 years old.  It provided the statutory basis for the collection and compilation of official statistics while preserving a guarantee of confidentiality for those required to provide the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics were, of course, collected and compiled long before the foundation of the State.  These included the ten yearly censuses of population, the annual censuses of agriculture, external trade statistics and statistics on births, marriages <Col N="1764" /> and deaths.  The range of statistics compiled increased significantly following the foundation of the State.  These were mainly the responsibility of a statistics branch in the then Department of Industry and Commerce prior to the establishment of the CSO in 1949. Indeed, the 1926 Act originally vested powers in the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but these powers were transferred to the Taoiseach under a Transfer of Functions Order in 1949.</P>
    <P>There have been many changes over the years in the collection and compilation of official statistics.  Our accession to the EC in 1973 had a significant impact, as statistics had to be produced in conformity with the Community statistical system.  This involved the adoption of Community classifications and the initiation of a number of new inquiries.</P>
    <P>Another significant development was the establishment of the National Statistics Board on a non-statutory basis in 1986 with the primary function of guiding the strategic direction of the CSO.  The board has produced two five year strategic plans.  The first covered the period 1988-92; the second relates to the period 1993-97 and was recently accepted by the Government and will be published shortly.  Progress by the CSO in implementing these plans are assessed by the board in annual reports which are presented to the Government and published.</P>
    <P>There has also been a number of interesting recent developments for example, the completion of the EC's Internal Market at the end of last year required the introduction of a new statistical survey of traders, called Intrastat, to collect statistics on intra-EC trade, which hitherto had been based on Customs documentation; the relaxation of exchange controls and their abolition at the end of last year necessitated the introduction of a range of new sample inquiries to provide improved estimates of Balance of Payments statistics; last year, the CSO initiated a new annual industrial products inquiry, the results of which will be particularly useful because it is based <Col N="1765" /> on a classification of products compatible with that used for foreign trade statistics; and last month the CSO published, for the first time, the results of their series on employment in the public service.  It is now working on the corresponding earnings series.</P>
    <P>The Bill has two broad purposes: first, to update the legislative basis for the collection and compilation of official statistics and, second, to implement the provisions of the Government White Paper.  &ldquo;A New Institutional Structure for the Central Statistics Office&rdquo;, which was published in 1985.  The 1985 Government White Paper took account of the views and recommendations of an advisory Statistical Council that was established under the 1926 Act.  It also took account of the 1985 NESC Report, &ldquo;Information for Policy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I now propose to refer to some of the key sections of the Bill.  Section 7 repeals the Statistics Acts, 1924 and 1946, and includes some consequential provisions. Section 8 states that the institutional structure shall have three components: first the CSO itself, is now being established as a statutory body, second, the Director General, shall be responsible for its management and control and third, a National Statistics Board shall guide the strategic direction of the Office.  This was one of the main features of the 1985 Government White Paper.  Section 10 describes the general functions of the CSO.  It includes, in subsections (2) and (3), important provisions relating to the co-ordination of statistics <i>vis-a-vis</i> public authorities, as envisaged in the 1985 Government White Paper.  The purpose of subsection (2) is to ensure general adherence to statistical standards and the consistent application of appropriate statistical classifications.  Subsection (3) provides that the CSO shall have the authority to assess the statistical potential of administrative records and to ensure that this potential is realised in collaboration with the responsible authorities. The purpose of this is to avoid duplicating requests for the same data and the high cost of direct statistical inquiries.  Existing examples of the statistical <Col N="1766" /> use of administrative records include the live register and the use of birth, death and marriage registrations for compiling vital statistics.</P>
    <P>Section 11 (2) states that the CSO shall maintain close and regular contact with the users and suppliers of statistics.  The Office already keeps in close contact with the principal users of statistics, such as Government Departments, the EC and research bodies.  It is also in direct contact with the large number of business firms that provide data on a regular basis. There were also intensive consultations with the main statistical users and data providers for the preparation of the National Statistics Board's 1988-92 and 1993-97 strategic plans, involving correspondence with over 200 undertakings and individuals, as well as seminars and specialist liaison groups.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the appointment of the director general by the President on the nomination of the Taoiseach.  The purpose of this is to reinforce the statistical independence and objectivity of the post.  This independence is explicitly provided for in Section 13.  This is a standard provision internationally and is in line with the 1985 Government White Paper which stated:</P>
    <P>The full independence and objectivity of the Office in the compilation and publication of statistics will be maintained, made more explicit and further protected by statute.</P>
    <P>The Act will establish the National Statistics Board on a statutory basis. Details of the composition and appointment of the National Statistics Board are given in section 18.  There will be eight members in all: five members of proven ability and experience in relevant fields, one of whom shall chair the board; an Assistant Secretary or higher grade from each of the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance, and the Director General who shall be a <i>ex officio</i> member.  The functions of the board are spelt out in section 19.</P>
    <P>Section 20 defines officers and statistics. This includes, <i>inter alia</i>, all staff of the CSO.  Each such officer will have <Col N="1767" /> to sign a formal declaration &mdash; given in section 21 &mdash; binding them to the confidentiality obligations of the Act.  The purpose of this is to emphasise to the staff of the office and to the public the overriding commitment of the office to statistical confidentiality.  A similar declaration is signed by officers of statistics under the current legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides for the collection of data voluntarily.  Much of the information now being collected by the CSO is on a voluntary basis.  Examples include price collection for compiling the consumer price index, the annual labour force survey, and the monthly and quarterly industrial inquiries.</P>
    <P>Section 25 relates to compulsory statistical inquiries.  It provides that the Taoiseach may make an order requiring persons or undertakings to provide information under the Act.  Many existing inquiries are already on a statutory basis, being conducted by order under the 1926 Act.  Examples include censuses of population, the annual census of industrial production and the quarterly balance of payments inquiries.</P>
    <P>Section 30 relates to access to the records of public authorities.  It provides that the Director General shall have the statutory authority to access and get copies of administrative records in order to realise their statistical potential.  As I stated earlier, it is important that this potential be maximised so as to avoid duplicating requests to persons and businesses and to avoid where possible the high cost of direct statistical inquiries.</P>
    <P>This is a priority objective of all national statistical services and is in line with the Government policy of reducing the data demands on businesses.  Conditions and exclusions on this access are set out in subsection (2).  For example, the CSO will not have access to records relating to a court, the Garda Síocháana, the prison administration and the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Section 31 provides for the co-operation of public authorities with the CSO, which was one of the principal features of the 1985 Government White Paper. <Col N="1768" /> This will have the effect of strengthening the existing links between the Office and other public authorities.  Subsection (1) gives the Director General the statutory authority for assessing and developing the statistical potential of administrative records.  The Bill explicitly recognises that this authority relates only to developments which are appropriate and practicable, and that public autorities shall comply only in so far as resources permit.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) places an onus on public authorities to consult the Director General when they propose to conduct a statistical survey or to introduce, revise or expand an administrative data base.  This is important because the statistical dimension must be taken into account at the design stage of any new or revised computerised administrative system.  If there is a conflict between the Director General and a public authority in relation to this co-operation, the National Statistics Board will play an arbitrating role, and, if necessary, make proposals to the Taoiseach for his decision.</P>
    <P>Sections 32 and 35 relate to the important topic of the protection of information. The statutory guarantee that all data obtained by the CSO will be used solely for statistical purposes and be treated as strictly confidential is essential to ensure high response rates and the provision of accurate details.  This is standard practice internationally, and the existing national statistical legislation is also very strict in this regard.  The public in general, and businesses in particular, have become very concerned about the confidentiality of particulars relating to them, so it is crucial that the new Act give complete assurances on this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 33 (2) provides that business activity codes and size codes may be assigned by the CSO to listings of business maintained by other public authorities. The purpose of this is to help to ensure that undertakings in the administrative systems or data bases of public authorities are consistently classified by these characteristics, in order to maximise the value of statistics produced by <Col N="1769" /> such bodies or extracted by the CSO from their records.</P>
    <P>Section 34 will allow the CSO to provide &ldquo;public use data tapes&rdquo; containing completely non-identifiable individual data to persons outside the CSO for the purpose of statistical analysis.  This would not be possible under the 1926 Act which provides that individual data, even if non-identifiable, cannot be divulged.  This is standard practice in many countries and it has often been requested by Irish research workers.</P>
    <P>Research workers, understandably wish to work independently on the raw data.  This will now be permissible provided that the units to which the data relate cannot be identified.  The Director General will be responsible under the legislation for deciding the conditions and restrictions under which these data tapes will be provided.  The main concern will be to ensure the data cannot be identified.</P>
    <P>Another major change to existing legislation is provided for in section 35. This will allow public access to the forms completed in the censuses of population since 1926, but only 100 years after the date of the relevant census.  The forms which survive from the 1901 and 1911 censuses are not governed by the Statistics Act, 1926, and are accessible to the public in the National Archives.  Indeed, they are the most frequently used documents in the archives.  They provide an invaluable source of information for genealogical purposes, and many people call into the archives every day to find out more about their ancestors.  Public access to census of population records after a lengthy period is a common practice internationally.</P>
    <P>The final Part of the Bill &mdash; sections 26 onwards &mdash; relates to offences and penalties.  The maximum fine in the existing 1926 legislation is only £50 and has, of course, been severely eroded by inflation over the years.  The CSO has not taken legal proceedings for many years because the fine is so small.  Another factor here is that the CSO has a policy of seeking voluntary compliance whenever possible. Nevertheless, there is an obvious need to <Col N="1770" /> update the penalties.  Section 44 provides for penalties of up to £1,000 for summary offences and up to £20,000 for convictions on indictment.  The DPP would decide what proceedings to bring in particular instances depending on the severity of the offence.  Subsection (2) provides for continuing daily fines for repeated contravention following conviction.</P>
    <P>In summary, the main purposes of the Bill are to implement the new institutional structure of the CSO, including putting both the CSO and the National Statistics Board on a statutory basis; to give the office new co-ordination powers in relation to the statistics of public authorities; to reinforce the confidentiality provisions while allowing access to non-identifiable data for research purposes; to allow public access to census of population records after 100 years and to increase the existing penalties to more realistic levels.</P>
    <P>The Bill will, when enacted, increase the effectivenes of the CSO in providing for statistical information needs.  This will be of considerable benefit to the Government, the EC, researchers, economists, the industrial, agricultural and service sectors of the economy, statistical users generally and the public at large.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The Minister and this House have had a number of skirmishes in recent times but that has not diminished my personal respect for him. These misunderstanding are out of the way and good relations between the two Houses are firmly established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot overestimate the importance of an honest, competent and comprehensive statisical service for the formulation of public policy.  The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that we have such a service and we agree with that objective.  The Bill, which reorganises the statistical service and places it on a new statutory basis, has long been awaited.  It was initiated in the committee set up by Dr. Garret FitzGerald and must have <Col N="1771" /> been an exercise close to that distinguished man's heart.  On first coming into Government he set out a number of questions about what should form the basis of a proper statistical service.</P>
    <P>That reminds me of my first memories of politics which was a debate in the old L &amp; H at UCD back in the early 1960s. I was a student then and the line-up was a distinguished one: the late Seán Lemass, the late James Dillon and the then young Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  I remember the warnings thundered by James Dillon about the perils of listening too often to statisticians.  He was not enamoured of the profession.</P>
    <P>The committee set up by Dr. Garret FitzGerald reported in 1986 and it is a shame that it has taken until now for that report to find its way into legislation.  The legislation must be judged against the criteria laid down in the report of 1986.</P>
    <P>We live in an age where quantification has assumed enormous, almost mystical, proportions.  Disciplines like economics, psychology and sociology have been dominated by the belief that increasingly sophisticated mathematically based techniques will yield answers to the most intractable problems.  This belief was often allied to a contemptuous dismissal of the old approaches which were based on history, the humanities and the distillation of human wisdom.</P>
    <P>Those of us who work in third level education have, over the years, seen the increasing domination and arrogance of those who regard themselves as the quantifiers. In more recent times the pendulum has swung in favour of an incorporation of the two in that the George O'Briens and the James Meenans and others who blazed a trail in the early years are credited with more than many of their successors allowed; Mr. Haughey would certainly belong to that second school.  At the New Ireland Forum I remember him majestically dismissing the proponents of the dismal science.</P>
    <P>Statistics should be a neutral science; an illuminator and provider of firm information upon which good decisions can be made in the public interest.  For that <Col N="1772" /> reason it is essential that the official compiler of statistics be disinterested, apolitical, beyond political interference or beyond any manipulation by people with ideological axes to grind.  The view long held by those who subscribe to the dictum of &ldquo;lies, damn lies and statistics&rdquo;, that statistics are in part about manipulating numbers to make a point, must have no place in our system.  There must never be any suspicion that information from the official statistical service is anything other than the most honest data.</P>
    <P>Statistics or the collection of statistics can be manipulated by an unscrupulous regime in the most basic areas, for example, the counting of those who are out of work.  We have seen in Britain the disingenuous attempts by the Thatcher Government, and later by the Major Government, to massage the figures and create an impression that fewer people were out of work.  We could see it, for example, in the question of establishing the true state of marital breakdown in this country.  Obviously the figures that emerge will have implications for public policy.  We had the experience of the so called &ldquo;black hole&rdquo; where there were major differences about the factual position. In these and many other areas information must be accurate and they are areas where an unscrupulous regime could perhaps mislead the public.</P>
    <P>We could also have a situation where people in the service with axes to grind for their own ideological reasons could present an inaccurate picture.  The tradition in this country has been of the highest, most disinterested form of public service from those who have held the position of Director of the CSO and those who have served there over the years. This Bill, I am sure, aims to maintain that tradition.</P>
    <P>The most frequent complaint from people who are habitual or professional users of statistics concerns the time lag in the publication of the census figures. Only a small number of volumes of the 1986 census has been published, although we are half way into the 1991 census. There tends to be a rush to release the <Col N="1773" /> head counts for towns, constituencies and so forth and after that the pace seems to slacken.  I wonder why, with improved computerisation, the process takes so long.</P>
    <P>The 1986 report frequently refers to liaison with the users.  By and large the main users of statistics have a good relationship with the CSO and find the CSO to be receptive and prepared to engage in effective consultation.  In the last census a new social class scale was designed after consultation with the committee of users and such co-operation should be encouraged.  All wisdom does not lie inside the CSO, outsiders may have insights which could enrich the quality of information.  The greatest possible degree of consultation with bona fide users should be encouraged.  I have put down an amendment regarding that issue which will be discussed later.</P>
    <P>A related issue is the composition of the board.  I have no doubt that the Taoiseach of the day would seek to appoint the best possible board.  However, the concerns of users are not fully taken into account in the composition of the board. The members will be nominated by the Taoiseach with other <i>ex officio</i> members from Government Departments.  While virtually every Department could claim it needs a representative, I am surprised there is no representative from the Department of Agriculture and Food because the Department has for a long time been intimately involved in the compilation of statistical information.  There is a case for having a representative of that Department on the board.  My main concern is that the users <i>per se</i> may not have sufficient representation.</P>
    <P>The original report recommended that three board members be nominated by the NESC and, while I would not necessarily go along with that, I wonder if there is a case to be made for one or two bodies &mdash; for example the Royal Irish Academy &mdash; being given a statutory right to nominate members to the board.  In practice, the Taoiseach's Department would consult these bodies but it might be better if something was written into legislation giving recognition to the rights of users <Col N="1774" /> to representation on the board rather than depending on a grace and favour provision by the Taoiseach of the day.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned the question of raw data being made available 100 years after its compilation.  This is one area where I would take issue with the Bill.  The Minister said one of the most frequently used sections in the National Archives is that dealing with the data from the censuses of 1906 and 1911 but we are saying that the census material compiled since the foundation of the State, for example in 1926 and 1936, will not be available for 100 years.  I regret this.  I should say that the wonderful, new National Archives are doing a great deal for scholarship in this country and are a credit to all concerned.</P>
    <P>At present Cabinet papers are made available after 30 years and they frequently contain sensitive material which can make or break reputations, and provide a fuller picture of how Government operated on our behalf at that time.  The data made available under a 50 or 60 year rule would largely be used by bona fide scholars and researchers, and the National Archives would be in a position to check the credentials of those who wished to use it.</P>
    <P>I would accept a situation where some material is classified and other material is not, as happens with some police records where examinations are made as to what may or may not be released.  I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say on that point because I think a period of 100 years is too restrictive.  Perhaps he could say what the situation is in other countries with regard to the release of archive material.  I intend moving an amendment on this at which point we can discuss it further.</P>
    <P>Looking at the CSO over the years, it is clear from my consultations with people involved that it has become a much more public oriented body and much more cooperative in making material available than many Government Departments. The CSO's light is frequently hidden under a bushel &mdash; I am not quite sure what a bushel is &mdash; but it could blow its own trumpet more loudly, and take <Col N="1775" /> greater credit and more recognition for the excellent work it does.  Those who use its services tell me that the CSO has been open to the public.  This is not true, however, of many Departments.  For example, in the Department of Education, a great deal of data is hidden away and scholars and researchers have difficulty gaining access to it.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage perhaps we could tease out the procedures, if any, for the new office to liberate material which is buried in Departments and which, while not originally collected by the CSO, would be relevant.  I hear from colleagues that Departments, and in particular the Department of Education, are notoriously reticent about making available information which would at this stage be of purely scholarly interest.</P>
    <P>One of the good things about the Bill is that it clarifies the position of the Director General.  The fact that the Director General is appointed by the President will enhance the office, giving it a status that it has not enjoyed up to now in the public mind, even though it deserved to do so.  I agree with giving the Director General sole control over the timing and distribution of releases.  While clearly there will be consultation on this, the ultimate decision must rest with the Director General, and the ultimate test of the integrity of the office will be on the rare occasion when he or she has to withstand political or other pressure to prevent the publication of figures that might be embarrassing.  I am glad also that the Bill gives the Director General control over strategy and methodology for the development of the office because, as I said and as Bill makes clear, the office has to be apolitical and independent.</P>
    <P>I already mentioned the question of the board, and I am concerned that all the appointments will be made, virtually directly, by the Taoiseach.  I will return to this on Committee Stage.  Another thing that concerns me is the major imbalance between the private and public sectors as far as the disclosure of information is concerned.  The strictures on private <Col N="1776" /> companies to provide information appear to be far greater than the strictures on local authorities.  Is this based on the belief that local authorities, by their nature, will co-operate with a governmental agency in making information available, and that private companies &mdash; for whom the provision of information can often be an expensive and distracting business &mdash; need to be coerced?  As I see it there is an imbalance and for that reason I intend moving a number of amendments to that effect.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about, and would like to tease out, some of the powers conferred on compilers of information because in recent times, especially in relation to tax inspectors, we have seen the conferring of powers which might erode some traditional civil liberties.  The right to enter houses in search of information is something that disturbs me, and I will talk about it more fully on Committee Stage, but I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say.</P>
    <P>As regards penalties, the Minister of State has stayed slightly ahead of inflation.  A penalty of £25 in 1926, I am told is probably the same as a penalty of £700 today; therefore, £1,000 is not a big increase.  The penalties have been increased but not too far ahead of inflation.</P>
    <P>The changes in the Bill are welcome because the 1926 Act is out of date.  There is a need for the collection of information to be transparent and the Bill advocates that cause as well as clarifying the position of the Director General.  I hope I will be able to work out any defects on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of the story of an unfortunate compiler of agricultural statistics who was sent out to compile information from a farmer who was reluctant to divulge the information required by the CSO.  Finally, the farmer said, &ldquo;I will tell you the way it is.  Some 70 per cent of farmers are above the average.&rdquo;  He was asked, &ldquo;What average, sir?&rdquo;, and he replied, &ldquo;The average of the other 30 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and ask the Minister <Col N="1777" /> of State to listen to the points I have made and, on Committee Stage, he may even take some of them on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on introducing this overdue legislation in his usual efficient manner.</P>
      <P>This Bill largely originates from a report in 1986 which emphasised the necessity to modernise the relevant legislation which dates back 70 years.  Because of this the Bill is to be welcomed as it should enhance the opportunity for development planning.</P>
      <P>I have a difficulty with legislation of this kind which deals solely with facts and figures and does not afford either the proposed Director General of the CSO or the proposed National Statistics Board itself an opportunity to evaluate findings or to highlight the necessity to address any aspect of these findings.  For example, when Ministers of State, particularly from the Department of the Taoiseach, reply to questions in the Dáil they can only comment on statistical information. They have no responsibility to act on such information.  In view of this perhaps it might be possible to consider on Committee Stage the necessity to extend the function of the National Statistics Board to evaluate and, where necessary, to highlight findings.</P>
      <P>This legislation will enhance the status of the CSO and, it will have the authority to make information more readily available to the public and to those involved in the planning and development of the economy.  In this respect speedy compilation of accurate and reliable information is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we know from experience, by the time the information is available it is outdated and often it is too late to act on the facts highlighted.  For example, the monthly unemployment figures compiled by the CSO do not provide a breakdown of the figures into categories such as carpenters, teachers and so on.  Such a breakdown is not even available, I believe, to the Department of Social Welfare. The paucity of information means it is not possible to highlight the need for <Col N="1778" /> additional training in specific categories of employment growth or to curtail training where there is over supply.</P>
    <P>These comments apply to areas such as education and they illustrate the necessity for publicising as much information as possible on the figures issued by the CSO.  The provisions in this Bill make this possible.</P>
    <P>It is important to continually remind authorities of the necessity to avoid duplication of services.  I welcome the inclusion of health boards and local authorities in the compilation of information and the co-ordination of such information through the CSO.  It means that large amounts of information are being collected from bodies such as the health services and agricultural services, all of whom will benefit.  If there is to be an agency like the CSO undertaking the functions prescribed for it in this Bill, there must be a mechanism for minimising the duplication of information.</P>
    <P>It is essential to avoid, in an area of scarce financial resources, a series of agencies or Departments undertaking their own research and compiling their own reports.  For example, the reports of the health boards are published annually and virtually all local authorities now publish reports.  It is, therefore necessary for the proposed National Statistics Board to liaise with these bodies to minimise overlap in work where possible. There can be no doubt about the desirability and importance of compiling accurate information given that there can be conflicting information from various bodies at times.  For example, there has been contradictory information between Departments, politicians and farming organisations on the level of farmers' incomes.  The CSO must be in a position to provide accurate information and must avoid situations and circumstances where conflicting information may arise as this leads to bad decision making.</P>
    <P>This problem applies to other areas besides agriculture.  There has been conflict on figures for tourism and forecasts of visitors to this country.  This illustrates that there is important work to be undertaken by the proposed Director General <Col N="1779" /> of the CSO and the proposed National Statistics Board.  This work will be vital in planning the future structure of our tourism business and in tackling the unemployment problem.  It will indicate the number of skilled people available in the workforce and will allow people in the planning and development area to plan accordingly.</P>
    <P>I agree with most of this legislation. It is a worthwhile Bill.  I am happy the Central Statistics Office is being moved to Cork, as part of the Government's decentralisation policy.  The decision to relocate the CSO in Cork was made some time ago and is in line with Government policy on the decentralisation and relocation of Departments.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Dempsey, and the Office of Public Works, which has contributed to a dramatic improvement in the economies of towns and regions through the decentralisation policy.  The relocation of the Revenue Commissioners to Ennis, County Clare, and to Limerick has had a dramatic impact on the economy of the mid-west region.  The relocation of the CSO to Cork is progressing steadily and I hope the office will be in place early in the New Year.  It is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could comment on certain areas of the Bill which need clarification.  I am not certain it is necessary for the President to appoint the Director General of the CSO.  We all appreciate this office must be above politics, if anything can be above politics at present.  Personally, I cannot understand why the appointment cannot be made by the Government on the advice of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Director General should be appointed for a specific length of time. This point has not been clarified in the Bill.  If I was offered the job, I would be reluctant to accept it because one's services can be dispensed with at any time on the advice of the Taoiseach.  I would prefer to see a fixed time limit, especially at the initial stages when the new <Col N="1780" /> authority is being set up.  A rotating Director General would be the worst possible option.</P>
    <P>I am not sure it is advisable for the Director General to be a civil servant.  I do not know if it is intended to appoint a civil servant or if the appointee will become a civil servant on taking up the position.  I would prefer if the position was open to civil servants and non-civil servants.  I have the highest regard for civil servants and I would not want people to think otherwise.  However, when appointing a person to a key position, it is important not to be confined to the Civil Service.  This matter must be considered more carefully.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's proposal to impose a fixed time limit on board membership.  This in line with the legislation for the establishment of other semi-State and statutory boards.  If the Minister imposes a fixed time limit on board membership, he should also impose a time limit on the Director General's appointment.  This should be considered on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Manning, I welcome this legislation.  It is an important area of responsibility.  I wish to put on the record our appreciation of the dedication and commitment of the existing staff of the CSO.  We might not have always been satisfied with the information we received from them, but they did provide accurate information.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, information is often delayed.  Therefore, it is not possible to counter misinformation which has been given to the public.  For example, information may have been given to the public about the effects of certain matters on communities or on incomes. However, when the figures were published, it was found there were no ill effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a few examples of where misleading information was given to the public who felt that certain matters were having a devastating effect on the <Col N="1781" /> economy.  They were told that millions of pounds had been lost in industries and thousands of people had lost their jobs. However, this never happened.  If accurate details and specific information had been available from the CSO, it would have been possible to comment on this negative and damaging propaganda.  This is important in disputes involving industries and communities.</P>
    <P>This legislation is clear and precise.  As the Minister has said, it is divided into three areas &mdash; the establishment of the statutory body, the independence of the Director General and the establishment of the board.  It is a worthwhile Bill and I welcome it.  I hope it establishes the framework which will enable our economy to develop and prosper and allow the people involved in the area of economic planning and development to plan future developments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I associate myself with the comments and the suggestions made by Senator Manning and Senator Daly.</P>
      <P>The statistical service has a proud record in this country.  We were among the world leaders in the 19th century in the area of statistical services.  It is fair to say that some of the most outstanding public servants in the country have occupied the position of Director General of the CSO since independence.  Without embarrassing those still alive, one can mention Professor Donal McCarthy who later became President of University College, Cork, Dr. Roy Geary, an internationally famous statistician and before them, Mr. Stanley Lyon and Mr. John Hooper.  Therefore, the CSO has a firm foundation of reputation and record on which to build.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning mentioned the importance of the integrity of the CSO. That is correct.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, paid a deserved tribute to the integrity of the Civil Service here yesterday.  In the case of the CSO its intellectual integrity could now be regarded as a cornerstone of responsible public administration in <Col N="1782" /> this country.  Therefore, I accept entirely the importance of the role of the CSO.</P>
    <P>The role of the CSO has changed in recent years because of the greater demand for domestic statistics, and the greater reliance placed on statistical data in presenting all types of arguments.  As a historian, perhaps I should dislike this practice, but I take the view that history, while it transcends statistics, should also incorporate them, that a good historical argument can never be invalidated by statistics, and that if the statistics are incompatible with it, there is something wrong with the statistics.  However, I will not proceed beyond that.  Historians and scholars should become more adept and professional in the use of statistics.  It is partly that and is partly the fact that our membership of international organisations, the EC in particular, has considerably increased the flow of statistics and changes in the type of statistics.</P>
    <P>A great deal of statistical discussion now revolves around our comparative position in the EC and how our performance in particular areas compares with EC averages.  It is difficult for the uninitiated to make sense of bold assertions about where we come on the league table and what that means.  People will not challenge our position on a league table but the important point is what that position means in terms of the opportunities and challenges we face. The EC dimension adds a further layer of complexity to understanding the implications of our statistics as well as providing more statistics for us to try to understand.  I have tabled amendments with a view to raising the consciousness of some statistics users including, in particular, Members of the Oireachtas.  It appears striking and, unfortunately, realistic, that when the Minister listed the main users of statistics in his introductory statement he referred to &ldquo;principal users of statistics, such as Government Departments, the EC and research bodies&rdquo; but Members of the Oireachtas are conspicuously absent and correctly so because I doubt if they are regular users of statistics either in the sense of perusing the voluminous volumes &mdash; if I can use <Col N="1783" /> that phrase &mdash; that appear, or pursuing the CSO to extract data that might be useful in contributing to public discussion. I am not blaming anyone for that.  I have enormous sympathy for Members of the Oireachtas.  I had sympathy before becoming one but I have a lot more now.  Members of the Oireachtas have an impossible job to do if they try conscientiously to keep abreast of developments in specialised areas, never mind stretching themselves over a range of areas.  I marvel at the diligence of a number of them trying to keep abreast of and understand what is happening.</P>
    <P>It is important that measures be taken to try to improve Members access to statistical data and to enhance their understanding of those data.  Unless we have a statistical training or have been immersed for years in research it is difficult to understand what the data means.  One can read them off but there are so many qualifications on how they are collected, how they compare and what exactly they say, that one can never be sure one is interpreting them correctly.</P>
    <P>I have questions which may arise on further Stages but part of the problem we confront in trying to get the best use out of our statistics is that the official statistics are only one element of the statistical data with which we are bombarded. Sometimes semi-offical, unofficial or private statistics are used by interested parites, which may include Members of the Oireachtas.  This is partly because they are presented in a way which make them more user friendly and they are devised for a particular purpose and unless one has the skills to interpret them one may be convinced by what appears to be self-evident truth.</P>
    <P>I will take a couple of examples of what I have in mind as regards education in which I am particularly interested.  There are difficulties getting information for a Member of the Oireachtas, in this case myself.  I will take five minutes to mention them as they are illustrative of problems that confront Members.  We discussed the Culliton report here yesterday and on <Col N="1784" /> other occasions and I will refer to one of the best known sentences in the report which has been used for policy purposes. It is the policy implications, not the intrinsic merits or otherwise, that interest me.  The report states that:</P>
    <P>Between 1971 and 1986 the number of accountants more than trebled, and the number of auctioneers and lawyers doubled, but the number of engineers increased by less than 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>That is part of preparing the reader to accept the conclusion that we ought to invest more heavily in technical education and relatively less in other areas of education.  I have an open mind on the investment categories in education; I do not represent any particular area of interest in education.  I am a historian but much of my historical writing has been on the inter-relationship between technology and business.  My background is not one of culture in the narrowest and sometimes most derogatory sense of the word in which it is used by those who argue that such creatures are peripheral to the economic problems confronting Ireland today.</P>
    <P>When I read that statistic I asked if the inference was justified, but we will leave inference aside for the moment since inference goes into politics to an extent. Then I asked myself if the statement was justified and what evidence there was for it.  One of my initial reactions was that given that relative emigration rates are likely to vary greatly between these groups, with a far higher rate of emigration among engineers than among lawyers due to the marketability of their skills abroad, the statistic may indicate something which happened in Ireland but does not tell us what the educational institutions were producing if many of those graduates went abroad on a different emigration rate.  Even finding that out requires a lot of digging.</P>
    <P>In order to clarify the point I contacted the Higher Education Authority as I considered it the first body to refer to for such clarification.  They supplied me with figures which, as far as they went, did not even bear out what was being said in the <Col N="1785" /> Culliton report, but if one were to pursue them in order to be confident of one's conclusions, one would have to ask further questions and pester someone whose job it was not to be supplying this type of data.</P>
    <P>I have preliminary information but I have not gone further on it because it is partly a question of my time and that of others, and partly of trying to know how one establishes the truth in cases like this. Leaving aside inferences and conclusions, how does one find out if the basic information is accurate?  This is the type of statement to which most people can relate and is evidence which seems convincing.  It is not cast in the form of a statistical table where one wonders about decimal places or what it all adds up to. This seems to make sense to people and therefore carries disproportionate weight in the formation of public opinion and in receptivity to arguments.</P>
    <P>A second and related piece of evidence that is being used at high official level at present comes from a different source, an international source, a copy is not available in our Library.  I have sent for it but it has not yet arrived from Paris.  It is a statement to the effect that Ireland establishes one firm for every 500 people, annually presumably.  However, these things are defined.  I presume that the statistic dealing with people is fairly accurate but everything else is less concrete. France, Germany and, I think, Italy have one firm for every 200 people; the United States has one firm for every 240 people. This shows definitely that we lack an enterprise culture, we have only half the rate of firm formation compared to other countries and we lack self starters.  We need to inject into education &mdash; this is an issue that arises in the context of the Green Paper and the forthcoming White Paper on Education &mdash; a far higher consciousness of the meaning of an enterprise culture.</P>
    <P>I am a strong believer in competition and enterprise but it is important to diagnose problems correctly initially. What do those figures mean?  Are they comparable?  Are they drawn from the same source?  They do not come from an <Col N="1786" /> Irish official source but they are used in official discussion.  How can someone who wants to ascertain the reliability of this type of data, or perhaps look even further since I am leaving the policy inferences aside, do so?  It is easy for someone like me who is daily engaged in research in other contexts but it is difficult for a harassed Member of the Oireachtas who has many claims on his time.</P>
    <P>We are often told we are very poor at establishing small firms in this country and one could very well ask what is the statistical basis of the relationship between small firms and large firms in these other countries I mentioned.  How many small firms are established in order to supply large firms in these countries because if there is a far different ratio of large firms to small firms, it may be that the opportunities for establishing small firms in those countries are far greater than here.  If one were to take account of that factor, the degree of enterprise being shown by Irish people in the circumstances is comparable.  I will not go on further about that because one can see how many layers there are &mdash; it is almost like an archaeological dig.</P>
    <P>The inferences drawn are very important and are likely, I suggest, to influence policy at Cabinet level at least as much as the perusal of reams of tables in statistical abstract.  Impressions are formed much more effectively by that type of information than they are by the tabular type one finds in much of the official statistics.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the relationship between the supply of official statistics, the supply of official statistics and semi-offical statistics from international bodies.  For example, I do not know the status of the Culliton report in official terms.  I presume it was set up under the auspices of the Government; is the type of material used there official data in the sense in which CSO material is official data?  How far can one check these things?  How far could one ask the CSO for a factual evaluation of the quality of the data used in what seems to me an official report or a report under official auspices as distinct from a pressure group's report or a report from any of <Col N="1787" /> the lobby groups around the country which are aiming at an immediate and particular legislative objective?</P>
    <P>The more we rely on this type of presentation of material, in a sense the more we marginalise the official statistics and the CSO.  We can have wonderful statistics and a very wide range of coverage, we can have complete confidence in the integrity and competence of the CSO and then we ignore a great deal of the data and give preference to material that has not been collated for similar purposes. There is a real and serious problem in how we incorporate CSO material in policy formulation rather than relying on other material which is more favourable in the short term.</P>
    <P>I am trying to enhance our appreciation of the CSO; I am not denigrating it in any way.  Enormous responsibility is on Members of the Oireachtas to try to use material and to follow up with questions about the use of material which both raises our consciousness and makes the CSO, and perhaps other suppliers or users of statistics, more conscious of the scrutiny to which they can be subjected. At the moment such material receives very little scrutiny and I doubt if many Members of the Oireachtas would get much thanks from their colleagues if they spend a long time trying to dissect and break down statistical data.  I am concerned about that and that is why I put down an amendment that at least one of the Taoiseach's nominees should be competent to represent the interests of Members of the Oireachtas; how precisely those interests would be made known, elaborated, devised and so on is another matter.</P>
    <P>I am simply horrified at the problems that Members of the Oirechtas confront in trying to pursue seriously and conscientiously the type of question I have mentioned.  If the standing, competence and self-confidence of the Oireachtas is to be raised, massive research support in a whole range of areas is required.  Many of these bear no relation to statistics but the statistical areas must be central <Col N="1788" /> because so much argument is conducted in those terms nowadays.</P>
    <P>That is the gravamen of what I wish to say at this stage but in reference to the point raised by Senator Manning about the 100 years rule &mdash; I jotted this down for discussion purposes of an amendment &mdash; it is incongruous that the 1901 and 1911 census figures are available &mdash; I spent many happy hours working on them &mdash; and the 1926 figures are not available.  For genuine scholarly and research interests, it is incongruous that the first census after the founding of the State, which records many of the changes that occurred during that time, should not be available in the way the last census before the founding of the State is available.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate the problems of confidentiality. I accept those and I agree entirely with what the Bill states in terms of the importance of protecting confidentiality but I would like a more user-friendly type of phraseology or at least an understanding that when the Director General is exercising his discretion, or her discretion as the case may be in due course, about charges, rates and access and so on, the legitimacy of impersonal research purposes will be very favourably kept in mind.  I would like a commitment along those lines, that for scholarly purposes, legitimate researchers can gain access to this material in a way or on terms which do not impede serious genuine research.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the Statistics Bill which deals with the CSO, the Director General and the new board.  It is time we updated legislation for the collection and compilation of official statistics.  This is necessary in view of our membership of the EC.  Statistics need to be collected and available to State agencies, local authorities and others so that future projects can be planned.  With the £8 billion coming from the EC, proper plans need to be in place and statistics are of the utmost importance</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the CSO offices are to be decentralised to Cork.  Perhaps <Col N="1789" /> Cork did not use statistics very well last Sunday when we were dealing with County Clare but let us hope next Sunday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when it comes to Kerry that we will do a little better.  That remains to be seen.  It is no good gathering facts and figures and storing them away.  The information gathered by the CSO and other agencies should be used fully for the promotion of various services in this country and internationally.  There is a great need for close co-operation between the CSO and the Ordnance Survey Office.  For example, many towns and villages throughout the country, which do not have urban councils or town commissioners, often do not have defined areas.</P>
      <P>If somebody asks what is the population of an area, does one measure it in terms of boundary: for instance, do you go to the crossroads, do you follow the piped water supply line or do you follow the town or village lights?  How does one determine the number of people living there?  Coming from a rural region, I know it is difficult to assess accurately how many people live in an area.  In co-operation with the local authority, the Ordnance Survey Office and the CSO, the population of every town or village should be assessed.  The population in a region can define the category of a town or village with regard to entry to Board Fáilte, for example: even 100 people could make the difference between a higher and lower rating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important for the CSO to help in future job planning.  Every year, there are many students coming out of third level institutions.  If they knew from the start the number of jobs that would be available when they graduate five years on, they would be able to assess their chances of getting employment in that discipline.  At present, there may be 200 applications for 2 vacancies.  If statistics were accurate, people could be influenced when making career decisions <Col N="1790" /> which would increase their chances of gaining employment.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that the appointment of the Director General of the CSO will be made by the President because it will help ensure confidentiality. When getting a form a person will look at it carefully.  Their first reaction may be to refuse to fill it up because they consider it asks for too much information.  Although this may be ordinary information, people do not like putting it on paper.  We are suspicious by nature, but we must give confidentiality and protection of information top priority where the CSO is concerned. We need to carry out a public relations programme to assure the public that the information they give is confidential and will only be used to produce non-identifiable data.  It will be difficult to get this message across as many people will not sign forms because they fear that the information may be used against them in the future.  This could either lead to misleading or no information being given.</P>
    <P>When a person receives a census form they ask themselves how they will tackle it.  I agree with the long and detailed census form because these forms are not issued too often and it is important to get as many details as possible.  There are many people working on the census who can help those who are having difficulties filling the forms.  The more comprehensive a census is &mdash; if the figures are used correctly afterwards &mdash; the more of a benefit it will be for everyone.</P>
    <P>I am glad we are putting the CSO and the National Statistics Board on a statutory basis, that the information gathered will be confidential and that the figures compiled by the CSO, the Director General of the CSO and the National Statistics Board, will benefit local and national areas and will be of extreme importance for us in our membership of the EC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for welcoming the Bill.  Senator Manning referred to some differences of opinion we may have had in my role <Col N="1791" /> as Government Chief Whip.  I explained myself to the Seanad Committee on Procedures and Privileges and I take this opportunity to say that no disrespect to the House was intended at that time.  As long as I am Government Chief Whip, a more than adequate supply of Bills will be initiated in this House because it makes the work of the other House more efficient in that they are thoroughly examined here.  I am conscious that there is a time limit on this Bill, so I will touch on the topics to which the Senators referred and that will give us time to deal with them in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>First, I would like to refer to the importance of maintaining the independence of the CSO, something they jealously guard and rightly so.  Senator Manning said that if the CSO was not independent, or was not seen to be independent, there would be a possibility of the manipulation of data, which would not be to anyone's benefit and if there was only a suspicion of this, it would lead to problems for the CSO.  I accept this point and I assure the House that the Bill is designed to strengthen that independence. Senator Manning refered to the manipulation of data concerning the live register statistics in the UK.  In May 1992 we changed the way we compiled these statistics to bring them into line with OECD practice and this reduced the live register count by 5,200.  When this change occurred after consultation and as a result of the review carried out by the CRC of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the categories of persons excluded from the live register post-May 1992 were, and have been, clearly delineated in each statistical bulletin of the monthly unemployment figures. Therefore, it is obvious that these figures will be different, depending on the set of statistics used.  That underlines the point made about the independence of the CSO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the area of co-ordination.  It is accepted that some sections of the Bill, particularly section 10 (2) and (3) and sections 30 and <Col N="1792" /> 31 will strengthen co-ordination between the CSO, Government Departments and public authorities.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning mentioned the distinction between public and private organisations.  This Bill also relates to private organisations, business or individuals. The same penalties apply to both public and private organisations.  In section 3 the definition of the term &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; includes a public authority. Sections 30 and 31 will generate more work for the public authorities in terms of complying with the legislation.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators, including Senator Daly, spoke about the composition of the board.  The 1985 White Paper made specific recommendations in this regard.  One subsection provides for the composition of eight members of the National Statistics Board in the manner prescribed in paragraph 27 of the 1985 White Paper.  However, this legislation provides for the appointment of an assistant secretary or equivalent or higher grade from the Department of Finance. It excludes a specific reference to the National Economic and Social Council. Since this is a non-permanent statutory body, we had to ensure that if something were to happen in the future &mdash; I do not want anyone to take the wrong meaning from this; there are no plans to do away with the NESC &mdash; and another body was put in its place, the legislation would not need to be amended.</P>
    <P>This legislation provides for the nomination of persons of proven ability and experience in the relevent fields by organisations which the Taoiseach considers representative of users of official statistics and providers of information.  The NESC will continue as the nominating body while it continues in existence and the Taoiseach will act on the nominations of the NESC.</P>
    <P>The CSO is gearing itself towards computerisation, towards the increased use of computerisation in the preparation of forms and the compilation of statistics but there are many areas where clerical resources are needed.  In fairness to the CSO, they have produced the recent statistics well in line with previous years. <Col N="1793" /> Generally they have done their work more quickly but the CSO largely depends on manual operation for the input of statistics and this may cause delays.  The CSO often remind me of the need for additional personnel so that tasks, such as the census, may be carried out more quickly.</P>
    <P>In relation to business inquiries, one is dependent on the rate and speed of response from businesses.  Most businesses respond satisfactorily to demands or requests for information but others do not.  Last year we initiated, on a statutory basis, a number of annual sample inquiries into the services sector.  The samples covered 6,500 enterprises in areas such as the retail sector and even though the inquiry related to a narrow range of questions, the response was disappointing.  It took approximately three months for 50 per cent of forms to be returned.  Many resources were used in follow-up measures and that can cause problems and delays.  However, increased fines, which I hope we will not have to impose, will prove beneficial.  Existing penalties are too small.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been an improvement in regard to the time taken to complete work.  For example, the results of the annual census of industrial production have been published earlier than usual.  Furthermore, the national accounts of 1991 were published in July 1992, while the national accounts of 1992 will be published later this month. Improvements are ongoing.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Director General, he or she is appointed by the President so as to underline the independence of the position. A similar practice is used in other appointments, for example, the DPP. The Bill provides for a fixed term contract basis.  In relation to Senator Daly's question about civil servants, the person to be appointed Director General need not be a civil servant.  However, on appointment that person automatically becomes a civil servant.</P>
    <P>I am unable to answer Senator Lee's question about the Culliton report.  I do not know whether those compiling the report used official CSO statistics or their <Col N="1794" /> own statistics.  I share the Senator's view in relation to the sentence he quoted. Senator Lee also mentioned education statistics and specifically the Higher Education Authority.  The Higher Education Authority recently established an advisory body on statistics on which the CSO is one of the bodies represented.  It is expected that this body will remedy some of the shortcomings mentioned.  This point also relates to public bodies.  This legislation will be of benefit in this regard.</P>
    <P>A Member referred to the adage, &ldquo;lies, damn lies and statistics.&rdquo;  It must have been a statistician who made the comment that a politician uses statistics like a drunk uses a lamp post, more for support than illumination.  Senator Lee pointed out that it might be of benefit if politicians used official statistics in debates in the Houses.  We return to the aforementioned points about real statistics and their availability in reasonable time.</P>
    <P>We will be discussing the 100 year rule on Committee Stage.  I have no serious hang-up whether the time-scale is 50, 60 or 100 years.  However, there is considerable unease about the confidentiality of information.  I understand that census forms remain confidential for about two generations.  If this period were any shorter, people filling the forms would fear that the information would not be confidential and their grandchildren or others would be able to look into their background.  This is a real fear. The Senator made a very good point in relation to the 1901 and 1911 censuses of population and the fact that the information provided in subsequent censuses is not available to researchers.  I may not be able to do anything about that in this Bill but for research purposes we might be able to examine this issue.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), line 32 to delete &ldquo;extraction and dissemination&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;extraction, dissemination and, where appropriate, evaluation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment as a way of expressing the concern I was talking about earlier with the purpose of exploring the possibility of seeing how one can use the CSO more effectively in terms of statistical education for public usage. Inserting the words &ldquo;where appropriate, evaluation&rdquo; accepts immediately that evaluation in a general way would add a burden to the CSO and responsibilities which it would not be appropriate to expect them to discharge.  However, there are areas where some revaluation of the date can be undertaken, its degree of reliability, the functions for which it may be legitimately used and the inferences that can and cannot be extracted from it.  I realise it is very difficult to specify those.  Nevertheless an almost educational function should, in principle, be available to and at times are requested from the CSO so that one could not exclude the possibility of there being a more evaluative category there from time to time when new data is introduced or if the CSO would ensure that the data it provides is not being used in a way it deems inappropriate.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the sensitivity which can arise and the fact that a great deal of data can quite legitimately be used for partisan political purposes.  That is part of the normal cut and thrust of politics and it would not be my objective to limit in any way the potential for that.  I believe that, partly because of our statistical illiteracy and partly because of the pressures of time on us, we do not use statistical material legitimately and that a certain amount of public service time is spent dealing with issues which need not have been raised or which might have been raised in a more sophisticated manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the purpose of this amendment. <Col N="1796" /> I think it is a legitimate purpose but I do not know if this is the most effective way of achieving it.  The amendment is permissive; it is not obligatory. It allows a learning process to emerge if it were felt that there is something to be said in this direction, and I am convinced there is.</P>

      <P>My initial reaction to what the Senator proposed is to reject it.  We all agree that the most important aspect is the independence of the CSO.  If the CSO were to stray as the Central Bank has into making economic comment on the activities of the Government, it would quickly become embroiled in party politics of one kind or another.</P>
      <P>The Senator will appreciate that the collection of statistics of necessity means that the basic data will be evaluated.  I do not think that he is referring to this but to an education process.  I suggest that it might be more appropriate if I were to request the views of the National Statistics Board on the evaluation/education process.  At present there is an education process for users who are directly involved in the compilation and use of statistics.  If we wish to introduce changes we generally consult with the users to get their views.  I do not think it is appropriate to insert this amendment in the Bill and am concerned about the effects it would have.  The Senator could go directly to the CSO to discuss this matter or I could bring it to the National Statistics Board and ask them to seek views on it and to see how his concerns can best be met.</P>

      <P>I will not press the amendment in the light of what the Minister has said.  His response was a civilised and appropriate one.  I found it helpful. However, the issue is one which deserves to be pursued and I would be grateful if the Minister would bring it to the National Statistics Board.  There is a mutual education process involved, the CSO must from time to time&mdash;perhaps very frequently &mdash; see their material used in ways which never occurred to them. <Col N="1797" /> Some mechanism ought to be found to raise the education level of those who use statistics.  I am thinking of Members of this House because this in an opportunity to enhance mutual understanding.  I appreciate the validity of the point made by the Minister.  However, I hope this issue will not be forgotten and that the board will see the most effective way of pursuing it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1a:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (2), line 5, after &ldquo;statistics&rdquo; to add &ldquo;, including Members of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is part of the same process.  The aim of this amendment is to stress that Members of the Oireachtas are among the principal users of statistics, or ought to be.  They have been overlooked in everything that has been put on paper or said so far.  I wish to link this amendment with amendment No. 3a, if I may, which concerns the composition of the board. If amendment No. 3a were accepted, this would suffice to cover my concern about this matter because, as things stand, there is no provision for even the most nominal recognition of Members of the Oireachtas as users of statistics.  I am interested in raising the matter wherever possible.  If a member of the board was competent to look after the needs of Members of the Oireachtas as users of statistics &mdash; and that person need not necessarily be a Member of the Oireachtas &mdash; it would cover most of my concerns.</P>
      <P>Is it in order to ask the Minister of State about his response to amendment No. 3a?  Otherwise, I am at a loss to know where a specific reference to Members of the Oireachtas, which I wish to see included somewhere, can be inserted?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the spirit of <Col N="1798" /> what Senator Lee has said.  We both come from a similar background and before I became a Member of the Oireachtas I was accustomed to hearing academics speak disparagingly of politicians.  It was a revelation to discover the amount of information which conscientious Members of the Oireachtas are obliged to assimilate and evaluate in an enormous range of disciplines and often under great pressure.  I always had a high opinion of politicians and was honoured and pleased to become one, but it did not take me long to realise the range of topics that have to be covered and the pressures involved.</P>
      <P>I do not want to anticipate the Minister of State, but perhaps making the board aware of the problems politicians have in this regard and the services they would find useful would meet the case.  I support the spirit of Senator Lee's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I also understand the points made, but we have seen in recent legislation, for example the Industrial Development Bill 1993, specific exclusion of Members of the Oireachtas from membership of boards.  I do not see any such exclusion in this Bill.  I do not know if it will be possible to have a Member of the Oireachtas on the board in this case.</P>
      <P>I do not fully agree with the exclusion of Members of the Oireachtas from the boards of State bodies.  It may be unwise. We endeavoured to have some cross-fertilisation between the interests involved in the Industrial Development Bill, 1993, last night &mdash; a member of one board can also be a member of another to allow cross-fertilisation between the related activities of the authorities concerned. As there is no specific exclusion of Members of the Oireachtas in this Bill, I wonder would it be possible to have one on the board?  I believe that would meet Senator Lee's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I argued that the person would not necesarily have to be a Member of the Oireachtas to be competent to represent our needs so I would <Col N="1799" /> not haggle over that.  However, I appreciate Senator Daly's general point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that either of the two amendments are necessary, because Members of the Oireachtas are not specifically excluded in the legislation. I agree, however, with the principle of the proposal.  In relation to amendment No. 1a to insert &ldquo;including Members of the Oireachtas&rdquo;, we must assume that they are already users of statistics.  I believe that adding them to this section is making an unnecessary distinction.</P>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 3a, it would be difficult to accommodate a wide variety of interests on the board without losing its effectiveness, because the numbers on the board would have to be expanded.  In relation to the point made, and specifically to the board itself, I will bring this matter to the Taoiseach's attention and ask them to keep it in mind when nominating the board's members.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the place to have somebody is on the National Statistics Board which advises the CSO, draws up the programmes and so on.  I will talk to the NSB to try to ensure there is somebody on their boards who is conscious of the needs of Oireachtas Members.  Perhaps, the Clerk of the Dáil, or other appropriate person working in the Houses of the Oireachtas, would be suitable because they would know what was needed.  In my other capacity as Government Chief Whip I know there will be an increasing need to use statistics in the Houses.  I accept the principle of the Senator's amendment but, as I have said, I do not think the amendments are necessary.</P>

      <P>I will not press the amendment but I would like to respond briefly.  I appreciate what the Minister of State has said, but I believe this is a substantive important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to what the Minister said earlier when he suggested that he bring some of the concerns I expressed to the board or that I contact it myself, I consider <Col N="1800" /> it unsatisfactory that individual Members of the Oireachtas should have to make their way through such a procedure. It so happens in my own case, I know some of the people involved and can do that, but that is giving preferential treatment to those Members of the Oireachtas who, by chance, know some of the people involved.  I do not believe that is fair to those who want to make a conscientious contribution but have not such contacts.</P>
    <P>There are deeper matters at stake here regarding the quality of service Members of the Oireachtas can render and the facilities available to them.  I am grateful for what the Minister of State has said and accept it in the spirit offered, but I will be returning to the matter on a fairly regular basis during whatever length of time I am here.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (2), line 5 after &ldquo;statistics.&rdquo; to add &ldquo;A register of such users shall be compiled and a meeting of the said users and the Office held once each year to review the activities of the Office and to discuss matters of mutual concern.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is, first, to recognise the principle of the users' right to be consulted.  That said, I know the CSO has been conscientious with respect to, and open to, the users of information.  However, we live in an era where consumers' rights need formal recognition.  I am also conscious of the remote possibility that the co-operation which exists at present might not always <Col N="1801" /> be there.  Academics and quasiacademics can occasionally get into conflicts which assume virtually theological proportions at a certain stage.  Years from now, there could be disagreement of a fairly fundamental nature about the methodology being pursued by the CSO on the part of some of those who use it.  The sort of thing is not unknown. Schismatic movements are not just confined to churches.  I am proposing that, as of a right, once a year the CSO would consult with the main users and ask them for their views on what is happening and how things could be improved.  There could be an interchange of views and it would be there as of right rather than at the present time where it is there by grace and favour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Senator is trying to do in this amendment and I also appreciate the fact that he recognises there is a good relationship between the CSO and the users.  The amendment as it is would entail much work and time being used in compiling and maintaining registers.  It would divert staff from necessary work.  It is important to emphasise that the CSO maintains strong links with the principal users of statistics.  The list changes constantly and an attempt to maintain a comprehensive register of users would not be practical or advisable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important to point out in relation to the Bill generally that at the moment the National Statistics Board is non-statutory but will be on a statutory basis under the legislation.  It will represent the broad sectors using the statistics. In preparing the board's strategy for statistics every five years, there is an extensive consultation process undergone beforehand with the users and suppliers of data.  As I mentioned, over 200 persons and organisations, including international organisations &mdash; though unfortunately, not political parties &mdash; were contacted by post in 1992.  There were also a number of seminars, liaison groups and so on involved in the preparation of that report.  Since the users and their interests are so diverse, it is <Col N="1802" /> considered preferable that one would have sector meetings rather than large meetings.  The seminars and meetings are better when they are small.</P>
    <P>Last year, three seminars were held by the CSO as part of the input to the board's strategy.  There was one held on the systems of national accounts, another on the labour market statistics and another on demographic statistics.  The seminars have been well attended which bears out Senator Manning's point that there should be a good flow of information and consultation between the groups and that the users of the statistics and the suppliers of the data take a keen interest.  I take it that is the real reason the Senator proposed the amendement. At each seminar there is a brief presentation highlighting the main issues of importance to the major users of statistics. This is followed by a free flowing open discussion and a question and answer session.  Proposals are made and taken on board.</P>
    <P>Section 11(2) will require the office to maintain close and regular contact with the principal users and suppliers of the statistics and the precise details of those consultations can be left to the CSO and the National Statistics Board.  Senator Manning is highlighting another point in the amendment which is that the CSO would do a little more PR for itself and get out more.  I can assure the Senator that will be done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording here is the wording recommended in the report upon which this Bill is based.  I do not regard it as a major point but I do not understand precisely what is meant by a period from two to six years.  Is it that some members would be there for two years and others for three, four, five or six years?  As it is now, it strikes me that it will be a sort of a rotating membership.  I am not sure if this is a great idea because sometimes when that happens one can have people who are there virtually forever and a particular way of thinking develops. Sometimes it is important that a board be almost cleared out completely and replaced with a totally new board.  If it was for four or five years that could be done.  I am not overly concerned but I <Col N="1804" /> would like the Minister to explain the thinking behind it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for precisely that reason that we are talking about periods of two and six years.  It is felt that it would not be a good idea, particularly in an area like this and that it would not lead to effective functioning if one was to clear out a board every four or six years.  The idea is that the Taoiseach can appoint members for a specific period of two, three, four, five or six years and that one will have new people coming in at various stages rather than having a clean sweep at the end of a four or six year period. From a political point of view, following a change of Government one could also have a situation where the board became due for reappointment.  Although they will not be appointed politically, everybody on the board would go and one would lose continuity.  I appreciate the point the Senator was making but I think this is a better way of approaching it.</P>

It seems to me this is an area where there are different ways at looking at statistics as they reflect the representation of the genders.  I do not believe in axiomatic representation but there should be a commitment in the Bill to some female representation on the National Statistics Board.  Perhaps it is there already, I do not know, but it is a valid area for taking that perspective into account.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister of State about the collection of statistics on suicide.  It is generally accepted that the recorded number of suicides is two or three times lower than the actual number of suicides.  When suicide was a crime, questions of criminal liability could not be considered under the Coroner's Act, 1962.  Now that suicide is not a crime, I understand that the coroner can determine that a suicide has taken place.  I wish to know what action will be taken to ensure that coroners look at this.</P>
      <P>There is a problem with providing evidence in a coroner's court if a suicide took place which can interfere with the statistics.  The present position, I understand, is that the investigating garda reports his opinion as to whether an incident was a suicide to the Central Statistics Office.  I would like the Minister of State to comment on the updating of the approach and if anything can be done to improve the gathering of statistics on suicides.  The psychiatric services and so on are concerned about obtaining proper data, especially on increasing levels of suicide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>This section worried me because it appeared to confer almost draconian powers on information collectors which would put them on a par with staff of the Revenue Commissioners who were involved in specific incidents recently.  Clearly, the collection of information of this sort should never be accompanied by forcible entry of a home or business place.  I am worried that this legislation seems to be conferring powers which could be abused, for a purpose which would not warrant those powers.</P>

      <P>I am not too comfortable with this either.  The Minister of State might consider a small amendment, to insert into the section the words &ldquo;other than a person's private residence&rdquo;.  I do not have any great difficulty with an official seeking information at a person's place of business but I would have reservations about providing a facility which could give officials access to private dwellings.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Members' concerns in that regard but I think they are reading too much into the section. Section 29 confers the right of access to officers of statistics for statistical purposes. Subsection (a) provides that an officer of statistics may enter a premises to personally deliver a notice.  It is required, for example, in the case of a census of population where an officer needs to deliver a census form to a tenant in an apartment block or house of flats which the owner might otherwise be able to prevent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (b) relates to the delivery of forms and questionnaires.  These forms are often collected in obligatory and voluntary business inquiries by officers of statistics.  The CSO has a permanent team <Col N="1807" /> of eight field officers who visit firms for this purpose.  Temporary teams of field officers are also recruited for large scale inquiries.  This was done, for example, for the 1988 census of services and the 1987 household budget survey.</P>
    <P>Subsection (c) provides the right of access for the purpose of making inquiries authorised under the Act.  That covers a situation where, for example, a statistics officer, such as a census of population enumerator would have to enter a premises to determine if a person or undertaking relevant to some inquiry was resident or, perhaps, even existed.</P>
    <P>The phrase used is &ldquo;at all reasonable times&rdquo;.  It is intended to ensure that the access is made at a time which is convenient to the person in charge of the premises in question.  The officer must be reasonable.  Senator Manning mentioned other people who have powers and I do not think they are constrained by that; they can arrive at any time after giving notice.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear, because everybody is concerned, that the section does not provide any right of forcible entry.  The offence of preventing entry for statistical purposes at a reasonable time is defined in section 37.  A person found guilty of such an offence shall be liable to a fine as set out in secton 44.  There are also sections in the Bill which prevent the officer from abusing his power.  While I understand the fears expressed, I want to reassure the House that this Bill is not designed to give an officer a right of forcible entry.  Any of these examinations, filling out of forms, handing out forms and so on, must be carried out at reasonable times.</P>

      <P>In page 14, line 28, after &ldquo;statistical&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and scholarly&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This point has been touched on in general discussion.  I should have used the words, &ldquo;for statistical and research purposes only&rdquo; but I am prepared to be reassured in a sense by the Minister's comments earlier.  Can the Oireachtas in some way convey to the Director General its intention, if it is its intention, that this should be interpreted in a constructive manner for genuine research purposes?  As it stands it would be open to the Director General to impose such charges, conditions and restrictions that would make it impossible to operate effectively.  I accept the Director General is totally independent and I do not know the procedure in order to intimate to him that one would wish him to respond in a particular way.  If there could be some indication of that, it would allay the type of fears that I, Senator Manning and perhaps others have in that respect.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 14, line 36, to delete &ldquo;100 years&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;50 years&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This point has been well covered on Second Stage.  The Minister expressed an open attitude to this in his reply.  He made the point in his speech that the 1911 census data is one of the most frequently used data banks in the national archive. I am sure the Minister would agree that 100 years is unduly restrictive.  He mentioned the objection, which is the same situation as might occur with Garda files, that information might prove embarrassing to people who are still alive.  The Minister suggested that he did not have any great objection in principle; I propose a verbal amendment at this stage which might meet the Minister's objection and the point I am trying to make. This might allow the Minister to do what we should do and yet safeguard interests.</P>
      <P>Would it be possible to change 100 years to 50 years and after the word &ldquo;census&rdquo; insert &ldquo;save in the case of data deemed by the Director General to be of a sensitive or classified nature&rdquo;?  We accept that the Director General is a person of total integrity in this matter and we are giving him or her discretion to release data which could be of great value to researchers and scholars without interfering with the rights of living people where embarrassing material might become available.  I am not sure of the proprieties of this but I am proposing this amendment and perhaps it could be incorporated.  It would meet both the Minister's reservations and the objective that I, Senator Lee and others seek.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with prevention of access.  I noted the points made by Senator Manning and the point made by the Minister in reply.  I ask the Minister of State in his capacity as Chief Whip to be wary of powers granted to deal with access.  I have great reservations about such powers as they entitle a person to enter a home or a business premises.  I accept that there are no such <Col N="1811" /> problems at present but there will be a problems in the long term where somebody, for one reason or another, does not want another person to enter his private house to collect information.  There is a real danger that we are heading down the road of &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; with this type of legislation going on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning compared the powers confered on an officer of statistics in section 29 to those conferred on officers of the Revenue Commissioners.  These powers include access to property and delivering documents.  Whether we like it or not, section 37 confers very real powers that I would be wary of putting on the Statute Book.  I am not extreme in my views, but I feel strongly about this type of legislation.  Before it goes to the Dáil I would ask that its powers be diluted because they are too extensive.  Under this section a person has power to enter a house and obtain documents and if he is prevented from doing so, the person who stopped him is guilty of an offence. These are extreme powers.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Senator Enright said on section 37.  There are real powers and while our fears were allayed earlier, the &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; scenario pops up again.  What is a &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo; for entering a premises?  The person who owns a house is the one who should define what is a reasonable time.  I would like the Minister of State to clarify this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what the Members are saying but section 29 is specific and says:</P>
      <P>An officer of statistics may at all reasonable times, on production of his certificate of appointment if demanded, enter any premises for the purposes of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) delivering a notice under section 26 of this Act, or</P>
      <P>(b) delivering or collecting forms questionnaires, records or information or,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1812" /> (c) making any such inquiries as he is authorised to make under this Act.</P>
    <P>This is hardly the ogre of &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo;, it seems to me to be the normal function of the officer's duty.  If somebody is interfering with an officer carrying out his duty, it is deemed to be an offence.  I would not share the view that this is &ldquo;Big Brother 1993&rdquo;, I think that is overstating it.  Section 29 is specific on what the officer can or cannot do.  It does not seem to pose the threat Members are suggesting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the fears people have if they look at similar powers other Stage agents have, in particular officers of the Revenue Commissioners. However, we are talking here about the right of access for an officer to deliver forms or to officially question a person for statistical purposes and for nothing else.</P>
      <P>We discussed the phrase &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo;.  To me &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo; is when the householder says.  Section 37 has an important role to play also in the protection of State officers.  If a State officer has a job to do, a duty to fulfil, he should not be subjected to physical or other threat.  We must have a penalty in law for, as it appears in section 37, &ldquo;any person who prevents an officer of statistics from entering at a reasonable time. ..&rdquo;.  You are talking about an officer of the State being physically prevented from delivering a census or other form.  We have to keep a balance.  In line with what Members have said, I will have another look at it to see if we can be more specific and deal particularly with the case of a private dwelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator McGennis said, I think Members may be reading too much into this section.  I explained under section 29 that we were talking about a situation where there were blocks of flats or apartments. For instance, somebody may have a block of flats or bed-sits that are not in good condition, and a census officer or an officer from the Central Statistics Office wants to gain access to compile information for the census of population.  Supposing the landlord has not declared the <Col N="1813" /> number of flats he has.  That is not the business of the statistics officer, but the landlord could say that a Stage agent was prying and as he would report him to the tax officers, he will not let him inside the door.  We must keep a balance, and this section provides penalties for people who do that.  I accept the concerns Members have expressed and I will have another look at it, particularly as it relates to private dwellings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard what the Minister said on section 29 and I appreciate what Senator McGennis said that this is not a major provision in itself, but it appears that more and more powers are being accumulated which affect the right of the individual.  Section 29 (b) deals with &ldquo;delivering or collecting forms, questionnaires, records of information&rdquo;.  It does not state for how long the specific records of an individual company being collected can be kept.  There are also problems for someone who, because of health, staffing or other problems may be unable to furnish statistical information on a business; those people should be safeguarded.  My overriding worry is that this is a continuing process.  I am concerned because under section 36 it will be an indictable offence to refuse or fail to provide information requested in response to a direction from the Director General and under section 44 a person on conviction on indictment shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £20,000.  I would like to alert the Minister of State in his capacity as Chief Whip that his is a worrying trend.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with Senator Enright.  I do not think powers are strong.  I know of cases where people gathering statistics have been refused entry to a house.  Is Senator Engright proposing that the person collecting the statistics should go away and forget all about it?  There has to be a penalty for not allowing people onto premises to collect legitimate statistics.  You cannot have it both ways.  A person collecting statistics has to get the information and if they are refused entry what are they supposed to <Col N="1814" /> do?  Are we not to impose a penalty?  Are we to forget that person and not try to get the necessary statistics?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Fitzgerald is aware that if somebody fails to return a census form they can be summonsed and prosecuted.  That is a separate offence.  Up to now, the census official has not had the right to enter a house to collect the form.  Senator Kelleher mentioned the &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; syndrome. Remember that once those powers go on the Statute Book they are there permanently. That is why I am concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>We are probably losing sight of the good side of this legislation. We have had debates on EC Structrual Funds and the National Development Plan but we have to look at the bigger picture.  If we are going to plan properly in accordance with demographic changes we must be in a position to gather that information.  We are heading into an area this legislation is not intended to address &mdash; the heavy handed approach, what we are talking about is empowering officers to do a job.  If we were discussing a specific function to be carried out by a member of the Garda Síochána, would we be debating a person's right to refuse?  There have been-ludicrous and unacceptable situations where people evade officers who are issuing a summons.  While I understand the Senator's concern I do not believe a threat arises.</P>
      <P>There is much concern about white collar crime and so on, but attempts to address such problems tend to be heavy-handed. If it transpires that the Senator's fears are well founded there is the possibility of amending the relevant legislation. However, that is not the intention of the measure.  Its purpose is to create a proper balance which will allow for planning based on accurate data such as population trends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This aspect is of interest to me in that the satellite town where I live must have a population of at least 100,000 to qualify for additional grants and infrastructure such as a town centre and regional college. <Col N="1815" /> It is vital, therefore, to ensure that statistics are accurately maintained to allow for planning and development in an area such as mine.  I do not feel threatened by this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered both sides of the debate, perhaps it will be possible to facilitate Members.  There is concern that officers will be able to work efficiently and there is also concern among all Members, including Senator McGennis, in regard to forcible entry and perceived invasion of privacy.  In view of this I propose that the wording of section 37 be amended to read: &ldquo;Any person who prevents an officer of statistics from carrying out his or her duties as allowed under section 29 of this Act shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo;.  This avoids problems with invasion of privacy and so on while ensuring that the officer of statistics will be able to undertake prescribed duties.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh agus a Sheanadóirí, is chúis áthas dom teacht anseo i bhur measc chun freastail ar an run tábhachtach seo.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the House has found time to discuss the ninth annual report of the Ombudsman covering his work for the year 1992.  It is entirely appropriate that this House should examine and discuss this report, which gives us a citizen's view of what our public services are like.</P>
      <P>In this sense, I see the report as being an aid to us as politicians in discharging our role as professional public representatives. Page after page, it details in a clear and concise manner the difficulties which the ordinary citizen encounters in his or her dealings with the institutions of State.  The report of the Ombudsman, should be on the recommended reading list for all politicians and the general public.</P>
      <P>This latest Ombudsman's report gives rise to a number of issues which, I feel, deserve to be highlighted.  I was surprised to note the Ombudsman's comment that many public representatives appear to be hesitant about bringing their constituents' complaints to his office.  He points out that in the case of those politicians who have availed of the services of the Ombudsman the process has worked to everybody's advantage.  The fact that it appears to be the same relatively small number of Deputies, Senators and local councillors, who continually send in complaints should give pause for thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ombudsman's office has the potential to be a valuable asset to all of us in our work.  We should accept his implicit invitation and avail more often of <Col N="1818" /> his services.  Certainly, the Ombudsman and his staff are doing their utmost to make elected public representatives as well as the general public aware of the services which his Office can provide. The Office has produced information leaflets and posters outlining the services available.  Staff are regularly involved in local ratio programmes, explaining the work of the Office, how complaints may be made and how they are handled.</P>
    <P>Important initiatives have been taken between the Ombudsman's offices, the National Social Services Board and the Citizen's Information Centres, which are leading to a greater awareness by people of their entitlements.  Allied to this new trans-institutional co-operation, the Ombudsman has continued and consolidated his programme of regional visits, where temporary offices, were established.  During 1992 staff of the office visited nine regional centres and over 500 called to these offices, to discuss their problems.  Before each regional visit, the information leaflets and posters which I mentioned are distributed throughout all public offices and voluntary bodies in the general area.  These regional visits have been a feature of the Ombudsman's work for some year's past. The value of such visits is exemplified by the statistics given in this report which indicate that visits by staff of the office, invariably give rise to increases in the number of cases, submitted for consideration in the area visited.</P>
    <P>The regional visits concept assumed a new and most welcome dimension in 1992 when a new service was launched in Cork which involves staff of the office being in attendance on the first Wednesday of every month, at the Citizen's Information Centre in Camden Place.  Over 200 availed of this new service during its first year of operation.  The report mentions that arrangements had been made to extend this type of regular service, through the Citizen's Information Centre, in O'Connell Street in Limerick.  I am pleased to say that this facility has been in place in <Col N="1819" /> Limerick since the end of April last and plans are being made to operate a similar service in the north-west from next autumn onwards.  These initiatives demonstrate a flexibility and adaptability on the part of the office, which could provide a useful inspiration for other public services.</P>
    <P>Members may be somewhat alarmed at that fact that the number of complaints, although not increasing, has maintained itself at a steady level of around 3,000 per annum since 1988.  It might be felt that the ongoing activities of the office, should have resulted in a reduction in the level of dissatisfaction among the public in respect of ways in which public services are administered.  To view the statistics in this light would, I feel, be to misread the situation.  I hope I am not being to optimistic in interpreting the combination of a levelling off of the overall number of complaints with the more widespread awareness of the Ombudsman's existence and role, as an indication that there may be a decrease in the level of dissatisfaction felt by members of the public, about the administration of services.</P>
    <P>Turning to the details of the work carried out by the Ombudsman during the course of the year, it seems to me that the effects of the Ombudsman, can be observed at two quite distinct levels.  In the first instance there are the results of his work where he has played a role in recommending reforms in work practices and procedures, which have given rise to the long term alleviation of difficulties, encountered by the public.  The second, and perhaps more typical effect of his activities has been the sorting out of problems on a once-off basis.  In many instances, this latter type of case does not have the potential for long term solution which would benefit future users.  Such cases may arise from genuine mistakes, misunderstandings or anomalies, which cannot be resolved without doing an injustice to some other genuine interest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1820" /> In the category of reforms of systems and procedures, one of the most gratifying features of the report, is the fact that the number of complaints against Telecom Éireann, has continued to drop significantly.  In 1992 the number of complaints received was 486 and when one recalls that in 1987 the number was as high as 2,022, one gets some sense of the degree to which customer awareness within Telecom Éireann has been enhanced in recent years.  This change has been effected through improved procedures on the part of Telecom Éireann and from the introduction of itemised billing.  It would be churlish to suggest that much of this improvement was not initiated by Telecom Éireann's management and staff but I feel confident in saying that the work of the Ombudsman has also played no small role in this most welcome development.</P>
    <P>Turning to what is perhaps a less widespread difficulty, attention is also drawn in the report to the fact that Telecom Éireann has agreed to change its procedures so the guarantors will be alerted to difficulties which have arisen with the customer whom they have guaranteed. This change arose from a case referred to the Ombudsman where a woman received a single threatening letter from Telecom Éireann stating that money was owing on her friend's account and that her line would be disconnected if payment was not received.  Following representations from the Office of the Ombudsman, Telecom Éireann has changed its practice and now advise the guarantor when the relevant account is overdue and of the fact that should this situation continue, it will call on the guarantor for payment.</P>
    <P>A number of other instances where the Ombudsman's intervention has given rise to improvements in procedures and practices are worth mentioning.  A local authority had required disabled people who were applying for housing transfers, where their existing accommodation included an extension designed for the <Col N="1821" /> disabled person, to sign a particular form of undertaking which, in essence, would have precluded them from seeking another disabled person's extension following the transfer.  The Ombudsman considered that this policy could exclude applications for genuinely needed transfers and he approached the local authority in question, and asked it to review its position.  The local authority, although reserving its right to have regard to cost factors, gave an undertaking that in future all such transfer applications would be processed in the normal way.</P>
    <P>Another case involving a local authority arose where a firm of architects complained that an authority had not responded to its request for information on the procedures for applying for a refund of planning fees.  As a result its application for a refund fell outside the statutory period laid down and the refund was refused.  The upshot of the Ombudsman's intervention was that he obtained a refund for the firm of architects. More significantly however, the local authority in question has decided to include a note on planning application forms advising applicants of the circumstances in which a refund of fees may be due, together with the procedures and time limits for applying for refunds.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare awarded a woman the minimum rate of maternity benefit, even though her earnings on which the rate was based was high enough to entitle her to the maximum rate.  The difficulty arose because the woman had been working in the public sector and paying the modified rate of PRSI which does not provide cover for maternity benefit.  She subsequently took up employment in the private sector. However, her reckonable earnings happened to be those in the last year of her employment in the public sector.  Following intervention by the Ombudsman, the Department of Social Welfare reviewed the position and concluded that such earnings are reckonable for the purposes of the maternity benefit scheme. <Col N="1822" /> The woman in question received the higher payment, together with arrears, and the Department of Social Welfare decided that it would identify similar cases which had arisen in the past and revise its decisions in the same manner as it did in this instance.</P>
    <P>A general reform of practice was also achieved in the case of a particular health board.  A case arose where the parents of a child believed she would receive orthodontic treatment, but such treatment was disallowed because the child had not achieved a sufficiently high severity rating for her problem.  The fundamental problem was that the health board's monitoring of the child's dental condition had not been satisfactorily communicated to the parents.  In the final analysis, the health board accepted the view of the Ombudsman that it should be clearly conveyed to parents that referral and ongoing review did not carry an assurance of treatment.  As a result, the board introduced a system of notification to parents whose children are referred for orthodontic assessment.</P>
    <P>Another case which caught our attention and where the Ombudsman's intervention effected significant long term change arose in relation to procedures for foster care.  Here children who had been under the supervision of foster parents for a long time were removed from their charge without advance notification. This occurrence clearly gave rise to considerable distress to all concerned.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the investigation of this case has been that the Department of Health has written to the health boards, advising them that written agreements are required in order to remove a child from foster parents or alternatively that the approval of the Minister for Health is required.  The Child Care Act, 1991 includes safeguards for foster parents when health boards wish to remove foster children without their consent.  Furthermore, the relevant health board is preparing written procedures in this area. It is especially pleasing to note that the <Col N="1823" /> Ombudsman considered it worth while to put on record the high level of cooperation he received from the health board in question.</P>
    <P>As I have said, many other cases handled by the Office of the Ombudsman may not give rise to long term solutions. Nevertheless for the people concerned and their families, the successful intervention of the Ombudsman on their behalf was clearly of major personal significance. Some of these cases deserve to be mentioned for a variety of reasons including, in some instances, the significant results which the Office of the Ombudsman was able to effect, and others because they highlight in a particularly graphic manner the type of problems which the citizen may encounter in his or her dealings with public administration.</P>
    <P>We would all, I am sure, share a deep sympathy for the difficulties experienced by any family which has a handicapped child.  One such case involved the parents of a three year old child who complained that they had not been informed that a Domiciliary care allowance existed for parents of children between the ages of two and 16 years and that when they learned of its existence the health board refused to make the payment restrospective to the child's second birthday. The report concluded that health boards have a duty where they are professionally involved in the management of handicapped children to impart information about specific allowances for the handicapped to the parents of such children. In the case in question, the board agreed that the allowance would be paid retrospectively to the child's second birthday.</P>
    <P>Another case which particularly interested us involved a tenant of pensionable age who applied to his local authority to purchase the family home under the 1988 tenant purchase scheme. The authority refused his application on the grounds that it was not satisfied that the complainant could afford to meet the <Col N="1824" /> payments involved.  The gentleman in question was prepared to get his son, who was living in England, to guarantee the payments.  The Ombudsman concluded that the local authority's decision was arbitrary and taken without proper authority and that it contravened the terms of the 1988 tenant purchase scheme.  The authority finally agreed to reconsider the complainant's application in the context of the Ombudsman's findings.</P>
    <P>The report goes into considerable detail about a case where a gentleman claimed that a local authority had failed to respond to his requests for information about their development plan which would have involved the demolition of his house for road improvement purposes. He also claimed that the local authority had failed to act in relation to an unauthorised and hazardous development which was taking place next door. He wished to avail of Government grants to improve his house.  However, while he was seeking information over a number of years about the objective of the local authority's plan and while he was in correspondence about the development taking place next door, the house improvement grant scheme was terminated with the result that he was no longer in a position to carry out the intended improvements.</P>
    <P>This transpired to be &ldquo;a most difficult and complex case&rdquo; in the words of the report.  The Ombudsman issued detailed findings which demonstrate meticulous research, as well as a fair-minded approach to all concerned.  In certain instances, the complainant's arguments were not considered to be sustainable and in others the local authority were found to have fallen short in their actions. Not all of the findings were accepted by the local authority but, as a gesture of goodwill, the authority agreed to make an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment of £3,000 to the complainant without any admission of liability or fault.  The Ombudsman regarded this as a reasonable offer.</P>
    <P>Neither the existence of the Ombudsman, <Col N="1825" /> nor the contents of his report should be taken as reflecting in an unduly negative way on the public service.  The areas of public service covered by the Ombudsman are many and varied, including the entire Civil Service, local authority and health board areas, together with An Post and Telecom Éireann.  Numerous schemes and programmes are covered and literally tens of thousands of staff are engaged in the administration of these services.  Inevitably, in such a broad canvass problems will arise.  Sometimes these difficulties occur because of simple human error.  We were particularly pleased to see that on a number of occasions when such error or delay occurred the public body in question was prepared to admit its mistake and to apologise.  For example, the old Department of Energy apologised for the delay in processing certain grant applications and admitted that the delay in processing one such application was due to an error on their own part, while the delay in the other case resulted from the time taken to establish technical guidelines arising from a new woodland grant scheme.  Both applications were processed without further delay.</P>
    <P>A lady who had moved from Britain received a letter from the Revenue Commissioners informing her that she was not required to submit a return of income for the 1990-91 tax year, unless otherwise notified by the inspector of taxes.  She later received a notice from the tax office advising her of a tax liability for that year, plus a surcharge.  Following an approach from the Ombudsman, the Revenue Commissioners said that the original letter had issued in error.  The commissioners expressed their regret for any inconvenience caused to the lady in question.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare also showed itself willing to admit its mistakes when it reviewed the case of a woman who complained that a child benefit payment from the UK was being assessed against her for the purposes of computing <Col N="1826" /> her lone parent (widows) allowance.  She also complained that she had not received any allowance in respect of her eldest son, who was over 18 years of age, but still attending full-time education.  Following their review, the Department of Social Welfare admitted that an error had been made and that the child benefit should not have been assessed.  They revised the rate of lone parent allowance retrospectively and her new weekly rate of payment included an increase in respect of her eldest son.</P>
    <P>Reading this report, and indeed having read previous reports of the Ombudsman, I am struck by the fact that the difficulties faced by the citizen in his or her dealings with public administration are often paradoxically the result of the diligent and vigilant application on the part of individual public servants of the rules and regulation applying to various schemes.  It must be acknowledged that such public servants are often doing their best to carry out their duties within the constraints of prevailing policy.  I have no doubt that they too are often touched by the very real problems encountered by their clients and very often would like to be able to do more to alleviate their difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman is not a blind supporter of all complaints received.  It is evident that his Office undertakes the most rigorous examination of all cases submitted and are prepared to reject those which they do not consider to have merit.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, of the 2,642 complaints finalised in 1992, 1,014 &mdash; or over 38 per cent &mdash; were not upheld.  In the course of the report, a number of examples of cases where the Ombudsman found in favour of the public body are given.  In one instance, a company complained that they had received a demand for additional excise duty resulting from alterations to a van.  Having examined the details of the alterations, the Ombudsman considered that the <Col N="1827" /> Revenue Commissioners had acted correctly.</P>
    <P>Equally in the case of Telecom, the Ombudsman found in their favour in a number of cases.  One concerned a complaint against reverse call charges.  There were several more about malfunctions in alarm systems which were connected to a central monitoring station and which the complainants claimed resulted in unduly high telephone bills.</P>
    <P>This sensible-minded and balanced approach is a fundamental element in the ongoing success of the Ombudsman's Office.  It is only because the Office is seen by both administrators and the public alike to act in an entirely impartial manner that the confidence and support of all sides is ensured for the continued successful operation of the Ombudsman's Office.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government, 1993-97,</i> our Government has committed itself to:</P>
    <P>restore confidence in the democratic process, by encouraging greater openness and participation at all levels, by improving public accountability, transparency and trust and by ensuring the highest standards in public life.</P>
    <P>We see the work being done by the Office of the Ombudsman over the past number of years as playing an important role in the creation of the more open and responsive public service which our Government wants and the country needs.  The Ombudsman, for all the efficiency and goodwill demonstrated in his report, can only do so much.</P>
    <P>The creation of the type of public service outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government, will only be achieved when several reforms are put in place.  Reforms are already underway or are under active consideration in a variety of areas which, taken together, will have the effect of giving the public the quality of public service to which they are entitled &mdash; local government reform <Col N="1828" /> ethics in Government, freedom of information, Oireachtas reform including the conferring of privilege on witnesses appearing before Oireachtas committees, together with an attendant obligation on witnesses to give evidence and furnish documents.</P>
    <P>No matter what reforms are introduced, in an entity as large as the public service which employs such a large number of people and provides such a wide range of services, occasions will inevitably arise when the citizen considers that he or she has not been fairly dealt with.  The Ombudsman will, therefore, always have vital and ongoing work to perform.  This Government is committed to supporting that work in every practical way possible.</P>
    <P>This report deserves the widest possible publicity.  The effectiveness of the Ombudsman is dependent, to a large extent on the public being fully aware first, of his existence, secondly of his role and functions and finally of the considerable influence which he and his staff can wield on behalf of the citizen.  May I, on your behalf and behalf of the Government and the public at large, sincerely thank the Ombudsman and his excellent staff for their openness, fairness and professionalism in discharging their many duties on behalf of the people of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  All Members would be at one in praising the Ombudsman and his staff for this, the ninth report.  If there has been a success story in recent years, it has been the Office of the Ombudsman. I have found the Ombudsman and his staff helpful and only too willing to assist. The fact that many public representatives have difficulties dealing with unsolved queries from constituents is one good reason for establishing this office.  As the Minister rightly said, given the vast number of cases being processed in State bodies, genuine mistakes will be made and the citizen must have the right to have these matters investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1829" /> I welcome the regional visits mentioned in the report.  Members are aware of the Office of the Ombudsman but most people may not know of it until they have a problem.  Those who have queries will first try to solve them themselves, and if that does not work, a certain resentment may build up between the individual and the State body in question &mdash; Telecom Éireann, An Post, a local authority, a health board or a Department &mdash; because maybe the former thinks no adequate response will be forthcoming.  It is important that these regional visits continue &mdash; there were nine last year &mdash; and many hundreds of people visited them and heard about the availability of the Office.  The work they have done liaising with citizens' information centres has been beneficial.  I know from centres in my constituency that great work was done and many people can have their problems solved at little or no expense. The Ombudsman can cut through red tape when he wants access to files and documents.  In many cases it is easy to establish whether there is a case to be investigated.  Decisions may vary from one case to another and I will not dwell on individual cases.  However, if there is a case to answer, the Ombudsman can approach the relevant body and get the necessary files.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that 38 per cent of complaints to the Ombudsman were not deemed worthy of investigation, but 62 per cent of complaints were investigated. It is important that the Ombudsman can get to the nub of a problem.  He must have access to information in order to decide whether a case warrants further investigation.  The Ombudsman may resolve cases which have been going on for a long time.</P>
    <P>Public servants should read this report because it may assist them in their work. We are all familiar with civil servants who are very helpful but others may have an attitude problem when it comes to dealing with public representatives and the public who make inquiries.  Where <Col N="1830" /> there is a repetition of certain incidents we must learn from them.  We must insure that when cases are being processed, mistakes are not to be repeated.  Local authorities, the Civil Service, health boards and Telecom Éireann must learn from their mistakes.  They must implement suggestions made by the Ombudsman in relation to work practices and procedures. There is no point sorting out one individual's problem but continuing unchanged existing practices and procedures for the rest of the public.</P>
    <P>This ninth report is welcome.  It is encouraging that the number of complaints relating to Telecom Éireann has dropped considerably.  However, when certain individuals get their telephone bill later this year, there will be probably be an increase in the number of complaints to the Ombudsman's Office when the new charges are introduced.  It has been said that only one in 25 calls will be charged at a higher rate.  I would like Telecom Éireann to inform me before I make my 25th call so that I can avoid making that call.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging that the number of complaints relating to Telecom Éireann has declined.  Complaints about reverse charge calls, queries about metered accounts etc., make interesting reading and, to be fair, Telecom Éireann admitted their error when the Ombudsman found in favour of the complainant. Everybody makes mistakes from time to time.  It is important that bodies and authorities admit error so that mistakes may be rectified.  It is crucial that we learn from mistakes and that they are not repeated.</P>
    <P>Members of both Houses and councillors who make representations must take on board what the Ombudsman said. The Office of the Ombudsman is another avenue open to the public and their representatives to have their problems solved and a considerable amount of time may be saved if one contacts the Office of the Ombudsman immediately.  Cases can often be difficult to resolve if those <Col N="1831" /> concerned become entrenched in a position or if, for example, angry telephone calls have been made, and people may feel there is no solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome this report.  It is hoped that local authorities and Government Departments will implement recommendations made by the Ombudsman in relation to work practices and procedures. I do not wish to criticise the Civil Service or local authorities, but difficulties do arise, sometimes it is caused by human error or lack of communication and the fault may be on both sides.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Ombudsman and his helpful staff.  While we do not wish to see them over-worked, we hope expeditious decisions are made in cases which are investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>More than most Members, I have a vested interest in the Office of the Ombudsman.  I thank and compliment the Minister of State, Deputy N. Treacy, on his contribution.  I note and welcome the presence of senior personnel from the Office of the Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>My interest in the Office of the Ombudsman encouraged me to come into politics, and I am not sure whether I should be a fan of the Office.  In 1978 I was the only Irish member of the International Ombudsman Institution.  The idea of an institution to interpose between the powerless citizen and the powerful State is an old and potent idea.</P>
      <P>Some 2,000 years ago in Rome, Juvenal posed the question: who should guard the guardians?  There were Ombudsmen in the Chinese dynasties.  In the Han dynasty, for example, ombudsmen became so powerful that there was one ombudsman for every bureaucrat, bureaucracy ground to a halt and the Han dynasty came to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The modern ombudsman institution comes out of a time of strife too.  The history of this institution is interesting. The idea of Ombudsman came to Charles <Col N="1832" /> 1 of Sweden when he was at war with Peter the Great of Russia.  During one of those wars he had to flee to Constantinople and he became aware in Constantinople that there was an office there called the Caliph.  Because law, public morality and religion were interlinked in that city, it was regarded as sinful for public administrators to misbehave.  The Caliph, among other things, had the responsibility of examining how public administrators fulfilled their responsibilities. King Charles of Sweden was aware that back home the grand dukes, who were looking after issues in his absence, were misbehaving on a grand scale.  He, therefore establised an office, which became known, first as chancellor, then as ombudsman, to look after his affairs but, ultimately, to look after the affairs of the people.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, the other protagonist in those wars, the Russian Tsar, Peter, being so engaged in wars and hostilities against the Swedes, became aware also that the dukes and the noblemen back home in St. Petersburg were also misbehaving and were not looking after the Tsar's interests or the interests of the citizens.  He appointed an officer, the Procuratora, known to this day as the eye of the Tsar, to look over the shoulder of every administrator to make sure they operated with prudence and justice and in the wider public interest.  It is interesting also that after the revolution in Russia, Lenin put forward the idea that there was only one legacy from the old days that was worth retaining and that was the Procuratora.  It is interesting, too, that in recent years the Procuratora has been a vigorous exponent of the interests of the individual citizen in the Soviet Union and now in the Commonwealth of Independent States.</P>
    <P>The idea of an Ombudsman in our type of administrative setting goes back to the 1960s.  We in Ireland were among the first in the common law world to propose the idea of an Ombudsman and this very year marks the 30th anniversary of the first <Col N="1833" /> debate on the creation of an Irish Ombudsman.  It is appropriate that this House should consider the Office as it enters into its tenth year of service to Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>The report we have before us is very important and it is essential that we look at it critically.  There is no point in always praising institutions.  When the institution of Ombudsman was first mooted it caused a great deal of fear and trepidation among administrators and politicians. I wrote some very critical analyses of the original Ombudsman Act and I am very pleased and flattered that it is on the record of both this House and the other House that contributors in that debate drew on the material I published at that time to criticise the very timid steps we were taking to create a fully developed institution of Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The New Zealanders dealt fully with this matter in 1961 and created an Office of Ombudsman which is the model for our Office.  I could see back in the late 1970s and early 1980s no reason why we should be timid; after all the New Zealanders had ten or 15 years experience of the position.  It spread very dramatically in the early 1960 and 1970s, first through the Canadian provinces, then in certain of the United States and it became a constitutional element in virtually every one of the British Commonwealth countries as they moved to independence. Ombudsmen in a variety of colourful guises grew up in that 25 to 30 year period.  Some of them became friends of mine.  One of them, a Jesuit priest, Fr. Ignatius Killage, was appointed Ombudsman in Papua New Guinea.  He also became the Ethics Commissioner, to ensure that politicians and administrators behaved ethically.  He ran foul of them at one stage, I will come back to that.</P>
    <P>The point I was making is that as well as saying good things about the Ombudsman, and there are many good things that could and should be said, we should look continuously to expand the Office.  We took a very timid step in this direction <Col N="1834" /> initially.  We excluded a whole series of public institutions including local authorities, health boards and State-sponsored bodies.  Those exclusions rapidly and in a very welcome way were removed.  However, we still have some exclusions that merit attention.</P>
    <P>The report is a model.  It is excellent because it produces case studies in public administration, a very important feature for any of us interested in public administration. In the past 50 years public administration has grown to an extent where public service, which was established to serve the public, can crush the public.  By simply observing the letter of the law, public administrators can do great damage to the very citizens they are meant to serve.  There is no market for public administration so we do not have any feedback.  We are not like shop owners or producers of goods who, if they stock or produce the wrong goods, are informed by the market and can quickly take corrective action.  The market is missing from public administration. The citizen has to put up with what he or she gets and frequently misunderstandings about precisely what one is entitled become the basis of complaint. There have been some improvements in recent years but a huge amount still needs to be done.  That is why the Ombudsman's report in its current form is so important.  As previous speakers have said, it should be compulsory reading for every public servant and every public representative because it is the only textbook we have at the end of a period which gives us a view into public administration.</P>
    <P>In a judgment some years ago in Alberta dealing with the prerogatives and powers of the Ombudsman, there was a beautiful phrase by a judge who said that the Ombudsman institution was most important in democracy because it could lift and carry the light of public scrutiny into the otherwise dark places of public administration.  He suggested that if it highlighted what was good then good was <Col N="1835" /> done but if it highlighted what was bad than corrective action could be taken. That is the light in which we should see the institution of Ombudsman and that is why I believe we should be continuously interested in how we press forward and develop this institution and how we use it to look into public administration and to highlight where our public service goes wrong.</P>
    <P>I am a little disappointed in the level of cases being referred to the Ombudsman. I note, for example, that within the jurisdiction there were 2,637 cases in 1992, 2,603 in 1991 and 2,727 in 1990. If my memory serves me correctly, the number of cases is decreasing compared to the early days of the Obudsman. However, that does not necessarily mean that people are more satisfied now with public administration than they were.  It could mean a variety of things.  One of the things, I fear, it means is the people are not conscious of the valuable role the Ombudsman can and must play in interfacing between citizen and administration. These are relatively low numbers and must be put in context.</P>
    <P>Nothwithstanding the fact that we have an Ombudsman and that we have more public representatives now than we had ten years ago, in a survey I did of TDs in 1981 I was able to point out that TDs at that stage were receiving on average 104 representations of one form or another per week.  Some of them were simple requests for information and some of them were complaints.  From my own experience and that of colleagues in both Houses I am aware that this figure has increased.  The volume of complaints against public administration has grown very dramatically over the past ten years and yet there has been a relatively static number of complaints coming into the Ombudsman's Office.  This should give us cause for concern and we should deal with it.</P>
    <P>The level of complaints received by the Ombudsman in the year compares <Col N="1836" /> relatively badly with the number of complaints being handled by active TDs, particularly in four or five seat constituencies. A number of factors may contribute to this, First, although the Ombudsman is still undertaking regional visits and undertook nine such visits in the period in question, this activity of the Ombudsman, which was very adventurous when it was initiated by Mr. Mills, needs to be expanded.  I realise this would put pressure on the resources of the Ombudsman but if that is the case we should provide the Ombudsman with a proper budget and with sufficient staff.</P>
    <P>Although the Ombudsman has produced excellent leaflets there is now less publicity about his Office because he does not have sufficient funds to publicise it. The Ombudsman in Dominica in Costa Rica has made a special appeal to children. Comics have been distributed outlining the role of the Ombudsman to make them aware the less fortunate have a champion.  We need to do something similar.  The Ombudsman needs a budget to communicate to citizens about the existence of his Office and what it can do.  There should be more publicity and more visits.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Ombudsman is an institution of this House, established on the most significant legislative basis.  It is perverse that it be treated like a Government Department when looking for its budget; it is also perverse that both Houses of the Oireachtas are treated likewise for their budgets.  In other countries the speakers of the Houses of Parliament, together with other senior oficials, form a budget committee.  This sets the budget for the Houses of Parliament and institutions closely linked with them, such as the Ombudsman.  That should be the case in Ireland also.</P>
    <P>The Office of Ombudsman is an institution to oversee administration and it is wrong that it appears to be beholden to Government.  The Ombudsman is established on a constitutional basis.  For example, the office holder can be <Col N="1837" /> removed only after a strict impeachment process.  He is appointed in the same way as a High Court judge.  If this high and highly-respected official is appointed, why can he not have access to funding? We can trust our Ombudsman.  The current incumbent has proved himself and I am sure his successors will prove to be more than cautious in this regard.</P>
    <P>Two other areas still provide grounds for complaint.  Both are in the law relating to the Ombudsman so they concern not the office holder but the legislature. The prison service remains outside the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman.  I argued strongly against this.  If an untoward occurrence happens in any part of public administration it should be subject to scrutiny by the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Clinical judgment is also not subject to his scrutiny.  One can give an example to show why this is facile.  A person may go into hospital and have the wrong leg amputated.  A form in the administration may be filled out incorrectly.  The Ombudsman can investigate why the form was wrongly completed but cannot have any role in investigating why the wrong leg was removed.  Some bizarre cases have been reported by ombudsmen in other jurisdictions.  I draw the attention of the House to reports of the administrative commissioners in Britain. These illustrate the fallacy of excluding clinical judgment.</P>
    <P>For ten years the Ombudsman and his officers have served this country well.  We should have every faith in that Office.  It should be provided with all the staff and funding needed to fulfil its remit.  Money given to the Ombudsman is well spent. The legislation should be critically reviewed occasionally.  As we explore the area of ethics in Government we should seek to vest that role in the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I compliment Michael Mills and his staff for their service to this country and its people.  When he was elected I said in the public press it was an inspired choice. Neither he or his office has disappointed us.  The prophets of doom were proven <Col N="1838" /> wrong.  This adventure in public administration has been most worthwhile.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister.  I am sorry more people were not here to hear that wonderful historical and philosophical statement from Senator Roche. The Ombudsman may not be &ldquo;the eye of the Tsar&rdquo; or the eye of the Government but he is certainly a seeking ear, a listening eye and a helping hand for the citizen. The Office of Ombudsman has been one of the major successes of the past ten years and it is nice to be able to report a success.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the personality of the Ombudsman.  His attitude and that of his staff has made the difference between that Office being a success or a failure. Those who look for assistance feel that they are dealing with people who are receptive to their problems.  This is essential for people who have already had difficulties from other bodies.</P>
      <P>Senator Roche's point on the need for greater publicity about the Office of Ombudsman is worth emphasising.  The number of complaints about public bodies is not static.  Like other public representatives, I receive such complaints. It is appropriate the Ombudsman has made contacts outside Dublin and become more associated with the citizens' advice centres.  This has been a major step in making the public more aware of the existence of the Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>It would be desirable to see a breakdown of complainants on a sex and age basis.  I believe a large number of them are women, many of them elderly.  They have lost hope in the system and, as a last resort, have come to the Ombudsman.  It is a great pity that some may have spent a long time struggling with bureaucracy before asking the Ombudsman to take up the cudgels on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thankfully, complaints about Telecom Éireann have decreased.  They may not have decreased to the extent they have if the Ombudsman had not been so consistenly <Col N="1839" /> critical over the past ten years about how Telecom Éireann dealt with complaints.  The improvement is directly due to the efforts of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche's comments on the prison service are important.  It is extraordinarily difficult for prisoners to make their complaints known in the public domain.  I have received leters from prisoners. They have often been sent by registered post.  They ask for replies so they can be sure I have received their letters.  That is a rather depressing message to receive through the mail.</P>
    <P>Medical cases are at present refered to the Medical Council.  That body is under review at the moment.  It is a self-regulating body and, as a medical practitioner, I would not consider it unreasonable for the Ombudsman to have some impact on cases sent to the Medical Council.</P>
    <P>I have raised the matter of disabled person's maintenance allowance in the House because I am interested in the subject. Disabled people and disabled persons groups have asked me on several occasions about transferring responsibility for the allowance from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Welfare.  They feel they would be more ably dealt with there.  These people have a continuing condition. Many pages of the Ombudsman's report are spent on representative complaints about the allowance.  I quote from the report.</P>
    <P>I suggested then (in 1988) that the disabled person's maintenance scheme should be examined with a view to establishing a consistent, coherent and a fair system of assessing the applicant's entitlement because it appeared to me that the regulations governing the operation of the scheme were unsatisfactory in their lack of clarity. This gives rise to difficulties of interpretation and to inconsistency in decisions in relation to income assessment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1840" /> That was the position five years ago and exactly the same is true today.  People have great difficulty interpreting the different schemes in the various health boards.  The Minister should consider transferring responsibility for this allowance to the Department of Social Welfare, because it is a very serious matter for people who are getting the allowance. Some of the cases detailed in the report are terrible.  Some people were not advised that they were entitled to benefits under the scheme.  People were not advised about the free travel scheme which is administered by the Department of Social Welfare.  The Ombudsman has been highlighting this as a serious problem since 1988, and it is still a serious problem.  There are no financial implications, this is one of the few allowances still administered by the Department of Health.  Perhaps the Minister would consider transferring this allowance to the Department of Social Welfare as the allowances administered by that Department are now more standardised.</P>
    <P>In the report discussion of the problems and complaints relating to the administration of the disabled person's maintenance scheme goes on for pages. There is a section on &ldquo;Entitlements of the handicapped in residential care&rdquo;.  An in-patient in an institution is only entitled to the disablement benefit or invalidity pension.  They would be much better off if they got the disabled person's maintenance allowance.  A young person in residential care is entitled to only about £5 or £8 per week.</P>
    <P>I live very near the Cheshire Home in Herbert Street, and the young disabled people in that home are part of the community. In fact when I said to one of the people who was running the home that it was great to see them sitting outside the pubs having a good time, she said they sometimes have such a good time that they are thrown out of the pub.  These young people take an active part in the village atmosphere of the Baggot Street area, and £5 to £8 per week is a very small amount for a young adult.  If they <Col N="1841" /> were allowed to claim the disabled person's maintenance allowance, it would not bankrupt the State.  Very few of these people are in residential care.  Another important factor is that they would be entitled to claim a travel allowance if they were in receipt of the disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
    <P>I commend the report and I second everything Senator Roche said about increased publicity and increased funding if it is necessary, because it is the most vulnerable people in society who contact the Ombudsman's Office.  I suggest that the Minister use his influence to have the administration of the disabled person's maintenance allowance transferred from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Welfare.  It would make a great deal of sense and would be a great help to the recipients of the allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and Government Chief Whip, Deputy Dempsey, to the House.  I wish to pay Senator Roche a genuine compliment. He told us the history of the Ombudsman, which was an education in itself, and displayed his very obvious knowledge of the subject.  It was the most interesting 15 minutes I have spent here in a long time and I compliment him.</P>
      <P>In many ways, the Ombudsman provides the small person's day in court.  This is essentially about the small person in our society.  Reading the report belies the old adage that you will never beat City Hall.  Michael Mills and his staff have demonstrated that not alone can people take on City Hall but they very often beat City Hall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refuse to believe that in such a centralised State as Ireland, with over 3.5 million people living here, fewer than 4,000 people have something to complain about.  I believe there is a lack of public awareness of this Office.  Regional visits have been made, leaflets have been published and so on, but today, the most effective way to get the message across is by television.  I fail to see why money <Col N="1842" /> cannot be provided to produce a television programme, to be shown at peak times, which takes any one of the cases we have seen here and follows it through, from the time the complainant finds out about the existence of the Office, covers the various stages in the process and, hopefully, shows the resolution of the problem, vindicating the rights of the citizen. One television programme, shown at peak time, would do more to highlight the existence and benefits of this Office than all the leaflets in the world.</P>
    <P>We can truthfully say that Members of the Oireachtas are probably the worst readers of leaflets in the world, because we get so many.  There is a very low tolerance for this kind of literature and political parties are discovering this.  If a person prints 50,000 leaflets, they might be read by 5,000 people.  People are aware that the medium is the message, and the medium is radio and television.  Something should be done to alert people to the existence of this Office.</P>
    <P>The other positive thing we could do, and I hope that the Minister takes this suggestion back to his Cabinet colleagues, is to put a notice on the many departmental forms to the effect that if a difference occurs between the claimant and the Department and if it proves impossible to resolve, the Office of the Ombudsman is available to try to resolve the problem.  Why is such a notice not printed on the many documents sent to claimants?  When a citizen is trying to resolve their problems with a Department, it is recommended that they take all the normal steps to try to settle the query.  When they cannot agree, the Department could suggest that the citizen avail of this arbitration mechanism.  This service is available, put there by the Oireachtas, and yet, for the majority of the people, a State secret.</P>
    <P>We should do two things.  A television programme should be made highlighting what I have just outlined, and Departments should publicise the service offered by the Office of the Ombudsman <Col N="1843" /> on their literature and the documents they send to clients or claimants.  The value of the Office is seen by the people with whom it deals.</P>
    <P>Having read this report, I echo what Senator Roche said.  This is a model of how reports should be written.  Read this report and you will know that Michael Mills was a first-class journalist, because this has his stamp on it.  It is about people who have problems with the State and who have had them resolved.  The report is a model of its kind.  I would like to impress on the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, to urge his colleagues in Cabinet to tell the Civil Service that such a standard is required.  It tells one precisely what is happening and where there are problems.</P>
    <P>The report also fulfils another important function, namely it highlights places where legislative changes are needed, for example, with regard to the law on separated persons.  The Ombudsman points to cases he is unable to bring to a satisfactory conclusion in other areas because of lack of legislation or because of existing legislation.  Departments should review legislation in the interests of good service and citizenship.</P>
    <P>If the Ombudsman brings to the attention of a Department, local authority or health board etc., a regulation that is discriminatory and should be changed, it is not enough to address the specific case. The machinery should be put in place to take corrective action and ensure the anomaly cannot recur.  I am sure this is often done, but it should be standard procedure.  Where the Ombudsman has brought a case to the attention of an authority and it has accepted there is discrimination, the machinery should then be put in place to amend or remove the regulation or disbarment in question.</P>
    <P>We have talked about those in our society without influence or power, the poor, the disadvantaged and the uneducated &mdash; the flotsam and jetsam of society, if you like.  That cross-section is <Col N="1844" /> nowhere more evident than inside the gates of Port Laoise, Mountjoy, Cork and Limerick prisons.  The Minister for justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, was in the House last week and I informed her that, although, I applaud the work of prison officers, a case had come to my attention of a remark made by a prison officer to a prisoner about the prisoner's spouse which was designed to cause grave emotional damage to that prisoner.  I said that when the State has total control over people it should use it lightly.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the Ombudsman's writ does not run in the prisons.  It has much to do with the timid approach all political parties adopted to the Ombudsman.  We were all frightened that somebody might uncover things we should have uncovered ourselves.  The fact, however, that his writ does not run in the prisons cannot be defended.  Those incarcerated in jails &mdash; and I am not making any case against that; they have been duly tried and sentenced &mdash; are in the total control of people acting on behalf of the State.  There must always be a system of redress.</P>
    <P>I know there are visiting committees but they do not have the resources to investigate a prisoner's complaint to the same degree as the Office of the Ombudsman. They have neither the time nor the necessary professional expertise and in many cases they would not adopt the humane approach of the present Ombudsman.  On reading this report one knows that the head of the Office is a human being of great sensitivity.  His sympathy and consideration for people which was always knows to those of us who knew him as a journalist is evident in his work as Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case to be made for extending the Ombudsman's writ to include the prison service.  Of all the areas of State administration, local authorities, Departments, etc.  I believe the one area where he should have the authority to investigate complaints is within the prison service, because of the distress of <Col N="1845" /> those without a voice and without power. The prisons contain many such people and because one is incarcerated slights inflicted and injuries done by the governor or his staff &mdash; imagined or real &mdash; assume enormous proportions for those with nothing else to think about for 17 hours a day.  The Government would do society a service by extending the services of the Ombudsman to the prisons.  Everyone in jail has an innocent family outside who will have to try with the State to rehabilitate their husband, son, mother, etc.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report.  I compliment Mr. Michael Mills and his staff in the Office of the Ombudsman on their work and wish them well.  If I could convince the Minister of State and the Government to provide the money to allow RTE and the Ombudsman to make a film about the Office, I would be very happy. It would be welcomed throughout the country and in time it would be one of the most important little films we ever made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this report. The work of the Office of the Ombudsman is related to that of politicians who often receive complaints from the public. It is vital for confidence in any demoracy that people have a place such as the Office of the Ombudsman to bring their complaints and receive a hearing.</P>
      <P>It is significant that over half of the complaints investigated upheld the original decisions taken by the authorities in question.  That said, the figures highlight the fact that in many cases members of the public are not satisfied; they believe they were wronged or that the relevant authority did not supply them with sufficient information.  We are lucky to have had a man of Mr. Michael Mills' calibre as the pioneer of the Office; as a result, everybody has a great regard for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in the section of the report dealing with health boards and orthodontic treatment.  As a public representative, I have personal experience <Col N="1846" /> of dealing with parents whose children are on a long waiting list for such treatment. It is interesting to see that the Office of the Ombudsman recommended to the health boards that a report should be furnished to such parents on the precise condition of their children.  That has eased the problem for parents who were awaiting treatment for their child and previously would have found out perhaps two years later that treatment was not suitable for their child in the first instances.  That highlights an area where the Office not only solved a problem but could make a recommendation to the health boards which the health board worked on and which is of benefit to everybody.</P>
    <P>An interesting part of the report deals with the fact that the Ombudsman has travelled to various areas and centres. This has to be welcomed.  It is something the Minister should encourage and for which he should provide funding because the image at present is that Departments and public bodies are removed from the ordinary people and do not understand the needs of a particular area or person.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Ombudsman and endorse the work he has done.  It is interesting to note that many of the complaints were not upheld and that has done the Depatments or local authorities a service when they were exonerated.  In many cases, individuals lack knowledge. People form the idea from hearsay that a certain situation exists, and they believe they were wronged.  People have a habit of telling others they are entitled to something when they are not and this has often led to believing they have been wronged. This is another area where the Ombudsman and his staff have helped the general public and the administration of services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and I welcome this report.  I did not intend to speak this afternoon but this report is one of the most interesting I have read since coming to the Seanad.  It is in layman's language.  I did not have <Col N="1847" /> any knowledge of the duties and role of the Ombudsman and the services performed by his office in the broader scheme of the public service and I welcome the report from that point of view.</P>
      <P>As a politican, I always felt a little apprehensive about the Ombudsman.  I thought he may have been a knocker of our public services, a watchful eye for everything they did and that he was more interested in promoting the negative aspects of our Departments then in promoting the citizen.  I am glad to say that his staff are to be congratulated for the manner in which they perform their duties.</P>
      <P>I was going to mention the point Senator Magner raised about the distribution of leaflets.  Leaflets distributed through the local authorities or Departments, such as the Department of Health, the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Education, can get lost.  One programme on RTE at peak time would do more to tell the public about the role and activities of the Ombudsman than all the leaflets printed.</P>
      <P>The fact that we have made an effort and started to regionalise the Ombudsman's Office and to make it more user friendly by opening offices in various parts of the country is to be welcomed. This is also to be welcomed from the point of view of the politician.  The examples highlighted in the report are set out in detail in terms of how they are processed, and even though a politician would attempt to do what he or she can do to solve a problem for a person, this can be time consuming.  The Ombudsman is to be congratulated for detailing how one should process problems, how one should be aware of the pitfalls in our bureaucratic system and how these pitfalls need to be carefully scrutinised when a problem arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer particularly to telephone bills.  Every day people come to me about their telephone bills and say they have been over-charged.  They <Col N="1848" /> believed the only solution was to go directly to the department where they would get the bureaucratic answer that the bill had been examined, all calls recorded and the amount was correct.  I welcome the fact that in these cases the Ombudsman can take over.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman plays a strong role in relation to local authorities.  I was not aware of the role of the Ombudsman in relation to the development plan.  There is an example in the report of the demolition of a house where the local authority had not given notice to the resident. There is a big role for us and for the Office of Public Works to make sure that the role and duties of the Ombudsman are widely publicised.  The Ombudsman could give a presentation to the local authorities which would help us in our role as public officers.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman is also interested in the reform of work practices and procedures. By highlighting the problem he is suggesting new ways in which the work of local authorities and Departments can be done.  We are getting so tied down by rules and regulations that we dare not deviate from them.  It appears that rules come first and people second.  I believe people must come first.  Rules are there to help us; they should not dictate what we must do.  Being a pragmastist, I allocate and assess time and judge each case on the information I receive.  I do not follow rules absolutely because if we go down that road we will become less sensitive. I entered public office because I would like to see a more caring society. We need to be more caring and I welcome the role of the Ombudsman in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is a pity an Ombudsman is necessary. I would hate to think he is there to keep a watchful eye on our Departments and that the Departments need an Ombudsman to monitor what is happening. Maybe a time will come when his position will be redundant because the point that have been highlighted today will definitely be taken on board by the various <Col N="1849" /> Departments.  The role of the Ombudsman should get wider publicity and all the speakers put great emphasis on that, particularly in relation to public representatives. I think we should make ourselves available to talk and work with the Ombudsman rather than working in isolation.  It seems to me that our paths never cross, which is a pity.</P>
    <P>It is good to see that we are restoring confidence in our Departments; a sense of openness, accountability and trust is developing.  I hope the Ombudsman would not be seen as dictating to the Departments how to conduct their business or solve problems.  We should work together rather than dealing with each person separately.  I would like to compliment Michael Mills and his staff on their work.  I welcome this report.  I have become more knowledgeable on the subject. Perhaps the Minister of State would take note of the points that have been highlighted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other Members in congratulating the Office of the Ombudsman on its excellent work since it was established.  I congratulate the Ombudsman on this report and I hope in so doing it does not sound as if I am being critical of other reports.  The report is easy to read and is very interesting. We get huge volumes of post and long reports which are probably important, but they are not as easily read as this report; I suppose the human element makes it interesting.</P>
      <P>In the Minister of State's statement to the House he said that in the Programme for a Partnership Government this Government has committed itself to:</P>
      <P>Restore confidence in the democratic process, by encouraging greater openness and participation at all levels, by improving public accountability, transparency and trust, and by ensuring the highest standards in public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to attain that lofty aspiration, as Senator Ormonde said, the Ombudsman <Col N="1850" /> might become redundant.  I do not wish him to become redundant but I think this Government is gearing itself towards an open and accessible public service. The reason for the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman was a perceived reluctance on the part of public servants to admit they had made a mistake. I know the Minister of State in his speech to the House and the report pay tribute to the various Departments of the public service who have been dealing with the cases.</P>
    <P>There has been a noticeable change in the way which public servants treat members of the public, and I say that not in a critical manner because I was a member of the public service from 1970 to 1975.  In those days serving the customer was not seen as the end product. We were told to continue with our work and the customer just got in the way. There has been a huge change and a movement towards seeing the customer as the end product and not a simple moving of paperwork.  I think the Minister of State's speech highlighted the fact that this change will continue.  Anybody dissatisfied with a decision or a result of an inquiry will feel they have a method of redress and will be received in the proper fashion by the relevant body.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to a couple of points which were raised in the report and to which the Minister of State made reference.  I am particularly interested in the statement by the Ombudsman that in the case of those politicians who have availed of the service of the Ombudsman, the process has worked to everybody's advantage.  I have been involved in public life for the past eight years and there is much criticism by certain elements of people who use politicians and of politicians who run clinics.  I freely admit to being such a politician.  I have held regular clinics since I was elected in 1975 and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Those who are critical of this approach to public life view it as parish pump politics and a system of patronage.  I have <Col N="1851" /> never seen it like that and my involvement with constituents is a most rewarding and fulfilling exercise.  One is not suggesting to people that one can deliver what they are not entitled to and I do not think that anybody is stupid enough to believe that the local politician can get them that to which they are not entitled. Those days are long gone.</P>
    <P>Members of the public who come to politicians or the Office of the Ombudsman are convinced that their case is valid and has merit and that they are not getting a fair hearing.  I would like to put it on the record of this House, and I hope it will filter through, that those people who avail of the service of politicians and the Office of the Ombudsman do so because they believe they have progressed their case as far as they can but that the merit in their case is not being acknowledged by the relevant Department. I take from the report that the Ombudsman recognises the work public representatives do on behalf of the public.  I do not view us as being in competition; I think the two are complementary and, while I have not yet availed of the services of the Office of the Ombudsman, if I exhaust all the options, I probably will in future.</P>
    <P>In the one-to-one cases, and this is mentioned many times in the report, it often happens that a result is achieved on behalf of an individual.  That does not mean that there has been a change in the system but it means a lot to the person who made the representation.  Politicans would deal with such issues on a daily basis.  Particularly worthy of mention are the cases where the Office of the Ombudsman has succeeded in having policy changes made.  I would like to applaud the work which has been done in that respect.</P>
    <P>In many of the examples which the Minister of State gave in his speech and which are mentioned in the report, policies have been changed.  Senator Ormonde referred to a case where information <Col N="1852" /> was not given to a resident by the local authority in relation to a case which was brought to the Office of the Ombudsman. The local authority decided to change their policy as a result of that decision.  The Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare are cited in other examples where one-of cases have triggered changes in policy, which is welcome.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the number of queries in relation to Telecom Éireann has declined.  The Minister of State and the report do not claim that this is directly as a result of the actions of the Ombudsman but I think nobody could doubt that the actions of the Ombudsman seem to have effected a change.  I remember on the usual radio chat shows there were daily complaints about the telephone service, bills and so on.  I think it is unlikely that complaints in relation to Telecom Éireann will be completely eliminated and perhaps the changes in the billing system may see the Ombudsman faced with many more queries.</P>
    <P>Another example which struck me was in relation to foster parents, where children were removed from the care of foster parents without any notice.  That seems a particularly heartless way to deal with people who are doing something which is supportive of the State and the families involved.  That prompted a policy change and the subsequent Child Care Act, 1991, recognised that people are entitled to the dignity of being told what is happening to them.  However, I do not want to labour the issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome this report and I think every Member of this Chamber and of the Dáil could probably write their political life history in a similar format.  Public representatives meet very interesting people, and hear of cases which tug at the heart strings and which, unfortunately, are not capable of being resolved.  This report also acknowledges that the approach of the Office of the Ombudsman has not been to take every case which has been brought to its attention <Col N="1853" /> to say that something has gone wrong and that the Office of the Ombudsman will rectify it.  The report states that 38 per cent of the cases were not upheld, this suggests that cases are not taken on lightly, but that they are thoroughly investigated.  After investigation it is decided rather than waste the resources of the Office of the Ombudsman, and indeed of the public service office concerned, that the case will either be proceeded with or dropped.</P>
    <P>I am interested to read in the report that the Office of the Ombudsman is entitled to information, where it is considered it is &ldquo;necessary to acquire without delay all documents relating to a complaint&rdquo;. I might find myself using the Office of the Ombudsman earlier than I had anticipated, because I understand that the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is refusing to release that type of information to a constituent who has requested it.  It is interesting that the Office of the Ombudsman can request that information.</P>
    <P>I welcome the growth of the citizens' information services.  People should be empowered to improve their own lifestyles and circumstances, and I think public representations and the Office of the Ombudsman have played an important role in this regard.  I wish to pay tribute to the citizens' information centres who provide services on a voluntary basis.  They provide training courses and clinics, and they host the regional visits, which are another aspect of the work done by the Office of the Ombudsman. I welcome the report and, like Senator Ormonde, I look forward to the day when the Office of the Ombudsman will be redundant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise the question of the appalling state of Clonmacnois national school in County Offaly.  The conditions in which teachers there are currently obliged to educate their young pupils amount to a scandal. Clonmacnois has been a seat of learning since 545 A.D. when a monastery was founded there by St. Kieran.  It became famous throughout Europe, and for 300 years students from many countries were taught a wide range of subjects there, including calligraphy, languages, poetry and the Brehon Laws.  The Book of Clonmacnois ranks alongside the Book of Kells as one of the most historic works ever produced in this country.  Because of its fame, Clonmacnois attracts over 100,000 visitors each year from Europe, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and other countries.  As an Offaly man I am proud of Clonmacnois and its history, as is everyone else in the county.</P>
      <P>I would like to place on record my thanks to the Office of Public Works for the splendid work it has carried out at Clonmacnois where in the last few years approximately £2 million has been spent on the monastery.  However, visitors to the famous site also photograph the existing national school which is in an appalling state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clonmacnois national school is a three-teacher school with 79 pupils.  Two of the classrooms cannot hold any more pupils due to lack of space.  The school was originally built as a two-teacher unit in 1948. It now requires two new classrooms, a library and a staff room, as well as repairs to the old building.  The roof of the school is leaking in four places and rainwater regularly flows onto the teachers and pupils below.  The situation is so bad that staff and pupils have to mop up water from the floors every morning.  There are <Col N="1855" /> no cloakrooms in the school and children are obliged to sit on wet tiles when changing their clothes.  The existing staff room was converted from an old shelter and there is damp mould on every wall and ceiling in the school.  There is also a real danger of electrocution from water dripping onto an immersion heater.</P>
    <P>The story of the repairs and extension needed at this school goes back to 1982 when sanction was granted for a general purpose room there.  In 1984 the Department of Education's architects visited the school, and the following year a departmental planning inspector called to check pupil numbers.  In 1987 it was agreed to provide two new classrooms and repairs to existing buildings.  In 1990, the departmental architects called again with outline sketch plans, and in 1991 the Department submitted completed sketch plans.  In February that year planning permission was applied for.  Permission was granted in September 1992, following an archaeological survey, and nothing has happened since then.  The parents, teachers and board of management returned to the Department and asked for building specifications to be drawn up to allow the renovation work to go out to tender.</P>
    <P>They have heard nothing of a positive nature in the intervening period.  In fact, all they have heard is that the school is not being included in the 1993 plan, which is a scandal considering its appalling condition. There is sufficient money available for certain other items and projects and it is essential that money be found this year for work on this school.  It is unfair on the teachers and pupils to have to work under such appalling conditions.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that the money is provided this year, less than £150,000 is required.  We met the Minister of Education on 25 February 1993 and she told us that money would not be available in 1993.  I believe this money should be found and must be found.  The educational opportunities for many <Col N="1856" /> pupils attending Clonmacnois national school are being hampered because of the condition of the school.  They are at a disadvantage compared to pupils on other schools where conditions are better.  They are not being treated fairly by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>It is the duty and responsibility of the Minister for Education to ensure that the pupils, teachers and parents of Clonmacnois are not treated in a discriminatory manner with regard to educational opportunities.  Recently pupils were withdrawn from the school for one day.  I sympathise with the parents and teachers who took this action.  If I was the parent of a pupil attending the school, I would be justifiably annoyed and upset if my child had to endure such conditions.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to make the necessary money available to the school in 1993 or, if not, to confirm that the funding will be provided in 1994.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Enright for raising this matter.  I do not doubt his sincerity on the matter.</P>
      <P>Consideration must be given to the important site on which the school is located.  The present accommodation at this school consists of three small permanent classrooms and the staffing comprises a principal and two assistant teachers.  The current enrolment is 78 pupils.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education agreed in October 1990 to provide two new classrooms and to convert two of the existing classrooms to a general purposes room.  The general purposes room is to be provided entirely at local expense. Sketch plans for this proposal were immediately started and were completed in January 1991.  Copies of these plans were sent to the school authorities to enable them to seek local authority planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, at that stage there were delays which were outside the control of <Col N="1857" /> my Department.  Because of the school's close proximity to the ancient monastic site at Clonmacnois the local authorities referred the matter to the Office of Public Works who advised that a test excavation would have to be done in order to ascertain the existence and extent of any archaeological deposits on the site.  This excavation found that there was very little archaeological material on the site however and this excavation and investigation delayed the granting of planning permission until October 1992.</P>
    <P>The next stage in the procedure is the preparation of tender documents.  It was not possible to include the Clonmacnois project in the 1993 construction programme for national schools.  The Senator is aware that this was confirmed in February 1993 by the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>The Senator also referred to improvement works required at the school.  The school authorities contacted the Department at the end of March 1993 regarding the poor condition of a flat roof and windows at the school.  A report has recently been received in the Department from the local Office of Public Works and is being examined at the moment.  The school authorities will be contacted about these matters at a very early date.</P>
    <P>I think the Senator will accept that there has been no appreciable delay to date in trying to improve the facilities at Clonmacnois national school.  I can only assure the Senator that careful consideration will be given to the inclusion in due course of the major project at this school in the Department's primary building programme having regard to the level of funds available and other commitments and priorities.</P>

      <P>The problem of coastal erosion is not confined to County Wicklow nor is the concern about the issue confined to the public representatives of any one political party.</P>
      <P>If something is not done about coastal erosion there will be a disaster particularly along our eastern seaboard.  It is widely accepted that the legislative basis on which the current coastal erosion programmes are implemented is unworkable. The Coastal Erosion Act should be repealed and rewritten.  The ineffectiveness of that legislation has been widely recognised by public representatives from all political parties.  In particular, I acknowledge the work of Councillor Michael Ledwidge, Chairman of Bray UDC in pointing out how unworkable are the current legislative arrangements. Allied to this unworkable legislation, successive Governments have provided woefully inadequate budgets to tackle coastal erosion.  Governments of all political views have been derelict in their duties to protect the coastline and the lives, property and well being of those living along the coastline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County Wicklow has a major problem with coastal erosion and this is widely recognised.  For example, the town of Bray is under continuous threat because the sea has encroached along the sea wall, especially at the esplanade.  A sum of approximately £7 to £8 million is required to make the area safe.  Money has been spent in recent years, but always in <Col N="1859" /> response to damage done by storms or some disaster.  It is only three years since a number of public representatives, including myself, phoned the then Minister for Defence from a house on the Bray seafront and asked him to put the Army on standby as we feared parts of the town would be flooded.</P>
    <P>Arklow is another town which has been affected.  Emergency work is being caried out there at present at a cost of £2 million or £1,000 per metre to build up coastal defences.  However more investment is required, particularly in groynes off the coastline.  There is a serious problem of beach depletion at Ennereily, the area of coastline between Mizen Head and Arklow.  Every week a portion of the cliff walk falls into the sea between Bray Head and Greystones and the sea regularly breaks over the main Dublin to Wexford railway line at Kilcoole.</P>
    <P>The problem is not confined to County Wicklow.  In County Wexford, approximately £15.5 million investment is urgently required to remedy coastal erosion. At Rosslare Strand work costing approximately £6 million, is being done but we had to wait until there was a near disaster before action was taken. Recently there was a threat of houses falling into the sea at Cahore.  £4 milion needs to be spent on the beaches at Cahore and Courtown.  Alevmine, Polshone, Curracloe, Ballytiege, Cullenstown require multi-million pounds expenditure.</P>
    <P>An examination of the Eolas report, <i>Coastal Management: A case for action</i> will show that in County Louth, 21 kilometres of coastline from Ballagar, Cruistown, Greenore, Seabank, Castlebellingham, Annagassan, Cloghercove, Dundalk, Salterstown, Seapoint, Termonfeckin require investment of approximately £12 million.  There is a need along this coastline for sea walls, groynes, rock armour and gabions.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave will be addressing the situation in County Dublin, but at <Col N="1860" /> present the entire east coast is under threat.  Cost benefit analysis will show that in some areas the threat of and damage caused by erosion will have to be sustained.  However, in other areas, for example Bray and Arklow, this cannot be tolerated because millions of pounds worth of private and public property is at risk.</P>
    <P>There will be serious danger to life and property along the eastern seaboard unless there is substantial investment in coastal protection which should be incorporated in the new plan for which we need financial contributions from Brussels. Ministers are sensitive to this issue and while there are many calls on the public purse, few serious issues have received such scant attention.</P>
    <P>In order to address this problem, we need new legislation, an ongoing Government and Opposition parties.  It is protection programme and an ongoing multi-annual budget agreed by both Government and opposition parties.  It is clear that local authorities are standing like Dutch boys with their fingers in the dyke.  It is only a matter of time before there is a major disaster when it will be too late and too costly to do anything about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Roche for allowing me to share his time.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy O'Sullivan, to the House.  I agree with everything Senator Roche has said.  Our neighbouring constituencies have similar erosion problems, some of which Senator Roche has outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the east coast has been badly eroded.  Immediate remedial action must be taken, otherwise the eventual cost will be greater and serious accidents may occur.  There is concern in Killiney, County Dublin about overhanging rocks in the area.  At a recent council meeting the borough engineer gave a vivid description of what has been happening there in recent years. <Col N="1861" /> The erosion is visible and it has been possible, over a period of time, to see it increase.  Immediate action must be taken to rectify coastal erosion.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senator Roche is aware that Irish Rail had to take action in relation to the DART line which runs along the coast.  This is one safety aspect of the problem and there are others with regard to houses in the area.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could give an indication that the Government is committed to a plan which will ensure that affected areas are continuously inspected and monitored so that progress is made. I agree that the legislation is outdated and it is important that we do not delay. The problems along the coast, which I and Senator Roche have outlined, are real.  Certain areas are more affected than others and lives may be lost if action is not taken.  I ask the Minister to respond positively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan) Gerry O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Roche and Senator Cosgrave for raising the important issue.</P>
      <P>The policy of the Department of the Marine is to facilitate the implementation of permanent protection schemes, where warranted, to prevent progressive erosion by the sea.  However, primary responsibility for coastal erosion rests with coastal local authorities, some of which have undertaken protection works themselves.  Owners of private property have a role in protecting their own interests.</P>
      <P>There are limited funds available to the Department of the Marine to deal with the large problem of coastal erosion. An amount of £200,000 was allocated in 1993.  These funds are earmarked for advancing existing schemes, such as the major protection scheme at Rosslare Strand, County Wexford, and the maintenance of former Office of Public Works schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to formulate a national programme of coastal protection works for <Col N="1862" /> the next few years, the Department of the Marine wrote to all coastal local authorities in 1991, including Wicklow County Council, inviting them to submit a list of priorities for coastal protection which they feel would be warranted and feasible and for which they are prepared to make funds available.</P>
    <P>Wicklow County Council in its submission to the Department of the Marine proposed protection works at eight locations at a total cost of £11.5 million. The council proposed the provision of rock armour at Bray to protect the promenade, harbour and existing defences at a preliminary cost estimate of £2.5 million; the provision of rock armour and undertaking of drainage works to protect the coast at and to the north of Greystones at a preliminary cost estimate of £2 million; the strengthening of existing coastal protection by rock armour from Cobbler Bulk to Six Mile Point near Kilcoole at an estimated cost of £1.5 million; the installation of rock armour and groynes at and to the north of Wicklow town at an estimated cost of £1.5 million; the provision of rock groynes and extension of present coastal protection to protect Arklow north beach at a preliminary cost estimate of £2 million; the stabilisation of the embankment with rock armour at the south of Arklow rock headland at Clegga beach at an estimated cost of £500,000; the provision of groynes and raising present sea defences at Arklow south beach at a cost of £1 million; the provision of groynes and planting to protect the sand dunes at Brittas Bay from erosion at a preliminary cost estimate of £500,000.</P>
    <P>The council estimates that the expenditure of £11.5 million on these protection works will protect endangered property such as houses, hotels, roadways, farmlands, etc, with a value of approximately £40 million.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the submissions received, including Wicklow County Council's submission, the Department of the Marine is actively seeking funding for <Col N="1863" /> a comprehensive National Coastal Protection Programme under the next round of Structural Funds allocations.  These allocations will be determined in the National Development Plan, due over the coming months.</P>
    <P>While no decisions have yet been made on Structural Funds allocation, I hope that the Government will accord high priority to this programme and that the necessary funding will be made available to enable schemes, such as those outlined above, to be implemented.</P>
    <P>With specific reference to County Wicklow, the project locations being proposed by Wicklow County Council are being considered for inclusion in the programme. However, pending finalisation of the programme and clarification of the funding available, I am not in a position, at this stage, to say if or when these projects can be implemented.  I might also add that in recent years coastal protection works have been undertaken in County Wicklow, specifically at the Murrough and Arklow, and a physical model study report was commissioned in respect of Bray.  This is now being assessed in the Department.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine recognises that the entire coastal zone represents <Col N="1864" /> an asset which must be protected and managed.  Close co-operation between the Department of the Marine and coastal local authorities in the planning and execution of all coastal protection works is essential.  Close co-operation is important with regard to the planning and management of all aspects of the coastal zone.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine is currently reviewing its approaches to coastal protection.  In this regard, I believe the way to proceed in the future is to look beyond individual projects and embrace the concepts of coastal zone management, which is being developed and implemented in other countries, giving a more comprehensive overview of the development and protection of the coastal zone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister of State for his comprehensive response.  I welcome the last paragraph which says that coastal zone management is the way forward.  It is not sufficient to suggest that local authorities make an input into this because in reality it is a national problem.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 23 June 1993.</P>
