      <P>I have notice from Senator Enright that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to sanction the building of a new 50 bed hospital unit at Edenderry, County Offaly.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGowan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism and Trade to consider the role of Bord Fáilte and the regional tourist offices after the enterprise boards are set up.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" /> The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that the Stella Maris School in Foynes, County Limerick, continues as a second level institution after 1995 in view of the withdrawal of the religious community and the decision not to accept first year students from September 1993.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Fahey of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to amend the social welfare regulations so that a self-employed person over 55 years of age, who has been making PRSI contributions since 1988, would become entitled to a contributory pension or, alternatively, would be credited with the contributions he has made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3" /> I have also received notice from Senator Kelleher of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide a secondary school in the Glanmire-Riverstown area of Cork.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to outline the position of the Tibetan people under Chinese jurisdiction; and the action the Government intends taking in relation to the situation.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Enright, McGowan, Neville, Fahey, Kelleher and Taylor-Quinn as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Enright's and McGowan's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Neville, Fahey, Kelleher and Taylor-Quinn may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business will be Items 3 and 20.  Item 20 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.  For the information of the House, I propose to withdraw Item 2, Criminal Law (Suicide) Bill, 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business: that the Order of Business be Items 2,3 and 20.</P>
      <P>Item 1 should be taken as soon as possible. I am concerned that the so-called reform of the Oireachtas is going ahead without any reference to this House which has been excluded from most of the newly formed committees.  That, combined with what is happening with the Criminal Law (Suicide) Bill, sends a clear signal that this House is being treated as a political backwater, to be used at the whim of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="4" /> This House has been treated disgracefully with regard to the Criminal Law (Suicide) Bill, which would not have seen the light of day if it had not been for the sustained pressure from this House over a long period.  The Criminal Law (Suicide) Bill introduced by the Government is similar in wording to a Fine Gael Private Members' Bill.  Last week the private secretary to the Minister for Justice telephoned &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; to give a public commitment that the Bill would be taken in the Seanad in the next two weeks.  It has now been withdrawn, not on a question of principle or because it would be dealt with better in the other House, but because the Government Chief Whip did not have enough business for the Dáil this week.  We offered to cooperate and make business available to the Dáil.  However, that offer was not accepted.  This House is being treated disgracefully.  We are told that the convenience of the Government Chief Whip is more important than the rights, duties and standing of this House.  I know that Members opposite feel as strongly as we do about this matter.  For that reason, we have no option but to propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that the Order of Business be Items 2, 3 and 20.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator made a lengthy contribution which, perhaps, should not be allowed on the Order of Business.  He wanted to explain his case and I allowed him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the proposal that an amendment be made to the Order of Business.  Senator Neville has been treated disgracefully and the House has been treated badly.  This fact does not need any further articulation.  We were led to believe that the Bill would be taken in this House.  Therefore, we acted honourably.  Last week I congratulated Senator Neville on a good day's work and this is not an acceptable way to do business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought that the Committee Stage of the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill would be taken this week but I understand <Col N="5" /> there may be difficulties with it.  I would like a commitment from the Leader of the House that it will be taken next week.  It is a long Bill and I realise it may not be possible to deal with it in one day.  Will the Leader of the House allocate a number of hours to this Bill next week as it is important legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment to the Order of Business.  It is two years since we introduced a motion in the Seanad to decriminalise suicide.  Since then, we have introduced a Private Members' Bill on two occasions.  We had the support of all parties in this House. It is disappointing, indeed disgraceful, to hear that this Bill is being withdrawn. During my time in this House a Bill has not been withdrawn from the Order Paper.  I am disappointed that this issue should have been withdrawn at the behest of the Government.  It is a bad day for the dignity and role of this House and for Senators.  My party and I, and indeed the House, have made this a Seanad issue.  It was judicious and fair that the Bill was promised to this House last week.  The Minister stated that the Whips would meet immediately to discuss the issue.  I withdrew the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill on the understanding that the Whips would introduce it to this House.  I am now informed that the Bill is being withdrawn.  I believe that I am being chastised for promoting forward thinking legislation to the House.  This proposal, because it is still only a proposal, is an affront to the dignity and role of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the remarks of Senator Manning and Senator Neville. We have reached a point where everything will be decided by the Executive. The Houses of the Oireachtas are becoming irrelevant.  There was broad agreement in relation to the proposed legislation.  Although time must be regulated in the Houses of the Oireachtas, it does not make sense to act in this way. Furthermore, I have seen a document which suggests that this House will be <Col N="6" /> used on Tuesdays and Fridays for committee meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On what basis has that document been circulated?  The Committee on Procedure and Priviliges has not ruled on this matter, to the best of my knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee on Procedure and Privileges will meet this evening to consider this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We have attempted, over several weeks, to reach a decision. However, how can such a document, outlining what is to happen to this House, be circulated?  Will we have a say in how we conduct our business and regulate our affairs?  Will the Leader of the House state whether there will be a debate on the Government report on selected aspects of the Culliton report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>For the information of the House, the document referred to by Senator Dardis was not circulated by me or by the Seanad office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I said that because of the importance of the Criminal Law (Suicide) Bill, it was of no consequence whether it was introduced to the House by Senator Neville or in the Dáil.  I justified introducing the Bill in the Seanad by saying that under the Constitution it has the power to initiate legislation. It is a poor reflection on this assembly that the Leader of the House stated that this legislation would be introduced this week and that it was then withdrawn.  Perhaps the Leader of the House will justify his reason for withdrawing the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Senators, I express our disappointment that this Bill is being introduced in the Dáil instead of in the Seanad.  None of us doubts Senator <Col N="7" /> Neville's sincerity and persistence in regard to this issue.</P>
      <P>It was indicated that this Bill would be introduced in the Seanad and Senator Magner and I raised this issue with the Labour Party Whip in the Dáil.  The reason given was that there would not be sufficient time to introduce the Bill in the Seanad and that more time would be available in the Dáil.  While I do not accept this we must ensure that the legislation is enacted as soon as possible in order to abolish the offence of suicide.  I express our disappointment that this Bill is being introduced in the Dáil.  I am not sure if we can do anything about it now because it is on the Dáil Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the sentiments expressed by Senator Manning and I am sure they are shared by the Cathaoirleach, a supporter of this House as an institution.  I believe those on the Government side feel it is important to maintain the dignity of this House which has been subjected to a series of insults. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is persistently referred to as the Dáil Committee on Foreign Affairs and I support what Senator Manning said about the necessity to implement Item 1 on the Order Paper today.  What is happening to the Criminal (Suicide) Bill is piracy, a form of carpet-bagging. However, it is appropriate that it is a suicide Bill because if we do not dig our heels in now we are aiding and abetting the suicide of the House as a serious legislative Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary that there was a commitment to introduce this Bill in the Seanad, a point argued by Senator Neville, and that then, to provide justification for the operation of the other House, it was simply snatched away without any justification.  I deplore this and I am sure the Cathaoirleach, although it would not be proper for him to express a personal opinion because of his loyalty and devotion to the highest principle of this House, must also deplore this. Decent people on the Government <Col N="8" /> benches feel the same.  This is not just an Opposition matter.</P>
    <P>I refer to Item 15 on the Order Paper in the name of the Independent Senators and Item 21 in the name of Senator Henry and myself.  Unless there is some amelioration of the conditions under which we work I will, in succeeding weeks, move an amendment to the Order of Business. It is not tolerable to work in an office the size of a shoebox with eight telephones and seven or eight people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and is on the agenda for this evening's meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad although I heard this on several occasions.  The situation is critical.  It is impossible for my colleagues and myself to work and I link this to Item 21.  I, and I am sure other Members, hope the Cathaoirleach will be responsible for this.  We receive unjustified bad press because of misunderstanding in the media about the way in which both Houses of the Oireachtas operate.  It is time to appoint a press officer to handle relations with the media and explain how this House operates.  We do not want to hear nonsense about the lack of Senators in the Chamber.  We work in our offices where we have television monitors to follow proceedings.  I am tired of unjustified criticism of professional politicians.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is being constructive and sincere about its business, will the Leader make time available to discuss insurance companies?  One insurance company is the cause of considerable hardship to a widow and this must not be allowed to continue.  It is important to discuss such an important issue and seen to be more constructive than the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>The points made by the Fine Gael Leader in the Seanad are valid because there are times when one is criticised <Col N="9" /> by one's own side.  The person who is criticised most is the Leader of the House, for whom I have great sympathy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Senator not rebel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy to rebel, Senator Norris, when one is an Independent Senator; it is one of the luxuries of being an Independent.  When one accepts the Whip the only thing to do is to walk the plank.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of this session all sides agreed that we would make this House work and this is still the case.  We meant what we said.  The Government Chief Whip has had his bite of the cherry and he would be silly to return for another bite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I also express my sympathies to the Opposition and to the Members of the House on this side. Senator Norris said that there are decent people here.  I believe that all the people on this side are decent and I am peeved with the whole situation.</P>
      <P>Regarding Structural Funding I call on the Leader to arrange a debate.  This funding was ably negotiated by our Taoiseach but the House should debate how the moneys will be apportioned to alleviate long term unemployment through expenditure on a job orientation programme, which is vitally important.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the reason bypasses are built around places like Cork and Tallaght that people do not see the poverty and deprivation in these areas?  Will the Leader have this discussed immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Leader of the House prepared to allow time next week to discuss the infamous integrated administrative and control system which is now being introduced by the Department of Agriculture?  D-day is 14 May 1993 in respect of these presentations.  They are <Col N="10" /> vital to the national interest as the 175,000 farmers involved cannot comply with the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment to the Order of Business.  We are discussing a future role for this House and whether the public perceives it as important. The Labour Party Members in this House can indicate that they are not prepared to accept the Government's proposals but we must remind ourselves that the people who elected the majority of Members to this House were informed four, five or six months ago that they will be allowed to hold only a certain number of meetings in any one year.  It would appear that the same policy is being pursued&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by the Government on the way we run our affairs in this House.  I believe in democracy, having been elected on many occasions in different elections.  However, if we are not prepared to stand up and be counted in this House the Government will decide when we sit and when our Chamber will be used for other business.  We will have no say in the matter.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Kelleher's proposal <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Structural Funds.  There is an ongoing debate in Cabinet at present and we should also debate how these funds will be used to the best advantage for unemployed people.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator D'Arcy's proposal. There is mayhem across the length and breadth of the country regarding the forms issued by the Department of Agriculture which must be returned by 14 May 1993.  Time should be made available early next week &mdash; let us sit a day earlier if necessary &mdash; to discuss this matter and to alleviate the problems and fears of farmers in relation to these forms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Cregan's call for a debate on insurance companies. We had a debate on insurance &mdash;<Col N="11" /> in which the Cathaoirleach was involved &mdash; particularly on motor insurance because great anomalies and injustices are perpetrated by insurance companies, which should be highlighted.  Many changes have been introduced designed to reduce premiums, but they continue to increase.  In addition, many categories of people are effectively debarred from getting insurance because of their occupation. It is discrimination and I highlighted this in the previous debate.  It is time to again highlight it and have another debate to try &mdash; to use an old Mayo phrase &mdash; to shake the marrow in the bones of some of the insurance companies.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the next stage of the suicide Bill will not be taken in this House as the Minister gave a commitment last week that it would.</P>
      <P>The pious platitudes from the Opposition are difficult to accept because at one stage last week there were only two speakers in this House while the Bill was being discussed.  Furthermore, half an hour was lost because there were no speakers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the amendment to the Order of Business.  This House is part and parcel of our Constitution. All these bodies are set up under our Constitution and must be treated with dignity and respect.  Elected Members to the House must not allow it to be trampled on.  There is sadness among Labour Party Members at what is happening.  The excuse proffered that there would not be sufficient time to process legislation in this House is unacceptable. <Col N="12" /> The House is available and we are prepared to sit at whatever time deemed necessary.  I ask Labour Party Members, many of whom have shown great courage in the past, to put down a marker in this regard to the Government. It is not simply a matter about the freedom of an Independent, as Senator Magner suggested.  The people voted in the last election for change and will be deprived of this if the Labour Party Members do not stand by their principles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the views expressed in regard to how the Suicide Bill should proceed.  The proposed delay is not one that rests easily on my shoulders. All the Party Whips in the other House agreed to proceed in the Dáil.  I remind the House that we made progress on legislation initiated in this House.  I am confident that in the coming weeks important legislation will be introduced and dealt with in the House.</P>
      <P>Item 1 will be agreed with the Whips tomorrow.  Unfair dismissals will be dealt with next week and the necessary time will be given.  The Minister, having dealt with Second Stage, would like to contribute on Committee Stage and will be available next week.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis mentioned the Culliton report.  I will have news on that shortly for the House.  Regarding the other issues, ranging from insurance to Structural Funds to area aid, we will be dealing with Common Agricultural Policy tomorrow, which will give the Senators a chance to make their views known to the Minister. On Senator Daly's comments on the building societies, I am sure the Whips will be able to agree a Thursday afternoon debate on this issue over the coming weeks.</P>

    <Title>Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Bill, 1992: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before this House relates to a key constitutional office of State, that of Comptroller and Auditor General. Article 33 of the Constitution provides:</P>
      <P>There shall be a Comptroller and Auditor General to control on behalf of the State all disbursements and to audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The office of Comptroller and Auditor General predates the State.  Thus most of our existing legislation in relation to that office remains the British legislation which was in force in 1922, notably the Exchequer and Audit Departments Acts, 1866 and 1921.  The Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1923, applied these Acts to the new State and the 1937 Constitution essentially enshrined the existing practice.  Much of what is contained in these Acts remains fundamental and will be consolidated and updated as necessary in this Bill.  There is now a clear need to broaden the statutory functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General. The purpose of this Bill is to broaden the concept of accountability and introduce audits on the basis of value for money.  At the kernel of the proposals in this Bill is the need for a more transparent and comprehensive kind of public accountability.  The existing statutory role of the Comptroller and Auditor General in auditing the accuracy and regularity of public expenditure is no longer sufficient.  Since the foundation of the State there has been a great increase in the volume and complexity of public expenditure and receipts and also in the number of different bodies and agencies administering or dependent upon public resources.</P>
      <P>There is an ever more pressing need, therefore, to ensure not just accuracy and the avoidance of irregularities but also good administration in the bodies concerned, i.e. efficient, economical and effective administration of the public resources entrusted to them.  The public have a right to be assured those receiving, spending and holding public resources are rendered accountable in a full and comprehensive manner for their stewardship of those resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one of the great officers of State, the Comptroller and Auditor General has a crucial role to play in making public accountability a reality.  The Oireachtas, as the supreme legislative organ of the State, appropriates the money required for the public services.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's function is to assure the Dáil, representing the public, that the conditions set down by the Legislature are complied with by those charged with the stewardship of this money.  This <Col N="17" /> is one reason why the Constitutional independence of the Comptroller and Auditor General is so important.</P>
    <P>While I have indicated that much of the existing legislation in regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General dates back before the foundation of the State, there have been significant non-statutory developments in the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, on the basis of custom and practice.</P>
    <P>The principal development has been the acceptance that the Comptroller and Auditor General has a function in identifying and reporting on instances where it appears to him that there has been loss, waste or uneconomic expenditure by Government departments.  Over the years the Department of Finance has fully supported the Comptroller and Auditor General in the exercise of this important non-statutory function.  The latest development on this front has been his recent initiative in preparing project audits which focus on particular issues or areas of expenditure or revenue together with his usual report on the Appropriation Accounts.</P>
    <P>These changes reflect ongoing developments over the past twenty years or so in the practice of audit generally and, the national audit in particular. Internationally, there is now a much greater emphasis on value for money in the public sector.  This is of course in addition to the traditional audit of accuracy and regularity.  While avoidance of fraud and error is a <i>sine qua non</i>, it is also important to address the misuse of resources, potentially even more costly to the taxpayer, due to poor administration.</P>
    <P>In formulating this Bill, the Department of Finance undertook a comprehensive review of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, including an examination of developments in national auditing in other countries in recent years, particularly those with a similar parliamentary tradition to our own.  In the light of this review and a special report by the Dáil Committee of Public Accounts, the Government decided to modernise the rôle of the Comptroller and Auditor General on a <Col N="18" /> statutory basis, having regard to best international practice and our own national needs.  This Bill is being put forward to consolidate and modernise existing legislative provisions, to make additional provision to extend the range and scope of scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General of public expenditure and the administative management of public resources in line with modern requirements, to provide for more effective arrangements for reporting by the Comptroller and Auditor General and to deal with other incidental and miscellaneous issues which now require attention.</P>
    <P>The White Paper published with this Bill gives a detailed account of the issues and the reasoning behind the measures proposed.  Therefore, I will not repeat what is in the White Paper.  I want rather to focus on the intention of the Bill and on a number of its more significant features and to mention changes made during its passage through the Dáil.  The two major new elements of the legislation relate to the nature of the audit process, and to the scope of that process.</P>
    <P>The nature of the audit process will be enhanced by the addition of a new statutory role for the Comptroller and Auditor General in regard to value for money.  This may be divided into, economy, efficiency and effectiveness.  These concepts are of course inter-related and in practice cannot be so readily separated. With that caveat, it may be helpful to give the essence of the concepts. Economy relates to acquiring and using only the necessary resources at the least cost.  Efficiency means achieving the required output with the minimum of resources or the maximum output from a given level of resources.  Effectiveness means that the outputs achieve the desired results.</P>
    <P>In relation to effectiveness, it is necessary to ensure that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General does not move into the assessment of policy, which is rightly an area dealt with by the Government and the Dáil.  In the public sector in examining effectiveness there is a difficulty in establishing the degree to <Col N="19" /> which changes in an area or a sector affected by a programme are the results of that programme.  In real life programmes do not generally have a single objective with readily quantifiable results.  Indeed, there are other factors affecting the change not just those resulting from the programme.  It is most important, that Departments and other bodies should have the necessary systems in place to enable them to appraise the effectiveness of their own operations in achieving policy objectives.</P>
    <P>The second area relates to the link between judgments on effectiveness and judgments on policy.  The formulation of policy is the responsibility of Government and Ministers are answerable to the Dáil for policy matters in their Departments. National auditors in most countries would accept it is not their business to examine policy and they have no rôle in this regard.  The problem is when examining effectiveness in practice, questions can easily arise as to the merits of the objectives of programmes being examined, as well as on the basis of validity or suitability of the programme itself.  Thus an auditor could be drawn into considering whether the objectives of a programme were reasonable in the first place and, directly or by inference, expressing opinions on the merits of the policy on which the objectives were based.</P>
    <P>It would not be desirable to draw the Comptroller and Auditor General into the political arena in this way.  It could compromise the independence, and consequently the effectiveness of that office.  The important consideration is that it is the responsibility of Departments and other bodies to have the necessary systems in place to enable them to appraise the effectiveness of their own operations.</P>
    <P>This consideration has been the central one determining the Government's approach to examinations by the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to effectiveness.  The Bill provides therefore, that he may at his discretion examine and report on the <Col N="20" /> economy and efficiency of Departments and bodies audited by him.  Those Departments and bodies will be expected to have in place the necessary systems for carrying out such appraisal of effectiveness so as to provide Ministers and management with the necessary information to take any corrective or policy action which may be indicated.  Such systems will be subject to examination for effectiveness by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>In this way the danger of the Comptroller and Auditor General becoming involved, directly or indirectly, in the area of policy is minimised.  At the same time, the Oireachtas and the public have a reliable and independent assurance that there are systems in place for evaluating the effectiveness of expenditure.  It will be noted that the power to examine efficiency, effectiveness and economy is discretionary while the normal financial audit is mandatory.  This distinction is necessary because it would not be possible for the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out every year a value for money examination in every body he audits.</P>
    <P>However the section of the Bill dealing with value for money is the key provision of the Bill.  It will give the Comptroller and Auditor General a statutory mandate to look at the administration, by Departments and publicly funded bodies, of the resources under their control, to assess whether their operations are economical and efficient and whether they have systems in place to allow them, on an ongoing basis, to appraise whether their operations are in fact effective.  This is the major reform contained in this Bill.  It is a positive step forward and one that has been recommended by the Dáil Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>During the debates in the Dáil, I moved an amendment which will expressly authorise the Comptroller and Auditor General in the course of his examinations under this section, to make comparisons, including comparisons of systems, procedures and practices, as he considers appropriate.  This will enhance <Col N="21" /> the section as it will enable the Comptroller and Auditor General not merely to address cases in which he finds ground for criticism, but to identify instances of good practice which may warrant study or emulation by others.</P>
    <P>The scope of the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit will be extended to cover all the non-commercial State bodies not already statutorily audited by him, and a number of other bodies, principally in the education sector.  These bodies are listed in the First Schedule to the Bill.  The health boards and the vocational education committees will also be audited by him.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will, in addition, be empowered to audit funds under the aegis of bodies which he audits, and with appropriate ministerial approval, subsidiaries of such bodies.</P>
    <P>The local authorities and commercial State bodies do not come within the Comptroller and Auditor General's remit.  The local authorities are already accountable to elected local representatives and will continue to be audited by the Local Government Audit Service.  Commercial bodies are audited by private sector auditors and are accountable to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.  It would be a duplication of effort if the semi-State bodies were accountable to both the Committee of Public Accounts and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.  It should be mentioned that the local government auditors' reports are made available to the Comptroller and Auditor General, and in his report on the Appropriation Accounts he may draw attention to any matter in those reports which he considers to be significant.</P>
    <P>An important extension of the scope of the Comptroller and Auditor General's operations will be the introduction of a statutory power of discretionary inspection. He will be able to inspect and report on the accounts, books and records of commercial harbour authorities, the regional tourism organisations and any body &mdash; other than a commercial State body or a local authority &mdash; in respect of <Col N="22" /> any year in which it received 50 per cent or more of its gross receipts directly from Departments or from the central fund. The Comptroller and Auditor General will be able to check that public moneys have been spent by the subsidiary bodies for the purposes for which they were provided.</P>
    <P>On Report Stage in the Dáil I moved an amendment to the Bill, section 8 (1) (c), to empower the Comptroller and Auditor General to inspect bodies receiving 50 per cent or more of their gross annual receipts indirectly from public funds.  This will enable the Comptroller and Auditor General, where he considers it necessary, to follow public money&mdash; such as grants awarded by State bodies &mdash;to private bodies where these bodies are at least 50 per cent dependent on such funds to ensure that the moneys have been spent in accordance with the intentions of the Oireacthas.  This power of inspection is quite distinct from his power of audit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will not audit the accounts of the bodies which he will inspect; they will continue to have their own auditors as at present.  The purpose of this power is to enable the Comptroller and Auditor General to follow public funds as far as may be necessary so that he can satisfy himself that they have been correctly appropriated.</P>
    <P>The Bill also consolidates and updates existing provisions in legislation relating to the constitutional role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, principally in regard to the comptroller function and the auditor function.  As a natural extension of his audit function in regard to the Government accounts, it provides for the audit by him of the Finance accounts.  Also, a number of incidental and ancillary provisions have been made.</P>
    <P>In addition to the measures which represent the major policy content of the Bill, a number of other provisions have been included.  Many of these are of a consolidation nature and they are explained in the White Paper.  There are, however, some notable innovations. Section 12 provides for the Comptroller <Col N="23" /> and Auditor General, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to charge fees in respect of audits, inspections and examinations carried out by him.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for the appointment by the Comptroller and Auditor General of a suitably qualified independent person to audit on his behalf the Appropriation Account for his own office and, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to examine his office in regard to economy, efficiency and management effectiveness.  For constitutional reasons, that person's report will be appended to the Comptroller and Auditor General report on the Appropriation Account of his office.  Section 17 provides for the transfer of staff from the office of the Minister for the Environment to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General as audits of health boards are transferred from the Local Government Audit Service to the Comptroller and Auditor General consequent on the provisions of this Bill.  I moved an amendment to this section in the Dáil to give greater flexibility in dealing with the individual preferences of staff should they wish to remain with the Local Government Audit Service or to transfer to the Comptroller and Auditor General office.</P>
    <P>Section 19 sets out, for the first time in statutory form, the duty of Accounting Officers to give evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts in regard to regularity and propriety, economy and efficiency, management effectiveness and matters arising from special reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides that different provisions of the Bill can be brought into effect at different times by ministerial order.  The large amount of new work passing to the Comptroller and Auditor General under this Bill will have to be introduced on a phased basis.  It is the Government's intention to bring the different provisions of this Bill into effect with the minimum possible delay.  Other sections provide for repeal of obsolete legislation and consolidation of existing measures so that there will be comprehensive <Col N="24" /> modern legislation covering the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware of the close and complementary relationship which exists between the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Committee of Public Accounts is a Select Committee set up by the Dáil to consider the reports which the Comptroller and Auditor General makes to the Dáil under Article 33.4 of the Constitution.  Heretofore, the Committee of Public Account's terms of reference related specifically to the examination of the Appropriation Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General's reports thereon.  The committee functions by calling the Accounting Officers of Departments to give evidence to them, thereby ensuring accountability to the Dáil.  As indicated in the White Paper, the Government will be proposing to the Dáil revised terms of reference for the Committee of Public Accounts to complement the extended scope of the Comptroller and Auditor General's statutory remit.</P>
    <P>For the first time, the duties of Accounting Officers in giving evidence before the Committee of Public Accounts will be set down in legislation.  This accountability will complement the additional powers proposed for the Comptroller and Auditor General in regard to Government accounts and for the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>I am aware of concerns among staff of the Local Government Audit Service about the implications for them of the transfer of certain audits to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. I recently met some local government auditors to hear their views.  The principle adopted in preparing the Bill following the White Paper on the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, was that local bodies whose funding came largely from central government, should be audited by the central government auditor, the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The health boards alone receive over £1 billion annually, 95 per cent of their annual resources, from the public purse and public accountability requires <Col N="25" /> that the Comptroller and Auditor General should now audit these boards and the vocational education committees, which also receive over 90 per cent of their funds from central sources.  The directly elected local authorities, on the other hand, raise a considerable share of their resources locally and have a direct democratic mandate, and these will continue to be audited by the Local Government Audit Service.</P>
    <P>These proposals will not result in a situation where staff in that service will be left high and dry in the new audit environment.  The basic approach will be that staff will be transferred to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office at the time the work is being transferred. There will be a much greater degree of co-operation and co-ordination between the Comptroller and Auditor General's office and the Local Government Audit Service.  This Bill will cause no diminution of work, in terms of quality and quantity, for auditors.</P>
    <P>Following my meeting with local government auditors and having regard to the representations made to me, I moved an amendment to section 17 of the Bill on Committee Stage in the Dáil to provide a more flexible procedure for the transfer of staff from the Local Government Audit Service to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.</P>
    <P>Rather than directly transferring those staff who have been working on the transferred audits, the new section 17 provides for a more flexible approach to allow local audit staff, as far as is practicable, to opt for the service of their choice.  The decentralisation of Government departments means that there is likely to be regionalisation of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office and planning for new administrative structures will begin as soon as the Bill has been passed.  I gave a commitment in the Dáil to have consultation with staff unions about the planned reorganisation of the audit service. I repeat that commitment here.  I am sure that, through consultation, the new structures can be put in place in a way that facilitates staff.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="26" /> In conclusion, I believe this Bill is an important reform that has the support of all parties.  It will result in a more effective scrutiny of public expenditure with greater emphasis on value for money and the efficient use of resources in Departments and in bodies supported by public funds.  This will ensure a more comprehensive public accountability, thereby contributing to improving the quality of the public services and to better use of public money.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to a large extent with the content and basic principles of this Bill.  In so far as the Bill details changes, it has, to a large extent, the support of all parties.  Therefore, we support the main thrust of the Bill.  However, I have one major reservation, the exclusion of a statutory audit and inspection of the accounts of commercial State sponsored bodies.  There has never been such a need for a thorough examination of our commercial State sponsored bodies.  There are examples of why it is necessary and we should dwell on this a little longer.  I will return to that matter later.</P>
      <P>Over the years, the audit system has been under a Comptroller and Auditor General and, as the Minister rightly pointed out, this goes back to the Exchequer and Audit Departments Acts of 1866 and 1921 and the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1923.  Over the years, there has been a thorough examination of moneys spent on behalf of the Oireachtas.  The moneys were authorised by the Oireachtas and the Comptroller and Auditor General in his constitutional capacity audited the accounts.  There should be generous praise for the work undertaken by this constitutional office holder.  While it might not be a high profile position, nevertheless a considerable amount of hard work is done behind closed doors. It is important work and we should pay tribute to the Comptroller and his staff for their consistency over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts has contributed enormously to the development of the system by the interchange of <Col N="27" /> ideas with the Comptroller.  The person best remembered for his work on the Committee of Public Accounts is probably Deputy Gay Mitchell.  He contributed an enormous amount of hard work to the committee, he raised its profile and brought the type of work undertaken to public attention.  The committee examined the various bodies outlined in the First Schedule to this Act, it examined various accounts, the accounting officers of Government Departments attended and gave evidence and much good work was achieved.  Senator Roche &mdash; a former Deputy &mdash; was a member and the committee comprised a committed group of people.</P>
    <P>The basic idea behind this Bill is that the Comptroller will still be in position but that the duties and responsibilities of the accounting officers and their right to report, account for and outline items which appear in the audit will be statutory.</P>
    <P>The other area which has been excluded in addition to commercial State sponsored bodies is local government. The sections in the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, were well thought out and were set up by the then British Government.  At that time the Government of the United Kingdom exercised a very high degree of central control, in the main to prevent local authorities from becoming involved in the home rule movement.  It transpired despite their best efforts that the local authorities, in the 1917 election in particular, became a focus for home rule.</P>
    <P>The structure and regulations which were in force under the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, have stood the test of time, the same applies to the Exchequer and Audit Departments Acts 1866 and 1921.  Some of the people who drafted those Acts had amazing foresight, and the provisions allowed works to continue over 100 years later.</P>
    <P>There has been quite a successful amount of work under the Local Government Acts and there have not been any major scandals in over 100 years.  Safeguards and very strict controls are <Col N="28" /> needed.  I am not saying that all the money was well spent, in fact much of it was misspent, but there was no misappropriation of moneys for personal gain.</P>
    <P>We must be careful because there is public concern in regard to spending public money and, as a result of waste, carelessness, lack of accountability or other reasons, major blunders were made.  I will give examples which are not political, they happen under all Administrations.</P>
    <P>In the building of Wheatfield Prison, the expenditure was treble the original estimate.  Prison houses were built in Portlaoise and the expenditure was again treble the original estimated cost.  The Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, was magnificantly restored, I am not quibbling about the work, but the over-expenditure was outlandish.  The managing director of a firm who allowed such an overrun on an original estimate would have received not a golden handshake or even a golden handcuff, but a kick up the transom, to use the words of a former Minister for Defence.  It is outrageous that this amount of money was spent without anybody being brought to book.  The taxpayers' money spent on the Government offices in Merrion Street &mdash; I hear they are luxurious &mdash; was far in excess of the level required.  Howth Harbour is another case, and there are many others &mdash; I am only giving a few examples.  Where there are overruns of that scale, somebody must be held responsible.  If the firm of consultant architects who draw up the contracts and prepare the plan make a blunder of that magnitude, it should not again be contracted to do work for a semi-State or Government body.</P>
    <P>I presume that any departmental Secretary who authorises or is in charge of contracts drawn up, gets legal advice from the Attorney General.  However, the people giving advice in other instances, solicitors or barristers, should be held accountable.  Any company carrying out work on building projects or on new factories, office blocks or housing estates should be treated the same way. Any professionals involved are paid <Col N="29" /> generous fees.  Therefore, if anything goes wrong they must be held accountable. The examples I gave &mdash; and there are many more across the country &mdash; involved the misspending of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money, which cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>There are a number of areas in which the Comptroller and Auditor General's control is limited to administration. Policy is decided by Governments.  The areas where he can deal with are very vague and he must be careful not to overstep his authority in these sectors because it is not his function.  He must also ensure that there is as little wastage as possible. For example, nine regional development authorities, with new offices, staff and equipment were recently set up.  They build up a relationship with different local authorities, Government Departments and so on.  Then they were progressively closed down.  Some senior personnel in these authorities had moved from their local authorities many years earlier because they felt regionalisation would be a major growth area.  Later when they tried to revert to local authorities they were unable to do so because the bodies were not-statutory at that time.  The closure of these offices was a major waste of taxpayers' money. However, I do not blame the Comptroller and Auditor General; the then Minister &mdash; now Commissioner Flynn &mdash; was in charge.  Much of the work undertaken by these authorities would have been of tremendous assistance at present because there is now a further move towards regionalisation.  They have devised excellent and well documented reports, dealing with the years from 1988 to the year 2000, which might be of benefit to the new Minister in her projections, plans and developments.  They are readable and easily available.</P>

    <Title>Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the ideas put forward by the Minister concerning the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is essential to have continued co-operation, although one will often have conflict. There is a healthy respect for the accounting officers and others giving evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts. There were heated exchanges at times; each side gave as good as it got.</P>
      <P>In regard to section 12 of the Bill, I have reservations about the charges of fees by the Comptroller and Auditor General and I would not like to see his office become self-financing.  That was never intended and I accept that the Minister does not have this in mind.  This office accounts for money spent on behalf of the Oireachtas and much of its work is tedious, slow and deliberate, which takes time and effort.</P>
      <P>I now come to the real point of my speech.  There are two Schedules to the Bill.  I am happy with the First Schedule, but I have problems with the exclusion from the Bill of the different bodies outlined in the Second Schedule.  The idea of this Bill was that Government spending would be analysed through the Comptroller and Auditor General, that local authority spending would be analysed through these authorities and that commercial State-sponsored bodies would be self-examining.  Senator &mdash; then Deputy &mdash; Roche was the chairman of that body.  I do not know his present views, perhaps he disagrees with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> CERT is to be examined; the accounts of the Church of Ireland College in Rathmines are to be audited, Comhairle na Ospidéal and the Defence Forces canteen board are to be examined yet the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot inquire into what happened in Aer Lingus holiday holdings and it would be a good idea if he did.  If the Comptroller and Auditor General had responsibility for Greencore, the scandal we witnessed there would not have occurred. It was an appalling rip-off of the Irish taxpayer and had the Comptroller and Auditor General power to examine what was taking place there the wheeling and dealing might have been prevented. However it happened and Senators have an opportunity this afternoon to decide to make provision in future for examination of semi-State bodies such as Greencore.  It would be a marvellous achievement if the Minister went back to Cabinet and said there was a very strong demand from Seanad Éireann for certain semi-State bodies to be examined.  There would be much support for such a move.</P>
    <P>Bord Telecom is specifically excluded from the application of section 8 and 9. Why?  We have the power if we wish to use it to speak about different bodies that I have mentioned, such as the Legal Aid Board.  Many of these bodies can be dealt with under the First Schedule.  However, in the past if I tried to raise a parliamentary question about bodies that are mentioned in the Second Schedule it would have been ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle because of the way the legislation is framed.  It is not within the remit of our debates to examine the workings of these particular bodies and discussions about them are rare.  The exception is when a semi-State body finds itself in trouble due to shortage of money or some other serious problem.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General should be able to examine the operation of semi-State bodies.  If the Comptroller and Auditor General had had power to investigate the purchase of the Telecom headquarters in Ballsbridge perhaps that scandal could have been avoided because <Col N="32" /> he would have had the power to demand documents for examination.  We are copperfastening an unsatisfactory situation by failing to make provision for the examination of semi-State bodies by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We may debate these matters at some stage but it is not possible for the Comptroller and Auditor General to investigate them and that is why the Bill is deficient.  It is no use going half way.  We should go all of the way and I ask the Minister to make that possible.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to clarify who has responsibility for the spending of lottery money.  Apparently it comes under the Department of the Environment and several other Departments but who has the responsibility for checking the actual spending of it?  Is it the Comptroller and Auditor General?  I am not doubting the people who have responsibility for it, nor am I casting any slur.  As far as I am aware lottery money is being properly spent and the programme <i>Winning Streak</i> features various projects to which money has been allocated.  People in the community are wondering how it is being spent and therefore more information should be made available.</P>
    <P>The lottery was established under an Act of the Oireachtas and we are dealing with the spending of public money here today with reference to audit and inspection of accounts.  The Comptroller and Auditor General can visit vocational schools in Roscommon and Tullamore to examine their accounts.  There should be a similar facility to inspect the spending of lottery money.</P>
    <P>Country enterprise partnership boards are being established and we are aware of problems with the Leader programme in north Tipperary.  If the local authorities had been responsible for Leader spending perhaps problems would not have arisen.  Who will be responsible for auditing the county enterprise partnership boards' accounts?  I would be grateful if the Minister could supply that information when she is replying.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill but I have some reservations.  We have a golden opportunity here to make sure that our commercial <Col N="33" /> States-sponsored bodies can be examined.  I am not criticising State-sponsored bodies which have done magnificant work but occasionally money have been wasted.  For example, a briquette factory was to be built at Ballyforan following election promises. While Bord na Móna employees worked hard on bogs, in all weathers and some got into bad health, approximately £5 million was wasted in architects' fees for drawing up plans for a briquette factory which was never built.  It proves that money can be wasted notwithstanding the problems of Bord na Móna.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>One must be careful to ensure that money is not wasted.  If the Comptroller and Auditor General had greater powers wastage could be prevented.</P>
      <P>The present Government has appointed many consultants and I believe that is a policy matter.  However, before a consultant is appointed he or she should be given a specific brief and should then be paid a specific fee for a specific job. We do not want consultants for the sake of it.  Many of the people who founded this State and who set up its administration had no more than primary school education.  They built a great State by the use of commonsense, the greatest asset of all.  Many consultants lack basic common sense because they are spending other people's money.  A close watch should be kept on how money is spent.  I ask the Minister to be careful how money is spent.  I support the Bill, although I have reservations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  As we all know, the Houses of the Oireachtas and, in particular the Dáil, have clear responsibilities under the Constitution which both Houses jointly exercise on behalf of the people of Ireland.  Constitutional responsibilities include the making and breaking of Government, making Government behave, making law, making treaties for war and peace <Col N="34" /> and, most important, for the public purse.  It would not be an overstatement to say that both Houses fulfil their constitutional responsibilities precariously. It would also be no exaggeration to say that the responsibility with regard to the control of the public purse is ignored.</P>
      <P>This Bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation we will deal with this term.  One of the most important constitutional functions with which this Bill deals is the way this nation, the Houses of the Oireachtas and, more particularly, the Dáil which has prime responsibility for finance, controls the public purse.  It is extraordinary that as the original legislation was passed before the foundation of the State, it has taken so long to do what this Bill has done. Therefore, the Bill is welcome.</P>
      <P>Volumes could be written about how poorly the nation's financial management and overseeing functions are performed. The brucellosis and the TB eradication schemes are only the tip of the iceberg.  If one reads the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General over the years, one will find many more tips of icebergs. These are only the pinnacle of huge ice mountains which float by unnoticed under the morass of public expenditure.</P>
      <P>The Minister said this is an important Bill because it expands the powers of an important office.  We endorse that view. It is a valuable move forward and I welcome and support it.  However, I believe there are other areas which require attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures in this Bill will need to be bolstered in the public accounting system and in the way this House and the Dáil operate.  Reforms are needed, particularly in the way public expenditure is accounted for and in the way the Dáil and the Seanad oversee that expenditure. It is worth reminding ourselves of the present arrangements.  At present, the Appropriation Accounts are returned to the Comptroller and Auditor General in the spring of every year.  They account for billions of pounds of public expenditure, which is dealt with by thousands of bodies and by hundreds of thousands of public servants.  It is an extraordinary task for <Col N="35" /> the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office to undertake each spring.  The Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff examine these accounts and report their findings in October, when a parliamentary organ &mdash; the Committee of Public Accounts &mdash; meets.</P>
    <P>I endorse the comments made by Senator Enright.  The Committee of Public Accounts has come a long way in recent years.  I do not think there has been enough public recognition of how it has progressed under the chairmanship of Deputy G. Mitchell in recent times and a number of his immediate predecessors. There were brave and courageous attempts to extend the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General which the media did not always acknowledge, recognise or even support.  I will refer to two of those occasions in a moment.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts consists of 12 Members of the Dáil who spend the months of November and December overseeing or examining the accounts, with the assistance of the Comptroller and Auditor General and with the benefit of the Comptroller and Auditor General's examination.  The audit of the public accounts is only scratching the surface, in spite of the enthusiasm and energy which is put into that task both by the Comptroller and Auditor General and by the Committee of Public Accounts.  It does not even scratch the veneer because public expenditure has become so complex, so universal, so extraordinarily multi-faceted that it is a virtually insuperable challenge for any individual group of public servants or small individual committee of the Oireachtas to oversee what has been done.  Extraordinarily challenges, hurdles and obstacles have been put in the way of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General, to hinder them in the performance of their tasks.</P>
    <P>Historically, the Comptroller and Auditor General, with the assistance of the Accounting Officer, sought to ensure that there had been numerical accuracy in the accounts and that the money had <Col N="36" /> been spent for the purposes for which it had been allocated by the Dáil.  There were no examples of deliberate and specific fraud or of money having been removed.  Also the Comptroller and Auditor General ensured that money was spent for the appropriate accounting period.  Efficiency and effectiveness were only introduced in recent times and only because Comptrollers and Auditors Gerneral took it upon themselves to expand their role.  They did so without any legislative support from either House.  This is to the shame of both Houses, in particular the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General's role has been expanded in recent years because public servants have been willing to expand their role and they have done this without any specific guidance. This Bill is welcome because it seeks to provide guidance and a little legislative clarity where previously there was none. For example, for the first time the Bill gives statutory effect in the audit to economy, efficiency and effectiveness.  It is extraordinary that a State which receives and spends a large proportion of every individual's earnings has not, until recently, been overly concerned with economy, efficiency or effectiveness.  It is even more extraordinary that it was not until 1993, almost 75 years since the foundation of the State, that we decided to deal with economy, efficiency and effectiveness on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>However, to fully implement the Bill's proposals it will be necessary to do more than give the Comptroller and Auditor General a statutory role with regard to efficiency, economy and effectiveness. That statutory role must be supported by a radical and dramatic change in our public accounting system.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows&mdash;she and I laboured in the musty confines of the Department of Finance &mdash; that the public accounting system is a farce.  No chip shop in the land is as badly run from an accountancy point of view as Ireland Incorporated.  A colleague in UCD often refers to the present accounting system as shoebox accounting.  It is based on a historical year and has a one year perspective.  In recent <Col N="37" /> years the Department of Finance introduced multi-annual programming.  However, the statutory basis of our accounting system is historical, non-accrual accounting which went out with the ark. I doubt if Noah and his team would have had a more inept management system in operation at accountancy level than Ireland Incorporated because, if they had, they would never have found their way to Mount Aravat.</P>
    <P>It is bizarre that we have no method of totting-up programmes and that we are still operating a nineteenth century Victorian accountancy model.  It will be necessary, if this Bill is to be effective and the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office is to have the impact we wish, to look at the Victorian accounting system. Victorian notions and the concept of an annual budget will have to be dispelled. It is farcical for the Minister for Finance to tell us, over a period of three to four hours, about financial auguries for the year ahead.  All public accounting programmes are multi-annual and they work on an accrual basis.  The nonsensical British Victorian model of public accountancy &mdash; which the British have done away with &mdash; should not be in operation. We need to support and augment the worthwhile provisions contained in this Bill by introducing an accounting system which approximates to the cost accounting systems operating in business.</P>
    <P>Given recent publicity Irish business is hardly a model of financial propriety or accountability.  However, modern business accounting systems have a lot to offer the public service and public administration. We need to augment the provisions of the Bill in that area.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a number of specific elements contained in the Bill.  The proposition is that non-commercial State-sponsored bodies are to be brought within the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General but commercial State-sponsored bodies will remain outside his remit.  This interests me both academically and personally because of my role as a public servant for many years. If we think about it and put other changes into operation the balance is probably <Col N="38" /> right.  I welcome the idea that non-commercial State-sponsored bodies are being brought within the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is astonishing what non-commercial State-sponsored bodies have got away with over the last 50 to 70 years.  It is bizarre. They have operated without any of the control mechanisms which apply to the Civil Service and local government because they were deliberately set up to avoid such control mechanisms.</P>
    <P>Non-commercial State-sponsored bodies were not overseen by the democratically elected local representatives.  In effect, they were cut free as budget based organisations and were actively encouraged to spend their budget.  No effective or efficient criteria were established and it was of no benefit to management in a non-commercial State-sponsored body to ensure economy.  It is important that the scandal of non-accountability existing in non-commercial State-sponsored bodies is brought to an end.  This Bill does that and I welcome this move forward.  It is bizarre that the Houses of the Oireachtas have never bothered to address the issue of non-accountability of non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  Fifteen years ago when the Committee of State-sponsored Bodies was set-up it focused entirely on commercial State-sponsored bodies which had the benefit of a market mechanism to show if they were efficient or inefficient but the non-commercial State-sponsored bodies were excluded. This exclusion has continued despite the fact that I and my predecessors, as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies, asked that this issue be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces inspection and I endorse this important move.  We need to open public institutions, not just from the point of view of democratic control but from the point of view of overall management control.  We must convince the people that public institutions are being run economically, efficiently, effectively and for the benefit of the people who pay for them rather than for the benefit of a minority who work in them. In an article I wrote in 1981 about the <Col N="39" /> idea of an Ombudsman, I mentioned the need for inspection.  The introduction of statutory inspection is welcome and is a dramatic move forward.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that we should look further into the area of inspection. Inspection needs to be expanded to local government.  Power of inspection should flow not only to the Comptroller and Auditor General but to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I realise that this will be dealt with in the other House by way of motion when the terms of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts are being reviewed.  However, it is appropriate to comment on this issue now.</P>
    <P>Some years ago when the Committee of Public Accounts travelled to Merrion Road to inspect premises which had been rented for many years by the then Department of Posts and Telegraphs, they were met on the doorstep by the chief executive officer of Telecom Éireann, who had been occupying the premises, and were refused admission.  I recall wearing an academic hat on a RTE programme that day and saying that in no democracy would a committee of the Houses of Parliament be turned away. The extraordinary thing was that every commentator in the land thought that it was fun to turn away a parliamentary committee and that these TDs were getting their come-uppance.  Nobody seemed to realise that the Members were looking after our interests.</P>
    <P>The concept of statutory inspection is a new and welcome move forward.  Those involved in its implementation are to be complimented.  I suggest that if the inspection is to be provided for the Comptroller and Auditor General on a statutory basis, we should ensure that committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas have powers of inspection.</P>
    <P>There has been a dramatic change in the way the Committee of Public Accounts has fulfilled its responsibilities in recent years.  This is largely due to the enthusiasm and energy of Deputy G. Mitchell, and a number of his immediate predecessors as chairman.  They pushed out the boat and have expanded the role <Col N="40" /> of the committee.  Given the willingness of its Members to work long hours, it is extraordinary that the committee has not been adequately acknowledged.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the revised terms of reference because under existing arrangements we accept the need for change, for example, the need to have the right to engage consultants, etc.  It was amazing to hear during the last Dáil that the Committee of Public Accounts could not engage consultants.  They need to have the right, as do all committees, to compel witness to attend meetings and give evidence.  We have a constitutional problem in relation to subpoening witnesses to come before committees.  This is an important point because the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General can only be taken one step further by the Committee of Public Accounts.  If the hands of the Committee of Public Accounts are tied and if it, therefore, lacks power, a lot of the good work which could flow from this Bill will not be possible.</P>
    <P>The committee must have equal powers to the High Court in relation to subpoening witnesses and it must receive an adequate budget.  It is a farce that for a couple of days in Dublin Castle, the powdered gentry of the legal profession receive more funding than the operation of all the Oireachtas Committees for last year and the year before.  That is not an exaggeration.  We struggled last year with a budget of £40,000 in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies.  As the Minister knows, it is difficult to buy a lot of consultancy time or accounting expertise for £40,000.  Nevertheless, that particular committee, like the Committee of Public Accounts, was charged with the task of overseeing thousands of millions of pounds worth of assets and expenditure.  Our powers were very restricted.  We had no power to <i>subpoena</i> witnesses, no power to compel witnesses and we could list from here to eternity the number of occasions where witnesses refused to co-operate.  Furthermore, we had no budget to perform our task.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> There needs to be a change in attitude to both Houses to committees.  It has become fashionable to talk of parliamentary reform.  I suggest that parliamentary reform is a leaky vessel as it has recently been restructured and relaunched.  It is not going to get very far because the parliamentary environment in which we operate is unique.  The PR single transferable seat system means that it is not profitable politically for Members of both Houses, either those who aspire to break out of this Chamber and move to the other House or those in the other House who wish to stay there, to invest their time in committee work.  I do not mean it is not financially profitable, because some inducements are currently being introduced in that respect. However, it is not politically profitable.</P>
    <P>I admire members of the Committee of Public Accounts who have no particular career interest, academic or professional, in it, and yet give immense amounts of their time.  They are not rewarded with praise or recognition.  The reality is the committee system will only work if there is political reward for attendance.</P>
    <P>Another aspect about the committee system urgently requires attention.  This is the scandal whereby neither this House nor the other House pays any attention to the reports produced by the committees. Currently, for example, when the Committee of Public Accounts produces a report and makes comments on it, the comments are sent to the Minister for Finance.  The Minister, by way of ministerial note, replies to the incoming committee the following year indicating the response of his Department or other Departments.  There is no test in the Dáil as to whether the proposals contained in the report of the Committee of Public Accounts are implemented.  In fact the Dáil very seldom discusses the reports of that committee.</P>
    <P>If we are to introduce a committee system, and I am a supporter of such a system, it will have to be a part of continuing reforms that will start and end with electoral reform.  A reform that will certainly have to be introduced is some form of compulsion to discuss the reports <Col N="42" /> of the committees.  I welcome the fact that there will be more time on Fridays for that activity.</P>
    <P>Regarding the exclusion of local authorities, I can understand the division between the local authority accounts and the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  However, I put it to the Minister that the black hole of Calcutta was a more enlightening place than the accounts of our local authorities.  I have been a member of a local authority since the mid-1990s and I have never ceased to be amazed at the ingenuity with which these accounts are produced.  The Minister has also been a member of a local authority and like me she knows that among the more impenetrable things produced in this or any other State, almost Kafkaesque in dimension, are the accounts and the estimates of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to ascertain from local officials the cost of a local government project.  If they do not want you to have the figure, you will not have the figure. Motions come before my local authority asking for the erection of traffic lights and we are told the cost of this will be £20,000.  However, when the manager wants to do something of equal complexity the cost turns out to be £1,000. How have the figures shifted around thus?  I do not know.</P>
    <P>This point illustrates the need for inspection, which is one of the great tools that has been introduced in this Bill. There should be a system of inspection introduced in the local authorities system.  I will break a confidence.  I have spoken to the last three Ministers for the Environment and I have asked them to establish a team of auditors who can be on call to inspect the programme of any local authority on the grounds of efficiency, economy and effectiveness. Such a team would pay for itself tenfold in the first year.</P>
    <P>There have been many occasions when, as a local authority member, and I have lectured for 15 years in local government finance, I have tried unsuccessfully to establish exactly the cost effectiveness of local authority programmes. <Col N="43" /> Whether the inspection would be part of concomitant change in the local government audit, or whether it would happen under the aegis of the Comptroller and Auditor General would not matter so long as an inspection was introduced. Not only should this inspection force be established but it should be allowed to be called into place by motion of local authority members.  That would give back some concept of local accountability.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the Bill provides for the first time a statutory basis for the performance by accounting officers of their duties when they are presenting evidence of the Committee of Public Accounts. There has been no statutory arrangement governing this, and I welcome this provision specifically because of my own experience over the last couple of years in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  I want to consider this in conjunction with statements made by Senator Enright regarding the exclusion of State-Sponsored bodies by giving the House an example of how deficient the present system is.</P>
    <P>At present there are no guidelines on witnesses appearing before the joint committees of both Houses and the Committee of Public Accounts.  There have been many extraordinary examples of committees getting the two fingers from public servants.  Senator Enright refers specifically to the Greencore issue.  I believe that if the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies had got an ounce of co-operation, as opposed to a huge amount of interference, from the then chief executive of the Sugar Company in 1989, when we were conducting an examination of the affairs of that company, then what became known as the Greencore scandal would have been public knowledge much earlier.  I have believed since that time that there was a deliberate effort, which was successful, to sabotage the efforts of the then Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies to ensure that the committee was deflected from the examination of the <Col N="44" /> affairs of the Sugar Company.  I wrote letters as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies to each member of the board of the Sugar Company.  Mr. Comerford destroyed all those letters and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies had no power to deal with him.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of public record, in the Houses of the Oireachtas that when we finally browbeat the Sugar Company into representing itself before the committee we were met by Mr. Tully, Mr. Comerford and Mr. Cahill and, to say the least, they would not have won any medals for co-operation.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, charges which were made against my predecessor, Deputy Lawlor, led to his resigning his chairmanship of that committee and the information on which those charges were proved to be erroneously based emanated from the Sugar Company.  This indicates something seriously wrong in the way public servants perform before Oireachtas committees.  All of these issues were the subject of a special report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.  It is extraordinary that that report was never examined in either House.  Some years later the Greencore issue burst upon the scene.  This might be seen as a good argument for bringing in State-sponsored bodies under the scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>I am not impressed by the way commercial auditors have operated in the case of commercial State-sponsored bodies.  I have seen over the years some quite extraordinary examples of failures by these commercial auditors.  They are not answerable to anybody and may be appointed on the basis that they play golf with the chairman of the board of the State-sponsored body or in some other way that is hidden from us ordinary mortals. We do not know how or why they are appointed and there are myriad examples of their failure.  This whole process needs to be tightened up.  I understand why the Bill has not taken the step of bringing the commercial State-sponsored bodies <Col N="45" /> under the control of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I would suggest that we strictly monitor the way the commercial auditors operate.  They are not giving value for taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright spoke about the Aer Lingus Holidays issue.  For a year and a half the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies wished to look into that matter but was completely impotent.  It had no power to pursue the matter once it could be declared <i>sub judice.</i>  Both Houses need to look closely at the way they operate the <i>sub judice</i> ruling and how that contains Members.</P>
    <P>The issue of the commercial State-sponsored bodies, their accountability and the way we examine their performance requires urgent review.  If the House is serious about parliamentary reform it might consider the report of the sixth Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies examining how the role of that committee could be expanded to allow it to perform more efficiently.</P>
    <P>There has been a whole series of scandals in the State-sponsored bodies over the years, for example, the Irish Shipping scandal&mdash;there is no other way to describe it.  That company had operated profitably virtually from the end of the war.  The employees of that company worked hard and performed well.  The company went down not due to any failure on behalf of the ordinary workers, but as a result of a catastrophic failure of management.  The tragedy in that case&mdash; I might be in agreement with Senator Enright&mdash;was that nobody knew until it was too late that Irish Shipping was sunk. Had there been a proper, efficient management service and a proper system of control and inspection in operation, that need not have happened.  Yet it did happen and there were commercial auditors in that company who knew what was happening.  This débâcle did not happen overnight but over a period of 12 to 18 months.  Something could and should have been done.  Had there been an efficient management system&mdash;I mean a supervision system&mdash;it would not have <Col N="46" /> happened.  The question of how commercial auditors perform in the State-sponsored bodies needs to be looked at. Greencore and Telecom Éireann, among others, are unedifying examples of failure.</P>
    <P>I had better end on a positive note or everyone will look carefully at their PAYE deductions and think that more of their money is going down the drain. I accept it is not possible to resolve all problems at once.  Government has become so complex and multifaceted and it cannot solve all our problems at once. This Bill is an honest effort to solve some serious problems and I commend it.  I look forward to Committee Stage debate.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State well.  She is an old colleague from the Department of Finance.  The Minister of State understands from the inside&mdash;we are both poachers turned gamekeepers&mdash;the inefficiencies of the system.  The Minister of State, probably worked in public expenditure division for longer than I did, so she has even more first hand experience of the inefficiencies of the system of managing our public expenditure programmes.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance has made good efforts&mdash;I have to say this because one never knows when one might have to fall back on them&mdash;over the past few years to move forward and modernise, for example, the programme budgets. This change is a good example but more needs to be done.  Work needs to be done in the Houses of the Oireachtas to complement the provisions of this Bill.  I wish the Minister and the Bill well.</P>

      <P>The contributions from Senators were extremely constructive.  There is a general consensus that getting better value for money is an aim shared by all sides in this House and in the other House.  We all want to ensure that we get the best system so that the taxpayer, who puts up the money, is given value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The day to day work of the Comptroller and Auditor General is not high profile but he and his staff do a good job.  As <Col N="47" /> Senator Roche and Senator Enright said, the work of the Committee of Public Accounts is often unsung but it is valuable. This Bill reflects the kind of donkey work done by the Committee of Public Accounts and reflects their thinking.  I would pay particular tribute to Deputy Gay Mitchell.  He pushed out the boat, so to speak, in terms of the work of that committee.</P>
    <P>The main point made in the debate has been the auditing of commercial State-sponsored bodies.  We all share a concern about issues where public money appears to have gone astray and they have been listed by the Members concerned. Senator Roche spoke about the difficulty of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies in getting people to appear before it and getting answers to questions.  This will be addressed.  The Government has given a commitment to legislate on privilege and compelling witnesses to appear in relation to all Oireachtas committees. That is at an advanced stage and is going before the Government in the next couple of weeks.  That will improve the situation.  The Director of Public Prosecutions has more than a passing interest in Aer Lingus Holidays.  However, there is a limit to the inspection an Oireachtas committee can carry out in this case.</P>
    <P>The general approach in the Bill is that it is the function of the Comptroller and Auditor General to report to the Dáil on non-commercial State bodies.  In the case of commercial State bodies, as with commercial bodies in the private sector, it is the duty of auditors to examine and report to the board of the company on efficiency, effectiveness, economy and whether any money has gone astray.  If the auditors fail in their duty they can be sued by the company concerned.</P>
    <P>The Department and the Minister responsible for appointing the board of a company should ensure it carries out its duties in overseeing the management of the company and ensure that there are procedures in place to review whether this has been done.  That is the most <Col N="48" /> appropriate way of dealing with this issue.  It is important that we do not end up having two Oireachtas Committees falling over themselves dealing with the same area.  The Parliamentary scrutiny undertaken by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies has been valuable, it is the appropriate committee to deal with these bodies.  The accounts of non-commercial State bodies are examined by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright referred to cost overruns on projects.  This is an issue to which the Comptroller and Auditor General has referred in the past.  He will have legal power under the Bill to examine such overruns.  He has very specific powers.  Senator Enright referred to the reports of regional development organisations. I am aware of the work done by the Eastern Regional Development Organisation when I was a member of Dublin County Council and I take on board the points made by the Senator.</P>
    <P>Section 12, which enables the Comptroller and Auditor General to charge fees, was referred to by Senator Enright.  At present he charges fees for some audits, although he does not have a specific statutory authority to do this. The purpose of section 12 is to grant him such authority.  It is not envisaged that Government Departments will be charged audit fees.  A private sector company provides for its audit fees in its financial accounts.  Section 12 enables the Comptroller and Auditor General to charge fees in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright asked who has responsibility for spending national lottery moneys.  These moneys are included in the Book of Estimates and are assigned to specific Departments.  The Comptroller and Auditor General can audit them when he is examining the accounts of the Department concerned; for example, amenity grants are administered by the Department of the Environment and the Accounting Officer for these moneys is the secretary of that Department.  The youth and sport grants funded by the national lottery are administered by the Department of Education.  The secretary <Col N="49" /> of that Department is the Accounting Officer for these moneys.  The power in the Bill to examine the expenditure of a body which receives more than 50 per cent of its funding from State sources gives a further power of inspection to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright raised a point in relation to the Leader programme.  This has been investigated by the Department of Agriculture.  The Leader funds undergo a double audit in that they are audited both by the European Court of Auditors and the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>The Government has not made a detailed decision in relation to the audit of the county enterprise partnership boards.  If they are development promotion bodies it is envisaged that they will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General; if they remain within the Civil Service they will be audited by the normal procedures.  It is open to the Minister under the Bill simply to add them to the Schedule.  No decision has yet been made because the proposals are being finalised at present.  We can discuss this on Committee and Report Stages if a clear decision has been made by then.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche referred to the need for radical and dramatic changes in the public accounting systems of both Central Government and local authorities.  I fully agree with him.  There are areas where it seems expenditure of £5 is assigned its own subhead, whereas expenditure involving sums like £300 million is covered by one block subhead.  This area certainly needs reform.  A joint working group representing the Department of Finance and the Comptroller and Auditor General is examining accounting procedures with a view to improving the relevance and extent of information given in the Government accounts.  I agree that the format of the Estimates needs to be improved so that they provide clear and relevant information.</P>
    <P>The format of local government accounts is laid down by the Department of the Environment.  Local authorities do not have any discretion except to prepare their accounts in this most impenetrable <Col N="50" /> way.  One of my responsibilities is to liaise with the Minister for the Environment in relation to local government reform. Change in accounting procedures is an area we can examine.  I would be glad to bring my experience to bear in trying to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of local authority accounts from the scope of the Bill was raised by Senator Roche.  The local Government auditors are also moving towards value for money auditing and improved reporting standards.  These developments are taking place in parallel with the reforms provided for in the Bill. The reports of the local government auditors are available to the Comptroller and Auditor General who can draw them to the attention of the Committee of Public Accounts.  This enables the Committee to examine at second hand the accounts of local authorities.  It is envisaged that in future there will be close liaison between the local government audit service and the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche referred to the role and performance of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies and its failure to deal effectively with certain issues.  I hope the reform of the committee system, including compulsory attendance of witnesses, will enable committees to function more effectively and prevent them from being thwarted in their work.  All Members of the House are concerned about money going astray or the taxpayer not receiving value for money.  We need procedures which ensure proper openness and accountability and that people who represent the public serve the public interest rather than their own.</P>
    <P>The work of the Comptroller and Auditor General has been characterised by independence and a commitment to public service.  The constitutional independence of this office has put him in a unique position to give an objective appraisal of integrity in public expenditure. We have been served well by those who have held this office.</P>
    <P>The extension in this Bill of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General to <Col N="51" /> cover questions of economy, efficiency and effectiveness of management will play an important role in building on the qualities of probity and integrity we expect from the public service.  This will be welcomed not least by public servants themselves who realise that under the Bill there will be ample opportunity for recognition and acknowledgement of good public administration.  When the Bill was discussed in the Dáil I moved an amendment giving the Comptroller and Auditor General the power to examine and recommend what he considers to be good standards of practice and draw comparisons. It is through such work that we gradually improve efficiency and effectiveness. I support what Senator Roche said in relation to publicity because it is through publicising the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts and highlighting areas where public money has gone astray that we increase vigilance everywhere, not least in the public sector. The Government, in bringing forward this Bill, are demonstrating a commitment to public accountability and to exposing the machinery of Government to more penetrative scrutiny.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford waste and inefficiency because of the demands on the public purse.  We cannot afford to have poor quality administration.  The aim should be to improve the standard of accountability, efficiency and value for money throughout the public service. However, in every large organisation, there will inevitably be areas where there is scope for significant improvement in the application of modern methods. Changing demands and technology mean that no organisation can remain static. While the legislation, as Senator Enright said, has served us well in the past and, indeed, stood the test of time reasonably well, it is time that we brought the Comptroller and Auditor General's powers a stage further.  These are the new powers involved in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Underlying the change which organisations must make, there is one area which is extremely important and that <Col N="52" /> is the application of good management. Management should be aware of the implications of what is happening in the wider world.  Organisations in the public sector need to be able, as an ongoing process, to appraise the effectiveness of their operations.  This appraisal should be such as to allow them to anticipate problems and opportunities so they may take timely action.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche spoke about what happened in Irish Shipping.  This Bill will subject systems and their effectiveness to the examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  He would look at the systems, for example, in the Department of the Marine for monitoring the board so that we would not have a recurrence of that kind of situation.  It goes beyond simply auditing whether the money was spent to buy ships that proved to be poor value for money.  He would examine the effectiveness of the procedures used to decide if the purchase was sensible, whether the Department of the Marine was in touch with the board and if the board was in touch with commercial reality.  That is the kind of role envisaged for examining effectiveness.  There would be a follow through on issues like that.  It does not cover semi-State bodies.  The concept of effectiveness is to see what systems are in place in Departments to enable them to monitor the bodies and their aegis.</P>
    <P>In examining management effectiveness, the Comptroller and Auditor General will have a new and important role in ensuring that public service organisations have proper management systems in place.  It is not necessary or appropriate for the Comptroller and Auditor General to have a direct involvement in the appraisal of effectiveness itself.  The Bill's procedure in this area follows the Canadian formula.  Good administration is the responsibility of the management of the bodies.  The role of the Comptroller and Auditor General is to examine and report on how that responsibility is carried out.  The new role of the Comptroller and Auditor General in this area will, I am sure, be effective in heightening awareness among public <Col N="53" /> service managers of the need to be responsive to changing demands.</P>
    <P>Following the Dáil debate, where many of the points made today were also made, I spoke to people involved in auditing to get a viewpoint as to where the appropriate balance would be between a public audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the auditors employed by the semi-State bodies themselves. The reply I received was that if an auditor is doing his job correctly, that the auditor's duty might lead him to go even further than the Comptroller and Auditor General in spotting problems within a semi-State organisation.  As bodies with a commercial mandate, they should be following normal commercial practice and if their auditors are not doing their job, they can be sacked or sued.  Auditing practice should also be reviewed to see how well it is working.  The board should ensure that they are getting the best audit service.  There is no shortage of good commercial audit practice if it is required. I listened to the points made in the Dáil debate and I followed them up and took advice.  That is the advice I received and I am happy with the balance in the Bill as to who will audit in the various areas.</P>
    <P>I look forward to Committee Stage. We had constructive Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil and I was in a position to take on board some amendments and suggest some amendments of my own which improved the draft of the text.  The contributions on Second Stage have been constructive and I look forward to similar contributions from Members on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. Calnan) Acting Chairman (Mr. Calnan)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Calnan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department <Col N="54" /> of Health, Deputy O'Dea.  I call Senator Norris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann pledges support for the Government and the Minister for Health in pursuing the most active campaign to contain the spread of the HIV infection, including measures to ensure open access to clear, specific, explicit and factual information on methods of transmission, availability of condoms to sexually active young people and support for the expansion of the free needle exchange programme.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister.  I would have given an even stronger welcome to the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, because I address some of my remarks personally to him, but I am aware of the Minister of State's seriousness concerning this matter.</P>
      <P>This is a serious debate on an urgent and important problem in Irish society. The motion is deliberately framed to avert conflict on a party political basis.  I am pleased that the Government side decided not to amend or oppose this motion.  For this reason the terms of the motion commend the direction of Government policy and urges Government to move rapidly in an already existing direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fitting that such a motion should come before this House as it was in the Seanad the first debate in either of the Houses of the Oireachtas was held three or four years ago on the subject of AIDS. I remember the seriousness with which this debate was conducted on all sides.  In particular, I remember the then Senator Katharine Bulbulia who, in a remarkable and moving contribution, stated that as a Roman Catholic, a mother of children, convent educated and living in a rural constituency, she found the issues of human sexuality involved difficult and embarrassing to discuss in the kind of explicit detail required.  Nevertheless, she felt a responsibility as a mother to her children and the other children of the nation to overcome this embarrassment <Col N="55" /> and to speak as clearly, factually and explicitly as the situation required.  If she could overcome her embarrassment, she asked rhetorically if the Government, charged with the responsibility for the lives and well-being of young people, could do any less?  That question remains pertinent today.</P>
    <P>I have framed one element of this motion in terms of information, but information of itself is not sufficient.  An intensive media campaign is needed to refer clearly to the existence of AIDS in our community as a major problem and to provide explicit information for all sections of the community on how to avoid infection.  The motion refers also to the need for easier availability of condoms although I recognise that this is an area which is being muddied by religious intervention.  Such intervention may be well meant but it is certainly misguided.</P>
    <P>In an experiment in a serious and scientifically validated Swiss study, vending machines for condoms were placed deliberately in locations to which the public had access and in particular where young people congregated.  The survey was conducted over three years with a substantial follow up.  It indicated, first, that the availability of condoms did not encourage young people to become sexually active at a younger age than they otherwise would have done and, second, it did not encourage young people to have more sexual partners than they otherwise would have.  However, it did encourage those who were already sexually active to use condoms.  It was interesting to note in this survey that there was a higher uptake of condoms among young females than males.</P>
    <P>I repeat something I said in the earlier debate.  I would be surprised to learn of a young person becoming sexually excited by the prospect of a piece of limp rubber.  I am quite certain sexually active young people are entitled to the fullest protection available, especially access to condoms.  Of course the availability of condoms is not sufficient unless accompanied by a well targeted educational campaign.  For example, in <Col N="56" /> Ireland more women become infected through heterosexual contact than men. Figure indicate that for heterosexual women the rate is approximately one instance of infection for 500 sexual acts and for gay men one in 300.  Women and passive partners in homosexual relations are more inclined biologically to contract the disease venereally.  Therefore a proper life skills preparation for women and young gay adolescents is needed so they may have the confidence to negotiate sexual practices and to be assertive in maintaining their individual right to engage only in safe sexual relations.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the information programme embarked upon by the Departments of Health and Education I am somewhat concerned about the focus of these programmes.  For example, the Federation of Irish Employers, now part of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation submitted its new guidelines to the Health Promotion Unit of the Department of Health for comment.  The Federation suggested the unit should refer to the significant role condoms play in inhibiting transmission of the infection. Yet I understand the wording of the forthcoming poster prepared by the Health Promotion Unit states that condoms can reduce the risk of transmission. Why does this not indicate what the unit knows to be the case, that condoms significantly reduce the risk of infection?</P>
    <P>It is also interesting that of the two posters currently in preparation the first transmits a generic message: &ldquo;Think positive; stay negative&rdquo;.  The visual image is a negative print of a photograph of a crowd scene.  The general proposition is effective and useful.  The second poster targets heterosexuals alone with its message and visual impact.  The Department has never produced, as far as I am aware, any information targeting gay men specifically.  This is at least a highly dangerous omission.  If one were to seek a siniter motivation the omission indicates the existence of official neglect and perhaps an element of discrimination.</P>
    <P>There has been a 20 per cent increase last year of newly registered infections among gay men.  Among the 74 newly <Col N="57" /> reported cases of HIV infection which was sexually transmitted, 41 occurred in gay men and 33 in heterosexuals.  There are 243 HIV positive gay men, 175 heterosexuals. In England, shamefully, a mere 2 per cent of the AIDS budget has been spent on the education programme for gay men.  I ask the Minister if he has any information regarding comparative figures on per capita spending on prevention especially in relation to gay men in England as compared to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the rôle of the National Aids Strategy Committee.  This was convened in December 1991 to draft recommendations on how best to approach the challenges posed by HIV and AIDS in the Irish context.  It focussed on four main areas, prevention, health care and management, discrimination and epidemiology. The committee's representations were presented to the Minister for Health on 13 April 1992.  The committee has not met since that date, as far as I know. Many members of the committee have expressed concern about communication procedures.  In one glaring example, in June of last year the then Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, announced the abolition of the post of national AIDS co-ordinator and stated that the NASC would oversee the area in future.  The first knowledge members of the committee received of this was when the announcements were made in the media.  No meeting of the committee was called then or since that time.  This must be rectified urgently.</P>
    <P>An independent and representative body of experts must be appointed to overview the implementation of NASC recommendations without further delay. This group should comprise of one representative from each of the non-statutory and statutory agencies working in the field of HIV and AIDS in Ireland. This would amount to approximately 15 people.  Groups should not be overloaded with civil servants who are answerable to the respective Ministers and as a result are not always seen as independent observers: the Commission on the Status of Women, the Ombudsman and the Advertising Standards Commission are <Col N="58" /> appropriate models.  In addition to monitoring the recommendations of the NASC, this body could make other appropriate recommendations from time to time.</P>
    <P>During the budget debate the Minister for Health stated that he would introduce any NASC recommendations on a phased basis.  The independent body could prioritise these recommendations objectively and, based on quarterly review consultations with the Minister and the National AIDS co-ordinator, oversee the proper executive of these measures.  Implicit in what I say here is the necessity for the re-establishment of the post of national AIDS co-ordinator. In this context I pay tribute to the remarkable work courageously undertaken without fear of political repercussions by Dr. James Walsh.</P>
    <P>My call for the re-establishment of the post of national AIDS co-ordinator is neither controversial nor partisan. Should anybody instance the question of budgetary constraints in funding such an independent body and the position of national co-ordinator, let me remind the House that the cost involved would be minimal compared to the average annual cost of £17,000 which a symptomatically ill person with HIV infection incurs to the Exchequer.  However, Government, although frequently wily, is not always wise in making economies.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly indicated the vital necessity for the re-establishment of the Hirschfeld Centre which was previously so extraordinarily effective in combating the spread of HIV infection in the gay community.  On several occasions I informed the House about the experience of the Danish Government which made 750,000 Kroner available to the gay community in Denmark for its AIDS programme. A capital grant of 1.5 million Kroner was given for the establishment of a gay community centre in the heart of Copenhagen.  The Irish gay community was uniquely responsible for releasing the energy which led to the revival of the Temple Bar area, yet it alone of all groups in society is being systematically deprived of assistance.  Such an attitude <Col N="59" /> is shameful and discriminatory and ought not to be continued by present Government.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the many heroic people living with HIV and AIDS who have, by their example, demonstrated how the human spirit survives in adversity.  I think in particular of a valued friend of mine who, in the early days of the Hirschfeld Centre, ably assisted us both in the running of the discotheque and in providing counselling services to distressed gay people.  From his hospital bed he has organised a group called Comfort AIDS which seeks to ensure that hospital patients with HIV, regardless of how they contracted the infection, receive sufficient practical assistance to enable them to continue their stay in hospital with an appropriate degree of dignity and comfort. I salute this true nobility of the human spirit and recommend such a humane attitude to those in Government charged with the responsibility to make decisions that so vitally affect the wellbeing of our community.  I also pay tribute to the various organisations working on a voluntary basis and in particular to the work of Ger Philpott and AIDSWISE.</P>
    <P>The reasons given by senior civil servants for not advising safe sex for gay men is because sexual relations between males remains a criminal offence in this country.  Figures from the World Health Organisation clearly indicate the AIDS virus is transmitted in 70 per cent of cases by straightforward heterosexual intercourse; in the remaining 30 per cent transmission is by use of intravenous drugs, mother to infant transmission, incidental transmission through blood products and homosexual relations. Nevertheless the rates of infection in the gay community remain a cause for concern, especially in western countries. Moreover, the WHO has urgently called for decriminalisation of sexual activity between consenting males and equal ages of consent, not as a moral issue but simply as a health measure.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that political inactivity has contributed to the spread of disease in this country.  However, I <Col N="60" /> cannot find it in my heart to blame the present Minister who has shown energy and insight and I hope that these qualities will endure throughout his tenure as Minister.</P>
    <P>In our last debate it was said that we needed somebody with the drive, energy and compassionate commitment of Dr. Noel Browne, who successfully combated the scourge of TB in the late 1940s. I believe that Deputy Howlin has these qualities and I hope I will be proved right.</P>
    <P>Gay Health Action published a document in 1989 showing levels of unsafe sexual practices among gay men.  The Government did not act.  It was not until 1992 that the Eastern Health Board published similar data.  One must ask why the Government waited impotently on the sidelines for three years and why the issue of the gay community is not yet sufficiently addressed.  I welcome the recent recommendation for desegregation of HIV positive prisoners in our jails but the authorities still refuse to make condoms available to inmates citing criminal law in support of this evasion of reality.  This is shameful.</P>
    <P>There has traditionally been a focus on the spread of AIDS among intravenous drug users.  This emphasis is appropriate but should not be exclusive.  It is appropriate because the drug community forms a lethal bridge to the mainstream community. However, the drug problem should be addressed as a specific and separate problem which has, of course, an AIDS component.  It should be treated comprehensively with a separate budget that does not drain resources away from other areas.  We should establish a mobile unit as an arm of the free needle exchange to visit those areas to which the socially volatile drug community habitually resorts in order to provide clean needles and remove infected ones for destruction.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that alcohol is a drug and is a major factor in the transmission of the disease.  Various eminent authorities, including Derek Freedman, have repeatedly indicated that when a major sporting event occurs in Ireland there is a subsequent significant <Col N="61" /> increase in self-referrals to the STD clinics and in the incidence of STD.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Department of Education should be prominently involved in this area.  I appreciate the work done in this area by two courageous women ministers: the previous Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, and the present Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach. The latter is to be congratulated on the factsheet distributed to post-primary students which frankly outlines the four principal routes of infection: (1) sexual, (2) blood products, (3) mother to child and (4) intravenous drug use.  It is welcome that young people should be so informed.</P>
    <P>We need, however, a better base of factual information on the epidemiology of AIDS if we are to mount an effective campaign against the disease.  There has, for far too long, been a simple focus on AIDS and death.  Perhaps the most significant figures are those in relation not just to full-blown AIDS but to the prevalence of HIV infection which would indicate the developing epidemiology of the virus.  For example, figures on the spread of the disease are not available with a gender and age breakdown.  We need to know how the situation is developing in order to target more effectively those groups at greatest risk.</P>
    <P>Theoretically based mathematical models for the epidemiology of the virus have failed and this failure has given rise to unjustified optimism about the future course of the disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, however, the future course of the development of the epidemic largely depends on our capacity to influence positively the pattern of sexual behaviour.  The editorial in <i>The <Col N="62" /> Lancet</i> of 3 April last year stated quite categorically that, despite the failure of the mathematical model and the consequent desire on the part of the British authorities not to face reality, if we do not act now as if there may be a heterosexual epidemic then there certainly will be one.</P>
      <P>There is no cure for AIDS nor is there likely to be one in the near to medium term.  AZT has, sadly, been demonstrated to be little more than placebo. A year or so ago I attended a lecture by Professor Luc Montagnier, of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, who discovered the AIDS virus.  His contention was that HIV infection remains at its initial low level of concentration in the blood stream for a considerable time before converting to full blown AIDS.  The mechanism which triggers the rapid increase in production of the virus is not yet fully understood but when this bio-medical nut is cracked it may then be possible to intervene with drug or chemical treatment to inhibit the triggering mechanism, thereby preventing conversion from HIV positive status to full-blown AIDS.  As a result AIDS would become a disease like diabetes in which the patient would remain infected but control the illness to a satisfactory level on a constant basis.</P>
      <P>In fact, I believe that as the situation develops we will see not an AIDS epidemic but an HIV epidemic.  The incubation period is lengthening all the time &mdash;ten, 11, 12, 20 years.  We do not understand yet the natural history of this disease. Even our figures for HIV infection currently are more like notional figures and represent a gross underestimate because they derive from link testing, something my colleague, Senator Henry will explain in greater detail.  It is imperative that we develop an efficient methodology of response.  AIDS, after all, may be only the first in a series of retro-viruses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Disease challenges the <i>status quo</i> and, therefore, presents a uncomfortable dilemma for the bureaucracies involved. I will give one example from my own experience.  A friend of mine, Jim Foster, whom I have known for over 20 years, <Col N="63" /> was recently appointed health supervisor for the City of San Francisco.  Because of Irish connections, his admiration for the work done in Ireland principally by the gay community in terms of AIDS and perhaps also his friendship with myself, he offered to make available free of charge £500,000 worth of aerosolised pentamidine which unlike AZT is undoubtedly effective and, used as a preemptive measure, can inhibit the development of pneumocystis cariniae in HIV positive patients.  This extraordinary act of generosity was frustrated by the inability of the Irish health bureaucracy to respond appropriately.</P>
    <P>In summary, I wish to make some further specific recommendations.  First, an executive group should be established to implement policy on an integrated basis; second, civil servants should no longer be placed in the invidious position of making ultimate decisions in this area; third, a proper and distinct AIDS budget should be immediately established by Government; fourth, since it will not be economic to continue to rely on hospital services for the treatment of HIV positive patients, GPs must become educated and involved in the area; and finally, education is the most important element. Educational programmes must be sustained, and I quote Dr. James Walsh speaking recently in Cork: &ldquo;Frenetic efforts from time to time do not work. There must be a sustained campaign.&rdquo; Moveover, in terms of sex education we cannot keep telling people only what they cannot do in their sexual lives.  We must explain what they can do, and this means a clear, factual, explicit and easily understandable safe sex campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the fact that the present Minister for Health seems to have revitalised his Department's flagging interest in the campaign on AIDS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of our most serious public health problems.  It is generally recognised that AIDS and HIV infection are grossly under-reported, not just here but internationally.  I have figures for the <Col N="64" /> most recent reporting of cases dated 19 March 1993.  France has reported 22,939 cases to date while the entire Russian Federation has reported 111.  With all due respect to the Communist system and the tremendous control it had over people, I suggest there is some curious under-reporting there, and that figures should be based on the incidence of either AIDS or the HIV virus.</P>
    <P>I will begin with the free needle exchange programme.  We have done well in Dublin with the free needle exchange programmes.  In Dublin the incidence of the HIV virus among drug abusers is about 20 per cent.  This is a figure with which many large cities in Europe and North America would be pleased.  This is a great tribute not just to the staff who work in these clinics but also to the Eastern Health Board, of which I was a member when this was discussed quite some time ago.  A similar programme had been set up in Liverpool which appeared to be successful, so the board took a practical decision rather than looking for the Utopia we all wish existing in the city, and decided because of the high incidence of intravenous drug abuse to set up these clinics.</P>
    <P>Addicts come to the clinics because they do not want to be infected with the HIV virus.  The clinics also try to get those who wish to get off drugs involved in suitable programmes and, from the public health point of view, it enables them to encourage drug addicts to lead a healthier life.  It is well known that poor general health is a co-factor in the development of AIDS in people with an HIV infection.</P>
    <P>It is essential, however, that there should be clinics near addicts' homes.  It is no good having large numbers of addicts in one or two centres around the city.  There are seven exchange sites at present but there should be more.  It is important that these centres are easily accessible for addicts for the reasons I have given&mdash;not just the prevention of HIV infection but getting them off drugs if they wish and trying to improve the general state of their health.  We can also encourage them to register with a GP&mdash;<Col N="65" /> most drug addicts do not register with GPs.  This is essential if we are to maintain the health of the general population.</P>
    <P>Female non-drug abusers are at particular risk because they can get HIV infection through sexual intercourse and this can be passed on to their children. This is a very serious problem with which the maternity hospitals have to deal. AIDS cannot be tackled if we do not deal with the drug problem.  In 99.9 per cent of cases AIDS is spread mainly by sharing needles and by sexual intercourse.  The Commission on the Status of Women was extremely anxious that more attention should be paid to women with AIDS. There appears to be a significant under-reporting of the incidence of the HIV virus among women, perhaps because it is often not discovered until they are near death because of AIDS.</P>
    <P>We will get a better idea of the incidence of AIDS in the heterosexual population because last autumn a non-linked programme was initiated to try to indentify the level of disease in the general population. I will explain what a non-linked programme is.  In all maternity hospitals blood is taken to screen women for the rubella antibody&mdash;the German measles antibody.  They now screen the throwaway blood for the HIV antibody.  This gives us an idea of the incidence of the HIV virus in the heterosexual population and if it is done every year it will indicate the rise or fall of the HIV virus in the population.  Since no names are involved, this is extremely satisfactory from an ethical point of view.  This is most important. How can we provide treatment or set up prevention programmes if we do not have some idea of the incidence of the disease?</P>
    <P>In 1991 Comhairle na n-Ospidéal recommended a minimum of four consultants in infectious diseases and genito urinary medicine in Dublin alone.  St. James's has carried almost the entire financial burden of treating patients with AIDS in Dublin.  Another consultant has been appointed to the Mater but what about the other two appointments?  Has the Minister even considered appointing one for the north and one for the south <Col N="66" /> of the city as recommended by the Comhairle?</P>
    <P>Because of the very long incubation period of people who are HIV positive &mdash;ten to 15 years it is essential that general practitioners become involved. We cannot have people going to special clinics in hospitals for ten to 15 years to see what will happen next.  The Irish College of General Practitioners should be involved in the monitoring of HIV infected patients.</P>
    <P>As Senator Norris said&mdash;and he is learning a lot about medicine through sharing an office with me&mdash;AZT has unfortunately proved to be useless.  As with viral diseases, people have to keep going until a vaccine is found.  This is extraordinarily difficult because like the 'flu virus, the HIV virus mutates rapidly so that by the time a vaccine has been found, the virus has changed and a new vaccine is needed.  There are two strains of the HIV virus of which HIV (2) is specific to Africa and countries associated with Africa.  There is a long way to go before we develop a vaccine.  Therefore, education and preventative measures are vital.</P>
    <P>It is nice to say that never has faithfulness to one faithful partner been more important.  The dangers are rather like those caused by syphilis in the pre-penicillin era.  We forget the death toll from cardiac and neurological disease associated with syphilis.  We should stop pretending that it is only teenagers who are involved in sexual activity.  We are always talking about protecting the youth.  It is ordinary everyday heterosexual adults who are at risk.</P>
    <P>I recently chaired a meeting of RELATE, the marriage advisory services central body.  Mrs. Maura Wall Murphy, the head of the mediation services here, who is not a woman noted for making dramatic statements, said that she could see, in pre-marriage courses in some years to come, one partner asking the other if he or she is HIV positive. I do not think that this was an overly dramatic statement.</P>
    <P>Dr. James Walsh recently said that condoms do reduce the incidence of <Col N="67" /> transmission of infection.  I regret that some in the medical profession say that it does not.  It is not totally effective but it greatly reduces the risk.  He said the main cause of condom failure was lack of a condom.</P>
    <P>It is virtually unknown for a patient to get AIDS or HIV infection from their doctor.  There was a very curious case in Florida, where people were said to have contracted infection from their dentist. The president of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association said that he was misunderstood when he said that testing of patients may be needed.  It has been known for health professionals to get AIDS from patients.  In the US, doctors have told me that they consider a patient to be HIV positive until proved to the contrary and take precautions accordingly. We may have to take similar precautions here, with all the attendant expense.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said in the Dáil that the last campaigns were low key.  He used the word coy to describe them&mdash;indeed they were.  I was looking at that advertisement depicting icebergs for a long time before I knew what it was, and I understand it was not clear to many others either.  I hope that the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy O'Dea, will tell the Minister for Health that I would like his next campaign to be far more explicit.</P>

      <P>I listened to Senator Henry with great interest and I bow to her knowledge in this area.  I want to comment on a few points that Senator Norris made.  He regretted the absence of the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin.  I want to apologise to the House on behalf of the Minister, who is unavoidably absent on urgent Government business. It would have been his desire to be here if at all possible because he has a great personal commitment in this area.  I feel confident that Senator Norris's high hopes of the Minister will be fully realised.</P>

I can assure the Senator that this will not be the case for much longer.  The Bill has been prepared in my Department, is ready to go to Cabinet and we hope to see it in this session.

      <P>I will bear that in mind. Senator Norris said that the National Aids Strategy Committee had not met for some time.  It met in the last two weeks under the chairmanship of the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin. Senator Norris also had a financial query about the percentage of the budget directed in a certain way.  I do not have that information to hand, but I will obtain it and communicate with Senator Norris.</P>

      <P>We are pleased with the terms of the motion and I would like to thank Senator Norris, Senator Henry and Senator O'Toole for tabling it and giving this House the opportunity to debate and support the Government's national aids strategy.</P>
      <P>Ireland ranks well on an international basis, when comparisons are made with other countries in terms of population-rates for cases of, and deaths from, AIDS.  In the EC in 1991, Ireland ranked eleventh of the Twelve member states with a case-rate per 100,000 population of 1.80.  Spain tops the list with 10.40 cases per 100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 334 AIDS cases and 146 AIDS deaths have been reported in this country to date.  The figures show, that of the 334 cases, 115 were homosexual or bisexual, 141 were intravenous drug <Col N="69" /> users, seven were homosexual/bisexual/ IV drug users, 22 were haemophiliacs, 34 were heterosexuals, eight were babies born to IV drug users, one was a heterosexual mother (with no apparent connection with an at-risk group) and six were undetermined.  Of the 334 cases, 146 have died and of the deaths, 47 were homosexual/bisexual, 53 were IV drug users, six were homosexual/bisexual IV drug users, 14 were haemophiliacs, 15 were heterosexuals, six were babies born to IV drug users and five were undetermined.</P>
    <P>In addition, a total of 1,358 persons have tested positive for HIV.  It is considered that this figure understates the true prevalence of HIV in Ireland and, on the recommendation of the National AIDS Strategy Committee, we have extended our HIV surveillance programme to include the anonymous, unlinked surveillance of HIV through the screening of bloods taken for routine clinical purposes at ante-natal clinics, which is surplus to requirements.  We also propose to include in the surveillance programme, the testing of unlinked surplus bloods taken at STD clinics and at out-patients departments.  This will be done on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>The information from the surveillance programme shows that we must be vigilant and active in relation to AIDS/HIV and it is imperative, therefore, that the national AIDS strategy is responsive to the evolving epidemiology of the disease, in particular towards preventing its further spread.  In addition, while we may rate favourably with other countries, statistics tend to hide individual human suffering and it is imperative that we have the appropriate framework available to care for and manage those individuals who have contracted the disease, and to ensure that they are not discriminated against or stigmatised in any way.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and I are committed fully to developing an AIDS strategy which is responsive to our needs.  To ensure that this happens, we have in place effective planning, implementation and review structures, which are addressing the serious public health and social challenges <Col N="70" /> which AIDS/HIV represent.  The Minister for Health is directly involved in the development of a comprehensive and integrated national AIDs policy in terms of prevention, care and management and anti-discrimination.</P>
    <P>In view of the significant impact of IV drug use on HIV in this country, I am also involved in the AIDS strategy in my capacity, as chairperson of the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse, which liaises closely with the AIDS strategy committee.  The National AIDS Strategy Committee, of which the Minister is chairperson, has developed a number of strategies to implement national policy goals on a priority and on a multi-sectoral basis.  Senators will be aware of these strategies which concern the care and management of persons with HIV/AIDS, education and prevention strategies and measures to avoid discrimination.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the strategies, which received a major additional investment of £3.3 million during 1992, is currently being undertaken by statutory and voluntary agencies.  A sum of £4.4 million has been allocated specifically for the HIV/AIDS strategy during the current year.  This has facilitated the delivery of a range of innovative services and programmes aimed at stemming the spread of the infection.  These include primary care clinics for IV drug users at which preventative and risk-reduction services such as methadone, needles and condoms are available on the basis of individual counselling and assessment; the provision of a consultant-led HIV/AIDS service in the Mater and Beaumont Hospitals and hospice and palliative care for persons with AIDS.</P>
    <P>This £4.4 million is, of course, additional to the general funding provided for the care and management of persons with HIV/AIDS through the mainstream health services.</P>
    <P>Senators, in their motion, have pledged their support for the Government and the Minister is pursuing an active and explicit public information campaign on HIV/AIDS.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> Preventative programmes by way of information and education on HIV/ AIDS are an integral feature of the ongoing work of the Health Promotion Unit of the Department of Health.  This element of the national AIDS strategy will be developed further with the implementation of a multi-media campaign on HIV prevention which will be launched by the Minister this month.  In that regard we will keep Senator Henry's suggestion in mind.  This campaign will be very intensive and will involve TV and radio advertisements.  The campaign will promote the need to practise safe sex and the role of condoms in this area.  In this regard, I accept that previous campaigns have been rather coy in relation to the role of condoms and the need to practise safer sex and these issues will be dealt with openly in the new campaign.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government has decided to amend the Health (Family Planning) Acts to liberalise the availability of condoms and the Minister for Health proposes to bring a new Bill in this regard before the Oireachtas in the near future.  The key feature of the Bill will be the removal of restrictions to supply condoms via vending machines and this will be a major and significant step in the fight against AIDS.  The Minister indicated to the Dáil yesterday during Question Time that he hopes to have that legislation published to coincide with National AIDS Day.</P>
    <P>Also in the area of prevention, the HIV-risk reduction methadone programme is being extended.  This is aimed at intravenous drug users in line with the recommendations of the expert group established to draw up a protocol for methadone prescribing.  The protocol will ensure that methadone is available to intravenous drug users in an accessible and controlled manner.</P>
    <P>Intravenous drug users still represent the largest number of persons infected with HIV.  Interventions aimed at both containing the spread of the infection and caring and managing infected individuals are, therefore, to a significant extent targeted at this group.  This is particularly so <Col N="72" /> in the Dublin area where the intravenous drug problems of the early 1980s have precipated the present intravenous drug-related HIV problem there.</P>
    <P>In order to provide an integrated approach to the problem, the HIV and drug use services co-ordinate closely and these include needle exchange through the primary care clinics for HIV/AIDS/ intravenous drug use in Baggot Street and Ballyfermot.  The health board has needle exchange programmes in five other locations also.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the primary care clinic framework will be developed further to ensure that the appropriate risk-reduction services, such as needle-exchange, are available and easily accessible, in a controlled manner.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the question of discrimination against persons with HIV/AIDS, in my capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Justice.  The National AIDS Strategy Committee made recommendations in this area and I am pleased to report to the House that two of the main recommendations of the committee are being addressed.  They are the descriminalisation of homosexuality and the segregation of prisoners with HIV.  The Government is currently considering the former and the Minister for Justice, on Monday last, announced that the recommendations of the high-level committee established to advise on the question of HIV would be published and implemented on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware from what I have said that the Government is active in the fight against AIDS and is introducing the measures proposed by the Senators to ensure that the spread of HIV is curtailed.</P>
    <P>Again, I thank the Senators for tabling the motion which I support and commend to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I support the motion moved by Senator Norris, Henry and O'Toole.  In view of what the Minister said recently, we are witnessing a major change in relation to the fight against HIV in this country.  The Minister for <Col N="73" /> State at the Department of Justice chaired the recent strategy committee meeting on 22 April, an indication of how strongly he feels about the HIV and AIDS problems.  He moved quickly after coming into office to ensure his proposals were implemented.</P>
      <P>When I examined the numbers of deaths in this country from AIDS I found that from February 1993 to April 1993 18 new cases of AIDS were reported and there were three deaths.  Any action we take to prevent a death in any sphere of Irish society is worthwhile.  The 8 per cent increase in AIDS cases since the beginning of 1993 is serious and needs to be examined.</P>
      <P>The number of deaths from AIDS when compared to other countries is not high but our national population level is lower than most.  However, we have not been to the forefront in taking action to ensure that the disease itself is properly tackled.  Anything we can do to avoid one death from AIDS is to be welcomed. Regarding the attitude to condoms in this country I have never heard of anyone dying from the use of a condom whereas many people have died because they did not use one.  I knew people who died from AIDS and there is dreadful human suffering associated with such a death. Some of those I knew were very loveable people and it was not by choice that they died from AIDS.  Much compassion needs to be shown to people with AIDS and we must do whatever possible to prevent further deaths.</P>
      <P>I have sympathy for people working in hospitals because they do not know when someone who is HIV positive is going to come in for treatment.  A HIV positive person may not have been indentified as such and staff are put at risk when dealing with them.  Many people will not identify themselves as HIV positive to the authorities because of fear of discrimination and of social ostracision.  The sooner a programme is implemented to identify people who are HIV positive the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do people with AIDS get proper care, especially in the latter stages of the disease? They do not seem to have received the consideration they deserve.  We <Col N="74" /> should organise a service similar to the hospice movement to make life easier for AIDS sufferers.  These people accept with dignity the fact that they have a horrible disease and we should do whatever possible to help them.</P>
    <P>The policy announced by the Minister in relation to prevention, care and management of AIDS is to be welcomed.  Not enough is done in the area of needle exchange and it would not cost a fortune to supply free needles.  If it prevented one death it would be worth the cost. In addition, condoms should be supplied free to people infected with the virus because usually they cannot afford them.</P>
    <P>The figure of £3.3 million in addition to funds allocated last year to fight the spread of AIDS is welcome.  The extra £4.4 million this year is also to be welcomed. It is a small amount of money when compared to the money lost in recent financial scandals.</P>
    <P>More education and training should be given to AIDS counsellors.  One-to-one counselling is very important for people who have notified the authorities that they have AIDS.  In counselling an AIDS sufferer may reveal the names of others with AIDS who are not prepared to come forward.  Counselling is very important to make life easier for sufferers and to help them accept their situation with dignity.</P>
    <P>The health education programme thankfully is to be very explicit; we have seen too many Irish solutions to Irish problems.  Regardless of the attitude of some right wing people to the supply of condoms it is important that condoms be supplied through vending machines and that people be educated through television and radio about the spread of AIDS.  We have sat behind closed doors for far too long doing nothing to intervene. It is very important that people be educated to practise safer sex through the use of condoms.  I welcome the Minister's decision to allow the supply of condom vending machines.  I am sure that if, in five or six years time, they have stopped the spread of AIDS or the number of deaths from AIDS in this country, this move will be welcome.  As I said, if we <Col N="75" /> can avoid one death it would be welcome. I welcome the Minister's commitments and I have no doubt he will honour them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>An all-party committee in the House of Commons came to the conclusion that the best way to avoid contracting AIDS was to practise celibacy outside marriage and faithfulness in marriage.  The committee said that everybody should strive towards this goal to which I subscribe.  Unfortunately, many people cannot attain that goal and we, as legislators, must provide for their needs. In 1986 I voted in the Dáil to make condoms available to people over 18 years of age.  As a result, I received appalling abuse from the public.  However, we have come a long way since then.  We have a more open society now and people are prepared to accept that there are problems associated with sexual behaviour, and the main one is AIDS.</P>
      <P>The Minister said today that Ireland was lucky because it ranked eleventh of the Twelve member states in terms of the number of people who have died from AIDS.  I attended a health conference in Bundoran last weekend and Dr. Joe Barry, who has responsibility for the AIDS programme in the Eastern Health Board area, of which I am a member, read a paper on the subject.  He mentioned another league to which the Minister did not refer, that is, the list of the number of intravenous drug users.  On that list we did not come second last but very close to the top.  I see merit in this motion because intravenous drug users using dirty needles are a problem in society.  I accept the need for needle exchange centres, but I agree with Senator Henry when she said that we need more centres.  Indeed, these centres should be established throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to speak about the methadone programme to which the Minister referred.  I wrote to the Minister yesterday on this subject because, at present, we have only two methadone treatment centres in Dublin, one in Ballyfermot and one in Baggot Street.  We need more centres around the city.  It is <Col N="76" /> wrong that so many people can go to only one centre for treatment.  Local communities must accept these centres.  The local communities I addressed are prepared to accept treatment centres for people who live in their catchment area, but not for people from other parts of the city.  I hope the Eastern Health Board will be able to open more methadone treatment centres and needle exchange centres in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting article in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> today.  I did not intend speaking on this motion.  However, I saw the article by Geoffrey Wheatcroft and I read it with interest.  The heading is: &ldquo;AIDS: Much Better If We Had Been Honest From The Start&rdquo;.  In it he blames the British Government for spending too much money in an early campaign against AIDS.  It reads:</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to scale down its campaign against AIDS, which was aimed at everyone indiscriminately. In a reversal of policy, efforts will now be targeted at high-risk groups.  This is an admission that the long-prophesied HIV epidemic among the general population has not taken place.</P>
    <P>He also says that in the last year for which figures are available, the British Government spent £121 million in the fight against AIDS.  This was only a little more than was spent on the programme to fight cancer.  I do not know if the facts in that report are true&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, to the House and congratulate the Minister for Health, <Col N="77" /> Deputy Howlin, on the steps he is taking to combat this terrible disease.  Unfortunately, in many cases this disease is self-inflicted. It is sad to see people inflicting suffering on themselves and, in some cases, infecting innocent, unborn children.</P>
      <P>Thousands of years ago a wise man wrote 77 words in ten short sentences. For generations people of all religions in this country obeyed those ten sentences. However, I have not heard them recently and, as a result, our moral standards have deteriorated.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Doyle and Senator Henry that the only way to avoid AIDS is to have sex with one faithful partner and to remain faithful to that partner.  Unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world and we must do the best we can.  Although I welcome vending machines which make condoms available, I doubt if they will solve all our problems.</P>
      <P>Recently, a priest told me that when he was a curate in Liverpool 30 years ago there were many unwanted pregnancies and people demanded that condoms be made available.  Now, 30 years later there are still many unwanted pregnancies in Liverpool.  I will not quote the figures because they might frighten Senators. Nothing is safe unless it is 100 per cent safe, and condoms are not 100 per cent safe.  They may prevent unwanted pregnancies in some cases, but they are not 100 per cent safe.</P>
      <P>We need better education programmes in our schools.  Unfortunately, we show pupils the bright side of life &mdash; discos, girls drinking pints of lager, etc., but that is fantasy land.  At present secondary school pupils are brought to the spring show, to museums or on cultural trails, but we should bring them to Mountjoy Prison to show them the inside of a prison and how people suffer if they do not adhere to a certain code of practice.  Perhaps we should bring these children to rehabilitation and detoxification units in our hospitals to see how these young people are suffering.  As the old saying goes the best gamekeeper is a poacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> Perhaps it would benefit our young people if those suffering from AIDS talked frankly to them and explained how recklessness ruined their lives.  It only takes one mistake to ruin a life.  I spent years using a shotgun, but, in one split second, I left myself seriously injured. Many competent motorists have fatal car accidents.  Often a person sitting in a bar enjoying himself does not realise that the horses and plumes are on their way to collect him.  Death can result from one simple mistake.  Although improvements have been made to cars and they are equipped with advanced brake systems the number of car accidents have not decreased.</P>
    <P>If one were to ask young people whether they would want members of their family to engage in casual sex with different partners their answer would be no.  People must learn to enjoy life but not to abuse it.</P>
    <P>The abuse of alcohol is the forerunner of many of our social problems, including that of unwanted pregancies.  Often women become pregnant because they were drunk and did not know what they were doing.  In this way, people also run the risk of becoming infected with the AIDS virus.</P>
    <P>We need better life skills programmes. People need to be educated but should not be told that if one uses a condom one can have sex every night of the week. That will not solve the problem.  People cannot continue to live promiscuous and reckless lives.  The human body can only take so much.  In the words of the recitation one will end up &ldquo;in the bughouse ward, with a life staked out on death&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of a health board for 20 years and I find it sad to visit rehabilitation units where young people are recovering from car accidents that could have been avoided.  Many of these young people are kept alive by machines and are unable to move.  Their lives have been ruined because they wanted one more drink.  In the words of a poem: &ldquo;One for the road&rdquo;, the young man said, &ldquo;One for the road that lies ahead&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>People infected with the AIDS virus <Col N="79" /> must become involved in education programmes to persuade young people that they must not lead reckless lives.  If they do they must be prepared to accept the consequences which are a damaged immune system and the risk of infection.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice must introduce severe penalties for those who threaten the public and, particularly, members of the Garda Síochána with infected needles.  These people should be sentenced to 20 years hard labour.  We must put an end to that behaviour.  We have taken a soft approach for too long. The Minister must be encouraged to introduce the necessary legislation &mdash; and I am sure this House will support him &mdash; to forbid this type of blackguardism with a disease that is incurable.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister success in his efforts to prevent the spread of this disease.  It is sad so much money must be allocated to combating a self-inflicted disease, money which could have been spent on other health problems.</P>

      <P>I welcome this motion moved by Senators Norris, Henry and O'Toole.  The tone of this debate has been more constructive and balanced than some previous debates we have had on similar matters.  We are making welcome progress in that regard.  The Minister's reply fits in well with the motion and with the tone of the debate.</P>
      <P>There seems to be an assumption in certain parts of Ireland that AIDS does not exist.  It is seen as an urban problem or as something affecting other countries and not holy and virtuous Ireland.  That is not the case.  Statistics reveal that AIDS is a problem in Ireland and that previous statistics have understated the situation. Perhaps we should ask questions about our ability to assemble statistics for example, not only in respect of AIDS but also for example, in relation to suicide where figures have been seriously understated for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a stigma attached to the problem of AIDS and consequently people are reluctant to concede the extent of the problem.  A Deputy said there was no sex <Col N="80" /> before the invention of television which is not an original statement.</P>
    <P>The key to solving this problem is education. Young and old must be made aware of the consequences of certain types of sexual behaviour, of unprotected sex, etc.  It is disquieting to learn that AIDS can be spread through heterosexual sex.  This would indicate to Government that there is an urgent need to ensure that sufficient education and information is made available to alert people to the gravity of the situation.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Norris's view that sufficient information is not available and greater efforts must be made in this area. However I was encouraged to see that members of the Eastern Health Board visited Newbridge College, a school in my locality and assistance was also received from the Department of Education for AIDS education.</P>
    <P>There is the suggestion, in some quarters, that it is undesirable for young people to be exposed to these realities.  I do not subscribe to that view.  It is necessary to expose them to these realities. Senator Norris, who is in frequent contact with students, will agree with me. Young people are more aware than we were at their age and are capable of accepting and absorbing information without some of the hang-ups we may have had.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry made the point that sexual activity is not confined to young people.  She conjured up visions of geriatric sex.  If people can enjoy that, more power to them.  This illustrates that education should be directed not only towards people at school or at third level institutions but at the wider community. The phenomenon is a relatively new one and people of an older age may not be as aware as they should be of the possible consequences of their actions.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement that the law applying to condoms will be changed is welcome.  This move is long overdue. Condoms should be freely available.</P>
    <P>On radio the other day I heard Ruth Riddick speaking about abortions.  She explained that a recent survey found that a high proportion of respondants did not <Col N="81" /> use protection when they knew they should.  That needs to be taken into account.  It is not true that because condoms are freely available HIV and AIDS will necessarily be reduced because, in practice, they will not always be used. This is not to suggest that the legislation should not be changed because the measures proposed are welcome.  Reference has been made to methadone and the needle programmes and I support those measures too.</P>
    <P>The idea that because one sins against a particular moral precept, one must accept the consequences and reap the whirlwind is something I reject absolutely and cannot understand.  It cannot be said of these who are unfortunate to contract HIV or AIDS, that they deserve it because of promiscuity or the fact that they were drug addicts.  Nobody deserves to be condemned to a future with HIV, and nobody deserves to be condemned to death from AIDS.  That is not what I understand morality to be and it is important to make that point.</P>
    <P>This is primarily a health problem and it should be addressed as such.  Every measure should be taken to reduce the effects of the disease and to ensure that the cost to the State, apart from the health of the individual which is important, is reduced to the degree that it is possible to ensure that people are not condemned to a long stay in hospital and that we do not have to introduce an elaborate and expensive panoply which would be necessary in the event of the spread of this terrible disease.</P>
    <P>I have a certain sympathy, however, with the remarks made by Senator Farrell. I have sympathy for the gardaí.  It is horrendous that any person involved in protecting other citizens and in protecting the law should be subjected to these kinds of threats and the people who make them should be treated as the worst type of criminal.  I would not confine them to bread and water because I do not believe that is the way to rehabilitate them.  However, they should be put in prison for a long time to pay the penalty. There is an onus on us to ensure that the guardians of law and order are protected. We have reached the point where the balance of advantage has been taken <Col N="82" /> from the gardaí and given to the criminals. As a university student I recall seeing Garda &ldquo;Lugs&rdquo; Branigan in the Olympic Ballroom.  He parted the hordes like the Dead Sea to take three people who were in front of the band stand into the back alley and rendered his own justice. Nobody protested.  I am not suggesting that we return to those days but I believe that the balance has gone too far in the other direction.</P>

      <P>I welcome this motion and support it.  I particularly welcome the language used in the motion &mdash; words such as &ldquo;open&rdquo;, &ldquo;clear&rdquo;, &ldquo;specific&rdquo;, &ldquo;explicit&rdquo; and &ldquo;factual&rdquo;.  We need to use that kind of language and to adopt the kind of approach it implies.  For years we have fudged sexually related issues and this does not serve the people of this country.  I am pleased that we are treating these topics in a straightforward manner.</P>
      <P>Like other speakers, I believe that the part of the motion dealing with education and information is important.  I am pleased that later this month there will be a series of television and radio advertisements about condoms and other aspects of HIV and AIDS.  As the Minister, Deputy Howlin, said they will not be coy; they will be direct and explicit, as the motion calls for.  This is particularly important in relation to young people, although I take the point made by other Senators that it is not only young people who are sexually active and who are exposed to HIV and AIDS.  However, young people often try to give the impression they they know more than they do especially when they are with their peers.  Nevertheless they often do not know how to get the kind of information they need.  It is important therefore that there is a programme of information in the media and in schools. Like Senator Henry, I am pleased that schools are acknowledging this and that a fact sheet for post-primary students is available.  I am also pleased that, schools are providing information and education about HIV and AIDS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the gay community for all their work in this area over the years, not just at the Hirshfeld Centre in Dublin, but also around the country. <Col N="83" /> When the authorities were slow to take action, the gay community were an example to the rest of us when it came to tackling the problems related to HIV and AIDS.  I welcome the wider availability of condoms through vending machines, following the enactment of legislation. People should not have to go to chemists and doctors to get condoms.  I agree with Senator Norris that the decriminalisation of homosexuality is as important for health as it is for civil liberties.  When something is declared to be criminal it has certain connotations which would make it less easy to discuss the kind of issues we are considering today.</P>
    <P>Regarding the use of needles and the provision of clinics, Members said there were only two clinics at the moment and that others are to be established.  I hope they will not be based only in Dublin, even though the problem of dirty needles is largely confined to this part of the country.  The need for people who suffer from AIDS to know where to go, wherever they live, must be acknowledged.  I accept that there cannot be clinics all over the country.  However, I support calls by other Senators that GPs should be trained and that there be an approach to the Irish College of General Practitioners in that respect.  There are many dedicated GPs who treat patients who are HIV positive or have AIDS and refer them where necessary.  However, not all GPs are so sympathetic.  Regarding the NESC recommendations and the further development of programmes, Senator Norris spoke about using the knowledge of groups who are experienced and expert in this field.</P>
    <P>I welcome the motion and support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion in the names of Senator Norris, Senator Henry and Senator O'Toole.  I think it is a timely motion, especially in view of the reply given by the Minister for Health in the Dáil yesterday.  I have read that reply and it has changed my attitude, in some respects, towards Government policy on the serious question of AIDS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>AIDS is a killer disease and the numbers who are HIV positive or infected with AIDS are growing in this country. <Col N="84" /> Ireland has the unenviable distinction of having the highest proportion of babies born with HIV virus.  The number of people who have contracted this deadly disease through heterosexual activity is also growing.  The task facing us is to muster all possible forces to halt the spread of the AIDS epidemic.  The motion is good in so far as it supports the initiative being taken by the Minister for Health, in that regard.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of this issue are blown out of all proportion.  One in particular which struck me recently was the idea that the medical profession should amend its ethical guidelines so as to require doctors who are HIV positive or who contract AIDS to report their condition to the director of community care in their area.  There is no evidence to suggest that any patient has ever become HIV positive or contracted AIDS from a doctor, not is there any likelihood of this happening in a normal doctor-patient relationship.  Some of the media reporting of the handful of cases involving doctors with the condition has been sensational but, given the public fear about AIDS, there is a need to reassure patients that there is no danger.  The most effective way to do this would be to require doctors to report their condition in confidence to the director of community care.</P>
    <P>AIDS became a major health issue in the late 1980s and will, unfortunately, be a health issue for the 1990s.  People with AIDS are normal people who have contracted a deadly disease in a variety of ways.  The Government must show that their response to this matter is not complacent but is active, preventative and caring.  This motion aims to support the Minister for Health and for Government for the initiative they are taking.</P>
    <P>I know there have been some policy changes but, as I have said previously, the introduction of a national AIDS taskforce would be an excellent and serious policy decision.  There is no point in the Government saying that the Irish AIDS problem is not too bad and that the number of people infected here with AIDS or HIV compared with in other European countries, is not high.  That is not what we want to hear.  We want positive action in this serious matter <Col N="85" /> which not only affects the people who have the disease but their families also.</P>
    <P>Are we serious about tackling the AIDS epidemic in this country?  If we are honest with ourselves, the answer at present appears to be &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I say this since there is no good reason for not establishing a national AIDS taskforce.  I was a member of the Southern Health Board for a number of years and the Cork AIDS Alliance made a submission to the board during that time seeking to establish a front against AIDS and HIV.  They asked for integrated co-operation between voluntary and statutory bodies. We must recognise that tremendous work is being done by the voluntary bodies and should be given every possible support.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling abroad that the Government's information and preventative programme is complacent and dominated by the values of one religious group.  Information is preventative. Ignorance of AIDS and HIV kills and the publicity campaign of 1987 which included billboards, TV, newspapers and the local health centres was a good effort at imparting information.  In the Minister's reply given in the Dáil which I have read he stated that:</P>
    <P>A prevention programme by way of information and education on HIV/AIDS is an integral feature of the ongoing work....  The campaign will be very intensive and will involve TV and radio ads.</P>
    <P>That is what we want to see.  It amazes me that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, can regularly rerun advertisements drawing the public's attention to the danger to farm animals from dogs on the loose, or that the Department of the Environment regularly advertises to warn the public of the dangers of drinking and driving yet the Department of Health confines its warnings on AIDS to small posters hanging in medical clinics.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for information on this subject and it is the Government's responsibility to provide the most effective and sensible public information.  If nothing else is achieved by this debate at least the Government will be informed that there is dissatisfaction with the <Col N="86" /> manner in which the issue has been handled, and a demand for a new initiative. The co-ordination of voluntary and the statutory bodies is essential in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.</P>
      <P>AIDS is a reality and there is no turning the clock back 20 years and saying it never happened.  It has happened.  The statistics that the Minister of State has given us in the break down of cases show that AIDS is not confined to any one group, to any age group, to haemophiliacs, homosexuals or intravenous drug users but affects people throughout the community.</P>
      <P>We must act now to halt the spread of the disease by doing everything we can to educate young people so that they will not fall into fatal traps.  In many ways I agree with Senator Farrell's view that, although it may not be fashionable, the only remedy may be to be faithful to one partner.  We have to face the reality that this is not what most young people do and as other Senators have said, older people are no saints either.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry outlined the frightening fact that the HIV virus is mutable, in other words changeable, and therefore is resistant to a single remedy.  It also seems that the incubation period of the virus is indeterminate and that it can lie dormant for many years before something triggers it to become full-blown AIDS.  That means that many people in the community are carrying a dormant HIV virus and do not know that.  They may have been infected ten or 15 years ago and the problem may not surface for many years to come.  That is a sobering thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ensure that all GPs have a rudimentary knowledge of the disease. The limited treatment available at present to ease the suffering of those with full blown AIDS must be available to all.  A person living in a remote area should have access to the same treatment as a person living in Dublin.  Therefore, I ask the Minister for Health to ensure that each health board organises training programmes for GPs so that there is a GP available to anybody who is HIV positive or who has full blown AIDS, if not in their own immediate area, at least <Col N="87" /> within easy travelling distance.  It is unreasonable to expect a person to travel 40 to 50 miles when in poor health to avail of the limited treatment currently available.  Such training programmes would not require much funding.</P>
    <P>Geographical areas which appear to be at risk should be identified.  Dublin and the larger cities stand out as areas prone to a high incidence of the disease.  The same is also true of ports and other places where people intermingle.  A previous speaker pointed out that following international sporting events there is a rise in the number of sexually transmitted diseases referred to STD clinics.  The same would apply to rock concerts and other large gatherings of people.  There is an equally strong likelihood of an increase in the numbers of persons infected with the HIV virus.  Therefore, each health board should be aware that a three day event with 5,000 young people congregating in an area may result in an increase in the numbers infected with the HIV virus a few months later.</P>
    <P>Another aspect referred to by Senator Sherlock which will have to be addressed is the rise in the number of children born with the HIV virus.  Unfortunately, many of these children have died but more will grow up to be carriers of the virus.  People will have to know how to deal with these children.  They should not be ostracised but nevertheless, special care should be taken of them when they start school because of the risk, slim though it may be, of their transmitting the disease inadvertently to other children.  Teachers and other carers have to be aware that this problem will worsen.  We should not allow our religious beliefs to prevent us from having a practical approach to the treatment and curbing of AIDS.  Condoms are a preventative measure and should be widely available to all regardless of age.  Those old enough to be sexually active are old enough to use a condom.  They should be told that it is not good to engage in sex with numerous partners and should be educated on the use of condoms.  This would contribute to preventing the spread of AIDS.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the <Col N="88" /> Senators who tabled this motion.  A Dublin publican recently installed a condom vending machine in a toilet on a Friday afternoon.  However, there were no condoms in it as none were available. By Monday there was £60 in the machine but nobody had complained to the publican. The machine had been installed in a ladies' toilet.</P>
      <P>We cannot plead ignorance on this issue.  It is a sad reflection that we are only eleventh of twelve EC states with a case rate per 100,000 population of 1.80. The general public are under the impression that we are not even twelfth; they think it does not happen at all.  There is one EC country with a lower rate than ours.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is supporting the motion.  As a father of seven, I do not want to give the impression that it is acceptable to have more than one sexual partner simply because condoms are becoming more widely available. However, I make no apology for saying that condoms should be used by sexually active people.  We had a major argument in this House and the other House no more than 18 months ago as to whether 16 or 18 should be the minimum legal age for using condoms and we decided on 17 years.  We must face the reality that young people are sexually active and make condoms available to them as a matter of urgency.  The growing number of single parents is a problem.  Condoms may help to reduce this incidence.</P>
      <P>It is a very sad reflection that we regard one group as different.  How are they different?  Their difference is in sexual orientation only.  I am surprised at the numbers of people who have died of whom 47 were homosexual or bi-sexual and 53 were drug users.  Those statistics worry me.  As a former Lord Mayor of Cork, I was involved in tackling the drugs problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>AIDS is a massive problem which could result in the extermination of 25 per cent of the population of some countries. We did not act fast enough when we saw what happened on the west coast of America seven or eight years ago.  We are prepared to say anything to avoid giving the impression that we have a problem.  We have many problems, such <Col N="89" /> as unemployment, our health services and crime, but AIDS is a problem which is going to get worse.  Even the Minister admits that the problem of people with HIV is only being dealt with slowly.  We do not know, exactly, how many people are infected.  Slowly but surely, the practice is emerging that if a person gets a blood test &mdash; for example, when applying for an insurance policy &mdash; the sample is checked for the virus.</P>
    <P>Sadly, we, as a people, are not prepared to face up to the problem.  We prefer to give the impression that it is a problem which only affects homosexuals. Homosexuals are, undeservedly, blamed for the problem.  They have learned that it is advisable to stay with one partner. We should give homosexuals the assistance and recognition to which they are entitled because if we do not, we will be compelled to do so by the European court.  As a nation, we should face up to our problems and give these people every assistance.</P>
    <P>A needle exchange scheme has been introduced in Dublin and in Cork.  Had we said, five or seven years ago, that drug users were to be given clean needles, people would have been shocked.  Yet this is a fact of life; we have to do it.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister mentioned prisons. There have been many deaths and other incidents in the prisons.  I know the Minister is examining this and I hope this issue will be resolved shortly.  It is wrong to say that what has happened in our prisons is not the Government's fault; it is.  We must ask how the drugs and needles got into prisons and if enough is being done for people in prison.  We must also ask if we are really committed to solving the drug problem.  I wonder if it can be solved.</P>
    <P>Cork is a small city; no more bigger than a decent town.  I would probably be amazed if I learned the identity of those despicable people who are supplying young people with drugs.  I cannot understand how these people never seem to be brought before the courts.  I would emphasise the importance of ensuring a strong commitment to solving this problem.</P>
    <P>I read with interest the commitments of relevant Ministers to solve problems <Col N="90" /> in area of tax and social welfare areas. The same type of commitment should be given when it comes to dealing with drug pushers.  Under no circumstances should young people be able to procure drugs for supply to others.  Whole families can be involved in drug supply.  People in the immediate area know what is happening and, understandably, are nervous.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Access&rdquo; is the important word in the motion.  When we are giving access, will we get the people who are doing wrong? There is a shortage of staff in the Garda Síochána experienced in dealing with the problems of drugs or the HIV virus.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the proposers of the motion.  I am delighted that everybody wants to substantiate what has been said in the motion.  The best people to educate us in this area are the homosexuals who were blamed for the problem initially.  I congratulate them and I hope that, in the future, we have more constructive debates on homosexuality.  It is important that we would always keep in mind that the greatest danger to our young people is drug.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to that; I was starting from a historical base.  Youth was mentioned and, as the youngest member of the Oireachtas, I want to add a word of caution.  A parish priest once wrote that condoms were only 90 per cent effective.  What consolation does this give to the 10 per cent who are either infected with the disease or faced with the possibility of infection or pregnancy?  While condoms should be widely available and their use should be encouraged, education and information on the transfer and spread of this disease is vital if we are to prevent its spread.  It is impossible to estimate how rapidly this disease is spreading.  We know of approximately <Col N="91" /> 1,360 cases.  Sadly this disease is being transmitted on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>I remember a heated debate about the sale of condoms in chemist shops.  There are not many chemist shops in this country open 24 hours a day.  Sexual activities take place mainly at night and people do not always go out with the intention of having sexual intercourse so it is vital that condoms are made available to people who intend to have sexual contact.</P>
      <P>As regards education I know of a person who recently contracted the HIV virus having slept with three girls and he is not sure from which one he contracted it.  That is the sad reality.  This man is university educated yet he did not have enough information.  The current educational programme is not getting through to young people.  A recent <i>Sunday World</i> article said the young now see AIDS as an old homosexual's disease. That paper might be called a rag newspaper but it does research its information. While condoms may be the route to solving this problem, people must be educated on how the disease is transmitted, and contracted and how it can be avoided.</P>
      <P>AIDS can definitely be avoided by not having homosexual or heterosexual intercourse. Unfortunately in the real world people have sex on a regular basis.  It is vital that people be discouraged from having sex with partners whose sexual background they do not know.  Condoms will solve most but not all of the problems. We must spend more on the provision of education and information.  The use of condoms is the most direct way of slowing the spread of the disease but it will not stop it.</P>

      <P>I am delighted and amazed this debate has produced so much consensus.  Our first debate on this subject was about two and a half years ago and it was a difficult debate because one had to speak in specific and explicit terms about sexual matters.  At that time <Col N="92" /> Senator Norris organised a briefing session for Members of the Oireachtas in Buswell's Hotel, which was fully attended.  Whatever differences there have been among Members we have always been united in concern about this question.</P>
      <P>I would like to pick up on some of the points made by Senator Kelleher.  AIDS education is the joint responsibility of home, school and State agencies; it is not the sole responsibility of any.</P>
      <P>In recent times my own organisation, the Irish National Teachers Organisation responded to the Green Paper &ldquo;Education for a Changing World&rdquo;.  In its proposals it indicated to the Department of Education and to the Minister that there was a need for teacher education on AIDS.  The current response is inadequate. Teachers have not been educated to deal with AIDs which is sensitive area and one in which parents must be fully involved.  The tackling of the problem must be directed and controlled by State agencies with the appropriate information, research and statistics.</P>
      <P>Certain conservative forces in society will oppose AIDS education but this is to be expected.  Parents, teachers, people in authority and public representatives are concerned and it is rare to find this degree of concensus.  We must formulate an initiative.</P>
      <P>Girls are reaching puberty at a younger age than some years ago, many reaching it at primary school.  This may be reflective of world trends.  Sexual activity is starting at an earlier age and so is experimentation with drugs.  We have had difficulties in Dublin with certain people offering easily obtainable drugs to the young, trying to create dependency. Those two facts require information about AIDS to be available to the very young.  It would be a major mistake not to tackle this problem before early adulthood or late adolesence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to educate children about AIDS we begin with information, develop awareness and create confidence. Scare stories do not work. Danger attracts.  There must be a long slow education process on sexuality, personal development and physical protection. The child must be told it has the <Col N="93" /> authority to say no or yes, depending on the context.  The child must be able to make an assessment.  If a child learns to judge he or she will be able to do so in adolescence and in adulthood.</P>
    <P>This process must begin at school and in the home, with a real contribution from State agencies.  They have not done so to date.  Agencies are saying the right things but there is no evidence at primary or at post-primary level of the preparation of teachers through in service education to tackle this problem.  Parents must be encouraged to accept this development, which is for the protection of pupils.  I welcome the consensus on the motion and I thank Senator Norris for making his time available to me.</P>

      <P>I have been moved by the quality of the debate here this evening, particularly as it is a matter close to my heart.  I hesitated in putting down this motion when I discovered my Private Members' Time was scheduled.  I had put it down before and I have also spoken on sexual morality on a number of occasions in this House.  On the last couple of occasions when I have had Private Members' Time I raised the question of the establishment of a foreign affairs committee.  By now I have a reputation for speaking on numerous subjects, sometimes perhaps <i>ad nauseam</i>, some Members may feel.  In that context my view of the importance of sexuality will not be considered unbalanced.  I speak with feeling because I am burying friends of mine at the rate of about one every six weeks.  AIDS is impacting directly upon my life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was pleasurable to hear the excellent contributions from all sides of the House. This has been one of the best debates in which I have been privileged to take part. I should not single out any speaker but the contribution that gave me the greatest pleasure came from Senator Farrell because I frequently disagree with him and his talent as a colourful storyteller has been used in ways I do not always approve.  This evening, although I disagreed with some of the emphasis, particularly on those whose infection was self-inflicted and so on, he dealt with the topic in a sensitive way.  He used his <Col N="94" /> storytelling talent to register concern about the tragic human cost of this disease.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's clear speech and his commitment in a number of areas.  It is noticeable however, that there is a lack of assistance for the gay community, except in the area of law reform. I applaud what the Minister said about the decriminalisation of homosexuality. I hope this comes about.  The Minister for Justice indicated in her appalling memorandum that there were two options, one of which was not decriminalisation and was exactly what the World Health Organisation has indicated would be a complete catastrophe for this country.  It is the kind of lunacy propounded by the self-styled Family Solidarity. I did not grow on a tree.  I am part of the human family, whatever they think.  That organisation has not shown much solidarity with me, nor much common sense.</P>
    <P>The other option is the decriminalisation of homosexuality.  I was glad the Minister said this was what the Government was considering because that way lies real common sense.</P>
    <P>I am glad the surveillance of HIV through the screening of blood taken for routine clinical purposes at anti-natal clinics will commence, as will the testing of unlinked surplus blood taken at STD clinics and out-patient departments.  It is important to say that as a gay man because sometimes gays are seen to be opposed to this kind of testing.  I have no mandate to speak for the gay community, but I speak as a gay man who has taken a responsible position for the past ten or 12 years since this virus was first identified. Not only do I not object to this development but I welcome it.  It is a positive step.</P>
    <P>I do not need the Minister's assurance that gay people will not be stigmatised by this Government.  Even when Mr. MacSharry was Minister for Finance the Government introduced a marvellous protocol which protected people against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or HIV status and allowed them to work if they had full blown AIDS.  That demonstrates that Ireland is <Col N="95" /> not a nasty, backward little country.  The Irish have a proud record of compassion, tolerance and decency and they should be given credit for it.</P>
    <P>With regard to Ireland's ranking in Europe, Greece is twelfth and just beats us.  It is not something to be proud of because that is in the context of the European Community countries only.  There are 33 countries in Europe and although we are in the first ten, we are not as good as we think although we are not as bad as other people may imply.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the presence of Dr. James Walsh in the House; he has played an important role in combating this disease. Dr. Walsh pointed out that the media campaign must be a sustained one. It is not sustained: a two week media programme is not a sustained programme and we need more than that.  I am delighted that everybody, from the youngest Member of the Oireachtas, Senator Kelleher, to the oldest, about whom I will not speculate, indicated their support for the Government's action and I join in that support.</P>
    <P>There is ongoing research into AIDS in St. James's Hospital and Dr. Fiona Mulcahy has done wonderful work in that area.  Gerard Philpott, of Aidswise, who is in the House this evening, has produced the best information sheet I have read.  Perhaps the Minister would like a copy.  It is clear, accurate and explicit.  It also contains some of the advice offered by more conservative Members:</P>
    <P>Celibacy &mdash; Abstaining from sex is a sure way of avoiding this route to HIV infection; the more partners you have, the greater the risk of having intercourse with someone who is infected with HIV.</P>
    <P>It is full of common sense and genuine morality.</P>
    <P>Education is vital.  There is no cure for AIDS but prevention is better than cure and the way to prevent the spread of this disease is to educate people about it. Condoms are effective; I believe they are 98 per cent or 99 per cent safe.</P>
    <P>This idiotic notion that the AIDS virus can somehow squeak through a hole in the latex is absolute nonsense.  The virus <Col N="96" /> exists in the molecule of water and it cannot travel without that.  The molecule of water is considerably larger than the virus.  Let nobody say that the virus is 100 times smaller than a sperm and thus can squeak through the latex; that is idiocy and it should not be promulgated.  People should be warned.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell said that we still have car accidents despite safety features like disc brakes and safety belts.  Is that an argument for throwing out the safety belts and disc brakes?  We must use the sexual equivalent of disc brakes and safety belts.  I thank the House for this evening's superb debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Society has a duty to organise itself in such a manner that its weaker sections are protected by the stronger and more affluent members of society.  With profound regret I have to say that the Department of Health and its Ministers have failed to discharge their obligations to the people of Edenderry and its surrounding towns and villages of Bracknagh, Clonbulloge, Rhode, Clonygowan and Geashill.  Edenderry District Hospital serves the people of those towns.</P>
      <P>The Midland Health Board participated in the initial plan to locate hospitals of different specialities throughout the Midland Health Board area. Although the members have done a certain amount of work on behalf of Edenderry District Hospital, they must be criticised because the case for Edenderry District Hospital has not been pressed with the urgency it deserves.  The members of the Midland Health Board should highlight this matter on every occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Edenderry hospital was built in the last <Col N="97" /> century.  A number of hospitals were built at the time, including those in Tullamore and Birr.  Edenderry hospital has the hallmarks of its time and, although it fulfilled its purpose then, the hospital now falls below standards required for such institutions.</P>
    <P>I have visited the hospital on a number of occasions.  It is divided into two sections: seven men occupy one section and seven women occupy the other. There is little space in each section and it is difficult to move between the beds. Many of the patients are elderly and incapacitated and the nurses have great difficulty discharging their duties in such confined space.  Nevertheless, I have rarely seen patients so clean and in such good spirits.  They are a credit to the nursing staff and the people who run the hospital.  Although the hospital is clean and the patients are well cared for, the conditions under which they are expected to live are below standard.  It is reprehensible that people are obliged to live in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Midland Health Board produced a plan for Offaly in 1985 which provided for a 50 bed unit in Tullamore, a 50 bed unit in Edenderry and the Birr District Hospital was to receive an extra 40 beds. I am sory to say that no progress has been made.  Edenderry hospital in view of its bad condition, was first on the list for improvement but nothing has been done. The hospital is part of the old workhouse system of the 1800s.  At present the building is a borderline fire hazard.  The walls are damp.  It is neither sufficient nor good enough.  When I see the way national resources have been spent over the last number of months it angers and upsets me.  I feel indignant that money was wasted on unnecessary projects whereas Edenderry District Hospital is absolutely essential.  The Department of Health's budget is in the region of £2,000 million. A hospital for Edenderry would cost approximately £800,000 but that money is not being made available.</P>
    <P>I recently visited the Minister for Health, as part of a deputation and I was told no resources were available this year.  I find that unacceptable.  People are born into this world for a short time only and are entitled to live lives of dignity, <Col N="98" /> especially in old age.  A society which cannot organise itself to allow people to live in dignity, especially in their final years is failing in its duty.  Irrespective of where is comes from money must be found for Edenderry District Hospital. The Minister has an obligation to obtain those resources.  Millions of pounds can be found for other projects, yet the Minister cannot find the money necessary for this hospital.</P>
    <P>Offaly County Council has discussed this matter and I have attended public meetings where righteous indignation has been expressed by the people of Edenderry. Other hospitals seem to have jumped the queue leaving Edenderry behind; it is not good enough.  I demand that this hospital go ahead.  The Minister has spoken about Tallaght hospital which is expected to cost £120 million.  We do not want a big hospital in Edenderry, we had a hospital there in the past which accommodated 50 people.  In 1985 a proposal for a 50 bed hospital was passed and I demand that moneys be allocated immediately to enable work to commence, not next year or the year after, but this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator Enright said money was being wasted on certain projects, I wish he had identified those projects to the Department of Health.  The Health budget this year is just short of £2,000 million, a considerable sum in a country of Ireland's size and resources.  I assure Senator Enright that every penny spent by the Department of Health this year is well accounted for.  Indeed, we could spend five times as much money if we had it.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for providing a community nursing unit in Edenderry lies with the Midland Health Board.  Traditionally, the needs of frail elderly persons were met by admitting them to long-stay hospitals.  This practice is now generally held to be unsatisfactory.  It is now accepted that greater attention needs to be paid to the development of community based services so elderly persons can continue to live in their homes, with assistance if necessary, for as long as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations on services for <Col N="99" /> the elderly contained in the Report &ldquo;The Years Ahead&rdquo; have been adopted by Government and are being progressively implemented.  In the past few years the Government has allocated substantial additional funds to the Midland Health Board.  During this time the board has considerably improved services for the elderly throughout the region.  The home nursing, home care and home help services have benefited while liaison nurses have also been appointed.  Respite care beds have also been introduced in all long-stay hospitals.  Arrangements have also been put in place for assessing applications for places in the board's long-stay hospitals and welfare homes.  These arrangements ensure that those people in most need of such accommodation actually get it.  Overall, there has been much improvement in the services being provided for the elderly and in the co-ordination of these services.</P>
    <P>It must be acknowledged, however, that some of our long-stay accommodation for the elderly does not meet modern day standards and needs to be replaced.  As the Senator is aware, the provision of a new 40 bed nursing unit for the elderly at Edenderry District Hospital is regarded by the Midland Health Board as a vital element of their community care programme.  This planned development is consistent with the recommendations contained in &ldquo;The Years Ahead&rdquo; Approval to go to tender will be conveyed as soon as I am satisfied that the necessary funding, in excess of £1 million, is available.  I must also take into account competing demands for capital funding from all over the country and indeed the internal priorities of the Midland Health Board.</P>
    <P>I would like to add that at present there are 1,005 public long stay places available for the elderly in the Midland Health Board which is generous by comparison with the norms recommended in &ldquo;The Years Ahead&rdquo;, and by comparison with levels of provision elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In addition to the health board homes there are 462 places in private and voluntary nursing homes of which 144 are subvented by the health board.  The Senator will be pleased to know that I <Col N="100" /> intend to implement the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 in the very near future. This Act provides a new legal framework for the regulation of nursing homes and, when the Act is implemented, a statutory duty will be placed on nursing homes to register with the health board in whose region they are located.</P>
    <P>Also, a new system of subvention will be introduced for dependent persons who require nursing home care.  Under the new subvention system, a health board may pay a subvention to a person whose dependency, means and circumstances have been assessed by the health board in respect of care in a registed nursing home.  Draft regulations setting out the new conditions for the payment of subvention under the new scheme have been prepared and discussions have commenced with the nursing home interests on these draft regulations.  The Act therefore, will provide the health board with another option in meeting the needs of the dependent elderly, locally and flexibly.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out to the Senator that there has been a fair share of positive action insofar as services for the elderly in the Midland Health Board are concerned. I would ask him to accept the commitment of this Government to the continued development of services for the elderly in the Midland Health Board area as shown by the generous additional funding for services for the elderly in the last few years.  I can assure the people of Edenderry and surrounding district that there is full appreciation of the need to provide this proposed new unit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I bring before the House this evening the motion that Seanad Éireann considers the rôle of Bord Fáilte and regional tourism organisations after the county enterprise partnership boards are set up.  The motion arises out of concern for the future.  The enterprise boards are welcome in most counties and particularly County Donegal where we have a number of longstanding agencies but inadequate ability and funding to promote enterprise and provide jobs.  I am concerned about the <Col N="101" /> development of the tourism industry in County Donegal although I would not claim to be more concerned than the Minister of State whose constituency is environmentally unspoiled and is crying out for development.</P>
      <P>I have examined the contribution made by Bord Fáilte to County Donegal.  I do not have accurate figures, but in 1989 the Bord Fáilte budget was about £30 million of which about £4.5 million was spent on funding the regional tourism organisations. I believe those organisations were well intentioned when they were set up as promotional bodies but they never received adequate funding.  The northwest region has great potential for tourism development.  I look at that region and ask myself what has the regional tourism organisation contributed.  I am disappointed that the organisation was never properly funded even though it has a good public profile.  The money they get only pays for staff, administration structure and literature.</P>
      <P>I have no respect for Bord Fáilte. While many say it is a wonderful organisation and has done much for tourism, I remain unconvinced.  The Government has allocated £30 million to Bord Fáilte. This organisation is top-heavy, there are three offices in Dublin and nine offices outside the country.  There is a serious duplication at international level which is absorbing the budget.  Some of the larger groups involved in tourism will tell me I do not know what I am talking about because they are doing well.  I have been interested in tourism for some time and it is good to know these groups benefit from Bord Fáilte's current marketing campaign.  However, there seems to be no help forthcoming from Bord Fáilte for the smaller operator in rural areas.</P>
      <P>As I see it, there will be a certain amount of duplication in the work of the enterprise boards, the regional tourism organisations and Bord Fáilte.  There is a great deal of confusion about the responsibilities of each body.  If a public representative wanted to help somebody planning a project he would have to know which agency would serve that project best.  There are good people at the top of these bodies and their intentions are good but they do not have enough authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="102" /> We are concerned about duplication of responsibilities.  In local authorities we say that when you pay the engineers and the administration, you will only have enough money to put oil in the lamp. Excessive duplication would disillusion those interested in developing tourism. The enterprise boards should have power and adequate funding but this is not the case with the regional tourism organisations or Bord Fáilte.  They currently cater for a small section and their role must be re-examined in light of the new enterprise boards.  I ask the Minister to raise this matter with the Minister for Finance and other Ministers involved in promoting tourism.  I am sure the Minister of State, is as aware of the problem as I.  We have too many institutions with very little power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher, Donegal South-West) Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher, Donegal South-West)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Donegal South-West</i>): I thank Senator McGowan for raising this important matter this evening.</P>
      <P>In the absence of the Minister for Tourism and Trade, I am pleased to have the opportunity to outline to the House the measures which are being adopted to ensure close co-operation, which is essential between existing tourism structures and the new enterprise boards.</P>
      <P>As the House may know, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, who has responsibility for the formation of the enterprise boards, has just reported to the Government on his review of the arrangements for the establishment of county enterprise partnership boards and will be announcing the details of the arrangements to be made for the establishment of these boards within the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the establishment of the enterprise boards, the Minister for Tourism and Trade is very conscious of the need to have efficient and effective institutional structures set in place for the promotion and development of tourism at regional and county level.  Following a detailed review of the co-ordination of tourism at regional level, as recommended by the Tourism Task Force and confirmed in the Programme for a Partnership Government, he recently <Col N="103" /> announced changes in Irish tourism structures, which should facilitate close co-operation and practical working arrangements between the RTOs and the enterprise boards, once they are established. Senator McGowan referred to duplication; none of us wants to see this.  It is essential that all agencies work closely together to ensure the maximum effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The RTOs will continue to have responsibility for tourism development at regional level, which will include the production of regional tourism development plans, the development of marketing functions at regional, trans-regional and trans-county level and, finally, a servicing rôle which will include the operation of the National Tourist Information Office network and accommodation requirements. The enterprise boards will be responsible for stimulating, assisting and co-ordinating community and rural based enterprise projects in the tourism sector, which can be developed around job creation opportunities.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte would agree that more could be done if the additional finance that is required was available.  I have no doubt Bord Fáilte at all times seek to obtain a bigger budget but it is difficult to make available all the money that is needed.  They do their utmost to work efficiently for the various regions with the money available.</P>
    <P>The Minister is currently examining mechanisms for improved representation for tourism interests at county level in the development of county tourism action plans, which will feed into regional tourism development plans.  In doing this, the Minister is working in close co-operation with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  It is anticipated that these new arrangements, which will shortly be finalised, will offer enormous potential and opportunities for the RTOs and the future enterprise boards to work closely <Col N="104" /> together in developing tourism to its full potential at regional and county level.</P>
    <P>As agreed with the RTOs, the Minister for Tourism and Trade is examining the suitability of the corporate structures of the RTOs to meet those objectives and is assessing the changes required to streamline their work and to facilitate efficient cooperation between activities at regional and county level.</P>
    <P>Turning to the rôle of Bord Fáilte, as the House knows, its main functions are laid down in the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939-87.  Its primary rôle is to encourage and promote the development of tourist traffic in and out of the State.  It is now widely accepted that there is tremendous potential for wealth and job creation through growth in tourism revenue.  Bord Fáilte plays a vital role in co-ordinating the function of export marketing and product development to enable the sector to achieve its full potential.</P>
    <P>While the new structures will provide for the development to county level of responsibilities for local tourism development, Bord Fáilte will continue to have responsibility for co-ordinating overseas marketing and promotion.</P>
    <P>If we are to create much needed jobs in this country we must focus on our natural assets and what more natural asset have we than the tourism industry? It has been proven over the last number of years that more jobs have been created in the tourism industry than in any other. We are told that by the year 2000 the greatest single industry will be the leisure industry and to capitalise on this we must have our structures in place.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Senator and the House that the points raised by him will be brought to the attention of the Minister for Tourism and Trade.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 May 1993.</P>
