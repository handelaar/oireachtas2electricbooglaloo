      <P>I have notice from Senator McDonagh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to immediately sanction the appointment of a Timire Gaeilge for County Galway vocational education committee exclusively, as otherwise the committee's programme of Irish language promotions will grind to a halt.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Sherlock of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to clarify the position in relation to 32 children in third class in Scoil Ghobnatán, Mallow, County Cork, who have been without a teacher since September last.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Roche of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to intervene in the dispute which has lead to the discontinuation of light, telephone, nursing and other vital services to the senior citizens resident in Clonmallon, Ashford, County Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1470" /> I regard the matters raised by Senators McDonagh and Sherlock as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule the matter raised by Senator Roche as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <P>I am sure the House would want me to wish both the Taoiseach and Tánaiste well in their visit to London this morning in their effort to secure peace for this island.  Today could be a very historic one for this country.  I am sure others will wish them both well on behalf of all who live on this island.</P>
      <P>Today's Order of Business will be Items 1, 2 and 37.  Item 1 will be taken from now until its conclusion and we will then proceed to Item 2.  I suggest 20 minutes per spokesperson and 15 minutes thereafter.  Item 37 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and Item 2 will continue at 8 p.m. to be concluded before 10 p.m.</P>

      <P>I join with the Leader of the House in wishing the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Irish team well in the discussions.  If what appears to be on the cards today happens, a framework will have been put in place in which real progress can be made.  Nobody wants to exaggerate the possibilities as there are still a number of people to be brought on side and a number of problems to be overcome.  However, what is happening is extremely positive.  The Irish Government has the luxury of all party support on this major matter and that should be a source of great strength to it today. On behalf of my own party I wish those involved the very best of luck.</P>
      <P>On more mundane matters, I want to refer to the legislation being taken between now and the end of the session. The Government proposes to push two Bills through all Stages tomorrow.  That is not acceptable and will be opposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply giving a deed of foresight, a Chathaoirligh.  You may rule me out of order, but I also want to mention next week's business.  When we spoke to the Whips earlier there were two proposals for next week&mdash;all Stages of the Aer Lingus Bill and the introduction of the Appropriation Bill, as is normal at this time of the year.  We are now told that two other Items may be proposed for next week.  We will particularly resist any attempt to push through all Stages of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) (Amendment) Bill next week because there is one part of that Bill which affects the working conditions of many Members of this House.  It is a Bill which needs to be teased out in legal and trade union terms and it would be unfair&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh.  I also ask the Leader if he could provide the House with some elaboration and information on the refusal of the Government to allow the President to accept the position relating to reform of the UN.  The Labour members of the Cabinet must have been absent when this was decided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>My party would be prepared to consider any legislation which <Col N="1472" /> would allow the President to accept this offer which reflects honour on this country and indeed could make a contribution to the development of the UN.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak for Senator Henry and myself when I join with Senator Manning in wishing the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste every success today.  I regard today as an historic day and I know I speak on behalf of everybody in this House when I say that we look forward to the success of this.  It is a day of opportunity and we hope to grasp the opportunity on this occasion.  While the work of the Seanad is going on here this morning there is an opportunity for those who are not involved here to hear the voice of Unionism in Buswells Hotel at 12 o'clock.  Dr. Chris McGimpsey is speaking to a group from the Glencree Centre for Reconciliation and I know all Members are welcome.</P>
      <P>In regard to more mundane matters, which Senator Manning also spoke about, I shiver whenever I read the words &ldquo;all Stages&rdquo;.  We are in danger of allowing ourselves to be treated as a rubber stamp whenever we do that.  It is imperative, in spite of all the legislation which has to come through the House between now and Christmas, that we at least urge the Leader to take one step, that is to have some sort of a gap between the Stages.  The Bills which are coming through this week may come through, but at least let us arrange to have some gap between the various Stages.  If we do not achieve this we are in serious danger of accepting the term &ldquo;rubber stamp&rdquo; with which we have been branded on occasion in this House.  We will deserve it if we permit that to be done to us in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We all extend to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the British Prime Minister every good wish in their efforts this morning to advance the cause of <Col N="1473" /> peace on our island.  The words we use before we assemble in the mornings, &ldquo;Direct our actions, oh Lord&rdquo; would be appropriate in their circumstances as well this morning.</P>
      <P>It is important to say that in these circumstances it is appalling that we continue to see bombs being used in Northern Ireland and that people have been killed in the past few days.  So there are many hurdles to be cleared.  These matters underline the call we made yesterday that we would return to the adjourned matter of Statements on Northern Ireland, Item 10, as soon as possible as it would afford us an opportunity to comment on what is taking place.  It has been stated by many people on all sides of the House that the tone of the debate which has taken place here has been balanced, reasonable and constructive and I am sure it will continue in that vein.</P>
      <P>The other matter has to do with GATT.  It seems extraordinary that the French National Assembly meets to decide formally the position of France on a GATT deal and we seem to be able to conduct all of these international treaties and negotiations unilaterally without any reference at all to Parliament.  That is undemocratic and these matters should be brought back and referred to Parliament.</P>
      <P>In respect of the legislation coming to us, the consideration of Bills and taking all Stages of a Bill, it is reasonable to say that where we are given adequate time we frequently detect flaws in Bills.  It is not a question of scoring political points, frequently this House has detected flaws in Bills and has improved them as a result of detecting those flaws.  That is why it is very important that there should be an interval between Second Stage and subsequent Stages for consideration of Bills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with the other Members on behalf of the Labour group in wishing well to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the British Government today.  Hours of painstaking preparation have gone into this occasion and I hope that everybody on all sides will respond carefully to the total package and the <Col N="1474" /> total document with generosity and that there will not be any quick responses without due thought.  This is a day of hope and a day for the future.  We hope it will go well for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I, too, wish to note the importance of this day and to wish all concerned success.  Hopefully, it will be a very fruitful day and will bring almost 800 years of extraordinary relationships between two neighbouring islands closer to the peace and tranquillity which should exist between neighbours.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to question your ruling on the matter relating to Clonmallon, a Chathaoirligh, because I know that you and your office have given generous consideration to this.  I accept that your hands are tied on this and that there is nothing you can do.  I have discussed the matter with your office.  We are all concerned on all sides of the House.  Is there a device whereby I could raise this matter by way of statement at the end of business tonight?</P>

      <P>I am glad the Senator is not in any way challenging my ruling, because it is a precedent of great standing in this House that that position would continue.  I am prepared at any time during the day to discuss how he may raise this matter, but at this time I have ruled that it is unsuitable for discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other Members in wishing both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Mr. Major well in their statement, and settlement proposals which, I understand, are to be announced today at midday.  We have been very wise here not to make any prejudgment on the matter.  Tomorrow, when we know what <Col N="1475" /> is in the declaration, it would be good that this House would discuss it.  I therefore ask the Leader if he could give us even half an hour, not at 11.30 p.m. tomorrow but first thing tomorrow morning when we sit, to make a judgment and an offer of support or to allow us to express our opinions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to join with the others in wishing the leaders of both Governments well in their deliberations in finding a solution to the problem in Northern Ireland, the outcome of which will be vitally important for this island of Ireland.  Because of the dialogue which has gone on for such a long time one would be hopeful that there will be a solution to the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to what Senator Manning said, this process, if it comes about this afternoon, has been the result of much work by many people, not least the non-partisan approach of the Opposition, which has been a very important ingredient in this State in getting agreement.  We should mark that.  I also wish to mark the fact that progress is also due to the patience of Mr. Garrett Fitzgerald who teased out the situation to the point we are at today.  It was his patience in dealing with somebody whom I am not a great admirer of that brought us to this stage.  I am delighted that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have brought the process thus far, but it is also fitting that we mention those who went before them, those who built brick upon brick in a process, the result of which, hopefully, we will see this afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with Senator Wilson in requesting time tomorrow morning to discuss the details of this declaration and to wish the Taoiseach and Mr. Major every success in the very serious task upon which they are embarking today.  I join also with Senator Manning in relation to finding out the precise details of the circumstances in which the Government refused President Robinson to accept the offer from the United <Col N="1476" /> Nations.  I wish to find out in the constitutional and legal detail on which this matter was decided.</P>
      <P>There is another matter, a Chathaoirligh, which Senator Quinn referred to earlier.  It is in regard to the relevance of this House and the question of rubber stamping.  This House is part of the Oireachtas, one of three component parts under the Constitution.  It is very important that all Members of this House recognise that and do nothing to diminish the status of the Seanad.  I am concerned that it is proposed to reschedule our business tomorrow to accommodate the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to hear Mr. Arafat in this Chamber. I disagree with that, a Chathaoirligh&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach well in their discussions with the British Government this morning, and I hope a means to peace will come out of them.  The meeting Senator Quinn organised for 12 p.m. today is timely and as many people as possible should attend because, as a northerner, I feel sometimes that we in the South do not know enough about the North.  This is a unique opportunity to listen to somebody from what one would call &ldquo;the other side of the fence.&rdquo;  I also welcome the announcement yesterday by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, in her efforts to tackle crime and drugs.  I hope this House will have an opportunity shortly to discuss both issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure my friend Senator Magner and my distinguished colleague, Senator Manning, will not accuse me of being partisan if I put on the record of the House, in the context of their remarks about the process currently underway in London, that the person who conceived the idea of the totality of relationships, as far back as 1981, was the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey.  It should be acknowledged that he commenced the process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach did yesterday in the Dáil, I would like to recognise the support this peace process has received from all parties.  With regard to an opportunity to comment on any statement or press conference that might take place, the Whips will have a discussion on that tomorrow morning.  As regards all Stages of Bills being taken in one day, many of us have to live with circumstances whereby, at the end of each term, various legislation has to be dealt with by certain deadlines.  In this session it is the first time we have dealt with all Stages in such a way.  It is not something I want to present to the House or to the Chief Whip, but there are times when legislation has to be dealt with by a certain deadline.  If the House so requires, a short break can be arranged between Second Stage and Committee Stage of the Bill.  There will be a sos between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. and the Adjournment Matters will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 23, after &ldquo;1967&rdquo; to insert&rdquo;, and in accordance with Article 8c of the Treaty on European Union 1993&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason I tabled this amendment is that since this Bill was initially drafted the Maastricht Treaty has come into force and we are now part of the European Union.  As such, certain questions can be raised under this Bill in relation to residents from various member states in third countries which would not have consular representatives from their particular state.  Under the Treaty of European Union they would now be entitled to consular services from other member states.  In that regard the question arises of Irish people paying fees to other member states' consular services, or in the case of our acting on behalf of citizens of other member states, their paying fees to our consular services.</P>
      <P>It is important to ensure that at all times our citizens have access to consular services, wherever they may go in the world.  We appreciate there is an international dimension under the Diplomatic and Consular Fees Act, 1939, whereby we have international obligations and, in turn, other countries have international obligations to us.  There is an opportunity here for us to tie up this matter.  On Committee Stage of this Bill the Minister talked about the issue of sovereignty.  I felt then, and I repeat the point today, that the question of sovereignty was dealt with in the Maastricht Treaty and now that it is in force it is a false premise on which to make an argument in relation to the details of section 1.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister has had an opportunity to reconsider since Committee Stage and can now accede to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the section as it stands it is clear that &ldquo;career consular officer&rdquo; and &ldquo;honorary consular <Col N="1479" /> officer&rdquo; have the meaning given to them in the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.  Section 2 of the Bill states that it applies to certain civil servants and other officers appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, all, obviously, officers and representatives of the State. If the amendment were accepted it would mean that &ldquo;career consular officer&rdquo; and &ldquo;honorary consular officer&rdquo; would be interpreted in accordance with Article 8c of the Treaty on European Union.  This would be unclear.  It could conceivably be interpreted as meaning that consular officers of other EU states would have powers under the Act equal to those of Irish officers.  That is not the intention of this Bill or of Article 8c of the Treaty.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary for officers of other EU states to have such powers to put Article 8c into effect.  Each state applies its own law and regulations concerning diplomatic and consular protection to all EU citizens in countries outside the Union, without distinction.  Article 8c is about equality of treatment of EU citizens to whom certain diplomatic and consular services are rendered.  This Bill is about Irish officials entitled to provide diplomatic and consular services and the two matters should not be confused.  The services which are the subject of the Bill are available to people of all nationalities and this is an important point.  A possible effect of amending section 1 as proposed would be to restrict the application of the Act to EU citizens, which nobody wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that in proposing this amendment Senator Taylor-Quinn was concerned with acknowledging in the Bill that European union is now a reality with a diplomatic and consular dimension. Much as we sympathise with that, we have found no way of putting in a reference to Article 8c of the Treaty on European Union which would not adversely affect the substance of what is essentially a simple Bill to tidy up outdated legislation from the 1930s. Although I cannot accept the amendment for the reasons outlined, I appreciate the <Col N="1480" /> Senator's intentions but the amendment could have an adverse effect on the application of legislation for citizens outside the European Union.  I do not think anybody would like that.  We have guidelines for the protection of unrepresented EU nationals by EU missions in third countries under Article 8c of the treaty.  I would be glad to give the Senator details of the guidelines but I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not give a more positive response on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I hope there will be further discussion in relation to the guidelines and that they will be put on a more formal basis at European Union level.  If I could get an assurance on that from the Minister and that there would be a uniformity of action and approach within the foreign ministries in the EU, I would be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>We discussed this amendment in detail in the lower House.  I was sympathetic to the view of the Deputy there and I am also sympathetic to the views of the Senator in this instance. However, we must take advice from the parliamentary draftsman.  Whereas the <Col N="1481" /> amendment would make section 2 look tidier, the meaning of the last part of the section would be less clear.  It is a drafting issue.  There would be consequential effects if the present wording were altered.  We had detailed discussions on this in the presence of the Senator in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. On the advice of the parliamentary draftsman, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, after line 45, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) where fees have been collected for a particular service (including applications for registration in the Foreign Births Register in the Department of Foreign Affairs, or in the Foreign Births Entry Book kept in missions abroad), the restriction on the delivery of such service arising from statutory time limits shall not apply.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, citizenship and passports were to be issued to people who had applied and had their applications processed by 31 December 1986.  A number of people applied and, unfortunately, by the expiry date, perhaps because there was such an enormous response to the offer, 3,000 of the 7,000 applications were unprocessed.  The bulk of unprocessed applications are in the Consulate General's offices in New York and Johannesburg in South Africa and have been lying there for the past seven years.  The fees have been paid and have not been refunded.  Passports have not been issued to the applicants.  This is a serious situation which should not be allowed to continue.  Legislation should be introduced and this amendment should be included in the Bill to allow these applications to be processed so that citizenship and passports may be given to the applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1482" /> We are aware of the tremendous goodwill and support we receive from Irish Americans in the United States, the general public, business people and politicians. Numerous requests and representations have been made to various Ministers in the Governments of the last seven years seeking to have this matter resolved.  Unfortunately, it has not been to date.  It is time that we showed goodwill towards these people.</P>
    <P>The situation in South Africa is possibly more serious as the political scene there is very unstable at present.  We hope that the democratic process will be established without huge difficulties in the months ahead but one does not know what political crisis may arise.  We have a responsibility to anybody who is entitled to Irish citizenship under our laws to process and issue passports to applicants.</P>
    <P>We realise that third and fourth generation Irish people are entitled to passports. However, it is disgraceful that this situation has continued over the past seven years.  The Department and consecutive Governments have been remiss in not seeing the fine opportunity to not only extend this facility but to provide that opportunity to many other people of Irish extraction.</P>
    <P>Over 44 million people in the United States are of Irish extraction.  In Australia almost 6.5 million people &mdash; about one third of the Australian population &mdash; are of Irish extraction.  There is a glorious opportunity for the Government to recognise the potential for Irish tourism by opening up this facility.  I urge the Minister to do so.  Only a small change in the legislation is necessary.  I hope the Minister can reiterate what he said on Report Stage in the Dáil that the Minister for Justice would be prepared to introduce a citizenship Bill shortly to allow that facility and I hope the Government can act expeditiously on the issue.</P>

      <P>What is at issue is the timing of the presentation of a Bill by the Minister for Justice to amend the Irish <Col N="1483" /> Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986. Such new legislation is necessary to enable the registration of the births abroad of about 4,000 people whose applications for citizenship could not be processed by the deadline of 31 December 1986.  It is inappropriate to try to deal with that issue by means of this amendment.  The problem must and will be addressed in another nationality and citizenship Bill.  This amendment would cause more legal difficulties than it would resolve.</P>
      <P>As promised on 11 November in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, I wrote to the Minister for Justice expressing the concerns of the committee about the negative implications for our reputation abroad due to this problem remaining unresolved after nearly seven years.  She informed me that whereas she had hoped to address a number of citizenship issues in one comprehensive Bill, to avoid further delay she has now instructed her officials to prepare a short Bill dealing solely with the applications for registration outstanding since 1986. The Bill will be introduced as soon as possible.  The House cannot expect any clearer commitment from the Minister for Justice.  In the circumstances I hope the amendment will be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for informing the House of the intention of the Minister for Justice to present a short Bill dealing specifically with issues that arise under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986.  I welcome this announcement and I depend on the Minister of State and his fellow Galwegian to ensure that prompt action is taken on this matter and to recognise, in particular, the urgency of the situation in South Africa.  We should not underestimate or diminish this in any way.  I look forward to the publication of this Bill early in the New Year.</P>

      <P>I thank the House for its co-operation because I am anxious to deal with this Bill as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House is slightly different from the Bill as initiated. Section 5 (2), which relates to the powers of officers abroad to take oaths and declarations and to do notarial acts, lacked a degree of clarity.  The section stated that a document which had affixed or impressed thereon or thereto the seal of any person to whom the section applied should be admitted in evidence. However, the seal used in most cases is the official seal of the embassy.  Accordingly, additional words were added to remove any doubt about the matter.  Consequential change had to be made in section 1, in the definition &ldquo;head of mission&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I wanted to inform the House that there is a slight change in the Bill as initiated.  I assure the House, as I explained to Members of the other House, that this is to ensure the Bill's clarity.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms Burton) Joan Burton">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are over 2,000 people engaged in share fishing. This Bill will enable them to opt for social insurance protection for themselves and their families during periods of illness and unemployment and for dental and optical treatment under the treatment benefit scheme.  The Bill, as initiated, provided for the introduction of a new optional scheme of social insurance <Col N="1485" /> for share fishermen.  The Bill also provided for regulatory powers under which specified employers and contractors may be required to keep a register of employees, contractors and subcontractors engaged by them.</P>
      <P>A number of amendments were made to the Bill on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil.  These amendments entitle volunteer development workers to the full rate of unemployment benefit and disability benefit on their return from abroad; bring forward by a year the date on which share fishermen who opt into the new scheme will become entitled to benefits; extend cover for treatment benefit to share fishermen who opt into the scheme and to their dependent spouses and provide for an amendment to the Pensions Act, 1990, relating to the selection of member trustees of occupational pension schemes.</P>
      <P>Share fishermen were traditionally regarded as being employed under a contract of service and as such were insured as employees paying the standard Class A contributions.  Arising from a case brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Collector-General in 1986&mdash;the McLoughlin case &mdash; the High Court held that the skipper of a particular fishing vessel and his crew should not be regarded as employer and employees for PAYE purposes.  This decision did not directly affect the insurability status of share fishermen but as they were no longer covered by the PAYE system, it was necessary to amend the regulations regarding the collection of PRSI contributions from share fishermen.  The amending provisions introduced at the time, deemed the owner, bailee or lessee of the fishing vessel, as appropriate, to be the employer of the crew for social insurance purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a subsequent challenge to these provisions in 1992 &mdash; the Griffiths case &mdash; the High Court found the regulations to be <i>ultra vires</i> and held that a person could only be deemed to be an employer where an employer/employee relationship existed.  This meant that in the absence of a contract of service, share fishermen could no longer be regarded as <Col N="1486" /> employees for social insurance purposes. They then became insured as self-employed persons, covered for widow's and orphan's pensions and old age (contributory) pension.</P>
    <P>Following on the decision of the High Court, consultations took place with representatives of the fishing industry to discuss their concerns regarding the absence of cover for short term benefits.  Share fishermen quite rightly regard themselves as being in a unique position in so far a social insurance is concerned.  Their sudden exclusion from insurance as employees in 1992 arose as a consequence of the court's decision and not through any fault on their part.  This Bill addresses the problems which arose from the court's decision by providing share fishermen with vital cover for unemployment and illness.</P>
    <P>The proposed new scheme, which is provided for in Part II of the Bill, gives share fishermen the option of paying special additional contributions.  Share fishermen who opt into the new scheme will pay special contributions at the rate of 5 per cent of their income in the previous income tax year, up to the PRSI earnings ceiling.  A minimum annual contribution of £250 will apply and the contributions payable will be collected directly by my Department.</P>
    <P>The Bill as published provided that contributions would be payable from the income tax year commencing 6 April 1994, thereby enabling share fishermen who opt into the scheme to qualify for benefits with effect from January 1996. This issue was highlighted by representatives of the fishing industry during the course of consultations they had with the Department following publication of the Bill.  The issue was also raised by a number of Deputies on the Second Stage debate in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Recognising these concerns, an amendment was introduced on Report Stage of the Bill in the Dáil which will enable share fishermen who opt into the scheme to start paying the new contributions in the current income tax year. This amendment means that share fishermen will qualify for benefits a year <Col N="1487" /> earlier, that is, from January 1995 as compared with January 1996 under the Bill as initiated.</P>
    <P>A second issue highlighted following publication of the Bill was that of the benefits to which share fishermen will be entitled.  The Bill as initiated provided that those who opt into the scheme will be able to qualify for disability benefit for up to 12 months in any continuous period of illness.  Share fishermen will also be entitled to unemployment benefit for up to 13 weeks in each calendar year.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the fishing industry expressed concern, however, about the absence of cover for treatment benefit. The benefits available under the treatment benefit scheme are highly valued.  I regard this as a particularly important scheme so far as women are concerned because the benefits are also available to dependent spouses, who are, by and large, women working in the home.  I am pleased, therefore, that is was possible to amend this aspect of the Bill to provide that the optional contributions to be paid by share fishermen will also provide cover for treatment benefit.  This special scheme of social insurance for share fishermen is an important development in the provision of comprehensive social insurance cover.</P>
    <P>Share fishermen became insured as self-employed following the High Court decision in 1992.  Many of those affected find this difficult to understand.  A substantial number of the skippers involved regard themselves as employers and would wish to see their crews insured as employees.  Representatives of the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation, for example, have indicated that 50 per cent of the skippers in this area regard themselves as employers.  At the same time, most of the crews involved in share fishing regard themselves as employees and wish to be insured as such.</P>
    <P>My Department has no discretion in this, however, because the High Court decisions of 1986 and 1992 effectively rule out the possibility of treating skippers as employers for social insurance purposes, unless the crew are employed under a <Col N="1488" /> contract of service.  One suggestion put forward aimed at resolving this problem was to extend the scope of the new scheme so as to enable the skippers to opt to pay a contribution in respect of their crew equivalent to that payable by employers.  In place of attempting to legislate for an optional scheme for the skippers, it would be preferable for them to organise their affairs in such a way that the crew are employed under a contract of service.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it known that, following consultations with the Office of the Attorney General, guidelines aimed specifically at share fishermen as to what constitutes employment under contract of service will be made available.  The advantage of this approach is that it will meet the needs of those skippers who wish to be treated as employers without having to enact legislation which might be challenged at some future date.</P>
    <P>The next amendment to the Bill deals with volunteer development workers. There are over 400 volunteer development workers in Africa, South America and Asia at present.  Having worked as a development worker from 1983 to 1986 on the Irish development programme in Tanzania, I am especially pleased to be in a position to rectify an anomaly in the social welfare system which prevented numbers of returned volunteer development workers from qualifying for full rate unemployment benefit and disability benefit on their return home in the event of their being unemployed or unable to work because of illness.  I know this provision will be welcomed by the many Irish volunteers working abroad and by the overseas development agencies.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 to 13 of the Bill provide that volunteer development workers who would otherwise qualify for reduced rates of benefit, will now qualify for the full rate of unemployment benefit and disability benefit on their return to Ireland. Under existing provisions, volunteer development workers receive credited contributions while working overseas which enable them to qualify for unemployment benefit and disability benefit. To qualify for the full rate of payment, a <Col N="1489" /> person must have earnings of not less than £70 per week in the governing contribution year.  Reduced rates of benefit, which are related to the level of earnings, are payable to people whose income is below £70 per week.</P>
    <P>Volunteer development workers are paid at local rates of pay in the developing countries and only qualify for the minimum rate of payment because of the low level of local payments, especially in countries in Africa and Asia.  They then fail to qualify for the full rate of unemployment benefit on their return home. Sections 11 to 13 of the Bill will now entitle them to full rate unemployment benefit and disability benefits on their return from abroad.  I am pleased to be a member of a Government which has provided for a substantial increase in overseas development aid in addition to extending full social welfare benefits to volunteers, including maternity benefits provided in the budget earlier this year.</P>
    <P>The other amendment made relates to the Pensions Act, 1990.  Section 15 of the Bill is designed to remove a legal uncertainty in that legislation.  It confirms that the selection of trustees by members of occupational pension schemes requires a majority of members of the scheme who vote rather than a majority of the members of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Regulations made last July to enable members of pension schemes to elect their own trustees become effective on 1 January next.  The regulations provide that members of occupational pension schemes will be able to choose trustees to represent them.  Under the regulations it will be mandatory for all schemes with 50 members or more, and directly invested schemes with 12 members or more, to have member trustees if at least 15 per cent of the members or the members' trade union request the appointment of member trustees.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for regulatory powers under which employers and other people will be required to maintain certain records of employees and of contractors and subcontractors engaged by them.  The section also provides that the required records will have to be kept in <Col N="1490" /> a prescribed place.  A person who fails to keep records as required will be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to the standard penalties for offences under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>The various activities undertaken by my Department to combat fraud and abuse are highly effective.  The results achieved to date highlight the need to target the building and construction industry in particular.  The regulatory powers provided for in section 14 of the Bill will be used initially to require employers and contractors in this industry to keep records of their employees, contractors and subcontractors.  These records will have to be kept in the site office and they will be available for inspection by social welfare inspectors.</P>
    <P>Employers in prescribed industries, such as building and construction, forestry, security and road haulage, are already required to notify my Department of the date of commencement of all new employees and subcontractors engaged by them.  The new regulatory powers in section 14 will complement these provisions and be of significant benefit in combating fraud and abuse.</P>
    <P>The greatest concentration of our efforts in this area must be aimed at ensuring employers comply with their obligations under the PRSI system rather than at ensuring people at work are not concurrently claiming unemployment payments as has recently been suggested in the media.  In the view of the Department of Social Welfare and the many expert staff engaged in fraud prevention, the main thrust of our efforts should be aimed at employers.  We can massively increase compliance if we ensure all employers get all employees fully in the tax and PRSI systems.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage of this Bill in the Dáil there was a good deal of debate on the question of fraud and abuse.  In this context, it was suggested the social welfare code discourages unemployed people from taking up occasional work.  This should not be the case.  Earlier this year we introduced new provisions under which unemployed people who do occasional work can earn the equivalent <Col N="1491" /> to their daily rate of unemployment assistance plus £15 in respect of each day worked and still qualify for the full rate of assistance for the remaining days of the week on which they are unemployed. For example, an unemployed person with a dependent spouse and three children can earn up to £37 for each day worked without affecting his or her entitlement to unemployment assistance for other days of unemployment in that week.</P>
    <P>On the wider front, the new back to work allowance scheme is proving extremely successful.  I draw the attention of the Seanad to the scheme.  It provides unemployed people with the opportunity to pursue self-employment ventures or develop new opportunities in areas with potential for development, such as fisheries, local heritage projects, craft enterprises, local tourism and horticulture.</P>
    <P>Participants retain entitlement to 75 per cent of their weekly social welfare payments for one year and 50 per cent of their payments for a second year.  They also retain entitlement to secondary benefits, such as family income supplement, the Christmas bonus, medical card and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  They do not have to sign on at their local office and there is no limit on the amount they can earn from employment or self-employment.</P>
    <P>The work targeted under the scheme must be new and additional, it will not displace existing jobs and it has the potential for long-term sustainable employment.  The new scheme will cater for 3,000 long-term unemployed people and lone parents during the pilot phase. Although it is still at an early stage of development, 340 new jobs have already been created and a further 222 people have taken up self-employment under the scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition to these initiatives, about 4,000 people are participating in the vocational training opportunities scheme at present and over 700 are engaged in third level studies.  Both these initiatives were extended to lone parents this year. Those Senators involved in daytime education will know the improvements to the <Col N="1492" /> scheme have been extremely popular and that there has been a significant take-up.</P>
    <P>The integration of the tax and social welfare systems is one of the areas for which I have specific responsibility as Minister of State.  The issue is complex and I set up an expert working group last July to examine the area.  The group includes academic experts, people with experience in administering the systems and people familiar with the effects of the systems on clients.  The group has the task of identifying the problems arising from the interaction of the tax and social welfare systems and the steps necessary to achieve greater co-ordination and integration of the two systems with particular attention to the impact on people's incomes.</P>
    <P>I have asked the group to prepare an interim report focusing on poverty traps and disincentives as they affect groups such as lone parents.  I regard the elimination of disincentives as a primary objective of integration.  The problems of disincentives have been well documented. For example, in certain circumstances a married person with a large family can find he or she is better off on unemployment benefit or assistance than at work.  Many factors contribute to this, including the level of family support paid to those on social welfare, the value of non-cash benefits such as medical cards and subsidised rents, and the limitations of the tax system in providing family support to those at work.</P>
    <P>Poverty traps are not confined to traditional family types.  Much attention is given to poverty traps facing married men with large families.  Other families face similar problems.  Lone parents may find there is little point taking up work when they take account of the sharp withdrawal rate of lone parent's allowance as well as child care and other work related costs.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the take up rate of family income supplement is relatively low because the FIS can offer a substantial boost to low income earners with children.  Again, I have asked the expert working group to examine this in detail. An interim report of the group will be presented to the Government shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> In terms of longer term integration, there are a number of ways in which the tax and social welfare systems are inconsistent.  The income basis for tax and for social insurance contributions are not the same.  It is interesting to note that the Commission on Taxation was of the view that social insurance contributions should be replaced by a social security tax on all income.  While there was not unanimous agreement on that point, it merits further examination.</P>
    <P>The unit of assessment is different for tax and social welfare.  The tax system is based mainly on the individual where the social welfare system has a mixture of individual entitlements and household assessments.  There are also inconsistencies facing certain household types and the Senators will be aware of the best known example.  A cohabiting couple are treated as married by the social welfare system but in the tax system, they are treated as two single people.  The current arrangements are complex from an administrative point of view.  I know that measures such as basic income system are seen as a way of simplifying the overall system, but this would have major implications for redistribution and financing. We need an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages in this regard.</P>
    <P>The answers to some of these questions have far-reaching implications for how we, as a society, distribute our wealth but I think the time has come for a fundamental rethink of this area.  Ireland, like most other countries, has a tax system which is separate from the social welfare system.  Our social welfare system, in common with other west European countries, is a mixture of insurance and assistance schemes.  In recent years, the viability of such schemes is increasingly being questioned for a number of reasons.  Taxation and social security can be seen as two sides of the same coin rather than as separate entities.</P>
    <P>The social welfare model which we inherited was designed for an age of stable employment with relatively short bouts of sickness and unemployment. The weakness of the social insurance system, which was based on the assumption <Col N="1494" /> of low unemployment, is becoming increasingly evident with rising unemployment rates and the system does not cope adequately with the move towards more flexible work patterns.  Many young people, for example, now work on contracts or on a part-time and casual basis and these patterns seem set to grow.  It is in this context that we need to look critically at the existing systems and structures. I have asked the working group to examine these issues and I look forward to receiving their main report and informing the Members of it in more detail in due course.</P>
    <P>Another issue which is of relevance in achieving better co-ordination and integration of the tax and social welfare systems is the use of a common services number.  In 1979, a joint collection system, the PAYE/PRSI system, was introduced and the RSI or Revenue and social insurance number, was adopted as a common customer number for tax and social welfare purposes.  RSI numbers are now being issued to young people before they enter the labour force and it is the intention that every adult will have an RSI number that can be used when they wish to avail of a social welfare or related service, or perhaps make an inquiry from their local tax office.  The basis of RSI registration is the Department's central records system and the client's RSI number is shown on a social services card on which the client's name is also printed. The person's RSI number, date of birth and sex are encoded on the magnetic strip on the card and this data uses up virtually all the available space on the strip.  I wanted to make that point to the House because some people feared a lot of information might have been carried on this strip.</P>
    <P>The social services card is designed to facilitate improvements in the quality of services provided to our clients, including the elimination of unnecessary queueing. Only the Department itself, health boards, FÁS and the differential rent section have access to the data base, and only for limited inquiry purposes.  All access is governed by the Data Protection Act and the Data Protection Commissioner. <Col N="1495" /> The card carries no identity. There is no photograph or identifying marks on the card.  It simply has the person's name, RSI number and the date of issue.  It is not, as has been wrongly described, an identity card.  It is simply used for social welfare purposes.  Effectively, it will enable us to bring, I hope, social welfare standards up to that of banking.  It is equivalent to a bank card for social welfare purposes.  I hope it will help to eliminate queueing, which is an unfortunate feature of the relationship of many people with the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the poverty traps faced by lone parents.  This is an area in which I have a special interest.  Almost 40 per cent of women who become single mothers are in the 15 to 19 years age group.  I am particularly concerned about the difficulties faced by these young women because there are obstacles to their participation in the labour force and in education.  The Government has already extended the scheme for educational opportunities for the unemployed to include lone parents.  We know that the earlier young women become mothers, all too often leaving the education system, the more likely they are to become dependent on social welfare for long periods.  Interrupting this pattern is vital.</P>
    <P>There is a perception however, that single parenthood means that the individual is consigned to a lifetime of dependency on social welfare.  This is strongly contradicted by a study carried out in 1990 by the Department of Social Welfare. This study analysed a sample of new claims made in 1986 for unmarried mothers allowances, which has since been replaced by the lone parents allowance scheme.  The study showed that a quarter of those who qualified for payment in 1986 received the allowance for less than one year.  By the end of four years, nearly 60 per cent had ceased claiming the allowance.  These results clearly demonstrate that, contrary to popular myths, entry into lone parenthood does not necessarily represent permanent <Col N="1496" /> long term dependency on the social welfare system.  Nonetheless, it is those young lone parents who are most at risk of long term dependency.</P>
    <P>This Bill is important legislation.  It addresses the problems faced by share fishermen arising from the decision of the High Court last year.  It gives share fishermen cover for unemployment benefit, disability benefit and treatment benefit. The Bill entitles volunteer development workers to the full rate of unemployment and disability benefits and provides for new regulatory powers to tackle fraud and abuse of the PRSI and social welfare system.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can reply to that later.  I welcome the key features of the scheme but any person who made contributions, whether or not they were recognised as an employee, should be in benefit from those contributions, even if they were only contributors for half or part of the year before and the year before that.  I am confused about this.  I cannot understand how it can be said that these people are not entitled to benefits before an opportunity is created for them to come under social welfare schemes. There is only dental and optical benefit if one is prepared to wait &mdash; but one would be without one's teeth if one was waiting for dental benefit.</P>
      <P>I welcome the recognition at long last that people who are working on a part time basis, particularly people who have dangerous occupations such as fishermen, deserve benefits and most importantly that their spouses and families deserve them.  At the same time I am confused about the court's decision and I would like it clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that share fishermen who opt into the new scheme will pay special contributions at the rate of 5 per cent of their income in the previous income tax year, up to the PRSI earnings ceiling.  The Minister also said that a £250 contribution will apply.  This would also be relevant to people who work on a part time basis and there should be an <Col N="1498" /> opportunity for them to avail of it.  Why is it that only fishermen are mentioned and that the Bill does not recognise everybody?</P>
    <P>The Minister's officials are very much aware that I have made the point for many years that the best way forward regarding social welfare, PRSI and tax is that everybody should get the same benefit.  The Minister is now recognising this and the point has been proved over the years.  When we first discussed social welfare here there were 32 different sections dealing with payments for children and that is now down to six.  The number was lowered over the years and there were many arguments about it. When Fine Gael was in Government and former Deputy Barry Desmond was in office the number was reduced to 16.</P>
    <P>I strongly question the Minister's statement regarding share fishermen being able to opt for a 5 per cent rate.  Any person can now argue that they are entitled to and should get the same benefits. The Minister should not just give it to share fishermen and say that it may be relevant to the construction industry.  For many years I have spoken about the black economy in the construction industry. The Minister also mentioned an identity card.  I said in this House in 1985 that there should be a plastic job card and that every person leaving their local exchange should get one.</P>
    <P>I am seriously concerned about the Minister's statement regarding employers. The biggest disincentive contained in the statement is that full responsibility must be put on employers.  Incentive must be given to people who have the initiative to create employment.  Whether we are socially, communist or liberally minded, some people can create employment while others are there to be employed. The Minister should not create a situation where employers are told that they have the full responsibility.  That is a large disincentive for anybody to employ and the opposite should be the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister later stated that every possible incentive must be given to people to look for work.  She said that the greatest concentration of our efforts <Col N="1499" /> in this area needed to be aimed at ensuring that employers comply with their obligations in relation to the PRSI system rather than, as has recently been suggested in the media, aimed at ensuring that people at work are not concurrently claiming an unemployment payment. The responsibility should not be on the employer to say that a person is claiming benefits or not.  The responsibility lies on us, the Government and the Minister to create a situation where the person who is working is doing so legally.</P>
    <P>The Minister later said that a person can look for part time work and still draw part time unemployment assistance.  That is there since 1985 under the social employment scheme, which was introduced by former Minister Gemma Hussey, and there is nothing new about it.  The impression should not be given that there are new benefits available. These benefits are already there.</P>
    <P>Employers must keep everything up to date and certain files must be made available.  This is the one point we have heard today regarding jobs.  I would do anything to ensure that even five extra jobs become available and I do not mind who is in Government.  A situation should not created whereby a person is constantly in a hut on a construction site making special provisions so that when a social welfare officer comes certain matters will be available.  That is no incentive for a person to create jobs.  It is creating a situation whereby a person who is claiming unemployment assistance and going to work can do what he likes, but if the employer is found out he is in big trouble.  It should be done both ways. Employers can bring the Government to the High Court and prove it wrong.  This is what people in the fishing industry did and it prompted the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government should be saying that it wants to give every incentive possible to people to employ others, but the Minister is saying quite the opposite.  The Minister is saying that a person can work three days a week and receive another four days' unemployment assistance.  A <Col N="1500" /> person will get four days because it is benefit for seven days and that should not be forgotten.  People who are unemployed only get benefit for five days and if a person is employed they only get five days' wages, or perhaps six days if they work in the service area, such as a shop. The impression being given frightens me and I cannot let it pass.  I ask the Minister to clarify the position because it is unfair to people who want to create employment.</P>
    <P>If we are talking about the construction industry and contractors coming on site, are we saying that the major contractor must be responsible for all the subcontractors' people or just the subcontractor? Otherwise no incentive is created.  The Minister is saying that the person who is employing these people, whether they are subcontractors or otherwise, must account in detail for everybody on site.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that employers in prescribed industries such as building and construction, forestry, security and road haulage are already required to notify the Department of the date of commencement of all new employees and subcontractors engaged by them.  Does &ldquo;subcontractor&rdquo; mean a name or people?  The Department should be informed about the company, not the people employed by that company.  Subcontractors are responsible for their employees, whether in the black economy or otherwise, and that is dangerous. We must ensure all subcontractors on sites have job cards to show the main employer that they cannot draw benefits at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the structure and system which the Minister has set up.  Every employee of a company should have an RSI number and card.  That card should remain with the employer if the employee remains in employment for the next 40 years.  By so doing people could not claim benefits because their cards would not be at the local employment exchange. <Col N="1501" /> Current technology allows a card to be checked in a local employment exchange and this will determine if a person is breaking the law.  The Minister has spoken about this on many occasions on radio.  This responsibility should not be placed on employers, it should be placed on people who do not withdraw their cards.  These people, whether subcontractors or contractors, should be brought to court if discovered on a site. We must not create disincentives for those with initiative &mdash; for example, people who want to build 50 houses or someone who wants to go fishing.  It is not fair to give the impression that an RSI card is only for RSI facilities.</P>
    <P>I was amazed the Minister did not say that only the Department, health boards. FÁS and the differential rent section of Dublin Corporation have access to the database for limited inquiry purposes only.  It was unfair of the Minister not to say that and why did she not do so?  We must not give the impression that people do not have information about such cards.  I am not saying they should not have this information, because people drawing benefit from the State must be upfront.  We must not create the impression that this Bill is relevant because people working on a part time basis are getting the same facilities.</P>
    <P>I refer to social welfare benefits and facilities available to people such as lone parents.  I am conscious of problems faced by lone parents.  The Minister in her speech gave the impression that lone parents do not receive social welfare benefits for a long period, and I quote:</P>
    <P>This study analysed a sample of new claims made in 1986 for unmarried mother's allowance, which has since been replaced by the lone parent's allowance scheme.  The study showed that a quarter of those who qualified for payment in 1986 received the allowance for less than one year.  By the end of four years, nearly 60 per cent had ceased claiming the allowance.</P>
    <P>In other words, nearly 40 per cent continue to claim the allowance after four years.  Obviously, the remaining 60 per <Col N="1502" /> cent married &mdash; and we should be glad, because that is what life is about &mdash; but we must not give the impression that these people are working.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister when she said every possible benefit should be given to lone parents.  Everyone should receive as many benefits as possible.  We should not differentiate between people.  Those on social welfare should be treated equally and benefits should be relevant to men, women and children.  All children should receive the same benefit; so too should payees.</P>
    <P>While I congratulate the Minister of State on her commitment to social welfare and to voluntary workers abroad, I also congratulate her on giving the impression that the reductions in benefits introduced by the last Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, have been reversed.  Nobody should say the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; have been reversed.  I do not want to be political in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with a case of a person on disability benefit.  Investigations were carried out by the Department and, after an argument, it was agreed the individual was entitled to disability benefit because he had been seriously injured.  People must be investigated by the Department because there is a shortage of money and if we can save £0.5 million in interest, then why not. However, if a person being investigated by the Department ends up worse off, the Department and the Government have a responsibility to own up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the person I referred to sought disability benefit, he was unemployed, with a wife and three children.  Although I was not worried about him, I was worried about his wife and children.  He was given disability benefit, after a two year argument with the Department, doctors and officials, at enormous cost, because the doctors had to be paid and the investigation cost money.  However, he was only entitled to a graduated disability benefit as it was one of reductions in the <Col N="1503" />&ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo;.  I would like the Minister to reply, if that is not the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department told me it is true and I have it in writing.  It was implemented in January 1993 as part of the reductions which the last Minister for Social Welfare introduced.  The Minister should make sure she has the correct facts before she replies.</P>
      <P>This person now receives a graduated disability benefit.  He has a wife and three children and he gets £72 per week.  How can anyone say we are a caring society? He was told to go back on unemployment assistance because there was no job for him and he was entitled to it.  If he went back on unemployment assistance and did not turn up at his hatch on a Tuesday because he was injured, who would be responsible?  Although the Department has admitted that he is seriously injured, his wife, three children and himself must live on £72 per week.  If that is not part of the cuts implemented on 1 January 1993, I would like it clarified.</P>
      <P>That man could decide to apply for long term invalidity benefit because the Department said he is injured and is not able to work.  This would cost the State a further £22 per week because he would be entitled to benefits which he would not get while on disability benefit.  That is what I call cuteness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone should be entitled to the same benefits; there should be no classification or distinction between one claim and another.  This person will have to receive a long term invalidity pension because the Department has admitted he is badly injured.  He will then have free electricity, free television and free travel for his wife and himself, which he would not have on disability benefit, as well as other benefits.  This man has been very badly injured and the way he has been treated is despicable.  The Minister gives the impression that every possible benefit is being given.  That is welcome because people who cannot provide for themselves <Col N="1504" /> should receive every possible benefit.</P>
    <P>The amount of money being spent by the State on social welfare is enormous. If the general public knew the real figure they would ask what was going on.  I have no objection to investigations being carried out into fraudulent claims. However, we should not create a situation where a person employing two people can have 16 different Departments calling to see if everything is up to date.  No wonder people do not want to employ staff.  The Minister, however, said the opposite about employees.  Let us go back to her comments on incentive schemes.  She said that:</P>
    <P>...an unemployed person with a dependent spouse and three children can earn up to £37 for each day worked without affecting his or her entitlement to unemployment assistance for other days of unemployment in that week.</P>
    <P>In other words that person could work for three days earning three £37 or £111, and receive four days' extra unemployment assistance.  When the social employment scheme was implemented in 1985, I was able to prove to this House that people could earn £1,000 in three days and still get tax free benefits and relief for the other four days.  People denied it and said it could not be done but it can be done.  People can earn £1,000 for three days and still receive unemployment assistance for the remaining four days of the week.  That has been on the record of this House for a long time. Many people are still doing it, and rightly so, because they are working part-time. Fishermen can make £1,000 in three days; in fact, they can make £30,000 in six months.  No one should say Killybegs is a poor place because it is not nor should anyone give the impression that all our fishermen are very poor because they are not.  While individual part-time fishermen may not be doing well, the skipper is.  Let us not give the impression that sub-contractors working on a part-time basis are poor because they are not.</P>
    <P>I am talking about the lack of incentive for people to go out and work for a few <Col N="1505" /> days.  A person can earn £37 a day and receive benefits for himself, his wife and children for the other four days.  Tell that to the person who is on £190 a week or £9,500 a year, and who has to pay the 1 per cent levy.  It must not be forgotten that the person on £140 a week does not have to pay the 1 per cent levy.  Even if one with three children is earning over £9,000 a year, where is the incentive to work?  One would be better off not working, although the opposite is being said to employers.  Anyone who is employed and earns £10,000 a year will have a take home pay of approximately £130 a week. There is no incentive in that.</P>
    <P>There is no logic in the family supplement allowance either because of the poor uptake, and I have been listening to arguments about that since it was implemented in 1987.  The reason for the poor uptake is that the person who is working does not draw it.  If a person with three children is drawing the family allowance and earning £160 or £170 a week, his employer has to take PRSI contributions from him.  If he is earning £164 or £168 a week he would also be taking tax from him, even though he has three children.  Yet, we give a family allowance book to his wife telling her to draw the money from the post office. What is wrong with the employer giving the employee the whole amount?  Why insult the little wife?  Why insult the family?</P>

      <P>The Senator may laugh but there are many people who have a lot of pride.  We should give the allowance to the person working because he is the person entitled to the benefit.  He should be bringing it home to his wife and family, although many of them might not bring the whole amount home.  That is a problem that everybody has to put up with.  I do not understand why we have to provide a family income allowance book to pay out £20 or £22 a week.  Why should we take the PRSI from an employee and from the employer who sends it on to the <Col N="1506" /> State which in the meantime pays the supplement out through another section? Why can the employer not give the employee the full amount instead of paying the PRSI contribution to the State?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome my colleague, Minister Burton, to the House and I am pleased with the tone of her speech.  I am glad she has broadened the debate because the legislation is a bit restrictive and I welcome the opportunity to debate the whole area of social welfare in a broader context.  It would be unfortunate if a court challenge on the specific aspects of the Bill relating to share fishermen resulted in people losing their entitlements under the social welfare code.  Perhaps those who took the case did not anticipate this result but it has meant share fishermen losing their entitlements to unemployment and illness benefits.</P>
      <P>In the Dáil, the Minister referred to the share fishermen's occupation as being particularly hazardous.  It is an area which, while providing a good deal of work at certain periods of the year, leaves the fishermen unemployed for quite a large part of the year.  I welcome this Bill because it will restore unemployment benefit to this section of society.</P>
      <P>I have a few questions for the Minister. In relation to the point raised by Senator Cregan about PRSI eligibility, I presume the fishermen will retain those contributions. The fact they have been in this social welfare limbo since the court ruling means they have broken their contributions and they may think they have lost their eligibility.  Could the Minister clarify this?  Under the new scheme, if the fishermen pay special contributions at the rate of 5 per cent of their income in the previous year, they will be eligible for benefit and will have to pay a minimum annual contribution of £250.  The Minister may have a difficulty with this. This income, because of its nature, will be varied.  The contributions may be difficult to collect because some fishermen's catches in the previous year may have been huge and they may not be able to pay the contributions in the current year based on their income for the previous year.  Would the payment of the £250 entitle them to benefit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments passed by the Dáil have probably strengthened the legislation. This point was made during the <Col N="1508" /> Order of Business.  No matter how foolproof legislation seems to be when it is drafted, it can only be improved by debate and amendment by both Houses. I compliment the Minister for taking on board many of the amendments; a number of amendments were introduced by the Minister herself.</P>
    <P>Bringing eligibility forward to January 1995 is worthwhile.  The Minister can confirm if I am right in believing that fishermen had lost benefit and would have been entitled to benefit from 1996 but she has brought this forward to 1995 to ensure they are restored to eligibility for benefit as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Another improvement provided in the Bill is the extension of benefits to spouses, who are mainly women.  We have said our legislation will be gender neutral but even the Minister refers to &ldquo;fishermen&rdquo;.  I welcome this extension of benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke in detail about treating skippers as employers.  I am sure there are skippers who want to be restored to their previous position as employers and share fishermen who want to be restored to the position of employees.  The Minister said the Attorney General has drawn up guidelines. I am unclear whether this can be done.  If skippers were able to draw up contracts, the income of share fishermen could be reduced.  Treating skippers as employers may be possible but the Minister said this area can still be extended.</P>
    <P>The last time the Minister was in the House, when I spoke on the budget, I complimented her on her work.  At that stage legislative changes were introduced to improve the situation of volunteer development workers when they return home.  The Bill provides further improvements in this area.  The people of Ireland would not approve of those who give willingly of their time, services and expertise &mdash; as the Minister did when she was a lecturer in Tanzania &mdash; being disadvantaged on their return home.  It is totally unacceptable to those who do this work and to the general population that we discriminate against such workers. The Bill provides they will be entitled to <Col N="1509" /> the full rate of benefit on their return home.  I welcome this.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the Pensions Act relates to trustees.  Last week there were references in the media to voluntary pension schemes.  The Bill may not apply to them.  In England people who opted out of State pension schemes and joined voluntary ones were severely disadvantaged. The Minister is nodding, so I take it the Bill has nothing to do with such schemes.  People who are considering optional pension schemes should be aware there is a possibility of losing entitlement to benefit.  It appears the State is more than looking after the needs of employees in this area.  I take it this is a technical adjustment to ensure trustees can be elected by the particular form of majority the Minister described.</P>
    <P>On the question of fraud and abuse I welcome the requirement to maintain records.  Not only will all PAYE workers welcome this but so will contractors and employers, with the exception of those who are defrauding the system.  A huge number of people work within the system.  They pay their contributions, employ people and pay their PRSI. Before the safeguards mentioned by the Minister and the requirement to have a register on site were put in place, employers and contractors to whom I spoke felt very hard done by because slick building contractors were allowed to tender; at one point they were tendering for Government work.  There is a general tendency to tar all employers and contractors with the one brush and say they are wealthy, they are defrauding the system and they are cutting corners.  Not all the self-employed or those who provide jobs are bad.  They provide jobs for those who need them.  Before the regulations were put in place, some contractors could tender and outbid others who were paying full tax and PRSI contributions to ensure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;their employees were fully covered.  They lost public contracts to contractors who took people <Col N="1510" /> from the dole queues and gave them time off on a Tuesday or Thursday morning to collect their dole.  The taxpayer and the State supplemented their income.  This was wrong and unacceptable.  I welcome the keeping of records on site.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Senator Cregan when he says the responsibility should be on the employee.  I am not sure why this should be the case.  The employer would surely have to make sure those he was hiring were available to work.  There is a joint responsibility.  Previously frauds and abuses were perpetrated by employers.  They hired these people and probably made it clear to them that if they were not unemployed they were not wanted.  Their wages were reduced by the amounts they received in social welfare. This was the black economy at its worst.</P>
      <P>There is a lot of media hype about the fact that the Department of Social Welfare is watching out for fraud and abuses.  There is a tendency to highlight that it is ordinary people doing nixers who are caught.  We all know of cases where people who paid their PRSI contributions from the age of 16 have discovered their contributions were not paid to the Department of Social Welfare.  I know of a specific case where somebody paid his PRSI for 30 years and worked for the same company until it went out of business overnight.  The Minister highlighted this problem.  It is one of the most despicable forms of fraud for employers not to pay the Department and the Revenue their employees' PRSI and PAYE contributions.  Employers who do not make those contributions should be liable to the most severe penalties.  I welcome the changes in this area.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the speech of the Minister of State was broader than just the content of this Bill.  It is important to look at the broad picture when we deal with areas of social welfare.  There is no doubt of the perception that there are disincentives to take up employment, the Minister of State highlighted various examples in her speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not fully aware of how well the back to work allowance, to which the Minister referred, is working.  It may be <Col N="1511" /> somewhat restrictive to say that it must be new work and &ldquo;develop new opportunities in areas with potential for development such as fisheries, local heritage projects, crafts enterprises, local tourism and horticulture&rdquo;.  Perhaps those of us who wish to encourage the scheme are looking at it in too restrictive a manner.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State is aware that the local authority of which she was a member, Dublin County Council, and most other local authorities, are strapped for cash.  There is no doubt that a large amount of work needs to be done and some of the areas listed here could be taken in under those schemes.</P>
    <P>The previous Government considered ways in which the local authorities could provide employment.  There are huge areas of County Dublin, which I and the Minister of State represent, which are in an appalling condition and need remedial schemes.  The social employment schemes which continue to be operated by the local authorities allow some leeway and flexibility but to mention that is to be accused of proposing workfare schemes.</P>
    <P>The local authorities should employ a large number of people on the unemployment register who want to work and supplement their social welfare entitlement by £30 or £40 a week without the loss of benefits.  That is vital because prior to this, if someone took a job they lost all their social welfare entitlements and there was no incentive to work.  I believe the local authorities could see themselves as huge employers but they feel restricted by trade unions and other factors and, perhaps, are looking at these schemes in far too restrictive a way.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State also referred to the scheme which allowed people to work for a certain number of days and still retain their benefit.  I welcomed this when it was announced in the budget but unfortunately, perhaps in common with the Minister of State, all I have seen in my own constituency is people who claim <Col N="1512" /> they worked for one day but lost their entire social welfare entitlements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to cite a local case for the Minister of State, where a woman claims her husband worked for one day and was caught &mdash; bear in mind it is two weeks before Christmas.  The local labour exchange is investigating the case which is on appeal and the family's entitlements have been cut off.  A week and a half later, that family has been refused any kind of welfare from the relieving officer in the local health centre, which seems very punitive.  However, I am not aware of the full details of the case.  The Minister of State's Department has suggested that the labour exchange must be quite certain that the person is self-employed and has been defrauding the system for quite some time.</P>
      <P>I also know of cases where people doing small amounts of work lost their benefit and were heavily fined.  However, even if someone is defrauding the system, there must be some way of ensuring that their families do not suffer hardship.  I know the family to whom I referred will not receive an income before Christmas. The system of relieving officers or welfare officers was set up to ensure that such hardships were not inflicted on families. I am afraid that some of the families of which the Minister of State and I are aware will continue to suffer hardship while the system is so rigid.</P>
      <P>The statement of the Minister of State that entitlement to benefits such as family income supplement, the Christmas bonus, medical cards and back to school clothing and footwear allowances can be retained is eminently sensible.  It is responding to requests by employers and employees that this should be done.  If it is not then, as Senator Cregan said, people will have no incentive to work.  The system is crazy if people end up paying more tax and PRSI and lose their benefits and people are right to criticise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State might enlighten me in her reply about how the back to work system, to which she referred, can <Col N="1513" /> be better used.  I do not think it is being used or that there is much awareness about it.  The only aspect which seems to have worked well, and about which I am extremely complimentary, is the educational area.  There has been a tremendous response by the Departments of Social Welfare and Education to the fact that unless people are provided with the opportunity to get back into the education system the cycle of disadvantage will never be broken.</P>
    <P>Great strides have been made in getting people into the education system and preparing them for a return to the workforce if jobs become available. Statistics prove that those with further education get jobs.  If we do not provide opportunities for people who opted out for various reasons such as social disadvantage, lone parents or being made redundant they will end up as an excluded minority in society, a system we should not encourage or support.  That is an area in which I have a particular interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and I share not only a constituency but also an interest in the alleviation of poverty and the integration of the tax and social welfare systems. I welcome her remarks but I would point out to her, and I am sure that her expert working group will be aware of this, that to suggest we do not have an integrated tax and social welfare system is only partly true.  The Minister of State said in her speech that there has been a slow takeup of schemes such as FIS and medical cards.  People are reluctant to apply because they are afraid that instead of receiving a benefit they will be penalised.</P>
    <P>While we do not have child allowances in the tax system, as I know the Minister of State is aware, we have child benefit in the social welfare system.  The cost of child care is not allowable for tax purposes but we have family benefit.  I am not suggesting that we should disallow any of the benefits but we have to address them in the tax system.  There is a slow takeup of schemes such as FIS because people do not see them as benefits and are afraid they are traps to make them pay more tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> With regard to lone parents, I am grateful that the Minister of State, probably not for the first time, dispelled the myth that lone parents are parasites on society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>There are people who do.  I am glad the Minister of State said that lone parents do not remain dependants of the State for their lifetime.  The name of the allowance may have changed from &ldquo;unmarried mother&rdquo; to &ldquo;lone parent&rdquo; but there is no doubt that it is usually a lone mother's allowance.  I ask the Minister to examine the responsibility of the absentee father because, unless we address that and somebody is given financial responsibility, we will not see any improvements in this area.</P>
      <P>I welcome the limited areas covered by this Bill and the Minister's speech.  We can continue to tinker with aspects of social welfare regulations and legislation where necessary and in this instance we had to respond to the court case but, unless we examine the area in its entirety, the £3.7 billion being paid this year in social welfare may not be spent in the best way.  It is imperative for those in need that we spend this money wisely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the Bill which removes anomalies in the social welfare system and moves towards a comprehensive social insurance system.  The issues covered in this Bill needed to be addressed but I also welcome, as others have, the Minister's widening of the debate by mentioning social welfare genreally and particularly the integration of the tax and social welfare systems.  I hope that the interim report of the expert working group to be presented to the <Col N="1515" /> Government shortly will recommend a radical restructuring which will integrate the two systems in a manner which does not catch people in poverty traps.</P>
      <P>The first specific aspect covered by the Bill is share fishermen, the Minister mentioned there are 2,000 of them.  It is probable there will be a larger number in the future because the Government intends to encourage the fishing industry in various ways.  We already had an indication of that in this House three or four weeks ago when we debated the issue.  This part of the Bill takes account of the two court decisions mentioned.  Like Senator McGennis I welcome the fact that the Minister accepted amendments in the Dáil which ensure that people will benefit by January 1995 instead of January 1996. I also welcome Part II of the Bill which rectifies a number of anomalies and ensures that people who work in this area &mdash; and their spouses &mdash; will have full insurance cover.</P>
      <P>We have all welcomed the provision dealing with volunteer development workers.  The Minister knows from personal experience the problems experienced by volunteers who return to this country.  I worked for a brief period of time for Concern, in Ireland, not abroad. I met many people who were concerned that the worthwhile work they had done in other countries meant they were not fully covered by the social insurance system because they had been working for relatively low wages compared to the wages they would have earned if they had stayed at home.  It is unfair that they worked as volunteers for the benefit of people who were less well off than themselves and were then penalised when they came back.  I welcome the fact that this is being addressed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little confused about the pension provision but I gather it tidies up existing provisions and ensures that people in pension schemes are properly represented in the legislation.  I welcome section 14 which deals with keeping records in the construction industry. Senator Cregan does not agree but I tend to favour placing the onus primarily on <Col N="1516" /> the chief employer as opposed to the subcontractors and various tradesmen working in the system.  The buck has to stop with the person at the top and placing the onus on employers ensures this.</P>
    <P>Those operating legitimately in the construction industry have been penalised in the past as many others have been able to operate in the black economy and, therefore, undercut prices.  The person genuinely trying to operate in the system and protect his employees has often not been able to match those prices.  This should be monitored to ensure that it works adequately because, if it does, it will guarantee an even playing pitch for everybody working in the construction industry.  That is the only way to protect workers in the long term.  While the onus is to be on the employer, the protection will benefit the employee.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a number of other areas which need to be examined. She will be doing this when she receives the report from the working group.  The system must be examined in a general way which takes account of the radical changes in society and work practices. There are more part-time workers now, much more job sharing and less work available.  In the past the system presumed that there was work available and that it was only necessary to direct people to that work.  This is no longer true and there have been a number of radical proposals from the Conference of Major Religious Superiors, the Combat Poverty Agency and, in relation to rural development, Mr. Jim Connolly of the rural resettlement organisation which address the changes in society which will affect the social welfare and tax systems.</P>
    <P>I support what other Members said about examining options such as the back to work scheme mentioned by the Minister and the CEDP schemes which operate in many local authorities and which have changed in the recent past through pilot schemes which are now broadly applied.  They now include an educational and training element.  These schemes do not simply employ people to provide cheap labour, a practice which some felt was encouraged by the original <Col N="1517" /> SES schemes.  The concept of allowing people to work in their communities while setting it against social welfare must be seriously addressed in the light of changes in our society.  I support what Senator McGennis said about the VTOS schemes and the opportunities for unemployed people to get back into the educational system.  Statistics show that is the best opportunity people have to gain meaningful and gainful employment.</P>
    <P>There is still much to be done in the consolidation of the social welfare and tax systems but a considerable amount of progress has been made, even in the recent past, in relation to the schemes mentioned.  Senator Cregan referred to the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo;.  In the 1992 scheme if one went from unemployment assistance to disability one had to have 13 contributions in the previous year.  That has been removed and is an important reversal for people who, inevitably, have to move at times from one system to another if they get sick while unemployed.  There are other similar areas of which Members of the House are well aware.</P>

    <Col N="1518" />
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House, it is the first time I have spoken in the House in her presence.  I also welcome the Bill.  I will be very brief. I want to explain a few things about the Bill because it affected me at one time and still affects the people who work on my boat.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners were very hard on fishermen.  They wanted the owner, skipper or skipper-owner of a boat to make tax returns for people who worked on it.  The owners and skipper-owners were against this; their view was that while they were the owner of the boat, the people who worked on the boat were not getting a wage.  They were paid on a share basis in accordance with the money made from the catch in any given week.  I own a 36 ft. boat which goes to sea regularly and there were five shares in it; divided as follows: When the catch was sold the money made was calculated and expenses, food and diesel, were deducted.  The remaining money was divided in five parts, two parts of that went to the boat and one part each went to the three people working on the boat, even though it was skipper-owned.  Boats were cheaper then but have become more expensive.  Up to 40 people could work on any one boat but the whole system has changed.  There can be up to 22 shares in a boat and only two of those shares would be divided among the crew because of the huge expense involved in running boats of that size.</P>
      <P>I was of the opinion until today that the IFO, supporting McLoughlin, took the Revenue Commissioners to court.  I want to point out to Senator Cregan that the Department of Social Welfare did not go to court, it tried to do its best for share fishermen at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners took the fishermen and owners of the boats to court because they maintained that fishermen working on boats should pay tax as employees and that the owner or the skipper of the boat <Col N="1519" /> was the employer.  The court ruled that this was not the case since these people were paid on a share basis in accordance with the money made.  It left the deck hands &mdash; as Senator Magner would know &mdash; the workers on the boat, in limbo for a long time about what would happen. At present if I have a boat I make my returns at the end of the year.  I co-operate with the Revenue Commissioners as I have a responsibility to tell them who was working on the boat and what I paid them.  Many skippers did not do that.</P>
      <P>This Social Welfare Bill will be welcomed. I felt that Senator Cregan went off on a tangent dealing with matters which had nothing to do with this Bill because it deals with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was relevant to the Minister's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, but this Bill deals with specific groups of people who have not until now been properly catered for under other social welfare legislation and it is looking after those groups.  It was not the Department, as I said, that went to court, it was the Revenue Commissioners and the fishermen and this Bill is the result.  It is some time since that case was in court and the matter has been in limbo since.  I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill before the House as it has cleared up, once and for all, the circumstances of the share fishermen and gives them their own niche.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps on Committee Stage I will ask a few questions on certain details.  If we go back to the concept of treating skippers as employers there seems to be a contradiction in the Minister's speech. The Minister said: &ldquo;Share fishermen became insured as self-employed following the High Court decision ... A substantial number of the skïppers involved regard themselves as employers.  However, others do not.&rdquo;  I do not disagree with that.  The part I disagree with is that if the skipper or the skipper-owner of the boat is not the employer, section 14 of the Bill &ldquo;provides for regulatory powers under which <Col N="1520" /> employers and other people will be required to maintain certain records.&rdquo;  If some of them do not want to be employers why then, if they fail to keep records, will they be guilty of an offence?</P>
    <P>The point I am trying to make is that if the Department of Social Welfare look on share fishermen as being self-employed then the Minister will have to look again at the section which provides that the skipper-owner of the boat &mdash; we will call him the employer for the time being &mdash; will be committing an offence if he does not keep records.  There seems to be a slight contradiction there but apart from that I agree with the Bill.  I also welcome the other groups being brought into the scope of the Bill.  It is a pity the legislation was not in place a couple of years ago as it would have made a great difference to share fishermen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is legislation to deal with a unique situation for fishermen.  Due to the nature of their occupation, particularly its seasonality, and that for long periods of the year they are unemployed, it is necessary to have a special arrangement in place for them. To a large extent the public attention in relation to this legislation has focused on the position of the share fishermen, but there is more to the legislation.  When the Minister introduced the Bill she covered a broad area of the social welfare code and some of the proposed changes are long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, I compliment the Minister in taking the initiative in relation to the volunteer development workers. From her own experience as a volunteer development worker, she will be fully aware of the anxiety of many of the personnel involved in the overseas development effort about the shortcomings in the code which left them at a disadvantage when they returned here.  I had occasion to have discussion for a period with the representatives of the voluntary organisations who were rightly concerned that people who made large sacrifices to work in areas of enormous need and deprivation found that when they returned home they were at a great disadvantage. <Col N="1521" /> That provision alone in the Bill before us today makes the legislation welcome.</P>
    <P>There is a need to go even further in the preservation and protection of employment and the provision of employment opportunities for personnel who work overseas and I know it is a matter to which the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, is at present paying attention. If, through APSO and other organisations, we have hundreds of personnel working in overseas areas it is necessary to have a structure in place here which will enable them to fit in when they return, and to enable them to do so in a way which will be beneficial to the company or organisation with which they are involved.  This part of the legislation, which to a large degree has been overshadowed by the emphasis put on the share fishermen, is worthwhile and overdue.</P>
    <P>It is also timely to have a discussion on how the social welfare code is creating poverty gaps for certain people and how these can be avoided.  The Minister dealt with this matter in her speech today.  She identified some of the areas where these difficulties arise and ways in which they can be tackled.  The work carried out by the working group in the Department of Social Welfare needs to be accelerated. It is time that a final recommendation or interim report was made available to give some indication of how the amalgamation of the tax and social welfare codes can be dealt with in a way that will improve living standards and, at the same time, will not be a disincentive for people to work.</P>
    <P>In the other House, in some of the discussion on this legislation, there has been quite an amount of comment as to whether the welfare code is a disincentive for people to work.  This is a delicate matter to deal with and I sympathise with the Minister's dilemma as to how this can be managed.  Some new intiatives are being taken in other countries which it might be useful to examine.  I particularly draw the Minister's attention to a number of schemes being tested by the French Government.  One of these relates to a <Col N="1522" /> system of purchasing stamps at local post offices &mdash; stamps as credit for work.  I would not like to delay the House by going into the detail of the new initiative taken this summer by the French authorities, which, I hope will create many opportunities for employment and at the same time loosen up a system which seems to stifle the prospects for employment. It should not be the case that the system chosen to protect the incomes of people who are unemployed and who face difficulties caused by disadvantage or disability, removes incentives to work.</P>
    <P>Striking the balance between the provision of employment opportunities and incentives to get people to work while protecting incomes is a challenge for the Minister and I am sure that she will face that challenge as she faced other issues in her short period in office.  I compliment the Minister of State.  In a very short time she has demonstrated that she has a clear grasp of this complex and difficult system. I was a Minister in that office for a while and I know that it is like.  The Minister has my support and my sympathy in trying to strike that balance.  I wish her luck in her efforts and I compliment her on introducing this legislation.</P>
    <P>With regard to share fishermen, a unique opportunity has been grasped by the Minister to deal with this complex area.  It is fair to say that there is no occupation with the same associated hazards as fishing.  The Minister will be aware from the results of studies that, in terms of occupational safety, fishermen probably face the highest risk of any sector in the community.  The seasonality of the industry also ensures that there is great demand on the welfare services to maintain living standards and an income so that these people will continue to work in that industry.</P>
    <P>When I was dealing with salmon fishermen, somebody said the fishermen would have been better off if all salmon net fishing had been stopped years ago because then the fishermen would have had to find some other occupation where they would have received a decent wage. The salmon fishermen on the lower Shannon <Col N="1523" /> have a six week season and their livelihood hinges on that.  Their standard of living depends on whether they have a good or bad fishing season.  I need not mention in the presence of Senator Fitzgerald, who is a professional, that the fishermen have suffered from low incomes because of the occupation's seasonality. Many have suffered due to the absence of adequate insurance cover to carry them through the lean periods in the height of the season and at other times.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Minister's proposal that concerns me and that is the pensions scheme.  When in the Department of Defence, I was dealing with windows of ex-Army personnel who did not opt into the pensions scheme.  The widows were severely disadvantaged when they discovered that their husbands had not availed of that option.  It bothers me to hear about options or voluntary involvement in schemes of this nature.  I do not wish to cut across what the Minister of State is doing, but a way must be found to ensure that the people who are dependent on the person who exercises the right to opt in or out of the scheme are familiar with what is on offer and that they do not find, when they decide to opt out, that they will be severely disadvantaged compared to their colleagues in industry.  That aspect of the option arrangement in the legislation bothers me.</P>
    <P>I would prefer a permanent and compulsory system.  If it means two compulsory schemes to cover both categories, so be it.  It may be more cumbersome and bureaucratic but it will deal with the circumstances I can foresee in the event of options not being exercised.  I again refer to the widows of Defence personnel who were not informed by their husbands that they had not availed of the opportunity to opt into a scheme and who were severely disadvantaged as a result.  They have been campaigning for a number of years, with only limited success, to have some of the mistakes made ten and 15 years ago rectified.  It is very difficult and expensive to do that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1524" /> With these reservations, I welcome the Bill.  I would welcome the inclusion of a formula to deal with people involved in aquaculture.  I am not sure if that is covered under existing legislation.  In future more co-operative arrangements for the development of aquaculture will be put in place by fishermen around the coast but due to the large investment involved it will not be possible for individual fishermen to undertake that on their own. Some of the larger companies in the aquaculture industry have drawn back from investment in that industry and the trend for the future will be an increasing number of shared fishery ventures undertaken by fishermen in the aquaculture business.</P>
    <P>I reject the accusation by some fishermen that the spread of sea lice and the decline of white trout stocks are connected with fish cages along the coastline. White trout stocks have disappeared at certain periods without explanation over the last 100 years.  In the 1940s and the 1950s the herring fishermen were accused of having depleted white trout stocks by the use of herring nets on the coastline. Now sea lice are blamed.  Sea lice have been there since time immemorial; they are part of the sea environment and are not the result of fish cages.  They were in the sea before fish cages, and I am sure they will be there after the fish cages have gone.  It is irresponsible to try to connect sea lice with the demise of white trout stocks in certain areas.  There is no scientific basis for that connection.  Sea trout stocks have declined without explanation during different periods and other reasons besides aquaculture.  If fishermen share in the development of aquaculture the facility of insurance should be provided for them under this legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is worthwhile and timely.  I sympathise with the Minister on the task she has ahead and I urge her to carry on her good work in the Department of Social Welfare.  She is assured of the support of the House in that work.</P>

      <P>I will ignore the combined weight of the opposition.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions with regard to development workers.  My son works in Zimbabwe and he would never forgive me if I did not welcome any improvement in his financial status, poor as he is. Ireland achieved a wonderful reputation abroad on the backs of such workers. Their remuneration is pitiful and the State should do anything it can to alleviate their circumstances when they return. I have often wondered about the effectiveness of our embassies abroad.  They do not help to send newspapers to our people in other countries.  Perhaps I should discuss this matter with the Tanáiste.  I welcome this measure and I am sure it is welcomed by all sides.</P>
      <P>In relation to share fishermen, I bow to the experience of the first Minister for the Marine, Senator Daly, and Senator Fitzgerald who is also an expert in this area.  I know nothing about fishing, but I used to watch the fishermen from the deck of a supertanker in the Atlantic. When the waves hit the boat, I often wondered if the fishermen would come back up again.  I was lost in admiration for their bravery and skill because it is a terrible job.  As Senator Daly said, we must welcome anything which can be done to help their financial circumstances.</P>
      <P>On behalf of my son, his wife and others, I welcome this development in relation to overseas workers.  I am sure they will be delighted when they come home.</P>

      <P>I thank all <Col N="1526" /> Senators for their warm welcome. Senator McGennis and myself are in two new positions today, having swopped our former relationship &mdash; which was stormy at times &mdash; in Dublin County Council. We are now in the more rarefied atmosphere of the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to a number of points mentioned by Members.  Senator Fitzgerald answered some of the points made by Senator Cregan in relation to share fishermen.  This scheme will cover share fishermen who share the proceeds of a boat, not part-time fishermen.  It is not a measure to deal with part-time workers, but with fishermen who share a boat's catch.  As Senator Fitzgerald correctly pointed out, this issue arose as a result of a long standing case taken by the Revenue Commissioners.  The Department of Social Welfare is providing social welfare protection and entitlements for this group of fishermen following the court's decision.  This move was not initiated by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The Bill permits share fishermen to be treated as self-employed.  The point was made, and Senator Daly also referred to this, that there are different views in the fishing industry as to whether its workers are self-employed or if, particularly among the larger boats, there is a contract of employment.  As I said, the Department of Social Welfare has taken the advice of the Attorney General in relation to this matter.  However, there is not unanimity in the fishing industry as to what the situation should be.  This Bill extends to share fisheremen the same conditions, entitlements and responsibilities as apply to self-employed people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Senator Daly's comments about the pension entitlements of share fishermen, they are now compulsorily covered as self-employed people. However, I accept his point that many spouses are not aware of the responsibilities of their self-employed spouse and if they die they may leave their survivor <Col N="1527" /> or family without cover.  As a result, the Department is developing its information section and Senator Daly was involved in this when he was Minister.  We are trying to make people more aware of their responsibilities and entitlements and what the system can do for them and their families if they pay into it and if they need income support from the Department of Social Welfare.  We will examine how this can be advertised to reach the spouses of fishermen who are not accepting their responsibilities under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan made comments about fraud and I appreciate his detailed knowledge about how business works. Although I am a member of the Labour Party, I have also been involved in business. I am sure Senator Cregan will appreciate there are two consequences if employers do not meet their responsibilities by complying with PRSI and taxation requirements.  The first is that they have an unfair competitive advantage over other employers and can underbid and undercut them.  This is not in the economic interests of the country or certain sectors or regions, one good reason to ensure compliance.  The second consequence is that where employers fail to comply with requirements in relation to paying social insurance reductions, employees, who have had a long period of employment in a company, may discover that moneys were not paid when they were due which jeopardises their entitlements.  Senator McGennis referred to such cases.</P>
    <P>We cannot do enough to stamp out fraud by employers, there are a limited amount of social welfare resources which must be targeted at those most in need. We must leave no stone unturned to ensure there is no abuse of the system.</P>
    <P>Section 14 does not relate to share fishermen.  It relates to certain prescribed industries, particularly the construction industry, forestry and others where abuse has been established by inspectors from the Department of Social Welfare and where it is important for employers to maintain records on site about all <Col N="1528" /> employees to deter fraud.  Everyone should be in the PRSI and tax systems so that the burden may be shared fairly and that when people experience periods of unemployment or illness and reach old age they will have their entitlements.</P>
    <P>I welcome the comments by a number of Senators about the volunteer development workers.  When I worked in Africa for three years I was lucky to get leave of absence so that I had a job to come back to.  However, many young volunteers, particularly nurses and teachers, are not in the same position.  I take the points made by Senator Magner and Senator Daly that we should examine how the valuable experience which people have gained in developing countries may be used to make such volunteers attractive to employers.  Volunteers who go abroad often live in remote areas and they take responsibility at a young age for substantial development programmes.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly knows they have huge responsibilities in remote regions.  They must deal with natural catastrophes, local governments, national governments, various issues such as planning and, as Senator Magner said, local Irish embassies and their personnel.  It is a fantastic experience in terms of building up independence, self reliance and a vast human resourcefulness in people who work in this area.</P>
    <P>It is a valuable resource.  I accept we should look at ways of using these people when they come home and we should ensure that their period abroad qualifies them for whatever employment opportunities are available on their return.  This is preferable to acting as a disincentive, whereby when they went away they were viewed as having disappeared for three years.</P>
    <P>Regarding the comments by Senator McGennis, and alluded to by Senator Cregan, in relation to lone parents, the reason I raised this matter is because there has been considerable medial coverage, especially in the UK, of lone parents. They have been subjected, to some extent, to a campaign of vilification.  I wish to put the facts about lone parents <Col N="1529" /> on the record as I am aware many Senators are interested in this issue. According to our survey, a high proportion, some 60 per cent, of lone parents return to employment, marry or go on to do other things.  They do not remain permanently dependent on social welfare.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, we must be concerned, as I said, about very young lone parents, because they are most at risk of long term dependency on social welfare.  The various moves by the Department of Social Welfare in opening up schemes fully to lone parents, for example VTOS schemes, have been hugely popular, as Senator McGennis said.  The responce has been enormous.  This is the best way of giving somebody an options and an opportunity to get back into employment and independence.  The Department of Social Welfare is anxious to expand this whole area.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly referred to the extension of the share fishermen scheme to people involved in aquaculture.  This matter will be examined by my Department, with consideration given to the Senator's comments today.</P>
    <P>In the absence of Senator Fitzgerald, I commented on section 14 of the Bill.  This section does not apply to share fishermen. It is concerned with certain industries, such as the building industry, construction industry and forestry where there have been some problems, as the Senator may be aware, in relation to contractors, subcontractors and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

      <P>The section excludes share fishermen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  It is a separate section dealing with specific industries, where, according to the Department of Social Welfare, there have been problems with employers fully registering employees for tax and social welfare. Essentially, it is meant to be another weapon in the fight against fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the specific case referred to by Senator Cregan, I did not have an opportunity to discuss it with the Senator privately and in detail.  However, from <Col N="1530" /> the details submitted by him I believe it is probably a question of part-time employment.  There have been a number of cases like this around the country. It is one of the cases my Department specifically examined and it is something on which we hope to be in a position to take action in a future budget.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulties involved for people when they get caught between different elements of the social welfare system.  It is one of the reasons the integration of tax and social welfare is a major objective for this Government, because we need to simplify the system, make it more transparent and give people every encouragement to take up whatever work is available.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I misunderstood the case referred to by Senator Cregan, but I will discuss it with him privately.  There have been a number of problems in relation to part-time workers.  I have been on record in relation to the reversal of 1992 measures as saying that one of the most difficult areas remaining to be dealt with is the question of part-time workers.  That did not arise as a consequence of the 1992 measures but as a result of the extension of social welfare protection to part-time workers.  In other words, something universally regarded as progressive in bringing part time workers into social welfare entitlements has also caused problems for certain types of traditional, casual workers who are not meant to be caught by the regulations.  I assure the Senator that it is high on my priorities, and on those of the Minister and the Department of Social Welfare, to find a solution which caters for part time workers, but which also takes into account what may be termed traditional casual workers in areas such as the docks and the meat industry.</P>
    <P>I again thank the Senators for their contributions and their kind remarks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 covers occupational injuries, insurance and other optional contributions.  The definition in this section of a &ldquo;person engaged in share fishing&rdquo; refers to &ldquo;the gross earnings of the working of the vessel&rdquo; in other words, the skipper gets a certain precentage of the gross earnings and the remainder is divided between the crew.  Are their social welfare contributions assessed on their gross earnings?</P>
      <P>If they are self employed, I understand they may pay extra contributions.  The Minister said: &ldquo;Share fishermen will also be entitled to unemployment benefit for up to 13 weeks in each calendar year.&rdquo; Any self-employed person who pays contributions is entitled to this benefit.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said that representatives of the fishing industry expressed concern about the absence of cover for treatment benefit.  Is it correct, therefore, that if one pays £250 one obtains the treatment benefits?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why discriminate?  If all self-employed people were asked to contribute more for benefits and treatment for their families, the Minister is rightly saying that there may be benefits available to a spouse and children, following the loss of a husband in a job, such as fishing.  However, the self-employed in any other industry are not entitled to treatment benefit.  Will the Minister clarify this point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in relation to the share fishermen was that these people were previously treated as employees and, therefore, had the full range of social welfare benefits, including treatment benefits but because of the ruling of the court, the have moved to being self-employed.  My Department is introducing an amendment in this legislation which allows them to retain their traditional treatment benefit.</P>
      <P>However, I take the Senator's point that all self-employed people should, perhaps, have this benefit.  As the Senator is aware, successive Governments have introduced self-employed people to the social welfare system with corresponding benefits; it is an ongoing process. Because of this legislation, other self-employed people might take the Government to court on the ground that they were not being treated the same as these fishermen.  The courts might agree with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 is relevant to my question on contributions.  The Minister said that because these people already made contributions as employees they will now get the benefits they had then as they were entitled to them.  That section also says all moneys contributed as an employee will be paid back.  I am discussing them together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I make the point that the Bill says optional and other contributions made while employed as fishermen will now be recognised.  I do not object to that but I object to creating a difference between self-employed people.  The Minister is putting great emphasis on bringing everyone within the social welfare structure.  I believe in everyone being brought into the combined tax and social welfare structure, there should not be two different structures. I have always argued that every person should have one number.</P>
      <P>For that matter, there should be no PRSI.  Tax, health insurance and welfare insurance should be integrated.  PRSI is a second tax on everyone except a person earning over £21,000.  He makes more money because above that salary he does not pay any more.</P>

      <P>People.  That is not the position in other countries.  I would take more money from a person earning over £21,000 and less from those who do not have the money.  The Minister would probably agree with me.</P>
      <P>This section provides for people who were previously regarded as employed by a skipper of a boat and have been found in court to be self-employed because they were entitled to a share of the gross earnings of the ship, whatever they may be. We will be giving them a benefit we are not prepared to give to anyone else.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell everyone that his or her family must be covered?  It is an urgent issue.  Many self-employed people would be prepared to contribute more if they received extra benefits.  They do not have nearly as many benefits as employees.  We should not give the impression that self-employed receive all the benefits.  There is discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area should be clarified.  The section should be changed to provide that if the self-employed made an extra contributions <Col N="1534" /> they would receive extra cover, especially treatment benefits for spouse and family.  That should apply to all self-employed people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Cregan but the essence of this part of the legislation is that it is optional.  If it was a compulsory provision it would be logical to apply it to all self-employed people, not just one section.  However, it is optional so the Minister can do not more than say extending it to other self-employed people is a good idea.  As it is not compulsory it cannot be regarded as an inequality within the system but I support the Senator's point.</P>

      <P>Share fishermen are not in the same position as other self-employed people who may have 48 to 50 weeks' work in the year.  When I was fishing, I might stay at sea for over a week because the weather was good.  Then I might not be able to return to sea for a fortnight.</P>

      <P>Self-employed people on share are not in the same category as share fishermen. This legislation deals specifically with a problem that has existed for years. Everyone should not come under the same provision.  There must be special legislation for certain categories of people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to it later. Senator Fitzgerald made a strong case for share fishermen.  Their work is exceptionally hard and they are terribly brave people.  The loss of life off our shores is frightening and their work is dangerous. Irish people do not give them sufficient recognition and are not noted for eating fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is immoral that most of our fish is exported when so many people work so hard to catch it.  There is nothing wrong with having an export market but we should eat more fish.  It is a healthy food.  I sell a lot of fish and I wish I sold more but, unfortunately, not enough people are buying it.  It is a sad reflection on us.  I know the problems of fishermen. My family and I buy about £500 of fish per week.</P>
      <P>We should not create differences between self-employed people and the part time self-employed. Many people on land are in the same predicament as share fishermen.  There might be no work for contractors for three weeks because of rain.  How would they be covered? We can examine the position for self-employed professionals between 1989 and 1993.  Were all architects busy for the whole year?  As self-employed people should they not be entitled to the same benefits, if they are paying?  Everyone should be treated the same way and the system should be simplified.  When is this going to happen?  As a nation, would we prefer not to have self-employed people contributing but covering themselves and their families from the point of view of pensions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will remind the Senator that in the case of self-employed persons, the contribution is 5 per cent.  In the case of employees, the employee contribution is 5.5 per cent while the employer contribution is 12.2 per cent.  For what they contribute, the self-employed get a good deal.  As I said, it is an area that is going <Col N="1536" /> to develop.  As Senator Fitzgerald rightly said, this Bill deals with share fisher people and specifically with a particular category who were employees and who, as employees, enjoyed treatment benefits. The Department of Social Welfare is trying to regularise their welfare protection by effectively recognising them as being self-employed but restoring to them some of the benefits they have traditionally enjoyed.  Therefore the Bill is take the point that the entitlements of self-employed people could be extended, but, and I am sure the House would agree with me, we would also have to look at the level of contribution they make.</P>

      <P>The date in section 4 was amended to 6 April 1994 so that benefits would be paid in 1995.  When we reach that date and the share fisherman pays the £250, or whatever the arrears for 1993-94 amount to, will that person quality for unemployment benefit?  The Minister said unemployment benefit would not come on stream until 1995.</P>
      <P>The other point I wish to raise on this section concerns the Minister's statements about the share fishermen being entitled to 13 weeks unemployment benefit. Why is the benefit being limited?  No matter what happens, the share fishermen, and there are many of them, will be unemployed for 20 weeks at different times during the year because of weather conditions and other factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the 13 week benefit, this is a special scheme.  This was the agreement we came to following discussions with fishermen's organisations. If the Senator is suggesting that this scheme should be extended, then <Col N="1537" /> we will consider this and keep it under review.</P>
      <P>The entitlements will be effective from January 1995.  That is the date from which entitlements under this Bill will commence. Some people may have made contributions under the old scheme and they will carry over.  Therefore, there should not be a break in the period, but this may not apply to everybody.  We are trying to bring in a new scheme which will regularise the situation from a date in the future.  Effectively, that is all we can do under the law.</P>

      <P>The Minister has already admitted that for an extra contribution of £250 the share fishermen would get their benefits a year earlier.  I have no objections to this because they were employees.  Is it correct to say that they would get these benefits a year early if they contributed the minimum amount of £250 now?</P>

It would not apply to general situations.</P>

      <P>The Minister is trying to make everybody happy.  She is trying to get the fishermen back to work on a legitimate <Col N="1538" /> basis, and the more people who are legitimate the better for the country in general.  However, we must discuss this question of legitimising in the context of the argument I made on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister is saying that if an individual who had no benefit up to now pays £250, they will get benefit for 1994.  There was a person who was investigated when he claimed disability benefit.  The investigating officer concluded that he was not disabled but able to work.  He had been on unemployment assistance since 1987 but he was disabled by an accident in 1989.  There was an ongoing argument with the Department from 1991 to 1993. After many consultants' notes and a lot of money had been spent by both sides, the Department finally admitted that the person was ill and could not work.  He is now on disability benefit.  However, because he did not contribute while he was on unemployment assistance between 1991 and 1993, he is only eligible for graduated disability benefit.  Why can this person not get more than a graduated benefit &mdash; £72 per week &mdash; although he has a wife and three children?  I want this point clarified.  This is relevant to this section.</P>
      <P>The Minister is allowing one person, at a cost of only £250, to be granted benefit immediately, while she only allows another person a graduated allowance because he did not have the required number of contributions between 1991 and 1993.  How could he pay when he was disabled and the Department was investigating his case?  Could somebody clarify that for me because the replies I received from the Department said exactly what I am saying to the Minister.  It is a contradiction of the same argument.  If they wish, people may contribute £250 and be eligible for benefits in 1994 while a person with a wife and three children, who has to live on £72 a week, is being discriminated against because the investigating officer said he was able for work between 1991 and 1993 when he was not. As a result he lost his contributions and got no credits, but if he had stayed on dole he would have received credits.  We are discriminating against this person.</P>

      <Col N="1539" /> We should create laws to suit everybody. I will not accept any excuses.  If there is to be tax and social welfare integration &mdash; and I want that &mdash; it must be done in such a way that people are recognised equally, irrespective of whether they paid £23,000 a year or £3,000.  Everybody should receive the same benefits.  I ask the Minister to clarify the situation.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that and I will give the details to the Minister.  I will be delighted if she can clarify the position.  However, my point is relevant. The reply from the Department said that the person was on graduated disability benefit.  I am not saying graduated disability benefit is wrong because it is relevant to a person who is not earning a large amount of money.  He or she might only earn £3,000 a year and if they went on to disability benefit it could amount to more than £3,000 a year, in other words, it would pay them to get sick.  I understand the graduation system but it is unfair to use it for a person who is totally disabled, and that is exactly what happened here.  The details I will give to the Minister will confirm the position.  In the letter, officials said that person is no longer entitled to disability benefit and he must apply for supplementary benefit.  That is not fair on that person or his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the one hand the Minister is saying if a person pays £250 he will be in benefit, and on the other, if somebody pays £250,000 he would not be in benefit.  I want everybody to be treated equally and that is why I am arguing.  I think I am right.  It would be most unfair and immoral of me to discuss this specific case later with the Minister and, in the <Col N="1540" /> meantime, pass this section without argument.</P>
    <P>We worked with Minister Woods and former Minister, Mr. Barry Desmond, from 1983 and reduced the number of benefits for children: there were 32 and now there are six.  It should be one, except where a handicapped child is involved.  It would be most unfair if I allowed this section to go through while knowing not everybody is being treated equally.</P>

      <P>Could this section be explained because it deals with the return of contributions paid in error.  No contributions could be paid in error if a person was an employee.  The court ruled that these people were not employees. Are there other areas where this practice prevails, such as partnerships and subcontractors? Are people getting a gross amount from money earned in other areas?  Are we questioning partnerships? Could these people bring us to court and say that they should not have been paying PRSI contributions?  I am worried about this.  I would not blame any self-employed person if they went to court to test the validity of section 3.  If I was self-employed I would be worried about whether I am getting the same benefits as everybody else.  I would win in court with that argument because I am entitled to the same as anybody else.  If contributions are paid back, any person who thinks they will get money from the Department will take it and will not question what he will lose.  If contributions are paid back to these people because they are not now employees, are they in benefit in 1994 by giving £250?</P>

If a share fishermen gets a gross amount from a catch, he is a self-employed person on contract, rather than a person employed on a contract.

      <P>A fisherman who reaches 66 years of age in a contributing year may continue to pay contributions although he is no longer required to do so.  This is a typical example of the type of error which may be encountered.  I do not want to give the impression that such errors are widespread, they are not, they arise occasionally in certain situations.  This is an amendment to section 28 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993.  The word &ldquo;optional&rdquo; has been added to the <Col N="1543" /> Act and it states that regulations may provide for the return, subject to any conditions, restrictions and deductions specified in the regulations, of any sums paid in error by way of employment, self-employment, voluntary or optional contributions.</P>

      <P>The Minister partly agrees with what I said in relation to the last two sections.  If, as the Minister said, this is an amendment to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, people should be aware of it.  I am worried we are creating certain benefits for some people.  I am not saying people should not get them, if I meant that I would oppose this measure.  I know what these people are entitled to and they should get more, given the work they do and the hours put in.  Like all self-employed people, they work long hours and people do not realise they do not finish at 5 p.m. I am worried we are amending the Act for a particular group.  One can only argue this point if, for example, the Department of Social Welfare states that one person is entitled to something, but that another person is not.  I want to simplify things and create a situation where everyone has the same entitlements, whether self-employed or otherwise.</P>

      <P>Section 3 states that £2,500 is the minimum amount required per annum.  However, section 7 states that if earnings are below the prescribed amount of £70 per week, the person will get a reduced benefit or will be disqualified. The sum of £70 per week amounts to £3,640 per annum, some £1,100 more than the £2,500 minimum required.  I do not understand why the <Col N="1544" /> amount in regard to share fishermen as stated in section 3 is £2,500, when section 7 refers to optional contributors who fail to qualify for disability benefit because their earnings are below the prescribed amount currently set at £70 per week.</P>

      <P>This is a complex area because of the introduction of social welfare entitlements for part-time workers. We are trying to cover share fishermen in an appropriate way, bearing in mind there are other regulations in relation to other categories of part-time workers.  It ensures share fishermen will be entitled to disability benefit.  If their earnings are below a certain level, they will receive a reduced rate benefit like, for example, part-time workers who receive a reduced rate benefit <i>pro rata</i> to the number of hours worked.</P>

      <P>It is an unusual situation and that is why special legislation is required.  In a factory, for example, if a boiler blows up and the factory is closed, people will be unemployed and claim unemployment assistance.  In the case of a boat, they only way share fishermen can earn money is by catching fish.  If they cannot catch fish, they should be able to get unemployment assistance. Fishermen must maintain and repair their boats, but they have to live and they do not have any money.  We talked in glowing terms about fishermen going out <Col N="1545" /> into the Atlantic in stormy seas, I fail to understand why this provision is included because the only way they can earn money is by catching fish.</P>

      <P>It is traditional for fishermen to maintain their boats, usually at Easter, because there is a high tide at that time.  Fishermen will lay their boats up and carry out general repairs, scrub the bottom of the boat and paint it. According to the Bill, fishermen would not draw unemployment benefit while carrying out such work.  However, if a boat was tied up in a boat yard and professional people were employed to work on it, fishermen would be idle and should qualify for unemployment benefit.</P>

      <P>For the benefit of Senators, this condition is not a new one and Senator Fitzgerald is probably aware of this.  It was introduced in 1964 when share fishermen first became insured as employees and entitled to unemployment benefit.  It has been in operation for 28 years and is also in operation in the UK. It has not caused problems for individual share fishermen or the organisations that represent them.  The scheme has always worked well and has been operated fairly by the Department of Social Welfare. There is a general understanding between the Department, the industry and individual fishermen as to what constitutes being engaged in repair work and what qualifies as periods when they may apply for unemployment benefit.</P>

      <P>I can well understand what Senator Fitzgerald is saying in theory and it would probably be fine with the vast majority of social welfare offices. However, some people in the Department of Social Welfare might think differently.  Some people could be asked whether they had been able to obtain work.

      <P>There are two different situations, as Senator Fitzgerald explained.  One is where there is routine maintenance &mdash; which is part of the work of the boat accounted for in part of the boat's costs &mdash; and the fisherman is working. On the other hand there might be exceptional repairs where the boat is taken away and is, therefore, out of action.  That is a period which would qualify for benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister earlier replied to a question on employers' records.  The Minister's speech placed <Col N="1547" /> strong emphasis on making sure the employer in particular will take responsibility for all records, making sure they are up to date and that the person is not claiming elsewhere.  Whether we like it or not, there is a general impression that there is no incentive to employ workers. More and more companies want to let people go and say they want fewer people working for them, which is regrettable.  I would like to see every company asked to take on one or two additional workers but when I say that to people in business &mdash; in the service or manufacturing areas, fishing or leisure &mdash; they give me a strange look.  I would like someone to try to contradict me, because if it is not true I must be living in a different world.</P>
      <P>No one will employ anyone if they do not have to, yet the Minister put the emphasis on making employers take full responsibility for their employees.  That is fine in theory but many employers, while good from a work or service point of view, are not accountants pushing buttons on a computer to make someone else do the work.  We should learn a lesson from other countries in particular America, whose economy turns on the creation of small businesses.</P>
      <P>In Cork, we turned around the situation after the closure of Ford's and Senator Magner is well aware of that. There are now more people working at the old Ford site than when the Ford Motor Company was there but they are all small businesses.  However, if I was to explain to those people the full responsibility of employing a person, they would pull down the shutters.  The smaller the place, the more people are working because each business needs transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What can the Department do to make it easier for the employer?  That question is not being asked and no incentive is being offered so I will persevere in my efforts here until I get satisfaction.  The Government is not providing any incentive to employers to take on more workers but says it wants to give incentives to employees through social employment schemes.  The impression is given that these are new schemes but <Col N="1548" /> they have been there since 1985 when they were called community work, etc. A great many people want to go to work in our country and cannot.  The Government and Opposition are now admitting that only a certain number of jobs can be created but more can and should be done. We should be providing new initiatives and motivating people &mdash; employers or employees.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech gave the impression that more emphasis must be put on the employer to take responsibility while it is not being made easier for him to do so.  It can be made easier.  The Minister introduced PRSI cards and says they are relevant to new employees.  If people in social welfare offices can press buttons to see if a person is entitled to benefits, why should every employee not have a job card?  Is the PRSI card an identity card and are we taking people's rights away by introducing it?  The Minister disagrees yet in her speech she said that:</P>
    <P>The social services card is designed to facilitate improvements in the quality of service provided to our clients including the elimination of unnecessary queuing.  Only the Department itself, health boards, FÁS and the differential rent section of the Dublin Corporation have access to the database and only for limited inquiries purposes.</P>
    <P>We should ensure that people know they have access to the database.  Speaking on radio, the Minister said nobody was entitled to examine the data, yet that is not true because four bodies can do so. I have no objection to that although I reckon a proper job card would not place as much responsibility on employers. Without the job card an employer cannot employ anyone, even for an hour.  Are we examining that situation sufficiently? Everything on the card should be relevant to a person's tax, PRSI and health contributions.  This will free from worry the person with the initiative to create work.  Such a person should not be criticised. He will not provide jobs because he would be faced with frightening <Col N="1549" /> responsiblities.  Does anybody here understand what is involved in employing a person?  We must provide incentives to employees and employers and bring everybody into the tax and welfare systems. I do not deny the amnesty is bringing many people into the tax system. When people become part of the system they will look for benefits which they have never sought before.  This worries me because I do not know how we can continue to pay £11 million a day in social welfare.  We are encouraging less and less initiative.</P>
    <P>Who is at fault when a builder or company which goes into liquidation has not paid PRSI on behalf of its employees for 20 or 30 years?  We &mdash; not the employers &mdash; are at fault because we did not make provision to cover employees for the benefits to which they were entitled.  If employees had job cards we could see if their PRSI contributions have been paid for the last 12 months and if not, we could seek them from the defaulting employers.  Banks can look at accounts of customers all over the world.  At the touch of a button they can debit people's accounts and acquire information.  There should be details of every employee on a database and by pressing a button we should be able to find out where any employee is on a given day.  This would remove the responsibility from the employer and the employee would know he is covered.  If a person is working on a site while his job card is in the local employment exchange, he should be responsible and should pay.</P>
    <P>Contractors and sub-contractors, with employees working in the black economy, are being given contracts by local authorities all over the country.  It is not for us to criticise such authorities when they are told by the Government to accept the lowest tender.  Some of these contractors are from London and elsewhere. This is what the European Single Market is all about.  How can we stop such contractors?  Will we have inspectors on site every day?</P>
    <P>Every employee should have a job card.  If a person is on a database and his job card is not in the local employment <Col N="1550" /> exchange, it should be possible to check every three months if his tax and PRSI contributions are being paid.  There should be only one payment for both tax and PRSI and there should be no PRSI income limits.  Why should a person earning more than others else pay less PRSI and be entitled to the same benefits?  I know a job card system cannot be implemented immediately but the Minister should consider its introduction.</P>

I stated I know of situations where builders said to people applying for jobs that unless they were unemployed and signing on, they would not be given them.  The onus would be on the employee to prove this was a condition of employment.  It is totally unworkable.  As the Minister said,  it takes two to tango.  This proposal is impossible to administer.</P>
      <P>Senator Cregan's suggestion about job cards is radical but I do not know if it would be acceptable.  Civil liberties groups would have problems with it. They exploded at the mere thought of us having ID cards.  His forward thinking concept may come but I do not see it being implemented in the life of this Government and I am not sure about future Governments.  While we do not have job cards, the requirement in the Bill to maintain records seems the only way to deal with this issue.  The responsibilities of an employer far outweigh the responsibilities of a person applying for a job.  I accept this section of the Bill introduced by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I did not say the employer should not take responsibility.  Both employer and employee should do so.  I did not suggest the employer should not keep records.  My proposal entails job cards, not ID cards.  A job card would be kept in a person's workplace.  If he was employed there for 30 years, he would not see it for that period.</P>

      <P>When I was looking for work in 1960 I was given a card by the local exchange and I brought it to my place of work and my employer held on to it.  This caused no problems and there were more people employed at that time than now.  These cards had to be stamped every week and employers made sure this was done.  Governments, irrespective of their composition, make mistakes.  When I was a messenger boy in North Mill Street, I was given my card when I left at <Col N="1552" /> the age of 16 and gave it to my next employer.  I see no reason for this system not being reintroduced.  Nobody contradicted my view that there are few incentives to employ people.  We are doing the opposite to providing such incentives.</P>

      <P>I appreciate Senator Cregan's concern, particularly in relation to small employers.  I ask him to be aware of the fact that over the period of the National Development Plan very substantial sums of money will be spent on construction and infrastructure projects. In the region of £2.5 billion will be spent on transport infrastructure and £655 million on environmental services.  There will also be substantial construction contracts in urban renewal, tourism, energy and, for example, the Tallaght hospital.  We are not talking about small employers but historically large sums of money and schemes.  The Department of Social Welfare wants to be satisfied that all that money, which will ultimately be paid out of taxpayers' money in Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, there has been a degree of fraud and abuse in the construction industry, about which Senators spoke which we must stamp out because it has substantial implications for competition and is putting legitimate operators out of business.  That is what <Col N="1553" /> this section is about and it will be applied to the construction sector.</P>
      <P>In relation to a comment which Senator Cregan made about the reference in my speech to the health boards and so on having information about people for social welfare purposes, that information is used by the health boards to administer supplementary welfare allowances.  Secondly, as the Senator is aware, FÁS administers various training allowances and there must be a tie-up between social welfare entitlements and for example, various FÁS and CEDP schemes.  That is why they have access to the information.</P>
      <P>Unlike in the old days when there were manual record systems, when the information is computerised it is subject to the Data Protection Act.  I feel strongly that the use of information should be properly governed by legislation and that those about whom information is held in various departmental records should be entitled to have access to it.  That is part of the programme of the Government and I have spoken about this to draw attention to the area because people are entitled to have it.  However, as I say, the health boards have access to the information because they administer SWA, FÁS also has access because it administers various allowances which have implications for social welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann recognises the need for an equitable and comprehensive world trade agreement but refuses to accept the agricultural provisions of the Uruguay Round agreement, on the grounds that they impose excessively onerous and unbalanced restrictions and obligations on the EU, <Col N="1557" /> and are inconsistent with the principle of equality of treatment of all partners.</P>
    <P>Following intensive discussions between Mr. Leon Brittan from the EU Commission and Mr. Mickey Kantor from the US, negotiations on the Blair House agreement have concluded.  All EU members states seem to accept the revised agreement in relation to agricultural trade.  This stage of the GATT negotiations, the bilateral agreement between the US and the EU on agricultural trade, is effectively concluded and the final GATT agreement must be approved by all 116 countries.  The other countries have little choice but to agree to the EU-US deal.</P>
    <P>Detailed technical negotiations will be required over the next few months but it is apparent that the major decisions are now agreed.  The basic elements of the Blair House agreement are unchanged as far as I am concerned.  Internal support for agriculture will be cut by 20 per cent over six years with the exception of the creation of the green box supporters which are not considered to be linked to the reduction of prices or which are regarded as controlling production.  The basic period is the average between 1986 and 1988 and credit will be given for reduction in support achieved since then.</P>
    <P>Over six years export subsidy refunds will be cut by 36 per cent in financial terms and the volume of produce covered by refunds cut by a further 21 per cent compared to the average from 1986 to 1990.  Import levies in operation in the 1986 to 1988 period will be converted to tariff equivalents and reduced by 36 per cent over the six year period.  There will also be a minimum access requirement of 3 per cent of internal consumption in the first year and 5 per cent in the final year relative to a base period from 1986 to 1988.</P>
    <P>The impact of the revised agreement for EU agriculture is as follows.  The reduction in the volume of export subsidies allowed at the end of the six year period, the year 2000, would be the same as the Blair House agreement, that is, a 21 per cent cut from the base period <Col N="1558" /> which is the average exports from 1986 to 1990.  This is a 30 per cent cut on the average from 1986 to 1992 and a 38 per cent cut on the average from 1991 to 1992.  However, the phasing of the cuts will be less severe because the starting period would be averaged on exports from 1986 to 1992.</P>
    <P>The media reaction to all this has been most interesting.  It seems to be biased against presenting the agricultural case which is our duty tonight.  The agricultural correspondent with the <i> Irish Independent,</i> Mr. Willie Dillon, has an article in today's paper with the headline &ldquo;Farm jobs saved Govt claims&rdquo;.  The article begins:</P>
    <P>The long term negative effects of GATT on Irish agriculture have been lessened by the &ldquo;significant advances&rdquo; made in last week's EU-US negotiations, Trade Minister Charlie McCreevy said last night.  His statement coincided with the publication of the Government's report on the effects of GATT which predicted a loss of almost 3,000 Irish farming jobs and a cut of £41 million in gross farm output.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State but I understood the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry was to have been here. We pressed him for these figures on numerous occasions but got blank refusals.  What does he mean by a £41 million cut in volume terms?  What period does it cover? Does it cover one year or two years?  I have figures here which I ask the Minister to verify or contradict. We previously asked the Minister to do it but he refused.</P>
    <P>I will continue with the article in today's <i>Irish Independent:</i></P>
    <P>But the report claimed that the effects on farming would have been much worse in the absence of a GATT deal, with up to 10,000 jobs being lost and output cuts of over £200 million.</P>
    <P>That is what the Minister for Tourism and Trade announced last night.  There has been a refusal from the very start to give us a breakdown of the figures.  I have my own figures which I verified with the <Col N="1559" /> IFA and other farm organisations which cover the six year negotiating period.  I honestly believe the Department is trying to confuse everybody, including the farmers, by giving figures for 1994.  I will give the figures as represented in the Blair House agreement in respect of reductions in agriculture which will be fully implemented by 1999 or the year 2000.</P>
    <P>The potential volume cut in cattle and beef will be 5 per cent.  This is the agreement. The reduction in prices will be 15 per cent which in any one year represents £266 million.  These figures cannot be contradicted as they have already been agreed.  Cattle premia will be reduced by approximately £12 million.  The potential volume cut in milk will be 2 per cent but the potential price cut will be 10 per cent representing a reduction of £135 million in any one year.  The reduction in volume for pigs is 3 per cent; the reduction in the price is 10 per cent representing a reduction of £25 million.  In poultry there is a reduction of 2 per cent in volume and 10 per cent in price cuts, representing a figure of £12 million in one year.  It is very difficult to calculate a figure for cereals because of setaside but it represents a figure of about £4 million of £5 million, to keep it as small as possible.</P>
    <P>There is a 10 per cent reduction in the price of sheepmeat which represents a reduction of £19 million.  This is the final agreement where sugar beet is concerned. There is a reduction of 3 per cent in volume and 12 per cent in the actual reduction representing a cut of £8 million, agreed by the Government in the Blair House agreement.  The Department of Agriculture consistently gives a figure of £41 million for the full reductions, without specifying when they will take place or over what period.  I calculate that those reductions represent a decrease of approximately £432 million in the year 2000.  It is physically impossible to put figures together representing the interim years of 1995-99, but it is not too difficult to guess.  On examining the figures, I do not know where the figure of £41 million comes from.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1560" /> An article in today's paper is headlined &ldquo;Gains for manufacturing&rdquo;.  It is claimed in the article that approximately 20,000 jobs will be created.  Very few details were given, but the only comparison I can draw as far as that figure is concerned is with the 1977 Fíanna Fáil manifesto.  It is pie in the sky.</P>

      <P>Interruptions do not worry me in the least.  These figures are picked out of the sky.  There is no basis for them, they are only dreams as far as the relevant Ministers are concerned.</P>
      <P>Imports of beef in the base period at 6.6 per cent of consumption were already in excess of the minimum access requirement for Blair House.  Figures of 3 per cent of consumption in 1995 and 5 per cent by the year 2000 were agreed.  The clarification on aggregation for meat products will have a positive effect.  The reductions in the EU exports in 1991-92 is 507,000 tonnes; the reduction from the average in 1986-92 is 362,000 tonnes.  It is accepted that the 1991-92 exports figures were exceptionally high as a percentage of EU production.  Taking a figure from the EU production in the longer term of about 8.26 metric tonnes, the cutbacks in production required would be in the region of 6.1 per cent from 1991-92 or an average of 4.4 per cent from 1986-92.  The likely cut back from the exceptional level of EU exports over the coming year is in the region of 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures are not questioned by the Government but it persistently says that this will not cost a lot of money.  It certainly will.  A reduction of 5 per cent is an enormous reduction in export terms. There are other cuts.  The EU is likely to use 1994 to further cut intervention stocks from the current level of 650,000 tonnes.  Of course, the US always expect <Col N="1561" /> the EU to give way.  It appears that the US expect the EU to reduce its stock problems in the early years of the agreement. Not alone do they want the cuts at part of the agreement.</P>
    <P>In the time at my disposal I want to make some other points in relation to this situation.  The present agreement is creating a situation where the price of cattle and beef generally will collapse. The arrangements are ideal to create these conditions resulting in a price reduction of up to 10 pence per pound.</P>
    <P>We all have unhappy experiences in relation to the collapse of markets.  We saw what happened in New Zealand, particularly in regard to sheepmeat.  New Zealand exported 200,000 tonnes of beef to the British market, they immediately brought the prime beef to the French market and caused the price to collapse. That cost the Irish farmer dearly and the same thing will happen as far as beef prices are concerned.  The factories will drop the price automatically.  An agreement whereby imports of beef can cause the market to collapse creates a serious situation and every farmer knows that.  It creates an incredible amount of hardship.</P>
    <P>It is impossible for the Minister to contradict my figures.  We know, however, that it is not difficult to calculate them over the six year period.  Those figures come from the Department of Agriculture, I did not concoct them, not did anyone else and it is easy to quantify the losses.  The Minister for Tourism and Trade stated yesterday that the loss of agricultural jobs will be 3,000 with a loss of £41 million in the gross input to agriculture. He stated a figure, knowing what the agreement is and the impact it will have on agriculture.  I predict the west will suffer greatly as a result of this agreement, because there is no way small farmers can operate a viable holding under this type of agreement.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that figure of 3,000 refers to unemployment in one year or over the full length of the agreement. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that for us.  I predict that over the six years of the agreement 40,000 people at present <Col N="1562" /> engaged in agriculture will leave the land, there is nothing for them except the dole. I have great pleasure in proposing the motion tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts should be outlined so that the Minister can see what is happening and appreciate the main problems in this sector.  Senator D'Arcy dealt quite adequately with milk and other problems, the overall reduction in costs and incomes of farmers because of the changes.</P>
      <P>All the main farming enterprises in Ireland, with the exception of cattle farming are now controlled by quota systems. Within the cattle sector there are two categories of farmers: those who produce their own calves from suckler cows and those who must go to the mart to buy their calves or store cattle.  The letter system of farming is unique to Ireland within the EU.  There is already a quota system for the suckler cow category, but the problem lies with the other farmers, those who must buy the calves or store cattle in the marts.  This very important sector of the farming industry is not covered by the regulations under CAP reform and, therefore, has no quota rights.  It is untrue to say that because a farmer can buy an animal, such as a calf, in the mart that he has the right to a premium.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The premium is legally owned by the calf producer and he may or may not choose to sell it.  If he sells the animal and the right to a premium it is sold on the open market to the highest bidder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cattle farmers who must buy their stock in the mart comprise almost 40,000 family farms which can be divided into three categories; 13,000 farmers buy <Col N="1563" /> calves and sell them as one year old store cattle, 13,000 farmers buy their store cattle and sell them a year later as forward stores and a further 13,000 then finish these forward stores cattle to beef. The value of the output at farm gate level from the third category is £400 million to £500 million annually.  Comparisons with other sectors should be outlined.  Average family farm income in 1990-1992&mdash; these are the Teagasc figures &mdash; is £13,600 for dairy farming, £4,977 for sheep farming and £2,6000 for cattle farming.  The figures show the income on cattle farms is less than 20 per cent of that on dairy farms.  Gross new investment per farm in 1992 was £2,778 for dairy farms, £1,059 for sheep farms and £728 for cattle farms. This shows how under-capitalised cattle farms are now.  The acres needed to achieve the average industrial wage of £14,000 for dairy farms was 62 acres, 205 acres for sheep farms and 222 acres for cattle farms.  It is obvious from those figures that if there is a serious reduction because of the proposals in GATT many of these 13,000 farmers will no longer be in business in about five years' time.  That will also be a result of CAP reform.</P>
    <P>The solution I propose on behalf of the Cattle Traders' Association &mdash; I am proud to represent its members although they are dwindling in number &mdash; for farmers who have no quotas, and who are not on guaranteed quotas, is that to correct this inequity, a cattle premium should be paid on a forage acre basis to those farmers who do not produce their own calves.  The value of the premium would be £150 per forage acre and only the area of farm devoted to the production of store to beef cattle would qualify for the proposed cattle premium.  An increased rate of premium would apply to smaller holdings and in disadvantaged areas and there should be a maximum amount of cattle premium paid to a producer.  A provision should be made to increase this maximum where there is more than one labour unit involved in the cattle enterprise and a minimum stocking rate would be required to qualify for this premium.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1564" /> I will give examples of cases where these proposals would work.  On an all-grass cattle farm where no calves are produced, the cattle premium could apply to the whole farm up to a maximum per producer with a provision to increase this maximum where there is more than one labour unit involved in the cattle enterprise.  On a mixed farm where there are already quotas for other production systems, the cattle premium would apply only to the remaining acres after subtracting the acres devoted to the system which already has a quota.  For example, on a 100 acre farm with mixed farming enterprises &mdash; there are many of these and I come from one so I know what I am talking about &mdash; with a milk quota of 20,000 gallons equivalent to 23 acres, a sheep quota of 100 ewes equivalent to 20 acres and a suckler cow quota of 15 cows equivalent to 30 acres, the premium would apply in this case to the remaining 27 acres.  The farmers opting for the cattle premium would not be eligible to apply for the present special beef premium or the extensification premium.</P>
    <P>Sources of funding are also important, and in this year's agricultural budget from Europe £100 million not spent will go into the coffers for 1994.  We have built up a system whereby more and more officials are involved on a daily basis in the running of each farm.  This is a genuine realistic proposal from an organisation that has seen the number of jobs dwindle in this sector over the last 15 to 20 years.  I will give the example of one townland where there were 13 beef producers 15 years ago, with slatted cattle units for holding the equivalent of 2,500 animals.  Today there is one producer left.  That is the enormity of the problem and the wives of the majority of the other members who were in that group at the time, now have to work outside the home.  I call on the Minister of State to realise and to make known to his colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry the seriousness of the plight of these producers before the remainder of the cattle enterprises are wiped out &mdash; I am one of those small entrepreneurs <Col N="1565" /> and if I did not have an outside income I would not be long in business.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the majority of members of the Cattle Traders' Association who are from the west and the areas of the country where the store cattle we talked about earlier are produced survive to ensure that there is a market for the store cattle produced in other areas.  I am pleased to support this motion at this eleventh hour before the GATT comes to pass.  This sector has no support &mdash;and I thank the Chairman for giving me this little bit of extra time because I know the small man is close to his heart.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak this evening in support of the amendment to the motion tabled by Senator D'Arcy and Senator Farrelly. This current round of GATT negotiations &mdash; the Uruguay Round &mdash; which is now to all intents and purposes finalised, has been the most complex, far reaching and intricate ever embarked upon.  I believe that it will be viewed in years to come as a milestone in the move towards the liberalisation of world trade. As well as being the first time that attempts have been made to include areas <Col N="1566" /> as divers as services and intellectual property rights under GATT rules and disciplines, it is also the first time that agriculture is being dealt with in the GATT in a comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into the history of the negotiations which have been ongoing since September 1986.  Members of this House will be familiar with this as the Uruguay Round was discussed on several occasions here, most recently last month.  As the House knows, agriculture is only one of 15 different subjects which have been under consideration in these negotiations.  While the thrust of this discussion is towards the agriculture element, before I speak on this aspect I would like to say a few words about the overall agreement and what it will mean in general for this country.</P>
    <P>The role of GATT in the proper functioning of world trade is a vital one which must be maintained and improved so that the multilateral trading system is not undermined.  This is particularly important for Ireland given our dependence on exports for our future economic growth. I do not have to remind Senators that exports are the lifeblood of the Irish economy and that it is in our interest to have a stable economic trading environment. This is simply illustrated by the fact that today some 60 per cent of the output of Irish industry is exported and two thirds of our manufacturing jobs are dependent on exports.</P>
    <P>Ireland's exports have grown very significantly in the past ten years &mdash; from £5.7 billion in 1982 to £16.6 billion in 1992.  In 1992, Ireland's trade surplus exceeded £3.4 billion which represents an amazing turn around in Ireland's economic fortunes because we had a trade deficit of over £1 billion only ten years earlier.</P>
    <P>In 1992 our total exports amounted to £16.6 billion with £4 billion representing agri-food exports and £12 billion representing industrial exports.  Our main manufacturing exports included chemicals, £3 billion; data processing equipment, £2.6 billion; and machinery, £1 billion.  Our overall trade surplus in 1992 <Col N="1567" /> represents 13 per cent of GDP, one of the highest in the world.</P>
    <P>We have, therefore, a strong interest in the creation and maintenance of a stable, well regulated, liberal world trading environment.  A failure in the Uruguay Round would likely produce the exact opposite and carries the threat of potentially serious damage to the Irish economy. Failure could also lead to a rapid escalation of trade conflicts and could create a hiatus during which the main trading blocs could drift into an increasingly antagonistic trade war.  We got a small hint of what that might entail during last year immediately prior to the negotiation of the Blair House agreement when the US threatened to introduced punitive tariffs on EU exports and the EU responded with the threat of retaliatory measures against US products. Some very important Irish products featured on the US &ldquo;hit list&rdquo; at that stage and the effect would have been to stop the trade in these products with the consequences of significant job and export earnings losses.</P>
    <P>Even bearing in mind that 31 per cent of our exports go to the UK and 43 per cent to other European Union countries, it is certain that these markets would be seriously affected by a trade conflict and that our ability to export would be severely curtailed.  Couple that with the fact that a failure to reach agreement would deny us the trade opportunities that are forecast to flow from the expected growth in world trade and Senators can see how important the achievement of a fair and balanced agreement would be to Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that the Government defined our policy in relation to the various elements of the Uruguay Round negotiations.  This policy can in broad terms be defined as a commitment to a global and balanced agreement which has regard to our concerns in relation to specific topics in the negotiations.  This approach is based on the premise that freer world trade would bring about significant annual gains to the world economy and that we are well placed to take advantage of any such increases.  In this <Col N="1568" /> regard, the Minister for Tourism and Trade earlier this year commissioned a consultancy firm to assess the impact for Ireland of the likely Uruguay Round agreement.</P>
    <P>The study sought to analyse the potential impact on Irish production and employment when the full effect of a GATT agreement had worked through to the international and Irish economies, that is, in the first full year after the six year period over which the GATT agreement is phased.  The consultants assumed that a GATT agreement would add a cumulative 1 per cent to the value of world trade each year over the six years of the transition compared to what is assumed would be the case in the absence of a GATT agreement.  Conversely, it was assumed that a breakdown in the GATT negotiations would lead to a cumulative 1 per cent annual reduction in the value of world trade over the six years of transition.  These assumptions yield an estimate of the long-term impact of a GATT agreement or a GATT breakdown of plus or minus 6 per cent of the value of world trade.  It is this world trade growth effect of a GATT agreement which is by far the most important effect in stimulating the production and employment growth which the study postulates will occur.</P>
    <P>The study's estimates of a GATT agreement's impact on manufacturing were that Irish manufacturing output would be expected to increase by £524 million if world trade and investment continued unaffected, if there was not a GATT agreement and almost £1,500 million by comparison with a situation where a breakdown was followed by increased global trade protectionism and a slowdown in global investment.  Manufacturing employment could be expected to increase by 4,550 and 13,112, respectively, under the same scenarios.  The gains in services were estimated at £121 million and £242 million in terms of output and some 6,000 and 12,000 jobs under the &ldquo;no change&rdquo; and &ldquo;trade hostilities&rdquo; scenarios, respectively.  I will deal later with the study's outcome in relation to agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1569" /> Turning to agriculture, it will be recalled that the initial draft outline agreement was contained in the Draft Final Act of December 1991.  Ireland was to the forefront in securing the Union's rejection of the approach of the Draft Final Act of December 1991 for finalising the round which we considered was not in the best interests of Irish agriculture. Subsequently, the Commission embarked on negotiations, with the US in particular, to find a more equitable outcome. Arising from this, US and Commission negotiators reached agreement at Blair House on a number of amendments to the agriculture sector of the Draft Final Act.  The most significant amendments related to the exemption of CAP reform payments from the support reduction obligations, a reduction in the volume restraint commitment from 24 per cent to 21 per cent and the introduction of a peace clause of six years duration.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the Blair House adjustments, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, still continued to have concerns on certain aspects of the agreement, particularly in relation to the volume restraint commitment and the matter of application.  On the day the agreement was reached, the Minister expressed these concerns and on 20 November 1992 he said that he remained very concerned at the outcome in regard to volume limitations on subsidised exports, particularly in so far as they will affect the beef and dairy sectors.  He said he will need to be clear that these can be accommodated within the CAP reform arrangements before there can be any question of his acceptance of the agreement in the Agriculture Council.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, and other Irish Ministers continued to outline the potential impact of the volume restraint aspects of the draft agreement on Irish agriculture at all the relevant Union fora.  In addition, they had insisted that the Union's approach to market access, including aggregation and tariffication, which were being strongly challenged in some quarters, be secured and that a range of adjustments would be <Col N="1570" /> required to make an agreement acceptable to the Government.  Every opportunity was consistently availed of to outline the Government's concerns in bilateral discussions with the Commission, Union Ministers and representatives from countries outside the Union.</P>
    <P>Arising from this, on 20 September 1993 a Joint General Affairs/Agriculture Council reaffirmed that the Union must ensure that its international commitments would be compatible with the CAP and the Union's export vocation would be protected.  The Council, at the insistence of a number of member states including Ireland, laid down a number of general guidelines for the Commission for further negotiations.</P>
    <P>In the further negotiations, significant adjustments were secured.  These adjustments represented major gains, particularly when viewed against the strongly held views of some participants that there could be no renegotiation of the export commitments or, alternatively, that if changes were made, the European Union would be required to make major concessions on market access for products of importance to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Of major importance are the concessions secured on the export support commitments, on market access and the peace clause.  The arrangements secured on the support commitments fully address our concerns in relation to front loading and intervention stocks.  Under the revised arrangements the European Union will, by comparison with the volumes which would have resulted from the original Blair House agreement, be able to export the following additional volumes over the next six years: 362,000 tonnes of beef; 146,000 tonnes of dairy products; 8,116,000 tonnes of wheat and wheat flour; and 269,000 tonnes of poultry and eggs.</P>
    <P>The foregoing will be particularly beneficial to Ireland.  For example, the additional quantities represent 60 per cent of current beef stocks and 33 per cent of current cereal stocks.  When compared to stock levels and normal export volumes the change in the front loading <Col N="1571" /> commitment in regard to beef is of relatively greater value than it is in the other sectors.</P>
    <P>In return for the concessions the European Union will be required to provide some additional access to its markets, mainly in the pigmeat and fruit and vegetables sector, and to reduce the import duty on the quota quantities of some other products, mainly cheese, turkeymeat and liver.  In the pigmeat sector, the Union has agreed to provide additional access for 39,000 tonnes of produce while, for cheddar cheese, the import duty for the quota quantity, which will be 15,000 tonnes at the end of the six year period, will be reduced from 845 ECUs to 210 ECUs per tonne.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Union accepted the Government's position on resisting further access for beef and dairy products. The fact that the Commission's undertaking not to grant subsidies on beef exports to South-East Asia will not be bound in GATT is also of importance as this leaves open the possibility of pursuing the reopening of this market for beef exports.  The Government will continue to pursue this vigorously.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of the Union's approach on market access was also particularly beneficial.  The tarriffication arrangements and the safeguard mechanism will continue to ensure the protection of Union preference.  The acceptance of the Union's aggregation approach on access means that meat imports will be 600,000 tones less than would otherwise arise.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the report of the consultancy firm on the impact for Ireland of the Uruguay Round agreement. The report assessed the impact of the round for the agriculture sector under a number of scenarios.  The worst case scenario which projected losses of £310 million is no longer relevant in the light of the arrangements that have been secured.  The Government is satisfied that the efficiency of the Irish agriculture and food sector will keep any losses at the lower end of the estimated scale.</P>
    <P>The Government has always insisted that the implementation of GATT commitments <Col N="1572" /> in the Union must take account of the relative importance of agriculture and specific products to member states and regions.  It has also always insisted that any GATT commitments which go beyond those in the CAP reform must be subject to adequate compensation to ensure that the income of producers is consistent with that under CAP reform. That continues to be the Government's position.  The assurances obtained at the European Council and in the Council of Ministers can be relied on to secure any necessary compensatory measures at European Union level.</P>
    <P>It must be kept in mind that the alternative to a GATT agreement was not a continuation of the <i>status quo</i>.  If an agreement was not reached, it was inevitable that either many of the Union's support arrangements would be challenged under the GATT or there would be trade hostilities.  The Union's support arrangements were vulnerable under the GATT, whereas the peace clause arrangement which will now continue for nine years would safeguard the current support and protection arrangements.  The consultancy report has estimated the costs to the agriculture sector in a trade hostilities scenario at £125 million per annum, which must be regarded as a conservative figure.</P>
    <P>The Irish agriculture and food sector will face challenges under the new GATT arrangements and the Government does not under-estimate these challenges.  At the same time, the fact that Irish industry was increasingly successful in exploiting market opportunities on the Union market and had reduced its dependence on the intervention system is reassuring and is a measure of the ability of the agri-food sector to face all challenges and to successfully adapt to new situations.  This favourable trend will undoubtedly continue and will be supported by the Government in regard to investment aid, market promotion and assistance for research and development.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the agri-food industry is well prepared to face the new challenges. In this regard, investment in the industry from 1987-93 amounted to £323 <Col N="1573" /> million, assisted with EC grant awards totalling £121 million under the FEOGA processing and marketing grants schemes and over £47 million in grant awards provided by the national development agencies.</P>
    <P>The food sub-programme for the period 1994-99 envisages total investment of £665 million.  It is envisaged that the EU will contribute £231 million towards the implementation of the programme and almost £73 million is to be provided by the State.  The programme includes the provision of capital grants to the food industry and financial assistance for research and development, marketing and promotion and training.</P>
    <P>I consider that, viewed objectively, particularly against the background of negotiations which have been ongoing since 1986 and the number of sectors and countries involved, all of whom had their own interests to protect, the proposed agreement underlines the fact that the Government's strategy in the negotiations in relation to agriculture has resulted in Ireland's major concerns being satisfactorily addressed.</P>
    <P>I commend the amended Motion to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most unusual moments I had since being elected to this House was two or three years ago when the then Minister for Agriculture, Senator O'Kennedy, had the first discussion on the proposed reform of the CAP.  There were speakers on all sides of the House, but Senator O'Kennedy and I were the only two people who spoke in favour of what was happening at the time.  It was extraordinary, Fianna Fáil spoke at length against what was happening&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and then voted for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said it then, and I say it now, that many aspects of the CAP were suffocating and oppressing the agricultural sector.  The Government had no choice <Col N="1574" /> but to ensure the best deal possible in the GATT negotiations.  The amendments to the Blair House agreement which have been achieved during the last two or three weeks are of vital importance to the agricultural sector.  No one could agree with the decision, and it would not have been possible to sustain it, to take 21 per cent from the CAP because this would have hit the agricultural sector in a particular year.  The fact that this is now being spread over a period of five or six years is important.  Equally important is the concession that the amount of intervention beef can now be sold off over a period of two years.</P>
    <P>The Minister says &ldquo;The fact that the Commission's undertaking not to grant subsidies on beef exports to South-East Asia will not be bound in GATT is also of importance as this leaves open the possibility of pursuing the reopening of this market for beef exports.&rdquo;  I do not know what this means.  I believe it is misleading, gives incorrect information and gives a sense that, in some way, a deal has been struck in order to gain access to the south-east Asian market.  If this is the case I cannot find any evidence for it.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware, the south-east Asian market is closed.  I support the view of the IFA and the farming community that it is disgraceful that that market and the Japanese food market, the most lucrative market in terms of food exports, have been closed to us.  If I were to pinpoint one aspect of the GATT negotiations which have let us down it is in that area.  There is nothing in GATT to create optimism about access to the south-east Asian market.  If anything the GATT agreement distances that market further because it stitches down the current arrangements.  It would be better if we were told this.</P>
    <P>I believe the most important part of GATT is the fact that we will now be considering non-subsidised agricultural exports.  Anybody objecting to GATT is not considering the country as a whole. This country cannot and could not survive without GATT.  It may be that those considering GATT from the viewpoint of <Col N="1575" /> the agricultural sector can point to issues and flaws in it.  However, the reality emerges when we compare our market with any of the major world markets.  For example, the USA, Canada and Japan are three huge markets and in terms of tariffs and barriers, Europe has far fewer barriers to trade.  In fact, if the barriers in these four markets were broken down in the morning, they would create a potential balance of trade surplus for Europe of almost £0.5 billion in respect of the USA, £1.5 billion in respect of Canada and £1.5 billion in respect of Japan.  Ultimately, therefore, if all the barriers were down, we would be the great gainers.</P>
    <P>It annoys me that the agri-industry in Ireland lacks the kind of support it should receive.  Over the last two years I have been closely examining developments in this area, and some of these are positive. However, for some reason we are not breaking into this industry.  For example, Tara Foods, located in Kilbeggan, is a company working without access to any of the Community supports.  It does not depend on the CAP, intervention or anything else.  It does its business and is a successful company.  There is another company in west Limerick, in the Newcastle West area, undertaking the same kind of business.  That company is buying premium quality food, exporting it and creating a market.  That is where our future lies.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that 127,000 extra tonnes of cheese can now be exported from Europe.  The reaction of the Food, Drink and Tobacco Federation to this announcement last week is indicative of all that is wrong with the Irish agri-food sector.  The reaction of the federation to the opportunity of a market for an extra 127,000 tonnes of cheese was that this was of no use to Ireland, but that the French and the Danish cheese industries could export into new areas. This was throwing in the towel.  The market is as accessible to us as it is to Denmark and France.  Indeed, there are people participating in the craft fair in the Mansion House at present who are <Col N="1576" /> endeavouring to sell and find markets for cheese.  This is happening on a cottage industry basis and on a larger scale.</P>
    <P>Our cheese industry is growing rapidly; we cannot cope with the output.  We must find new markets and this additional export capacity is a small example of a niche that has been created through the change in the Blair House agreement which is of great value to this country.</P>
    <P>This House can take pride in the fact that it has, more than any other institution in this State, maintained a constant debate on GATT over the past couple of months.  Nobody else has managed to do so.  IBEC failed in this respect and I accept a certain portion of the blame on behalf of the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>The economists of this country have let us down.  There is a report on GATT with the Department of Tourism and Trade which has not been published.  This has aroused grave suspicion that there is something in the report of which we are unaware.  I believe the reason for its non-publication is that it has been written by economists who never tell us anything. Everything is on the one hand, and on the other hand.  In addition, economists confuse issues and they are always, unerringly inaccurate in anything they have to say about finance.  Furthermore, one will always find them on both sides of every financial debate and economic argument. They are of no use.  My conjecture is that the report is gobbledegook, and that is why it has not been published.  However, I believe it should be published.</P>
    <P>Those aspects of agriculture, together with anything based on fibres, for example, the rag trade, which will undoubtedly suffer over the next two or three years, should get support to enable them to make a bridge into new areas of development.</P>
    <P>Under the Lomé Agreement we made a number of concessions to Third World countries by breaking down barriers for them.  Now under the GATT these barriers have broken down for everybody and the advantage we gave the Third World countries has been eroded.  In view of this I ask the Minister and the Government to look at more creative and imaginative <Col N="1577" /> ways of showing the same level of support for those Third World countries which suffer from reducing trade barriers. It has been suggested that GATT is bad for these countries; however, that is not necessarily so if we approach matters differently but with the same level of support for them.  Similarly, I believe GATT will allow services to Third World countries which will enable the development of their own industry to take place and also allow them to go forward.</P>
    <P>Finally, I believe that the sending of CAP products from intervention to Third World countries, where it was seen as a charitable gesture from this side of the world, put food into Third World countries at an uneconomic and uncompetitive rate which, in effect, depressed the development of the agriculture sector in those countries and was not good for them.  I believe they will improve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. As I mentioned recently, GATT is about trade.  The GATT agreement which was signed in 1947 is a multilateral treaty providing a code of rules for the conduct of world trade and a forum where countries can discuss and resolve their commercial problems and negotiate a reduction in barriers to trade.</P>
      <P>It is important that there be a GATT agreement.  The Uruguay Round is the eighth round of negotiations and has been in progress for seven years.  It is an achievement that agreement appears to have been reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resources of one country can be very different from those of another. Therefore there must be agreement as to how these resources are used in terms of imports and exports.  In this context, control is necessary, and this is what GATT provides.  As Senator O'Toole said, when CAP was discussed in this House there was scepticism about whether it would be good for Ireland. That was because we were frightened by propaganda, which we are still hearing today.  As a member of the EU we had to accept CAP.  We joined the European Community to better our way of life and <Col N="1578" /> we have definitely benefited from it.  If there were no quota system we would get far lower prices for milk and other produce.  The CAP compensation system has helped farmers and they welcome it.</P>
    <P>It was also said farmers would suffer greatly if there was disagreement.  Irish farmers, especially those in the west, would suffer much more if agreement had not been reached.  Senator D'Arcy said he was puzzled that the newspapers supported the GATT.  The newspapers are not the source of this support; it is coming from people expressing their opinions to the media.  In today's <i>Cork Examiner</i> Mr. Alan Gillis, outgoing president of the IFA, accused the Government of failing adequately to defend agriculture.  He also accused them of that in the past.  Fine Gael Members mentioned his opposition to GATT.  I would not be surprised by that.  As I said before&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The professor said the deal was extremely good news, not just for industry but for agriculture.  He described it as an excellent package and said he very much welcomed it.  IBEC also welcomed it and the deal is worth 2,000 jobs to Ireland.</P>
      <P>Two Irishmen played an important role in securing the GATT, Mr. Peter Sutherland and Mr. Ray MacSharry.  Senator D'Arcy said he would not trust Mr. Sutherland.  I was surprised by that remark.  Mr. Sutherland is an Irishman and while his job as director-general of GATT requires him to be neutral he would think of his native country.  Last Thursday night, when the negotiations between Brussels and Washington had broken down, Mr. Sutherland insisted both sides would talk about what had been achieved instead of about their continuing differences.  He injected fresh momentum at a decisive moment and since then the obstacles have fallen one by one.  I commend him for staying up all night to ensure the negotiations reached a satisfactory conclusion before the deadline tonight.</P>
      <P>The GATT package covers 15 trading sectors.  It was always recognised the Uruguay Round of talks would stand or fall on the agriculture issue.  The former EC commissioner, Mr. MacSharry was a driving force behind the agreement on this area.  The American priority in the GATT talks was to target EU export subsidies, used to dump surplus products on the world market at knockdown prices.  The threat to Europe did not come from the Americans alone.  Large scale beef producing countries like Brazil and Argentina were also angry about export subsidies.  Therefore, Europe had only two choices; to agree to cutbacks in the negotiations, or allow the GATT to judge the issue, with every prospect of defeat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1990 Mr. MacSharry launched the CAP reform plan, designed to cut overproduction. This is accepted as a great success.  It was one element in a complex <Col N="1580" /> process with the US trade representative, Mrs. Carla Hills, who was demanding a cut of no less than 90 per cent.  In July 1990 Mr. MacSharry addressed a meeting of ministers from the world's leading nations at Dromoland Castle, County Clare.  Without giving advance notice he suddenly announced the EC was to cut subsidies by 30 per cent.  There was a great furore after that announcement and the farming organisations said Irish farming had been sold down the river. However, Mr. MacSharry knew what he was doing on that occasion.</P>
    <P>In December 1990, the 116 GATT partners met in Brussels, supposedly to wrap up the deal.  Mrs. Hills continued to press for a 90 per cent cut in export subsidies but Mr. MacSharry dug in his heels.  Talks were held until the EU endorsed the plan.  In November 1992 Mr. MacSharry went to Chicago and had a meeting with Mr. Madigan.  At that stage he agreed to a 21 per cent cut in EU subsidies over six years.  That was a fine achievement.  Mr. Delors disagreed with him on this point and conveyed a message to Mr. MacSharry's hotel.  He in turn threatened to resign and then Mr. Delors told him to continue.  The good work Mr. MacSharry has done to bring about this trade agreement should be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>We should also compliment our negotiators, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Minister for Tourism and Trade and the Tánaiste. They spent many hours negotiating the best deal for Ireland and our Farmers. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, always made it clear that any deals in the GATT should be accommodated in the CAP reform arrangements before there would be any question of him accepting it.  I pay tribute to these people.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole said he had difficulty understanding a section of the Minister's contribution.  I did not get as much education as the Senator but I think I understand it.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The fact that the Commission's undertaking not to grant subsidies on beef exports to south-east Asia will not <Col N="1581" /> be bound in GATT is also of importance as this leaves open the possibility of pursuing the reopening of this market for beef exports.  The Government will continue to pursue this vigorously.</P>
    <P>This will definitely reopen markets for Irish beef exports and anything which does that should be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I quote another part of the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>The Government has always insisted that the implementation of GATT commitments within the Union must take account of the relative importance of agriculture and specific products to member states and regions.  It has also always insisted that any GATT commitments which go beyond those in the CAP reform must be subject to adequate compensation to ensure that the income of producers is consistent with that under CAP reform.  That continues to be the Government's position. The assurances obtained at the European Council and in the Council of Ministers can be relied on to secure any necessary compensatory measures at European Union level.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence in our negotiating team of the Tánaiste, the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy and especially the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Walsh and his junior Ministers, Deputy O'Shea and Deputy Hyland.  They will ensure whatever deal is made will be the best for Irish agriculture and farmers.  I welcome the deal.  It is a good one for our country and will also help the world economy.  I do not think it will have the adverse effect on agriculture referred to by some Senators and farm organisation leaders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you will agree with me, a Chathaoirligh, when I say that there is a certain air of unreality about this debate, given the historic agreement reached between the British and Irish Governments this afternoon.  The lights were not on when I came in and I thought we were sinking into a European darkness. <Col N="1582" /> It would be appropriate for us on this historic day to put on record the fact that this agreement has taken place and that the benefits we all hope can accrue from it will flow to us.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, I am pleased he did not have to give this creative speech to the House because having listened to and read it, one wonders what the problem was.  On the basis of this speech, this marvellous GATT deal has delivered so many benefits to us that we should not be critical of it.  The confidential report of the Department of Tourism and Trade to which Senator O'Toole referred is quoted from in some detail.  Now that the agreement has concluded, it would be useful to see that report in its totality.  I can see strategic reasons for not publishing the report beforehand, but I can see none for not publishing it now and making it available to us.  There is a degree of creative accounting in this matter.  We keep hearing abut the benefits gained for us, in the GATT talks and in the clarification of the Blair House agreement, but there is not much about the losses that will accrue. While one might concede that, as a small open economy, we have little choice but to participate in a GATT agreement nevertheless it is unquestionable that there are severe consequences facing our agricultural industry.  It is also unquestionable that given the dominance of Irish agriculture within our economy, there will be a knock-on effect.  We can argue about the magnitude of that effect, whether it is the £480 million loss in farm output, which the Irish Farmers' Association claim, or as this speech put in picturesque terms, the price of hostilities amounting to £214 million.  We can argue about the scale of the magnitude but the bottom line is that there is an effect. Of course there are benefits to certain sectors.  The last time this issue was debated, I mentioned the fact that my party put down a motion three years ago in this House underlining the dangers for GATT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the debate on GATT eventually reached the media, and it has taken a considerable period of time to get there, <Col N="1583" /> I heard one of these eminent economists, to whom we are all meant to listen with great care and attention, suggest that a person buying food from the supermarket would benefit from a reduction of £1,000 a year in their food bill.  That is arrant nonsense because if one goes into a supermarket and takes any food product off the shelf, the contribution the price of the raw material makes to the value of the product is minimal.  Packaging, services and other such factors are the major contributors towards the cost of food.  In addition, if one takes into account that 40p in every pound of our net foreign earnings derive from the produce of our farms, it is then certain that at least part of the benefit which might accrue to consumers will be exported and given to consumers in other countries.  It is a fundamental law of economics that the capacity of people to eat a certain amount is limited.  Apart from this, it is also common sense.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also stated that as incomes rise, if I may go back to my college economics, the proportion devoted to food falls.  That is also common-sense. It is difficult to forecast the alleged benefits that will accrue to us.  We have heard about the world economy and how much it will grow, but we have to live in our own little island and the farmers living here have to try to make a living.  We must be concerned about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fear is that this so called attractive doctrine of trade liberalisation will benefit only the United States of America. How will we, even with our larger farms of 100-200 acres, compete with feed lots of thousands of cattle and prairie farms producing thousands of acres of cereals? That is what confronts our farmers.  Is it appropriate that although the Minister is working hard to improve rural development and fund rural infrastructure, we are getting to the point where no one will be left to avail of that infrastructure?  Is it right that when those people leave our <Col N="1584" /> farms, and are forced into emigrating or into urban conglomerates, with all the social consequences that entails, the Government has to find the money to pay their unemployment benefit when it would have been much better to have found a smaller amount of money to keep them in the rural community?  They are the fundamental questions faced by society but they have not been answered and have not been addressed in the context of GATT.</P>
    <P>I am critical of the role of our most senior politicians in this matter.  I have repeatedly said it was a matter of such consequence it was proper that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste should have been involved.  When the Tánaiste went to the United States of America to discuss Northern Ireland with President Clinton &mdash; he was right in doing so because it was an important matter &mdash; did he also address the other important issues about trade and the consequences of a GATT deal for our country?  In addition, was it right that when the heads of Government met, there was a discussion about GATT only at the end of the day, it was only brought in through the side door because, as far as I am aware, it was not on the agenda?</P>
    <P>There have been minor concessions. Because the French and the Americans made such a fuss over cinema and video, they were able to leave that to one side, while thousands of people are affected by other issues which do not seem to have been of such magnitude.  I am afraid I cannot come to terms with that sort of thinking.</P>
    <P>The deal is there but I do not think it is as good as it should have been for us. To dwell on these minor concessions and regard them as victories is disingenuous. They were not victories.  Where do we go from here?  It should go on further than CAP reform and where there is compensation &mdash; we started off by saying we did not want any &mdash; it must be full and permanent compensation, not compensation which will disappear within a few years.  There is a genuine problem here because the budget is increasing all the time as a result of the MacSharry <Col N="1585" /> reforms.  There is a budgetary problem in terms of finding the compensation moneys.</P>
    <P>Within the EU, we are locked into this system of quotas.  What happens when we have to compete in this market and the signal comes to us to produce extra milk, grain, beef or mutton?  How will we do it?  If milk production in Idaho is increased by 8 per cent, how will we produce extra milk when we get the market signal?  I do not understand it. Perhaps we are getting to the point where we will have to talk about sea quotas and producing milk at world prices.  At least some of our dairy farmers are competitive enough to do that.</P>
    <P>Compensation must be full and permanent. I am sorry it has been asked for but that is the position.  The Culliton report must also be adopted in full, as the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, said in this House last summer.  When we get to these so-called world prices, and we could argue at length about them, Ireland must be able to produce off its farms and at least allow our people some prospect of living on the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment to the motion.  As a small country, Ireland does not need world trade hostility because it has been proved over and over that small countries lose most.  We can rest assured that if any conflict arose, regarding restrictions on our exports, other larger countries in the EC would have various ways of camouflaging change.  In the long run Ireland would be the major loser if there was trade hostility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>GATT's role is of extreme importance to the proper functioning of world trade. If an agreement is up and running, trade can flow freely.  While there was much sabre rattling among the major countries, the agreement, which is almost finalised, is better for us.  For that reason I compliment everybody involved in the Irish negotiations.  It was not an easy task. When we talk of world powers, we are talking about countries which have billions in excess of what we have.  We must <Col N="1586" /> play our role in a world where these big powers are front runners.  I also compliment the Tánaiste, who is receiving other compliments today for his work with the Taoiseach, a constituency colleague and friend of mine, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, and the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, for the major roles they played in the agreement.</P>
    <P>The GATT agreement is far reaching. The Uruguay Round was discussed in this House on numerous occasions and perhaps it is a little late to discuss it now because agreement has been reached. However, it is right that we should air our views.  The Uruguay Round has been going on since the mid-1980s and there have been ups and downs.  We must remember that, prior to the Blair House negotiations, the US threatened to introduce punitive measures.  Items important to the Irish economy and Irish jobs were earmarked to be cut.  If that had happened, it is possible that factories would have closed and we would never have regained those products or jobs.  That point should be made and kept in mind. When punitive measures are introduced by one group, there are retaliatory actions.  Anything that upsets the balance of complicated world trade will have serious effects on economies and jobs. We cannot have any jobs at risk at present.  Our sales to the UK, the EC and other European countries are high. There is no doubt that if restrictions had been imposed, these trading links would have been greatly affected.</P>
    <P>Any conflict restricts world trade.  If there are punitive measures on one side and retaliatory measures on the other, it stops the proper flow of trade and we do not want that.  Given that some agreements have been reached and others are being discussed, we will have a better flow in world trade and Ireland will benefit. We must remember we cannot have everything our own way.  We cannot have all and give nothing.  There must be a balance and that achieved by our negotiators is the best possible.  We cannot always have what we seek.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1587" /> I compliment the people involved, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, and the Ministers of State.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, for coming to the House and reassuring us that the Government has done its best to get a proper settlement for GATT.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. Broadly speaking, I welcome the GATT agreement.  It will be good for some sectors of the economy and there will be substantial benefits from it.  However, that is not the case all round.  Analysis, and our intuition, leads us to believe that there will be job gains in the chemical, electronic, pharmaceutical and mechanical engineering sectors and job losses in agriculture, clothing and textiles.  That is generally agreed but it is the magnitude of the losses which gives rise to different opinions.  It is inevitable that the Government party will put the best possible face on it while the Opposition will have a different analysis.  The truth probably lies somewhere in between.</P>
      <P>Many of us spend much time assessing the likely effects on our areas.  National figures are one thing but the European Union figures are a different matter. What really matters is what effect it will have on our neighbours, their families and friends and our constituents.  In some cases that leads to quite depressing analysis. My neighbours, friends and constituents will not benefit from the gains in the chemical, electronics and pharmaceutical sectors, which will be the biggest winners, according to the best analysis I can find.  We do not have that type of industry base in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The structure of agriculture in Cavan-Monaghan, and in the western counties in general, is very weak, as 70 per cent of the farmers are working holdings under 50 acres.  I imagine some of the western counties would have a worse structure.  Therefore, we are incredibly vulnerable.  I suggest that up to 5,000 jobs will be lost over the next six years.  We are starting from a base which is not as bad as in cities and in other parts of <Col N="1588" /> the country.  There are 7,000 to 7,500 unemployed people in County Cavan and County Monaghan.  The worst scenario is that we will add another 5,000 or 6,000 to that figure over the next six years rather than make huge gains.</P>
    <P>Given the strong base of our food industry, we will continue to progress in that area.  However, our manufacturing industries &mdash; such as furniture making &mdash; in County Monaghan are becoming more mechanised and require fewer people. This is depressing.  We must analyse our present and future situation and then come up with a prescription for future policy formation.</P>
    <P>Farmers will need compensation to stay in business.  Although we are often accused of going around with a begging bowl, given the depressing unemployment figures throughout the EU we should try to keep people at work even if it takes compensation to do it.  People should not be pushed into an economy where there are no alternatives.  I would not worry if my neighbours and constituents could get jobs in factories.  Many farmers who work small pieces of land find it difficult to make a living and they would be happy with that.  However, those alternatives are not available.</P>
    <P>I am worried about future generations. Young people coming onto the jobs market each year are suffering.  We all get telephone calls for help.  Each week I receive approximately 12 calls from young people asking for help to get a job. They have written to numerous companies without success.  The economy is stagnant.  Areas with a traditional economic base which do not have modern factories suffer terribly.  People in such areas spend their limited resources sending curriculum vitaes but they get no response.  People do not understand why this happens and very often their dreams are shattered.  The romantic future they hoped for during their final years at school is destroyed.  They are left in a wasteland where they cannot use their skills.  If this trend continues, it will be bad for the ethos of the country.  We must analyse, prescribe and help ourselves but we also need outside help.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" /> Today's talks about peace highlighted the fact the Border counties have suffered because the Border exists; they have suffered because of the policy pursued by the IDA, no doubt inspired by the Government.  Goods sold in Northern Ireland do not receive financial assistance from the IDA.  For the past four or five years we have said that market penetration in Northern Ireland is poor yet we continue to pursue that policy.  If there was integration between the two economies, up to 75,000 jobs could be created.  Yet we pursue a policy which prevents us from capitalising on that market.</P>
    <P>At present, I am assisting a group who want to become involved in manufacturing and they are looking at the English and other markets rather than the Northern Ireland market because they will not get grant aid there.  The Border counties could exploit such a situation.  I ask the Minister to listen carefully to what I have said.  Given the prospects of further discussions leading to peace, it would be a gesture to Irish entrepreneurs to give them the assistance they require to exploit that market and to create a unified economy.  As I said, people involved in manufacturing do not consider the Northern Ireland market because there is no grant aid and the entire island is losing out as a result.</P>
    <P>We cannot change the situation now. This agreement will evolve over the next five or six years.  At the end of that period we can look back and say whether predictions made by Government were right or wrong.  However, those of us interested in improving the conditions of the people who elected us must continue to strive to create additional jobs.</P>
    <P>I do not believe Structural Funds will create the number of jobs we require. Some parts of the country will be unduly hit by this agreement because of the structure of their economy.  We need to work hard to try to give young people and future generations hope for the future.  I hope we will succeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been odd features to the debate which has taken place <Col N="1590" /> here and elsewhere over the past few days on GATT.  There is an air of unreality about it.  I realise it is complex and, as the last speaker said, it will take some time to digest.  There are, however, certain truths about GATT which we must accept.  In any agreement of this nature governing international trade, there must be give and take; the advantage cannot be on one side.  Some hair-raising propositions put forward about GATT &mdash; for example, the end of family farming and the destruction of a series of industries &mdash; are alarmist.  Such arguments are not based on an in-depth examination of reality.  Ireland is a small open economy and if we do not export, we die.  A GATT agreement is, therefore, more important to Ireland than to many other economies.</P>
      <P>Much has been made in the media about the role of the US.  However, we must put this in context.  Trade is less significant to the American economy than it is to the Irish economy.  A GATT agreement is vital to Ireland's better interests.  The nature of our economy is so export dependent that any failure to reach agreement, or to make the necessary compromises to reach an agreement, would have been inimical to our long term interests.  When trade relations between the US and EU declined dramatically in the 1991-92 period and it looked as if the US was going to fall back on protectionism, we saw, for the first time, the real impact this could have.  The Minister referred to the targeting of high profile exports from this country.  A 200 per cent increase in export levies on Bailey's Irish Cream and Waterford Glass products was threatened.  It does not require much imagination to see that such a move would have devastated those enterprises.  Notwithstanding the difficulties Waterford Glass has had in the past, a hike of 200 per cent in US tariff levels on what is primarily a dollar export-oriented product would have been absolutely devastating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Blair House agreement has rightly been criticised for its many warts yet, if it achieved nothing else, it did help to end that phase of the GATT negotiations.  It also introduced a number of elements <Col N="1591" /> which we, as a nation, rightly contested. Much has been said about the downside of the Blair House agreement for agriculture but our negotiators achieved the best deal they could.  With the French, we contributed a major input towards changing the final outcome on agriculture.</P>
    <P>Here and in the wider public debate, there have been some extraordinary examples of unreality.  There have even been questions as to whether we should be in GATT at all, which I find amazing because it is an argument from yesteryear. Some 30 years ago when membership of GATT was first discussed, Ireland was a small, closed economy.  As a nation we made a conscious decision, to which successive Governments contributed, to open our economy and try to create growth and prosperity from exports.  We must face reality; we cannot engage in the type of self-delusion that argues against GATT membership.</P>
    <P>Those of us who participate in public debate and the formulation of public policy have a responsibility to those participating in the real economy.  These are the people of whom Senator Cotter spoke so movingly, the people we see in our clinics; they are young people, the generation who do not seem to know where we are going.  I also wonder sometimes where we are going.</P>
    <P>I lecture in a third level institution attended by the finest people from our second level colleges and I wonder how we are going to provide jobs for them. The GATT agreement, which the Minister covered very cogently in his speech, will be one way of helping them because it will liberalise world trade.  If the agreement fulfils its objectives it will boost trade figures worldwide.  A conservative estimate has suggested the worldwide trade boost from the GATT agreement will be of the order of 1 to 1.5 per cent. Even the lower figure would mean an immediate injection in the first year of about £247 billion for world trade.  The European Union, of which we are an integral part, accounts for approximately 21 per cent of the world's export trade so <Col N="1592" /> a significant slice of that figure will accrue to Europe.  As other speakers have said, areas such as the chemical industry, electronics and certain manufacturing industries will do very well out of GATT.</P>
    <P>There will, of course, be a downside because the GATT agreement will try to cut out internal subsidies, free up export access to foreign markets and get rid of some fundamental parts of Europe's agricultural and economic policies.  I have sympathy for some of the arguments put forward by spokespersons for the agricultural sector.  In his speech the Minister dealt with the additional volumes the EU will be able to export under the revised arrangements following the original Blair House agreement.  Over the next six years these improved volumes will include 362,000 tonnes of beef; 146,000 tonnes of dairy products; 8.1 million tonnes of wheat and wheat flour; and 269,000 tonnes of poultry and eggs.  One can see from those figures that some of the worst suggestions of the agricultural commentators have not been proven, although there are elements of truth in what they said.  We all recall the debate that took place when Ireland joined the EU.  One of the great benefits was supposed to be a common market with closed access for agriculture and a guaranteed consumer market for farm products.  We are now changing that for very good reasons, not least because in the process of international trade negotiations there is give and take.  Since the give is in the agricultural area, it would be a good idea to examine the issue of compensation.</P>
    <P>We should also examine some of the contradictions involved in the GATT agreement.  When we talk about agricultural access we must recognise that any access for agricultural products into the EU will simply increase the surpluses there thus increasing the pressures on us to run down production.  There are other contradictory elements in the agreement, for example, the limited access for EU products to the Far East and Pacific markets generally and Japan in particular.  A few years ago a group from both Houses of the Oireachtas was in Taiwan seeking to increase our beef exports to that country. <Col N="1593" /> I recall the technical barriers to trade that were put in our way.  We have to accept that in the GATT agreement the entire Pacific Basin seems to have been left almost exclusively to America.</P>
    <P>The GATT agreement is not just a curate's egg, good and bad.  It has more good elements than bad, though there are obvious elements that need to be improved, such as EU access to certain markets.  On balance we must accept the agreement as the best that could be achieved and it is much better than most of us expected.  The prognostications of doom are not well founded.  I support this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate because over the last few years there has been very little discussion of the broad topic of GATT.  When a debate took place it was unintelligent and biased in the way it was presented.  Effectively, the farm lobby said GATT would be the death knell for Irish agriculture while the trade unions and IBEC never mentioned the agreement.  The overall GATT agreement is good for the Irish economy and that is why it must be accepted.  Some Senators have said the GATT deal is bad for the country but I cannot understand how, if it is good for the economy, it can be bad for Ireland.</P>
      <P>The issue of rural depopulation was also raised.  We must realise that many young people do not wish to stay on the land and if we can create jobs for them in other areas then this GATT agreement is welcome.  How can one tell a young person who inherits 20 acres that they must stay on the land because jobs cannot be provided anywhere else?  I am confident that jobs will be created by the GATT agreement which will balance world trade and help Ireland's open economy. We can no longer tell the farm lobby that the endless supply of subsidies will continue because we are living in the real world which is ruled by the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to frequently remind people who are dependent on subsidies <Col N="1594" /> that they will not last forever.  GATT is a step towards the liberalisation of world trade which will eventually see subsidies being reduced.  We will be trading in a world economy where efficiency will survive and inefficiency will not.  It is disingenuous of us to discuss subsidies time and again.  We must discuss other ways we can provide jobs.</P>
    <P>The agreement came about in difficult circumstances.  I welcome some of the concessions to which we acceded in the Blair House agreement.  The general thrust of the GATT is welcome.  Senators on both sides of the House realise the need for a world trade agreement and it is time such an agreement was reached.</P>
    <P>Irish farm leaders called on the Government to veto the agreement.  This was very unfair.  They put a gun to the Government's head when the overriding factor was the economy and our people. The suggestion that we use the veto in the national interest was very disingenuous. Not all the unemployed or the young people leaving college, who cannot find work, are farmers.  We should look to the greater good rather than to vested interests.</P>
    <P>I welcome the agreement.  The Director General of the GATT, Mr. Peter Sutherland, said the agreement was good for this country and advised us to sign it quickly before it was too late.  I compliment Mr. Ray MacSharry.  At times he had to take a lot of flak.  He was hailed as a hero until he announced a 30 per cent cut in exports.  With hindsight, that was a good deal.</P>
    <P>The GATT deal is an improvement on the Blair House agreement and it must be welcomed.  I compliment everybody associated with the negotiations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify a point. It was said that I criticised the newspapers for not opposing the agreement.  I did not do so.  I said the debate in the print media was biased.  The coverage given to agriculture in the papers today was very limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave details of the additional volumes of beef and dairy products the EU will be able to export <Col N="1595" /> over the next six years compared to what would have resulted from the original Blair House agreement.  This is the agreement to which we objected all along.  The Minister said the Union will be able to export an additional 362,000 tonnes of beef.  However, we should not be fooled by this figure.  At the end of the six years there will be a volume reduction of approximately 5 per cent.  There will be a 4 per cent reduction in the volume of dairy products which can be exported. This is where the problem lies.  While I accept this agreement is an improvement on the Blair House agreement, nevertheless the figures relating to volume reductions are staring us in the face.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche raised the issue of subsidies. I do not trust the Americans.  Over the years they have complained bitterly about the subsidisation of agriculture throughout Europe.  However, they subsidise their own 2 million farmers by approximately £28 billion a year and they will find a way to continue doing so.  One year they may have a drought, which will be regarded as a disaster, and they will compensate farmers.  The next year they may have a hurricane and again they will subsidise farmers.  I do not know how this can be controlled.  This has been the practice in America through the years.  I am sure the US Government will find a way to continue subsidising their farmers. The US was very keen to insist on volume reductions and cuts in subsidies to reduce agriculture prices to world market levels. We will find, and we will not have too long to wait, there is no equivalent to the way the US subsidises agriculture based on the numbers farming.</P>
    <P>Some lots in the US run 6,500 to 7,500 cattle and are farmed by two or three people.  There are huge dust bowls and tracts of land in California managed by one or two people.  We do not want such a situation here.  We have family farms. When we had a scarcity of food during the war years, it was the small family farmer who provided food.  I do not want to see these farms disappear overnight.</P>
    <P>We are not complaining about the agreement but the impact it will have on <Col N="1596" /> agriculture.  As the volumes are reduced, costs in the processing sector will increase resulting in redundancies.  Not only farmers but rural areas will be affected.  I would hate to see farmers with less than 100 acres, particularly in the beef sector, become non-viable overnight.  The milk sector is not very prosperous but at least people can have viable holdings in respect of 35,000 to 40,000 gallons of milk.  The same cannot be said of the beef sector.  If the 21 per cent cut is implemented in five years time, the beef sector will not be viable.  This sector is vital to this country.  We export approximately 80 per cent of the beef we produce.  Our agricultural exports amount to between £4 billion and £5 billion and our industrial exports amount to £12 billion.  We should also take import content into account.  If there is a decline in the rural economy that would be bad for Ireland.</P>
    <P>In relation to compensation, the Minister and everybody else knows the EU agriculture budget always faces difficulties. This is the only source from which compensation for losses can be paid.  Neither the UK nor Germany will allow further compensation.  The Minister said &ldquo;the assurances obtained at the European Council and in the Council of Ministers can be relied on to secure any necessary compensatory measures at European Union level.&rdquo;  The Minister said this in the knowledge he has of the difficulties facing the EU agriculture budget.  He knows that a tough battle will have to be fought to obtain any further concessions in respect of compensation.  I had experience of negotiations in Europe when it was easier to obtain money for agriculture.  The Minister may think the GATT negotiations were a big battle but seeking compensation will be just as difficult. I do not foresee an improvement in this area in view of the attitude of the British and the Germans.  Their main interests are in the industrial side of the global economy.  They will not provide money for compensation.</P>
    <P>There is always a danger when multinational conglomerates achieve control of any area.  They now have the benefit <Col N="1597" /> of a global agreement and there is no doubt they will move their industrial bases to the cheaper economies.  They will flood the dearer economies with high volumes of products which will lead to the collapse of some markets.  They have done this before.  We got no support from multinational financial institutions last year when interest rates were soaring at 20 to 25 per cent.  They were ready for the kill.  The big multinationals will do the same.  They will sell large volumes of products at cheap prices which will destroy our markets.  Nevertheless, as a reasonable politician with an understanding of our economy, I accept that as a small open economy we have little option but we must continue to fight our case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1598" /> I initiated three debates in this House on GATT.  I presume the Minister appreciates that we need to keep him and his Department sharp in the different areas.  It is essential to debate and to try to get improvements in any area of the economy.  I hope that what I am saying will not come true in the next four or five years.  However, there has to be an ongoing debate in this and the other House to ensure, now that the agreement is signed, that any measures for improvement in agriculture do not drive our farmers from the land, as I believe may happen as a result of this agreement.</P>

      <P>I dtús báire cuirim <Col N="1599" /> fáilte roimh an Aire atá anseo anocht in ionad an Aire Oideachais.</P>
      <P>Ní féidir le Coiste Gairm Oideachais Chontae ne Gaillimhe a scéim Oideachais a chur í gcrích go huile agus go hiomlán gan seirbhísi timire Gaeilge a bheith ar fáil.  Tá sé seo intuigthe nuair a chuireann tú san áireamh go bhfuil scéim Chontae na Gaillimhe ar an cuigiú scéim is mó san tír.  Tá an obair ag dul i méid in aghaidh na bliana agus is amhlaidh gur géire an riachtanas dá bhrí sin go gceadódh an Roinn Oideachais timire Gaeilge buan.</P>
      <P>Chomh maith leis sin tá dlúthbhaint idir an Ghaeilge agus obair an choiste mar atá léirithe ag na gníomhaíochtaí éagsúla a thiteann mar dhualgais ar an timire Gaeilge.  Is orthu siúd a thiteann an obair a bhaineann leis na míreanna seo a leanas: (1) tá scéim scóláireachtaí i Rosmuc agus 120 gasúr ag freastal ar chúrsaí a bhí ann gan briseadh ó 1933; (2) tá cúrsa do ábhar mhúinteoirí don Cheard Teastas á chur ar fáil gach bliain, (3) tá cúrsa do iascairí óga á chur ar fáil; (4) tá scoileanna éigse agus seanachais á eagrú agus féithoireachta á dhéanamh orthu agus ollchruinnithe á socrú; tá freastal mar thimire ar cúig scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht agus ocht san fhíor Ghaeltacht; (6) tá freastal mar thimire ar na trí Oileáin in Árainn.  Is léir ón méid sin atá le déanamh ag timire Gaeilge nach mór comharba a cheapadh láithreach do Liam Ó Donnchadha, iar-thimire a chuaigh amach ar phinsean ar 31 Lúnasa 1992.  Iarraimid mar sin faomhadh na Roinne don cheapachán seo gan a thuilleadh moille.</P>
      <P>County Galway Vocational Education Committee is urgently in need of an Irish organiser to replace Liam Ó Donnchadha who resigned from the position on 31 August 1992 having given distinguished service and reached retirement age.  The committee had the unbroken services of a timire Gaeilge from 1933 to 1992 and Liam O'Donnchadha acted as timire since 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one takes into account that County Galway vocational education committee has the fifth largest scheme in the country and that the scheme <Col N="1600" /> embraces large Gaeltacht areas, it is evident that the committee cannot fully implement its scheme without the services of an Irish organiser.  The amount of work involved in putting the scheme into operation is increasing annually, due to enrolment figures showing an upward trend in most schools in the county.  It has always been the vocational education committee's policy to expand the scheme to comply with various achievements involving the provision of education courses and so on.  Some of this work would, no doubt, fall to the Irish organiser.</P>
    <P>The following is a summary of the duties of an Irish organiser and future developments would add to this summary: (1) the organisation and implementation of the Rosmuc scholarship scheme for 120 students which has been in operation with an unbroken record since 1935; (2) the course for the teacher trainees who wish to obtain the Ceard-Teastais; this course is held annually in Carraroe; (3) the holding of a young fishermen's course at a Gaeltacht venue and (4) the organisation and superintending of scoileanna éigse agus seanachais, that is, the Irish folklore groups in the Gaeltacht; (5) work as an Irish organiser in five Gaeltacht and eight iar-Gaeltacht nó Galltacht schools throughout the county of Galway.</P>
    <P>As will be seen from this summary of duties, it is imperative that the Department of Education authorise the appointment of a full-time permanent Irish organiser for County Galway vocational education committee without further delay.  Otherwise a major portion of the committee's scheme will remain unaccomplished to the detriment of County Galway in general and certain areas in particular.  Tá litir anseo agam ó Chumann Príomhoidí na nGairm Scoil agus na gColáistí Pobal chun a chur in iúl don Aire comh práinneach is atá an scéal. Téann sé mar seo:</P>
    <P>A Chara:</P>
    <P>Ag cruinniú na bPríomhoidí ar an lú Nollaig, '93, chuir an Príomhoifigeach Feidhmiúcháin, Choiste Gairmoideachas <Col N="1601" /> Chontae na Gaillimhe, in iúl dúinn nach raibh Timire Gaeilge Lan-Aimseartha Buan le fáil don chontae seo, i.e.  Chontae na Gaillimhe.</P>
    <P>Chuir seo ionadh agus alltacht orainn óir bhí Timire Gaeilge ag gniomhú i gContae na Gaillimhe ó 1935 i leith.</P>
    <P>Is scanallach an scéal é seo agus fulaingneóidh Cúrsaí Gaeilge agus Cultúrtha in iomlán dá bhárr.  Tá Cúrsaí Scoláireachtaí ar siúl ó 1935 i leith agus cuidíonn siad seo go mór le meas agus gean i leith na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta. Tá an obair iontach seo ar fad a bhí ar siúl ag an Timire Gaeilge le beagnach 60 bliain i mbaol agus an Ghaeilge i lag trá go náisiúnta.</P>
    <P>Impíonn-muidne ort ó Chumann na bPríomhoidí, gníomhú agus féachaint chuige go mbeidh Timire Gaeilge Lan-Aimseartha Buan againn ag tús 1994.</P>
    <P>Tá an litir sínithe ag Michéal Breathnach, Rúnaí Gairmscoil Cholmain Naofa, Gort Inse Guaire, ar son Cumann Príomhoidí na nGairm Scoil agus na gColáistí Pobal.</P>
    <P>To summarise, there is consternation in County Galway vocational education committee.  The principal's association of all the schools in the county share this worry.  Landladies who in many cases have put extensions onto their houses to cater for the students at the Irish courses in summer are extremely worried.  This is a major business in the Gaeltacht of Connemara.  The situation has been exacerbated by the fact that the adult education officer of County Galway vocational education committee is now going on a career break to Russia.  The great anomaly is that the Minister for the Gaeltacht is bringing in Teilifís na Gaeilge at this time.  As Fine Gael spokesperson for the Gaeltacht in this House I commend the Minister for his meaningful effort to consolidate the language.</P>
    <P>County Galway vocational education committee, of which I am the vice chairman, has set up a special subcommittee to input into this new service but nobody will be there to service this committee <Col N="1602" /> now because we have no timire Gaeilge in the county.  The Galway Gaeltacht areas have contributed much to the Irish language over the years and I appeal to the Minister and to the Minister of State who is here tonight to represent her to let the work continue.  There is an onus on the Minister at this crucial time to allow County Galway vocational education committee to appoint a timire exclusively for County Galway vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on the record that unless this permission from the Minister for Education is forthcoming the consequences are frightening and manifold: (1) the highly successful Gaeltacht scholarship scheme will no longer function; (2) courses for young fishermen in the Gaeltacht will die; (3) the course for teacher trainees who wish to obtain the Ceard-Teastas, held annually in Carraroe &mdash; a very important qualification for teachers in vocational schools &mdash; can no longer continue in the Gaeltacht of Connemara; (4) the organisation and superintending of Irish folklore groups in the Gaeltacht will cease; (5) work as Irish organiser in Gaeltacht and iar-Gaeltacht schools will be grievously affected and (6) the proposed County Galway vocational education committee input into the newly proposed Teilifís na Gaeilge will be lost.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the Minister gives approval to County Galway vocational education committee to appoint a timire exclusively for County Galway vocational education committee.  I wish to lay particular emphasis on the word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo; because it is established already that County Galway vocational education committee has had a timire since 1935.  It embraces the full Gaeltacht of Connemara and the Aran Islands.  We applied for our own timire and, as the Minister is aware, the reply we got was not satisfactory.  If this timire is not approved and sanctioned it will be to the major detriment of the Irish language in Galway.  Ministers from Galway are already familiar with the situation that prevails, particularly the Minister for the Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, who is doing such great work in setting up Teilifís <Col N="1603" /> na Gaeilge.  It is imperative that the Minister allows County Galway vocational education committee appoint a timire exclusively for the county of Galway.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, níl ach beagán Gaeilge agam.  Más mian leis an Teach labharfaidh mé i mBéarla.  I am glad the Senator has raised this matter as it gives me an opportunity to inform the House of the Department's position.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the House that the Minister is committed to the preservation of our national language and culture and that she would not be party to any decision which would result in the services in respect of the Irish language being provided by County Galway vocational education committee &ldquo;grinding to a halt&rdquo;, to use Senator McDonagh's words.</P>
      <P>It is important that the House should be aware of the background facts in relation to this issue.  In June 1992, the chief executive officer of County Galway Vocational Education Committee informed my Department that the timire Gaeilge employed by his committee would be retiring at the end of August 1992.</P>
      <P>The officials of the Department immediately made inquiries in order to ascertain the nature of the duties carried out by the retiring officer and to establish whether the filling of the vacancy created by his retirement was warranted.  No other vocational education committee in the country has such a post.  Discussions were held with the chief executive officer and it was intimated to him that, on the basis of the information provided, the Department was not prepared to sanction the appointment of a replacement timire Gaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officer immediately wrote to my Department requesting the appointment of an educational officer who would assume the duties of a timire Gaeilge as well as those of education officer.  A schedule signed by the chief executive officer containing the conditions of service of an education officer <Col N="1604" /> was attached to his application.  Incidentally, the duties of an education officer and a timire Gaeilge are not the same.  Subsequently, further correspondence was received in the Department which indicated that County Galway vocational education committee were seeking appointment of both an education officer and a timire Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Following receipt of these requests, the Department reviewed the position carefully and in detail.  It was decided not to sanction the appointment of an education officer for County Galway vocational education committee.  Furthermore, the Department was not convinced that there was a need for a full-time post of timire Gaeilge to service the area of the County of Galway for which County Galway vocational education committee is responsible.  However, it was accepted that there was a need for a timire Gaeilge in the region.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, my Department advised both the chief executive officer of County Galway vocational education committee and the chief executive officer of the City of Galway vocational education committee in writing on 5 May 1993 of its decision to approve the appointment of a timire.  The letter to each chief executive officer indicated, <i>inter alia</i>, that the person to be appointed would be responsible for the performance of duties for both the City and County vocational education committees.  Conditions of service and the qualification requirements relating to the proposed appointment were also provided.  The post has been advertised and I understand that a number of applications have been received.</P>
    <P>The appointment process has not advanced beyond that stage to date.  I am aware there have been discussions between the chairpersons and chief executive officers of the two vocational education committees in relation to the appointment procedures and the allocation of duties to the timire.  Unfortunately, it appears that the discussions have run into difficulties and final agreement has not been reached.  As a result, the post remains vacant.</P>
    <P>The Minister's decision in relation to the need for a post still stands.  She is convinced that the post is required to <Col N="1605" /> maintain the service to an Gaeilge in the region.  The Department has already approved filling the post on that basis and any further delay in this regard should be avoided.  I, therefore, urge both vocational education committees to get together to resolve whatever problems still exist so that the timire Gaeilge may be appointed under the terms and conditions outlined in the Department's letter of 5 May 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for giving me permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment. This is an important issue in the Mallow area.  I thank the Minister of State for staying to reply and I hope, irrespective of the reply given previously that the points I make will be taken on board and that the Minister and the Department will respond.  There are 32 children currently attending Scoil Ghobnatán in Mallow, County Cork, who have been without a teacher since last September.  The pupils are now being supervised by their parents in an organised way and I appeal to the Minister to appoint a temporary teacher in accordance with a previous proposal of the INTO.</P>
      <P>The background to this problem is the falling birth rate which has led to the decline in the number of children entering schools in Mallow, as in other areas of the country.  There was a general agreement in Mallow that because of this there is a need to reorganise the schools generally in the area and the parents and the board of management of Scoil Ghobnatán fully support this.  Since February 1993 they have been seeking to have a full debate on future policy regarding primary schools in Mallow which is borne out by a letter written by the board chairman to the town clerk of Mallow on 11 August 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Scoil Ghobnatán is the only primary school on the south side of Mallow.  When the school reopened in September, it seemed reasonable to the parents to keep their children in attendance in view of the fact that there were two empty classrooms.  The alternative was to send them to schools on the north side of the <Col N="1606" /> town which involves sending their children through heavy traffic and leaving pre-school children at home.  The parents have given a commitment to abide by any future decisions of the Minister for Education in the matter of overall school reorganisation in Mallow.  However, pending this, it is important that the Minister should intervene to appoint a temporary teacher.  The children have been without a proper teacher now for more than three months and they should not be asked to start another term in January without the teacher they need.</P>
    <P>When the school reopened, as I said, it was reasonable to keep the children in Scoil Ghobnatán, the reason being that since February 1993, the other boards, despite the efforts being made, failed to come together to start the process of rationalisation which the Minister and the Department wanted carried out in Mallow at the time, and which is accepted as necessary.  The failure of the delegate conference to make any positive progress towards a rationalisation of the primary school structure in Mallow leaves the 32 children in Scoil Ghobnatán without a teacher.  Despite the willingness of the Scoil Ghobnatán parents' association to compromise on this, the boards of management of St. Patrick's and St. Mary's national schools still saw fit to veto the appointment of a temporary teacher to Scoil Ghobnatán.  The reason there has been no progress in relation to rationalisation is because the boards of St. Patrick's and St. Mary's schools have refused to address the issue for fear of undermining their own position.  Their stubborn position has been highlighted by their refusal to allow a temporary teacher for the 32 children in third class in Scoil Ghobnatán.</P>
    <P>The parents stated they believe that the teachers in these two schools objected on 27 November &mdash; three days before the conference meeting and there was no mention of it at the conference &mdash; to the appointment of a temporary teacher, despite the fact that their jobs would not be affected.  No teacher will lose his or her position due to rationalisation.  The INTO, the only outside body to have examined the situation, recommended that a temporary teacher be appointed to <Col N="1607" /> Scoil Ghobnatán.  The parents of Scoil Ghobnatán were willing to abide by the conditions laid down by the INTO proposal and have also made a commitment to abide by future decisions of the Minister for Education in the matter of school rationalisation in Mallow.</P>
    <P>At a meeting with the manager of the school, Monsignor Denis O'Callaghan, on 11 November, the parents were assured that the situation regarding the appointment of a temporary teacher would be resolved at the delegate conference on 30 November.  Following the meeting of the delegate conference, the manager informed the parents &mdash; and the board of Scoil Ghobnatán also reached the same decision &mdash; that he now had the acquiescence of all parties at the conference for the request for a temporary teacher for the 32 children.  On 3 December the manager committed himself to making an immediate application to the Department of Education for a temporary teacher.  The parents cannot understand why this application has not been made and why his commitment has not been honoured but it is reasonable to assume it was because of objections by teachers in St. Patrick's and St. Mary's schools.</P>
    <P>The parents of the pupils of those schools say that they are indifferent to it and the manager, Monsignor O'Callaghan, said when he contacted the Department he found that two teachers had already voiced an objection.  I heard him make that statement as I was present. I contend, like the parents and the board of management, that theirs is a legitimate request and that it is their constitutional right to have their children educated in their own locality.  The space is available and it is unreasonable to expect that children should be forced to pass empty classrooms and cross town, particularly in the middle of winter, for no better reason than to safeguard the position of St. Mary's and St. Patrick's schools.  That is the opinion in Mallow town.  Have those people the right to veto a legitimate request to the Department for a temporary teacher to be appointed pending the outcome of the overall rationalisation?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> I received a letter from the Minister and the position of the Department was that the <i>status quo</i> should prevail for the 1993-1994 period.  The reason it did not happen is that it was plain the other schools would not co-operate in the conference that would lead to the future policy of rationalisation, hence, the decision by the parents to keep the children in Scoil Ghobnatán &mdash; in their locality and in the only school on the south side of the town.  The main point I want to make is that it is unreasonable for the others to drag their feet as they have done.  It is reasonable for the parents to say that there is space there and that they want their children educated in this school.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minster and the Department to look at the situation with a view to having a teacher appointed pending the conference and to have the conference expedited.  If there is to be a conference &mdash; and the whole future policy hinges on that &mdash; there is no reason any particular section should drag its heels on the matter.</P>

There are six primary schools in Mallow town, including the Church of Ireland and the all Irish schools: Scoil Ghobnatán &mdash; boys and girls to second class inclusive; Mercy girls' national school &mdash; girls first class to sixth class; St. Patrick's boys' national school &mdash; boys first class to sixth class; Scoil Iosagáin &mdash; infant boys and girls; Gaelscoil Thomais Dhaibhis &mdash; full range boys and girls; Mallow Church of Ireland &mdash; full range boys and girls.  There is certainly no shortage of classroom space in Mallow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 1993 the authorities of Scoil Ghobnatán applied for sanction to retain boys and girls in third class from September 1993 and to be allowed to extend to a full range school.  These pupils would normally have transferred to the Mercy girls and St. Patrick's boys' schools.  Scoil Ghobnatán is located on the southside of the river Blackwater whereas the other schools are on the north side of the river. The school was established in 1970 for children up to and including first standard. <Col N="1609" /> The main reason for its establishment was that children of that age were too young to travel the 1.5 to 2 miles through the centre of the town to the schools on the northside.  In 1986 the school was allowed to retain boys up to second standard and in 1992 to retain girls to second standard.  The chief reason given for the request to develop to a full range school was that children in the third to sixth classes should not have to travel to the other schools because of their age.</P>
    <P>Following the request the Department consulted the patron of the schools and the local inspector.  Submissions were received from the school authorities of Scoil Ghobnatán, the school's parents' group, the Mercy girls' national school and St. Patrick's boys' national school. The authorities of the Mercy and St. Patrick's schools were totally opposed to any change in the status of Scoil Ghobnatán as it would significantly reduce their enrolments and lead to loss of teaching posts.  I should add that with the declining demographic trends these schools' enrolments were already declining but the loss of the pupils from Scoil Ghobnatán would exacerbate the situation.</P>
    <P>The Department considered that the question of the retention of pupils in Scoil Ghobnatán was part of the much larger issue which needed to be addressed, the question of the reorganisation of the schools generally in Mallow in the light of the expected major decline in enrolments in the centre.  To allow for a fuller examination of this complex matter, the Department decided that the <i>status quo</i> should be maintained in the centre for the 1993-94 school year and that a major examination would take place early in that school year.  The Scoil Ghobnatán authorities were informed of this decision in July 1993 and told that if the pupils were retained in the school in September 1993 they could not be included for staffing or capitation grant purposes.</P>
    <P>The outcome was that the parents of the pupils in question presented their children at Scoil Ghobnatán on 1 September 1993 despite the Department's instruction.  The school authorities felt they could not refuse the pupils entry and, accordingly, were allowed into the <Col N="1610" /> school.  No additional teaching services were provided on the basis that these services were available in the schools to which the pupils should have transferred.</P>
    <P>The present position is that the parish priest has held a number of meetings with the school managements to try to resolve the immediate problem of the Scoil Ghobnatán pupils and to raise the question of the general reorganisation of the schools in the town.  The most recent meeting was held last Monday night with the boards of the Mercy and St. Patrick's schools.  These boards are still totally opposed to any compromise solution for the appointment of a temporary teacher in Scoil Ghobnatán for the 32 pupils. Objections centred on two points: allowing irregular action by a group of parents to override a specific Department decision on a given matter would constitute a dangerous precedent which would undermine authority generally in the field of education; the present unacceptable situation of the 32 pupils retained in Scoil Ghobnatán without a teacher is due to that irregular action, for which the boards of the Mercy and St. Patrick's schools cannot be held responsible.  The boards stated that the 32 children would be welcome in their schools, as they had always been.</P>
    <P>The Department will now urgently review the situation in the light of the failure of the most recent local meetings to come forward with a compromise to resolve the present unsatisfactory situation of the pupils in question.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair.  I understand the reasons the Chair has forced me to avail of this rather unsatisfactory means of highlighting the Clonmannon issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the House will be aware of the ongoing problems in Clonmannon retirement village at Ashford, County Wicklow, which should be the ideal retirement home.  It is a beautiful campus of self contained bungalows ranged around the old home of Chester Beatty, which is now a nursing home.  The dream of a peaceful retirement for those who bought into Clonmannon has turned into <Col N="1611" /> an unbelievable nightmare.  Without wishing to sensationalise the issue, the dispute in Clonmannon has reached the point where the health and, I believe, the lives of some of the residents are under threat.</P>
    <P>Clonmannon was built some years ago by Retirement Ireland Ltd.  A second company, Home Affairs, provided the service, care and management of the complex.  Retirement Ireland and its sister company went into liquidation in 1989.  They were taken over by a company called Rayhill which brought in a new company &mdash; also closely related to it &mdash; called Hilltop Catering to take over the care and management of the complex. For some time things went well but, following a breakdown in management and a series of extraordinarily tangled litigation, the quality of the service began to dramatically decline.</P>
    <P>In addition to declining services, a range of charges were introduced and imposed on residents.  They had to pay for things which were previously understood to be part of their expensive care contracts.  Where the nursing services in the nursing home were, under the terms of the care contracts, always made available to the residents of the estate, they were now charged on an individual basis. People who required daily injections were invoiced at the rate of £10 per injection. When people were supplied with support stockings, which had been laundered, they were charged £10.  When sanitary and incontinence pads were delivered, they were charged £10 for delivery. They were charged £3 for nail clipping.  Hilltop Catering also announced some time ago that they were, in addition to the individual charges, imposing a 3 per cent across the board charge.</P>
    <P>While this was going on there were very odd occurrences within the operations of the two companies involved. <Col N="1612" /> Assets from Rayhill, the property owning company, which was involved in litigation at the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do.  The assets were being transferred.  The transfer of assets frightened the residents who withheld their care charges.  Since then they have suffered the following consequences: water supply to a number of the houses has been cut off; services from the nursing home have been cut off; catering has been cut off; the telephones which operate through the central switchboard have been cut off.  There have been threats to cut off the electricity.  Public lighting in the estate has been cut off.  There have been two or three serious accidents among the residents of the estate.  I believe there is a thinly veiled threat to cut off electricity over Christmas and to interfere with the sanitary services.</P>
      <P>As a member of local authorities, the health board and as a Member of the Oireachtas, I am frustrated that there appears to be no statutory agency empowered to intervene.  I ask that our concerns in this matter be brought to the attention of the Minister for Health and the Minister for the Environment because public health and safety is involved.  I also ask that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment be requested to appoint an examiner or an inspector as appropriate, to look into the tangled and extraordinarily complex affairs of these companies.</P>
