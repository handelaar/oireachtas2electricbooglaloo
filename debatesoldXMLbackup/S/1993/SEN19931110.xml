      <P>I have notice from Senator Naughten that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to amend the farm retirement scheme proposed by the EC as it will not be applicable to the vast majority of Irish farmers.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator McGowan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide funding for an extension to St.  Columba College, Stranorlar, County Donegal.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Burke of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to upgrade to national primary status the routes from Swinford to Ballina and Castlebar to Westport, County Mayo, as a continuation of the N5.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Cotter of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to take action to protect the jobs of 75 people <Col N="230" /> who are employed in the manufacture of hamburgers at a factory in the Castleblayney area of County Monaghan.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to allocate more funding to Co-operation North.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Dardis of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to alleviate the losses suffered by potato and horticultural growers in Leinster resulting from the exceptional weather conditions during the growing season.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Farrelly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Minister for the Environment to approve funding for the provision of the new fire station at Kells, County Meath.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Naughten, McGowan, Burke, Cotter, Ross, Dardis and Farrelly as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Naughten and McGowan and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with great sadness that I offer the House and my party's sympathy to the wife and family of the late Mr. Eamonn Rooney, a former Senator and TD.  It is a great loss for the people of Malahide.  Mr. Rooney was a great friend to the people in Malahide, although political differences existed.  He <Col N="231" /> was a great businessman in north County Dublin who was involved in the community. He had a love for horses and I often had the pleasure of meeting him at race meetings.  On behalf of the House and my party, I express our sympathy to his wife and family.  May he rest in peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Leader of the House in expressing sympathy to the family of the late Mr. Eamonn Rooney.  He was a quiet, decent person of integrity &mdash; the type our parties have been lucky to have as members over the years.  He made a substantial, if unacknowledged, contribution to public life.</P>
      <P>Mr. Rooney came from a family steeped in the Sinn Féin tradition.  He represented County Dublin, a very large constituency in those days, for 18 years. As the Leader said, he was a north Dublin man and proud to be so.  His 23 years in the Oireachtas, 18 years in the Dáil and five years in this House, spanned the departure of the Civil War giants and the arrival of a new generation into Irish politics.</P>
      <P>He was a wise, friendly man who was particularly good at encouraging young people.  He was loyal to his own party but, as has been said, his tolerance and natural sympathy enabled him to make friends across party boundaries.  Most of all, he will be remembered for his decency and as one of nature's gentlemen. The Fine Gael group send our deep sympathy to his wife and family.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Independent group I offer my sympathy to the wife and family of the late Mr. Eamonn Rooney.  He was a friend of my father; I do not think anyone present in this House served with Mr. Eamonn Rooney.  I remember a friendship which extended over a long number of years.  I knew him as a man of strength and quiet dignity. The country will miss him as a good friend of Ireland.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour group I extend a vote of sympathy to the wife and family of the late <Col N="232" /> Mr. Eamonn Rooney.  As other Members have said, he served for 23 years in both Houses.  His service to the nation and to north County Dublin will be long remembered.</P>

On behalf of Democratic Left I want to be associated with the vote of sympathy to his wife and family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the only Member of the House who served with the late Mr. Eamonn Rooney I want to be associated with what has been said.  As Senator Manning said, he tried to reconcile the Civil War divisions which still existed when I entered the Houses of the Oireachtas in 1965.  He had a deep respect for those from every tradition in this House.  His conduct as a Member of this House and his commitment to his own people are an example to all.  I would like to be associated with the vote of sympathy.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader of the House if, by arrangement with the Whips, there could be flexibility on the time given to the principal speakers on Item 2 because it is a Bill, not a motion. Can the Leader give us definite news about a debate on Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have run out of patience seeking information on the legislative programme.  In a month from now the Leader will probably be telling us about extra days sittings before Christmas but we still do not know the programme of legislation to be initiated in this House.  I am considering calling a vote to draw attention to the lack of co-operation from Departments if we do not know by this day next week what legislation is proposed for the remainder of the term. That would encourage people to act more efficiently.  I do not include the Leader of the House in those remarks because I know he is seeking a response from various Departments.  However it is important to draw attention to the lack of organisation by the Government in the area of legislation.  We need someone to take a decision and say when the Bills will be taken, the order in which they will be taken, where they will be initiated and the list of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to indicate what progress has been made in providing time for a debate on Northern Ireland.  He is aware, as are the Members of the House, that we have been looking for this for several weeks and there have been calls for it from all sides.  Perhaps he could indicate when we could expect to have that debate.</P>
      <P>It is also important that we have a debate on GATT, and the Leader was asked about this previously.  There have been developments in the last week at European Community level and we are due to conclude a deal before the middle of December.  Since it is important we discuss this matter before then, perhaps he could make time available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader if we can have a debate on the national plan now that it is being questioned.  Those of us from rural Ireland are extremely concerned that the EC are querying the amount for regional and county roads. There should be no diminution of the inadequate amount allocated to such roads in the plan and we should fight tooth and nail to ensure that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise again a subject I mentioned last week for which I received considerable support, that is the question of drugs, especially in the inner city of Dublin.  In a moving programme last night mothers of inner city children spoke passionately and with great dignity on this issue.  The Leader indicated he was arranging time for a debate of this issue and perhaps he could say when such a debate might take place so that we could prepare for it.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's further call for a debate on the North of Ireland. I am sure that is in the Leader's mind.  I ask for a target date for this because he has already given a commitment in principle.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning requested a change in times on Item 2 to be taken between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.  I assume he is suggesting the opening speaker should have an extended period because it is a legislative item.  I have no difficulty with that if the time could be extended so other speakers would not be excluded as a result.  It would show the seriousness&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I see.  I mention one other item, and I am sure you, a Chathaoirligh, will tell me whether it is in order.  If not, perhaps the Leader could mention it tomorrow.  Every Senator would surely extend the best wishes of this House to the former Taoiseach, Mr. Lynch, who is in hospital.  If it is not appropriate for me to mention this today perhaps the Leader would formally do this tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Toole.  Members of this House will continue to demand that legislation is brought in for debate in this House.

      <P>On the timetable for the spokespersons, we will talk about that later.  In that regard, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is today discussing the formula for Private Members business and related issues.  It is encouraging that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is meeting on the basis that more people want to be involved in the House.  We will deal with that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the debate on Northern Ireland, I have spoken to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and I may have more information for tomorrow morning.  My colleagues, Senator O'Sullivan, Senator Magner and I are pursuing the matter and hope to have a definite timeframe on it.</P>
      <P>With regard to legislation, I am in contact with the Chief Whip on a daily basis in respect of the need for a legislative programme to be outlined; I spoke to him again this morning.  The Adoptive Leave Bill will be initiated in the House tomorrow.  Between now and Christmas new legislation will be initiated in this House.</P>

    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few questions on this section.  My first question may appear frivolous but it is not in reality. This Bill intreprets and defines what words mean and in page 7, &ldquo;aircraft&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;a machine that can derive support in the atmosphere from the reactions of the air,&rdquo;&mdash; I can understand that part of it, but &ldquo;other than the reactions of the air against the earth's surface&rdquo; created some problems me.  I want to make a few points on this matter and as I said, I am not being frivolous.</P>
      <P>Over the weekend, we read of a certain event in the United States where a certain Mr. Miller was, according to witnesses, circulating around 800 feet above the ground and would have succeeded in landing, were it not for some lighting cables, in the middle of a boxing ring. There was a fair element of accuracy in that.  I do not know if the Minister knows &mdash; I have no knowledge of it myself &mdash; what kind of a contraption Mr. Miller was operating but if this machine derived its support in the atmosphere from the reactions of the air, it is covered under the Bill, but if it derived its support from the reactions of the air against the earth's surface, it is not included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am expected, like every other Member, to assent to the contents of this <Col N="238" /> Bill and I want to be satisfied that I know what is the definition applied to an aircraft, especially with regard to the latter part of the definition &mdash;&ldquo;other than the reactions of the air against the earth's surface&rdquo;.  What is the Minister talking about here?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in the points made by Senator Howard.  He has given the definition of aircraft in the Bill himself.  The vehicles included in that are power driven aircraft, aeroplanes and helicopters, non-power driven aircraft, balloons, gliders and hangliders.  When we refer to reactions of the air against the earth's surface &mdash; the surface of the earth includes land and water &mdash; we are referring to a machine similar to a hovercraft which reacts on the surface of the water and moves without going into the air.  The Bill excludes such machines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>A hovercraft only?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said.  I want to move on to the subject of the authorised officer.  There are four categories defined in the Bill.  I want the Minister to explain what function or role he envisages, for example, for an officer of the Permanent Defence Forces and an officer of Customs and Excise?  I can understand that there is a role for an officer of the Minister or a member of the staff of the company, but what role is envisaged for the Commissioner of Public Works?  I am sure the Minister understands my interest in this given the area I come from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Howard asked about the role envisaged for an officer of the Customs and Excise and an officer of the Permanent Defence Forces.  When introducing legislation, we must take into account existing legislation and the effect new legislation might have in impinging on the operation of existing legislation and laws of the State.  The purpose of <Col N="239" /> including these officers is that in this situation these definitions will enable the company to authorise those people to act as authorised officers of the company for any period of time, including an officer of the Permanent Defence Forces holding a commissioned rank from lieutenant upwards, an officer of the Minister, an officer of the Customs and Excise or a member of staff of the company.  It could relate to drugs, the security of the State, a disaster, etc., in other words, the Authority would have the power to delegate functions of responsibility to appointed officers from other State Departments or agencies to carry out functions on behalf of the authority in the interests of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 is long.  In the Bill &ldquo;State aerodromes&rdquo; means Cork Airport, Dublin Airport and Shannon Airport and &ldquo;State aerodromes&rdquo; shall be construed accordingly.  I have been unable to find a definition of unlicensed aerodromes, although there is a definition of State aerodromes.  Are all aerodromes and landing strips, private or otherwise, regional airports, etc., excluded from the classification of State aerodromes?  If so, is it not extraordinary that no section or no part of section 2 defines other aerodromes, particularly regional airports, and landing strips and private airfields?  What is the position of the categories I mentioned, particularly unlicensed aerodromes because as I said, State aerodromes have been defined as Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports? Are all aerodromes other than Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports unlicensed aerodromes under the terms of this legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo; is used in the Bill in the normal sense of a landing field.  References to aerodromes also cover areas of water used for landing seaplanes, helicopter landing areas known as helipads and landing areas on oil rigs and other structures.  This clause does not define the term but extends its <Col N="240" /> normal meaning.  All State airports and regional airports are licensed by ANSO and they must operate in accordance with stringent international and national regulations. The airport in Baldonnel will be under military law, so that is covered in its own right there.  However, there would be other private landing strips and similar places that normally would not have a licence because they would be operating in the lower air space at all times and, consequently, would not be used in a regular way.  Some people would have their own private planes and landing strips and would not normally be licensed because they would be for private use.  I hope that is of assistance to the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about seaplanes and regional airports. Where in the Bill are these categories of airport mentioned?  We refer to three State aerodromes.  I have no objection to the reply the Minister gave in responding to my question but my objection is that it does not appear to have effect within the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of interpretation.  &ldquo;Aerodrome&rdquo; is included in the Bill, and covers the definitions I have given.  There is a link between section 60 (1) (b) (i) and section 2 (1). Basically, our definition of &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo; covers the various expanded definitions I have given, and, consequently, the Bill covers them.</P>

      <P>If I could again be of assistance, section 60 (b) (i) states:</P>
      <P>for the licensing and regulation of aerodromes (other than State aerodromes), and for the regulation of aeronautical safety standards at State aerodromes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, we are saying that the Authority would have the power to decide if it is necessary to put in a regulation, or to demand that a licence be <Col N="241" /> sought for a particular landing area, when we are talking about air navigation in that area.  This is the facility we are giving to the Authority and they would operate in the interest of public safety and the safety of aircraft at all times.  It is a wide definition to cover any eventuality in the interests of public safety but, more particularly, public aviation safety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>If my understanding is correct, what is being proposed in this legislation is broadly putting in place a reenactment of the existing situation.  To that extent the points made by Senator Howard, while relevant, are covered.  My understanding is that any airfield, for example, the small airfield in Miltown Malbay/Spanish Point where there was a tragedy this summer &mdash; even though it may not be defined in the national sense like the transatlantic airport at Shannon &mdash; would, nevertheless, have come under the control of the Department heretofore and will now be under the new Authority.</P>
      <P>Such airfields would have to operate under the same guidelines and safety standards required for larger airports. The situation seems to be, more or less, the same as it was before apart from the fact that the new agency will now take over the responsibilities previously operated by the Department.  If my understanding is correct then landings on oil rigs or at small airports are covered by the regulations previously operated by the Department but which from now on would be operated by the new agency.  It is quite clear.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The section states that:</P>
      <P>Every order or regulation made by the Minister or the company under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order or regulation is passed by either such House within the next subsequent 21 days on which that House has sat after the order or regulation is laid before it, the order or regulation shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
      <P>Apart from this section and the laying of regulations before the House, I have an interest in a document in another field which is laid before the House.  I seek clarification from the Minister regarding the 21 sitting days referred to in the section.  A period of 21 Dáil sitting days would elapse much earlier than 21 Seanad sitting days.  Will the Minister confirm that the period referred to allows for 21 Seanad sitting days to elapse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is yes.  A period of 21 sitting days refers to 21 parliamentary sitting days, 21 Dáil sitting days if the Seanad is not sitting, 21 sitting days if the Seanad is sitting or a total of 21 parliamentary sitting days adding the sitting days of both Houses.</P>

      <P>Section 6 highlights what is drastically wrong with legislation in this House, which is that it is drafted in gobbledegook.  People who draft it assume Members of this and the other House are expert in the way they construct and play around with the English language.  The wording of this section is gobbledegook.  It probably makes sense to the Minister who has a huge file to explain it to him.  We must accept what we are told.  It is about time that civil <Col N="243" /> servants and those who draft Bills do so in a way that people can understand. Senator Howard is correct.  One should not have to guess the intention behind such language or seek legal or expert opinion as to what it is.  We are lay people, not experts or draftspersons.  We are here on behalf of other ordinary people to make sense of the laws proposed by the Government.  Every time I see gobbledygook I will bring it to somebody's attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Magner's observation.  We should not conclude debate on this section so easily.  I am concerned with the Minister's response.  We are given a separate and distinct role as a House of the Oireachtas. If I understood the Minister's reply correctly, he said the sitting days of the Seanad and the other House could be combined to give a total of 21 days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can give a more considered response shortly.  When we returned from the summer recess we were confronted with a number of papers, totalling around 150 or 180 pages. I was very concerned about one document which contained 181 pages.  I needed professional advice on it even though I was satisfied it should be objected to or, at least, further explained.  It takes time to get such advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I, Senator Magner or any other Member is confined by adding Dáil days to Seanad sitting days, it will not be physically possible for me to obtain either the veterinary or legal advice which I would need on that subject.  I know it is a slightly different issue but the principle is the same.  If we are an independent and distinct House, as I believe the Constitution intended us to be, it is unreasonable and unacceptable that the performance of this House should be restricted by the performance <Col N="244" /> or the sitting days of the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my utmost to respond to both Senators.  I was interested in the example of gobbledegook Senator Magner gave.  I presume we can take it as an example rather than a definition.  I can understand and identify with what Senator Magner said. However, I think he will accept that the parliamentary draftsman is a learned lawyer and that despite the fact that we may have difficulty with what is contained in the Bill, when this Bill is passed and signed by the President it becomes an Act of Parliament and a law of the land.</P>

Our job is to legislate.  I can understand what the Senator says but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>To return to what Senator Howard said, section 6 is a standard provision in relation to ministerial orders.  It is, basically, a safety valve where the Legislature passes laws empowering authorities, agencies or individuals on behalf of the State to effect certain decisions.  However, the Legislature also holds to itself the right to have those decisions annulled by a motion in <Col N="245" /> either House subsequently if it is not satisfied with the decision which has been taken.  I think it is a fine thing in legislation that we empower an agency, individual or Authority to take decisions on behalf of the public, but to protect the interests of the public we put in this safety valve whereby we can annul the decisions.</P>
      <P>While I can understand what Senator Howard said, and he made a good point, I think it should be looked at in totality, in the broadest context: a decision is taken, it is laid in the Library of the Oireachtas, it is available to the Members of both Houses, any eventuality may happen, any notice may come to somebody's attention and any Member of either House can put down a motion within 21 days.  If the Dáil has not done it within its 21 days, there is nothing to stop the Seanad from doing it within its 21 days.  Consequently, we are giving a broad power to the Members of the Oireachtas to effect a decision negating a decision which has already been made. However, we have put in the caveat that any decision heretofore taken cannot be invalidated; the effect will always be forward, not retrospective.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 7.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be interested in a clarification of section 7 which states that the Minister may give a direction in writing to the company.  There is no problem with section 7 (1) (a) (i) but could the Minister of State please explain section 7 (1) (a) (ii) which states: &ldquo;to do or refrain from doing anything to which a function of the company relates specified in the direction the doing, or the refraining from the doing, of which is, in the opinion of the Minister...&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>What does that mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Why could that not have <Col N="246" /> been put in simpler language?  Essentially the Minister may give a direction in writing to do or refrain from doing a certain thing.  Why was it necessary to insert a convoluted sequence of words following that?  Not being a lawyer, I fail to understand what legal definition could be implied here.</P>
      <P>I also want to address the area of directions. It relates to &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;, and I assume that is the Minister with responsibility for civil aviation.  When one reads through the section one finds that the Minister can direct the company in writing to give a direction in relation to a specified area and in relation to specified restrictions on the flight of aircraft in a specified area of airspace.  Subsection (d) states:</P>
      <P>whenever the Minister is satisfied that the interests of the State or the public so require... measures taken by it and the human and material resources employed by it for the purpose of safeguarding civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference,...</P>
      <P>The inference in this section is verging on the military and it may involve an aspect of defence of national security.  Is the responsibility to rest solely with the Minister or is he acting on advice from the Minister for Defence or the Government? Does the Minister give a unilateral direction and on what is his advice based? What is the thrust of this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have responsibility for aviation security and subsection (d) empowers him to give directions to the Authority on various matters.  Those directions could be given as the result of a Government decision or on the advice of the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Justice, the Garda Commissioner or the military head of intelligence and various other such people. The Minister has responsibility and would have the Cabinet security subcommittee and other information available to him.  It is a broad ranging situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, who would be privy to <Col N="247" /> this information, would have a fundamental obligation and legal responsibility to inform the aviation authorities that certain matters needed to be done to protect the aviation system, the public using that system and the people who may be affected by those using the airways and air systems.  If air traffic control towers and aviation buildings had to be protected for a reason at a particular time in a particular way, this subsection enables the Minister to give directions to that effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his clarity in relation to subsection (d).  I have a question on section 7 (1) (a) (ii). A great deal of specific direction is given to the new Authority under this subsection in relation to, for example, becoming members of international organisations.  Is there a purpose behind the specificity of this section?  Are there international organisations which the new civil aviation authority will be precluded from joining or are there organisations to which Ireland does not subscribe because of its policy on neutrality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This subsection enables the Minister to direct the company to take any action necessary to meet the Government's responsibilities as a member of an international organisation, such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation.  In other words, this will enable the Minister or any of his staff representing Ireland at various international fora and being a party to international conventions and treaties, some of which will be set up in the future and which will not be enshrined in legislation or have a binding effect on the new Irish Aviation Authority, to allow the Authority fulfil his responsibilities as a member of that new organisation or any particular organisation to the satisfaction of the Minister and the Government of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can it also be construed as preventing the Civil Aviation Authority from taking a fully autonomous role <Col N="248" /> in joining international air navigation organisations?  That is why I asked if there was another agenda.  Was it in order to comply with the stated policy on neutrality of this Government and successive Governments because of the close association with military travel?  Are these directions any different to those which are written into similar legislation establishing semi-State bodies?  Is there any departure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no departure; they are very similar.  The Senator is correct when he says the Authority will be obliged, as a national commercial State body, to carry out the policy of the Government and the people of Ireland enunciated by the Government of the day.  The Authority must operate under the normal parameters of our foreign affairs policies and responsibilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Mooney for asking the last question.  Is this section identical to the usual legislation for semi-State bodies with regard to ministerial directions?  Second, I am slightly uneasy about this part of the Bill; perhaps the Minister could tell us if there are any areas of this new aviation authority's functions which will not be subject to ministerial direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>They are very close to similar provisions in other semi-State legislation.  They are not identical because, first, we are dealing with aviation and, second, the Authority will have major international responsibilities and when they are taken into consideration, the legislation we pass must be somewhat different from legislation for other semi-State bodies whose responsibilities are only national.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there any areas in the functioning of this body, either in the regulation or commercial aspects, which will not be subject to ministerial direction or immune from the Minister giving direction about how the body is organised and directed?</P>

    <Col N="249" />
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Authority must carry out the aviation policy of the State.  It has a commercial mandate.  It must operate under international treaties and conventions and that imposes certain obligations on its operations.  In the normal ancillary activities, the Authority will make its own commercial decisions and be free from absolute ministerial control. However, it will report regularly to the Minister and consequently will be under certain ministerial control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be able to give directions, for example, on safety controls and regulations down to minute detail within the parameters of international regulations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister would not be able to give directions down to minute detail.  The Authority is free from control on the matter of fees, charges, technical details and day to day aeronautical management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not have power to intervene?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minster is empowered to intervene.  However, he would not give directives in the normal day to day running of the organisation, although he is empowered under our laws, the Constitution and some aspects of this legislation to intervene at any time on an issue.  He can issue a directive, but in the normal commercial operation and management of the Authority the Minister would not be involved in specific detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>If, in theory, the Minister is entitled to intervene in the most minute detail, which he obviously is, but which in practice he says he will not do, will he consider withdrawing those powers from the Bill?  What is the point in having that power if the Minister will not exercise it? Such an assurance is unnecessary if the Minister will not exercise this power, keeping this provision in the Bill is unnecessary if it will not be used.  All it does is raise fears about ministerial <Col N="250" /> interference when we have assurances that that will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the question I raised earlier about similarities between this and other legislation setting up semi-State bodies, it has always been the practice for Ministers with responsibility for semi-State bodies to defer or to refuse to answer questions on their day to day operation.  They have always made it quite clear that the Minister has no brief in regard to questions of a specific nature in relation to the managerial function of semi-State bodies and I ask the Minister to clarify whether the same situation will apply to the Irish Aviation Authority.  Although the Minister will have control over the policy aspects of the Irish Aviation Authority, will he or she be involved in the day-to-day operation of the executive and managerial functions of the body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be most unwise for the Minister not to have a function in relation to the direction of the company in certain areas, for instance if the Government decided as a matter of policy that the national airline or those involved in the airline business should change their method of communication, say to a satellite communications system, which would involve considerable State investment in the national airline and in the necessary equipment, and which would involve keeping in mind all the implications for the aviation business here.  It would be inconceivable that the Minister would not be in a position to give a direction along those lines to the Authority, where the Authority might feel that staying with the existing system of navigation might be more desirable from its point of view.  Therefore, the power which the section gives the Minister, to give a direction in writing to the company on a matter of Government policy on major issues, for instance the example I have given, is a fundamental power and, for that reason, it is important to keep this provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is exactly as Senator Mooney and Senator Daly outlined.  The Minister can give directions similar to those given to other State sponsored and semi-State organisations on general policy but he is never involved in their day-to-day running.  There would be no point setting up a commercial autonomous organisation if the Minister was involved in the every day running of the companies.  There would be no point taking them out of the Civil Service system, away from political responsibility. The Minister's role here is on general policy.  Obviously that policy would evolve from Government and from the company itself.  There will have to be a constant link between the Minister, his Department &mdash; there will be a special section in the Department dealing with the Authority &mdash; and the Authority. There will be special interaction between them, a constant evolving of national aviation policy, taking into account the changes internationally so that we will not be left behind.  Obviously the Minister, as a Member of the Government, will be able to give a direction on any aspect of the Authority at any time, but he will not be involved in the normal detailed running of the organisation.  He will be basically a policy director.</P>

When does a matter of major Government policy become a matter of detail?  At what level is the line drawn and the Minister says this is Government policy and beyond this he shall not go because it is a matter for the <Col N="252" /> executives of the semi-State body?  I am not clear about where that line is to be drawn.  Why is that power necessary if it is not going to be exercised?  I cannot understand why the Minister says that certain matters within the semi-State body will not be subject to ministerial decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be of assistance to Senator Ross and to the House on this matter but we must accept that we are setting up a corporate structure. We will give it commercial teeth.  It will be headed by a chief executive, a team of line managers and an administration. It will take account of the traditions in national and international aviation policy.  It will be fully in tune with the policy of the Government <i>vis-á-vis</i> present aviation policy and with the international changes which are being effected in international aviation policy.</P>
      <P>The Authority has an important public responsibility which it will have to exercise in close co-operation with the Minister. It has to have a commercial mandate and the line is clear.  The Minister has a macro responsibility and the Authority will have the micro responsibility.  In other words, it will be responsible for the day to day details but when it comes to decisions of major importance <i>vis-á-vis</i> Government policy, investment or opportunities, the Minister may wish to direct the Authority to take a particular line.</P>
      <P>He will not come in each week to say that he did not like what was done the last Friday and ask that it be changed by the next Thursday.  That will not arise.  It will be a constant, normal, professional relationship between a Minister as a member of a Government acting on behalf of the people with a political responsibility to creating public policy, and an Authority acting on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers it supplies and who demand its services.  They will be acting in a responsible commercial way and I am confident a successful corporate structure will evolve in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for your protection, Sir.  However, nothing Senator Magner said caused me any offence.  I understand what the Minister of State said but could he give us some assurance that when he talked about the difference between the macro and the micro policy &mdash; Government policy being the macro policy and the micro policy being for the <Col N="254" /> semi-State body &mdash; neither he nor any other Minister will interfere or will give a direction in regard to the detailed day to day running of this body?  In other words, matters of charges, safety regulations or matters of commercial importance will be left to the semi-State body.</P>
      <P>I am making the point that Ministers are coming from a completely different angle.  Ministers from the Labour Party and the Fianna Fáil Party are coming from different angles &mdash; the decision made depends on whether it is a Labour or a Fianna Fáil Minister.  They are coming at the matter from a completely different angle and will be making decisions for different reasons and motivations. Obviously in what the Minister of State calls macro policy he will certainly have those powers but would he give us an assurance that he will not interfere in the day to day running of the Authority and that he will give no directions on detail or the day to day running of this body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with Senator Ross's acceptance that the directions in future will be given by either a Fianna Fáil or a Labour Minister.  That gives me great assurance.</P>
      <P>I could not give such a guarantee; it would be foolish of me to do so.  The Minister of the day has certain responsibilities to discharge on behalf of the people and the Government.  He may have to intervene in a particular situation. One section in the Bill refers to where there is a difficulty pertaining to an accident or security and the board may consult the Minister and the Minister may take the final decision.  The Minister may have to take an instant decision on any particular issue an any particular day so I could not give such an assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the point Senator Magner made pertaining to another semi-State organisation, last year the Government took an objective and critical view of the performance of our semi-State organisations and, acting on behalf of the Government, the Minister for Finance drew up a set of regulations and guidelines by which these semi-State bodies <Col N="255" /> must discharge their obligations.  Those guidelines place great responsibility on the board of each company but more particularly on the chairperson of each board who must report on specifics in a detailed way to the Minister at the end of each year.  The chairperson has the facility to report at any time on any issue, as the board may also do.  One can be certain that the Minister will only intervene when it is necessary to do so.  He will only intervene on a matter of policy or direction and in the interests of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not totally satisfied with section 7 (1) (c) to which we referred earlier in relation to the measures taken by the board and the human and material resources employed by the board.  The line about which I am concerned and which I would like clarified is: &ldquo;...for the purpose of safeguarding civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference...&rdquo; I am thinking of a scenario where Irish airspace could be violated by a military power.  The chain of command in this legislation would seem to suggest that once the aviation Authority became aware of this unlawful interference it would have to contact the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications who, in turn, would have to contact the Minister for Defence as this would be a defence matter.  If our airspace is violated, if there is an act of unlawful interference, this is essentially a military matter.  I am curious to know if the Minister has addressed the efficient chain of command that would be required in this instance.  A visitation of this kind could lead to a doomsday situation.  However, we are considering legislative effect and I am curious to know if the Minister has addressed the seeming anomaly in this legislation where he is taking unto himself powers which could be more efficiently carried out by the Department of Defence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>I am returning to the point concerning the power of the Minister in regard to policy and the power of the <Col N="256" /> Minister to interfere and give directions with regard to the detail.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that we have had a success story in Ireland since the foundation of the State in establishing State companies because we have had the opportunity of giving commercial freedom to commercial companies.  Errors have been made where Ministers on occasion have attempted to interfere in the detail and day to day administration and I am delighted to hear the Minister say that this is not the intention in this case.  However, we are legislating not only for the Minister, or Fianna Fáil and Labour Ministers because there may be a Minister from another party at some point in the future&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If our job as legislators is to establish in law the rights of a Minister, it is not sufficient for the Minister to say: &ldquo;It is not the intention&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I had the interesting task ten years ago of being involved in An Bord Poist, prior to the establishment of An Post.  When the legislation dealing with this new commercial body was going through the House, we were concerned that it would not be interfered with on a daily basis by a Minister at the behest, perhaps, of a Deputy who wished to have a favour done.  What the Minister is saying is acceptable, but it is not what we are agreeing should be written into the legislation.</P>
      <P>I have no problem with the reference requiring the company to comply with a policy decision.  It is good to see that in writing, because that means it will have to be confirmed and it will not be simply a matter of a phone call from the Minister for something to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, if the Minister is unhappy with a detail, he has the power to dismiss the board or the chairman.  That that is the second power available to the Minister should he wish to become involved in the detail and the Minister has to be very sure of himself if he undertakes this course of action.  That is a powerful weapon.  It is similar to what would <Col N="257" /> happen to a commercial company in the private sector.  If the shareholders do not like what is happening they have the power to change the board.  They do not get involved in the detail, but once a year at the AGM they question and criticise and then change the board if they do not like what is being done.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has thought this through.  I was interested in the question asked earlier by Senator Magner to ascertain if this legislation is the same as that setting up other State companies.  I do not believe it is the same as the Bill establishing Telecom Éireann and An Post.  I believe this is much wider and gives the Minister greater freedom.  I suggest that the Minister think twice before we enshrine these powers in legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I call Senator Magner may I make an observation? There has been a lot of debate on this section but I am not restricting the Senator in making his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought you were asking me to withdraw something I had yet to say, Sir.  There is a true divide on this issue.  There is no direct correlation between the State, and semi-State companies and the privately owned and commercially operated sector.  For example, as regards the ESB, I have no doubt that what is classified as ministerial interference was the result of representations made by a Senator or Deputy when an injustice was being committed against part of a community or an entire community, say, in some part of rural Ireland. A commercial company may ignore such representation, but the State has a responsibility to improve people's lives, and people's lives are improved by the application of services nationwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other reality is that in most cases the State stepped in where private enterprise refused, where the project was too big or it did not appear to be profitable. An example would be our transport services. Years ago the transport service started off as private companies going back to Bianconi, but they got out of the transport business because they could not <Col N="258" /> make money.  Then the State intervened and put an infrastructure together.</P>
    <P>If one follows Senator Ross's usual cry that projects must be totally commercial, that no other consideration must be involved and that people really do not matter, what kind of a country does one finish up with?  Do not always assume that ministerial interference is bad in itself.  It can be very useful in correcting injustices, and I can give 150 examples.  I have no doubt that Senator Ross and Senator Quinn would have made representations to Ministers to get something done that would have come within the remit of a State company if that company was not acting with sufficient speed or dispensing what would be termed natural justice.</P>
    <P>Therefore there should not be an assumption that there is a direct correlation between a private board of directors, who operate strictly in a commercial sense, and a semi-State company that has responsibilities to the country.  As we know, private commercial companies can up anchor and head off out of this country and leave nothing behind them; they have done so but State companies or semi-State companies cannot and never will do that.  They have a different set of priorities and I hope they always will have.</P>

      <P>I will keep my remarks to a minimum.  I thank the Senator for those remarks.  Commercial State bodies have been even more hampered by the fact that Senator Magner's party leader, together with the Minister for Health, made strong and binding commitments that there would be no further sale of State assets in the lifetime of this Government, something which may or may not be binding as it was a pledge made under pressure at a certain period.  The problem is that we do not know where we stand at this stage.  It is difficult if the Tánaiste makes a statement one day to keep Labour backbenchers happy and the next day we see&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The direct answer is no, and I made it clear earlier that in the matter of fees and charges, technical details to do with aviation, etc., it is a matter for the new company.  It will not involve the Minister.  Section 7 refers to policy of a general kind, in other words, it refers to the policy and not the detail.</P>
      <P>This legislation is modelled on the legislation introduced to deal with An Post and Telecom Éireann.  I wish to tell Senator Quinn that we appreciate his contribution to the development of An Post and to the leadership he gave as Chairman of the Board of An Post.</P>
      <P>Section 7 (1) (a) (i) states that the Minister may give a direction in writing to the company requiring the company&mdash;</P>
      <P>to comply with policy decisions of a general kind made by the Government in relation to aviation in so far as the decisions affect functions of the company,</P>
      <P>and, basically, it goes into the detail after that.  The reason it is broader in this legislation is that this new company will have international responsibilities and obligations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I talked about the chain of decision-making in the event of acts of unlawful interference, such as the violation <Col N="260" /> of our airspace by military authorities or hijacking, which would probably come within the ambit of the Department of Justice because it would be seen as a criminal act.  If a military violation took place it would come within the ambit of the Department of Defence. Yet the chain of command suggests it is a matter for the Authority to deal with, in conjunction with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and, perhaps, another Minister.  The chain of command needs to be addressed more efficiently.  I await the Minister's reply.</P>

      <P>I must specify that we are taking about civil, not military aviation. It is unlikely &mdash; and I hope it never happens &mdash; that our airspace will be violated because we are aware of the aircraft which comes into our airspace at all times.  The international world is on constant alert and we are always aware of what is happening.  Planned measures work over a period of time.</P>
      <P>In the unlikely event of a national disaster of serious proportions, to which Senator Mooney alluded, an emergency system comes into operation on a national, regional and county scale. There is a clear system in operation. Public servants around the country have a key responsibility to press the buttons in any situation on air, land or sea.  This system is well known in the public sector, but it is not advertised for State security reasons.  Each agency has its own responsibilities and it links into a clear system in the interest of protecting the people and anyone using our airspace or the navigation area around our coasts.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be obliged to appoint staff in his Department to act as a link between the Government and the public with regard to aviation policies and to ensure that regulations in relation to State policy are implemented internationally, nationally or otherwise.

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be possible to quantify the figures.  There is a major charge on the Exchequer as a result of civil servants who are ANSO staff because they must be paid by the State from Exchequer funds.  There will be a major reduction in this figure from 1 January when this Bill is passed and signed into law and the new Authority comes into being.  As a result, a commercial body will be responsible for discharging its obligations to its staff by way of salaries, etc.  The remaining staff will have specific responsibility for ensuring that this Bill is fully enacted and that the aviation policy is carried out on behalf of the people.  Since the remaining staff will be permanent in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, their salaries and administration expenses must always be paid by the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> In page 13, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) The headquarters of the company shall be located at, or close to, Shannon Airport, County Clare.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment should not come as a surprise to the Minister or to the Government. A similar amendment was tabled by Deputy O'Malley during a debate of a select committee of the other House.  It was debated and rejected by the Government. I invited the Minister, during my Second Stage contribution, to give an assurance that he would incorporate in the legislation a requirement to locate the head office of the Irish Aviation Authority at Shannon or close to Shannon. I did that deliberately because its location would be valuable and significant to the area, given current events in the region.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that the head office should be located in Shannon.  I invited the Minister to include in the legislation a requirement that it should be located there for no other reason than for the benefit of the area.  If the Minister had acceded to my request it would not have been a contentious issue and it would have gone through without difficulty.  The Government was given adequate notice about this matter during the discussion of the select committee of the other House.  I told the Minister my wish during the Second Stage debate.  The Minister responded to the debate but he did not deal with my request.  That reluctance on the part of the Minister suggests that the Government is rejecting the idea of locating the head office at Shannon.</P>
    <P>There are valid reasons Shannon is the ideal location for the head office of the Irish Aviation Authority.  First, more than half the staff employed by the Authority work and reside in the Shannon region.  In fact, the service provided at Shannon and Ballygirreen is the hub of an area of control which covers the west, the north and the Atlantic.  As a result, this should be the location for the head office.  Senator Daly, in his Second Stage speech, disagreed with my suggestion and <Col N="263" /> the Minister confirmed his acceptance of Senator Daly's disagreement.  Senator Daly made the point that the location of a head office is never included in legislation. Again, the Minister agreed.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney echoed my sentiments about the research facilities available to us.  As a Member of this House I did not have anyone available to me whom I could ask to research legislation of the last ten years to check if an Act contained provision for the location of a head office in a particular place.  Senator Mooney largely agreed with my point about the absence of research facilities.</P>
    <P>When the Shannon Estuarial Authority legislation was introduced in this House Limerick was designated as the head office for that proposed body.  I vividly recall its designation because there was a further requirement that the chairman of the proposed Authority should live within 50 miles of the head office.  There was a lengthy debate on how the miles were to be measured.  If the distance was 50 miles as the crow flies, he could be from Tubbercurry, County Sligo, but if it was miles by road the then chairman of Clare County Council, Mr. Seán Keating, from Kilbaha could not be chairman of the body.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is wrong to say no legislation contained a provision to designate a place for the head office of an authority or body.  Also during my time here another place was designated as the head office for Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Therefore, the response to this amendment should not be that this is never put into legislation because those two cases are examples in which it was done.  If I had the research facilities for which I voted and which people on the other side of the House voted two weeks ago to deny me I would have several other examples to justify my argument.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to designate and put into law that Shannon should be the headquarters of the Irish Aviation Authority because of the economy of that area.  It may be said that although it may not be in the legislation the Minister or the <Col N="264" /> Government will influence the decision and that the board of the Authority will look favourably on the proposal to locate the head office in Shannon.  The experience with semi-State bodies in the Shannon area, particularly with Aer Lingus, is one of constant withdrawal.  As one who lived in that area I have been conscious of that withdrawal through the 1950s up to today.</P>
    <P>The philosophy behind the withdrawal is encapsulated in an air service provided from Dublin to Shannon each evening at 10.20 p.m.  I have often used that service. I would alight from the aeroplane and would only have reached the car park when it would have taken off to return to Dublin empty because the crew would not remain in Shannon.  That is one example of why Aer Lingus is in trouble.</P>
    <P>The attitude has always been to withdraw from the area.  I am satisfied there is a grave risk that, unless we enshrine it in legislation, an excuse will be found by the board and senior executives of this body to locate in Dublin and further staff will be withdrawn from Shannon over a lengthy period.  I therefore propose that the head office of the Authority is located at Shannon Airport.  I have advanced my reasons; there are others, perhaps contentious ones, I could also advance. Shannon is the natural location and will, for the foreseeable future, be the hub of the operations of this body.  It is logical to locate it there.  Because of the experience with other semi-State bodies in the area it is necessary to enshrine this in legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept Senator Howard's bona fides in putting down this amendment and there is a case for siting this Authority in Shannon.  There is, however, a general point which would give comfort to my old friend, Senator Ross.  It is an abuse of State and semi-State companies if one does not use objective criteria in an issue as important as the site of the headquarters.  I could suggest Cork as the location because it has an airport, needs the jobs and has some of the staff needed.  I would also get a few lines in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> and I would have done my good deed for the <Col N="265" /> day.  However, it would bear no relationship to the needs of the company.  Therefore, we do a disservice to those organisations we are trying to modernise and make relevant by ensuring they are sited in a specific area, irrespective of their needs.  I would object if, given the Minister introducing the Bill is Deputy Treacy, the headquarters were located in Galway.</P>
      <P>Objective criteria should be used to take a specific action.  There was a long discussion and it was agreed the new aviation body should be commercial, make money and not be subvented by the State. As the Minister said, it should make a profit if possible.  One should begin by ensuring that its structures, head office and facilities are geared to enabling it to carry out that mandate.  One does not do that by resolution, no more than the Minister was told he should not interfere in the day to day business of the new Authority.</P>
      <P>We should meet the executives of the aviation Authority, examine the objectives we are trying to achieve and then decide where we should site it.  The likelihood is that the decision will be in favour of Shannon, it has always been the hub of our aviation business.  Dublin Airport and the capital in general are crowded and Shannon has been associated with aviation since its inception. However, one does not proceed by resolution, by enshrining in the Bill where it should be established.</P>
      <P>Senator Howard says it has been done before.  If so it was for similarly crazy political reasons.  It is never justified.  The new Authority should decide where it should be situated because it is in the best position to do so.</P>

It must be recognised that at this stage the people in County Clare and the mid-west region will not accept any Minister's statement or promise.  We have had enough promises concerning Shannon.  Just 12 months ago Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, as Minister for Transport and Communications, came to County Clare and made a very strong statement that she and her Government &mdash; many of the current Ministers were Ministers in that Government &mdash; would maintain the status of Shannon.  She gave a firm commitment and her reasons to do that.  Yet less than 12 months later the picture changed.  We in the region will not accept promises from Ministers.  This commitment to establish the headquarters of the Authority at Shannon Airport must be incorporated in the legislation and enshrined in this Bill.</P>
      <P>As Senator Howard said, we have clear and definite reasons for wanting it there. Over 300 employees of the current ANSO operate from Ballygirreen, just outside Shannon Airport.  The majority of the operation's workforce are based there.  There is huge potential for further development in that area which controls a large area of airspace, out across the Atlantic and up along the north coast.  It is a clear area from which they can operate effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="267" /> It is imperative that the headquarters be located at Shannon Airport.  We have had commitments from the Government which have not been honoured.  Not alone has the transatlantic status of Shannon been removed but in an unprecedented and underhand fashion discussions were initiated with the United States authorities in relation to transferring part of the customs pre-clearance service at Shannon to Dublin Airport. There has been clear diminution of the Shannon region.  We need a firm commitment from the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications that this will not continue.  We need something of substance put into legislation. Commitments and statements from Ministers are not acceptable to the people in the region; we want it in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I concur with the sentiments expressed by Senator Howard and Senator Taylor-Quinn.  I would also like to see the headquarters of the Irish Aviation Authority located at Shannon Airport.  However, Senator Magner strongly put the case I wished to put forward.  I do not think putting this into the Bill is the proper way to go.  The location of any company is not a matter for legislation.  Senator Howard said that he was strongly recommending this suggestion to the Minister.  I strongly recommend it also but it is not appropriate that it should be enshrined in the legislation.  It would not necessarily be in the best interests of the country if that method was used.  While I concur with the sentiments, writing into legislation that the headquarters of the Authority should be located in a specific area is not the right way to go about achieving it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to this debate in the Dáil and here now. I have looked at the legislation in this area and I accept what Senator Howard says in relation to the Shannon Estuary Authority.  I am sure he would be the first to admit that since we were talking about an Authority for a particular region, there was no place where those headquarters <Col N="268" /> could be located other than that region.  If we look at the legislation establishing Údarás na Gaeltachta, the decision was that the headquarters would be located in the Gaeltacht.  It was specific to make sure that it was located in a Gaeltacht area in order that services would be given to the people of the Gaeltacht from headquarters within the area.</P>
      <P>Here we are talking about the headquarters of a national Authority with international responsibilities.  I have to concur with what Senator Magner and others have said.  There is no point setting up an Authority unless it is given certain freedom and flexibility in line with Government policy to take a decision on what is in the company's best interests.  I indicated clearly in this House, and in the other House, that it is not practice in legislation to identify or specify where the headquarters of a semi-State body should be located.  The criteria must be what location would best enable the Authority to operate effectively.  I assure the House that this decision will be given the most careful consideration and all the relevant circumstances will be taken into account.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept that the location of the headquarters, wherever that should be, should be written into the Bill.  I would love to be able to say to the House that it will go to Shannon.  My duty, as a legislator with political responsibility for the affairs of ANSO, is to have a Bill passed and once it has become law, to operate the decisions that have been taken as a result of the Bill's passage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must make sure that a chief executive, a board, headquarters and funding are provided so that the company can go forward with a commercial mandate to discharge its obligations.  We will take everything into consideration as soon as the Bill is passed.  A proper, evaluated conclusive decision will be taken and, ultimately, that is the way it has happened in other legislation.  It is in the interests of this House and of legislators that we would never specify where a national authority is to locate its headquarters. That should be a matter for clear evaluation and objective decision <Col N="269" /> once all the information is fully and finally available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not impressed by the Minister's fancy footwork.  Last week he was very clear that the designation of an area for any headquarters was never in legislation.  Now, because from personal experience I could inform the House that there were two pieces of legislation which designated a location for a head office, there is a mad scramble to find justification for that.  Nonetheless, we have moved from the position a week ago where it was never done in legislation to an admission today that it has been done in legislation, but there were certain reasons for it.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he would be delighted if he could announce that the headquarters would be located in Shannon. I accept that and I know he would, and there are very good reasons he should be delighted to be in a position to do that.  However, the fact that he is not in a position to do it indicates that it will not be located there.</P>
      <P>Two other factors were taken into account by the Minister in his reply.  One was that it is a national body with international obligations.  That is a further indication that we have to think nationally and of international obligations and locating that body's head office at Shannon would be a diminution of our obligations in these fields.  This is further confirmation that the decision has already been made not to locate it at Shannon.</P>
      <P>As I said we have moved from a situation where it was never done to write into legislation the location of a head office to a position where it was done but there were special circumstances.  If I were a younger Member of the House without experience of these two pieces of legislation, I would not be able to say that.  As there has to be a change and because very little notice was given, feeble excuses are trotted out as to why we cannot repeat in this legislation what was used in two other Bills and I am sure there are several others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> The fact that the Minister cannot announce the location of the headquarters of the Authority today means, in my view, that it will not be at Shannon. That is obvious because of particular party political considerations, of which the Minister is very aware, affecting his own party within the county.  Therefore I have no option but to stay with my proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision on this matter and to look at the concerns of people in Shannon.  Jobs have been lost due to the change in Government policy towards the Shannon stopover. There is the potential loss of a further 2,000 jobs in the region and people will be transferred to Dublin as the skills will be required there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Those with the skills are currently in the Shannon region and when they move, the area will be denuded of these good people.  If the Minister accepts the amendment it will be an indication that the Government has not sold out the area altogether and that it is anxious to undo some of the damage caused by its decision to change Shannon's status.  I ask the Minister to take this opportunity to indicate to the mid-west that the decision he takes here will show that the Government support the development of the area around Shannon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are now moving from an amendment calling for the headquarters of the Irish Aviation Authority to be located at Shannon to the pure and unbridled party political statements &mdash; gloves off.  In this sense, if one accepts the logic of Senator Howard's position, as <Col N="271" /> re-echoed by Senator Neville, that they know the headquarters will not be located in Shannon &mdash; how do they know?  Senator Howard knows it will not be established in Shannon because the Minister would not say it would.  If that is his position, the amendment is a charade.</P>
      <P>There is sufficient goodwill and enough common sense in locating that facility in the region.  Most of those that would be involved in the new Authority reside and work there anyway, but it should be a matter for the new Authority.  I do not know of any double agenda here.  If Senator Howard has any evidence of the decision already being taken, I would like to hear it because I would not like to take part in a charade.  Senator Howard should withdraw the amendment.  There are Members on this side of the House &mdash; Senators O'Sullivan, Daly and others &mdash; who want to see this facility in Shannon. I am from Cork and I would not object to seeing the facility there, if that is what the Authority decides.  It seems to make sense to me, but I am no expert.</P>
      <P>It might show a new sign of maturity because this amendment, if pushed, will be defeated.  Senator Howard has created a sufficient amount of goodwill and has made a case good enough to be substantiated. If Senator Howard withdrew his amendment, Members of all parties would lobby the new Authority &mdash; this is legitimate &mdash; to get a result.  I am sure he would get all-party support to ensure that what is proposed in his amendment becomes a reality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There was widespread disappointment in the mid-west at the decision to change the status of Shannon Airport but there is now an increasing realisation there &mdash; in Clare in particular &mdash; that the decision has been taken and we have to go on from here.  I support the view put forward by some public representatives &mdash; not of my persuasion &mdash; in the mid-west, who said on local radio today that it was time to have a unified approach to seek additional developments for the Shannon area which would compensate the region for any loss that <Col N="273" /> may arise because of the change in the flight patterns.</P>
      <P>There is a widespread feeling in Shannon that the headquarters of the new aviation Authority should be located there.  There are justifiable reasons for that.  The new Authority will have approximately 600 personnel and 300 of them are already engaged in the vicinity of Shannon, between the air navigation station at Ballygirreen and the airport control tower itself.  It would, therefore, be logical for the headquarters of the Authority to be located in the area where the most personnel are at present employed.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to give the House some indication of the breakdown of the personnel between the various locations and to give us some indication of what the headquarters would mean if it were to be established at Dublin, Shannon, Cork or elsewhere.  It is my understanding that the headquarters and staff would consist of a small number of personnel &mdash; I do not know how many.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us as to the numbers involved in the headquarters management structure as distinct from the various elements of the Authority which make up the overall staff.</P>
      <P>While recognising he cannot write it into legislation, I urge the Minister to give his support to Shannon as the headquarters for this new Authority.  This would give the region an opportunity not only to make a worthwhile contribution to the air navigation business but to look at new areas of development, especially in the Eurocontrol area and in satellite communication &mdash; I highlighted this before &mdash; and ask whether the Authority would become involved in many other areas of activity which could be based at Shannon.</P>

Senator Daly noted that only my name was put to the amendment.  It was a low key effort to get a positive response from the Minister.  I regret I did not receive a positive response.  That is the explanation.  Senator Daly said we should get together on this and that there should be a mood of optimism, but I ask him to put this in print.

      <P>This amendment was not tabled for the purpose of embarrassing Senator Daly or anyone else.  It is too bad if it caused embarrassment.

      <P>May I throw the cat among the pigeons in relation to the absence of a specific location for the headquarters of this Authority?  I am sure the Minister will respond to Senator Daly's point regarding the impact the location of the aviation Authority on a particular region.  From what I could glean from Second Stage speeches and from figures being bandied about in regard to staff, etc., the secretariat of this Authority may total 50 to 60 people.  The people in many areas welcome the continued decentralisation of Government bodies and if that happens in this case, many areas would welcome an injection of 50 to 60 civil servants, irrespective of the nature of the semi-State body or its functions.  I raise that point in the context of the current situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date all functions are carried out by executive order of the Minister, in other words, civil servants are currently based <Col N="276" /> in Dublin.  I am putting in the caveat that because there is an airline and an airline industry in Shannon and that 300 of the 600 staff are based there, the new Authority should be based in Shannon.  I sympathise and empathise with the arguments the representatives of that region put forward.  While I disagree with the principle of enshrining the location of the new body in legislation, I sympathise with Senator Howard's amendment.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that Government speakers have interpreted the motivation behind Senator Howard's amendment as an attempt to politically embarrass them.  If they could see this amendment as genuine they would recognise Senator Howard's sincerity in this regard.  Senator Howard and Members on this side of the House are concerned about the future of that region.  Since the Government announced the change in the status of Shannon last week, further announcements of job losses have been made.  On Saturday 50 job losses were announced in the Shannon Hotel and today more than 200 jobs losses were announced in De Beers.  This is a serious matter.</P>

We have concrete proof of that and I can provide Senators with a copy of the statement made last year by the present Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the headquarters of the Authority is located in Shannon and this must be enshrined in this Bill. I do not understand Senator Daly's contribution. On the one hand, he pleaded with the Minister to locate the headquarters in the area and gave the same reasons as Senator Howard, Senator Neville and I, while on the other hand, <Col N="277" /> he will vote against this when it is put to a vote.  I do not understand that mentality.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks we have heard a lot about <i>la fourchette</i> and this is further evidence of forked tongues.  It is unfortunate that those from the region do not vote for the region.  I call on Members on the other side of the House and the Minister to reconsider their position.  The Minister has another opportunity to do so on Report Stage when he could table an amendment along the lines of Senator Howard's amendment.  Senator Howard in his Second Stage speech told the Minister he was offering him the opportunity to table this amendment but that he would do so if the Minister did not.

If he was not he would have done what I suggested ten minutes ago &mdash; he would have withdrawn his amendment and said &ldquo;Let all the people who agree where the headquarters should be sited get together and lobby the Authority&rdquo;.  He can create a bit of history here this evening by withdrawing the amendment and putting everybody to the test.

There are 600 staff involved with <Col N="279" /> ANSO: 310 in the Shannon region, about 150 at Dublin Airport, 40 in Cork and 100 in headquarters in the city of Dublin.</P>

I thought I had put everything on the record in the Second Stage debate and that I had assured everybody of the position. I thought I had given the maximum information and that we would not have any difficulties.  I made it clear that Ballygirreen at Shannon is the principal centre in Ireland for the control of air traffic entering or exiting from the North Atlantic air routes, and that will continue to be the case.  I was the person who recently went down to Shannon to announce a £6 million investment in the most modern, sophisticated aviation technology to ensure that that would be maintained.  That is our commitment to Shannon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The name &ldquo;Irish Aviation Authority&rdquo; is misleading.  It clearly suggests the body has more powers than it is the intention to give it.  In the world of international aviation a national aviation Authority would have the right to award route approvals.  This is the way the Civil Aviation Authority in Britain and its counterparts in many other countries operate.  We have a horse of a different colour.  I suggest what we have should be more correctly called the &ldquo;Air Traffic Control Authority&rdquo;; it is masquerading as a national aviation authority.  I am against this, not just because it is misleading and sloppy, but because a good case has to be made for a body with the powers a national aviation authority should have.  On the clause concerning the name, my point is that the name is inappropriate for what the body has been set up to do.  I suggest that the Minister of State should take that into account and reconsider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to Senator Quinn.  I do not accept he is correct in saying this would be only a traffic regulating authority.  It is quite clear from the Bill and the statements which I consistently made in the debate in both Houses, that we intend this to be a commercial aviation authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The name of Ireland is highly regarded throughout the world and we want to give the Authority a clear identity.  The Government considered a number of names for the company and decided on this one.  We considered calling it the &ldquo;Irish Civil Aviation Authority&rdquo; but Britain has the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority and, in fairness to them and ourselves, we wanted to ensure there would be no confusion at international <Col N="283" /> level.  Consequently, we decided on the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>
    <P>Of course, it will have traffic regulatory functions, national and international responsibility, but it will have a commercial mandate and brief.  It will operate under corporate commercial criteria and will be expected to make money in ancillary activities.  I am optimistic and confident for the future of this Authority and we intend to appoint a commercially driven board.</P>
    <P>As a small island nation, route allocation must remain a matter for Government. We are in a strategic location, as I said on Second Stage, in the north Atlantic and it is important that the Government is in a position to take binding decisions, take account of the situation internationally and that our Authority is able to maximise opportunities as a result of Government decisions.  I am satisfied that we are giving a clear identity from an Irish, aviation and commercial point of view to this Authority.  I am happy with the name the Government has chosen and I think it will prove to have been a wise decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, I disagree with Senator Quinn on the basis that the Irish Aviation Authority deals, in the main, with foreign airlines and companies. Therefore, it ought to contain the word &ldquo;Irish&rdquo;.  As it deals essentially with aviation matters it is essential to include the word &ldquo;aviation&rdquo;.  In dealing with international business contacts, the word &ldquo;Authority&rdquo; is important and understood internationally.  The allocation of routes might be a possibility in the future.  I do not know whether Senator Quinn is accurate in relation to what the Americans and British do, but I could see an expanding role for it in the future if this was found desirable.  I think it is as good a name as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In case my point was not understood, I believe the State should decide the regulation of international air agreements.  However, I believe that this new Authority should &mdash; I would like to <Col N="284" /> return to this when we debate its functions &mdash; have the function to award route approval.  That is the point I was trying to make.  Therefore, the word is inappropriate. However, I accept the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we look at aviation in Ireland, particularly from an international and a service point of view, Dublin Airport on the east coast serves the British and European air traffic routes, on the north Atlantic routes we have Shannon and Knock airports on the west coast and Cork Airport on the south coast.  We have a small number of international airports, compare that to the situation in Britain where there is a huge number of airports and a much greater ongoing need for the regulation of traffic routes, which would not be feasible here. However, as Senator Magner said, as the international aviation world and national aviation policy evolves, perhaps in the future we may be able to do that. However, at this stage we feel that decision should be left to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12(2) refers to the authorised share capital which it states: &ldquo;shall be such an amount as may be determined from time to time by the Minister&rdquo;. I do not see why the amount of the share capital should not be spelled out in this Bill.  I do not understand the problem with that.  This is <i>carte blanche</i> for the capital to be any amount under the sun which is too wide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only should we specify the amount of the share capital, or at least a ceiling which it should not exceed, we should also be laying down that the articles of association are so drawn up that the capital cannot be increased without reference to the Oireachtas.  Otherwise, the mechanism of a State owned company becomes such that the powers of the shareholders, the State, are exercised by the Minister without any reference to the Oireachtas.  There is not even a requirement that changes in the share capital be notified to the Oireachtas, let alone a requirement that the Oireachtas approve <Col N="285" /> it.  That is incorrect and the Minister is being given unnecessarily wide powers.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that either House should get involved in the day-to-day nitty gritty detail of the workings of a State agency or Authority.  On the other hand, there has to be some overview at the proper distance.  The proper occasion for the exercise of that overview would be in relation to the establishment of the share capital.  It should be established here what the share capital should be and that we should have a say in it and approve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinn made an interesting contribution.  The share capital of the company has yet to be determined by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in consultation with the Minister for Finance. Section 19 deals in more detail with the issue of shares and debt to the Minister for Finance.  In exchange for the assets which are being transferred to the company &mdash; the current and fixed assets &mdash; consisting largely of air navigation equipment, office equipment and stores, the company will issue to the Minister for Finance shares and debt, in proportions to be determined by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. The value of the shares and debt, taken together, will be equivalent to the value of the assets being transferred. The value of the assets which are to be transferred is estimated currently at approximately £30 million.</P>

      <P>It is incorrect that this would not be referred to in the House.  If the Oireachtas has a concern, I think it should have a say with regard to the capital.  It seems to be left vacant and in the hands of the Minister, which seems incorrect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinn is correct from a corporate, commercial point of view.  However, this is a different situation where the Government has responsibility for air navigation services. The political head of the Air Navigation Services Office is the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. Administering on his behalf is a team of civil servants known as the Air Navigation Services Office.  Until this Bill is passed by the Oireachtas, signed by the President and becomes law, it is not possible to give effect in law to what Senator Quinn says.  We must first pass the law and set down the parameters within which the transfers and the structure will be put in position.  When the law is passed, we will have no option but to operate within what is laid down.</P>
      <P>While it would be positive and meritorious to proceed in the way the Senator advocated, it is not possible due to the existing structure.  The political situation requires legislative decision by the Oireachtas and when the Oireachtas legislates, we are obliged, as a Government and as a Department, to carry out the will of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point. He used the word &ldquo;parameters&rdquo;.  I would like to see a parameter here in regard to a maximum share capital to which we agreed.  In other words the Oireachtas should have some say.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 13.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 13 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 13 contains one of those classic phrases often included in Bills which make no sense.  Why is it included and why is it necessary?  To say that the memorandum of association would have to be consistent with the Act is tautology in the extreme.  I do not know why that phrase is required as everything else must be approved by the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  If the phrase means it is necessary to seek the <Col N="287" /> approval of the Minister, that is what it should say.</P>
      <P>I worry about providing in legislation that things have to be done within the law.  It implies that there are ways in which people could act outside the law. It seems totally unnecessary to address this point and to put in a phrase to the effect that it should be consistent with the Act.  Everything else in the company must be approved by the Minister for Finance and the Minister.  I did not feel that was necessary either.</P>
      <P>If the point of this section is that the memorandum of association requires the approval of the Minister and the consent of the Minister for Finance then that is what it should say and not that it should be consistent with the Act.  It cannot be any way other than consistent with the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole's remarks from a purely language point of view.  However, one must look at the system as it evolves.  I am responsible for this Bill and I will have an active interest in the area while I am in this position.  However, others will take my place, they will not be dealing with the Act but will have responsibility for it.</P>
      <P>The advice available to us is that this is a standard provision which we are obliged to insert.  The parliamentary draftsman advised that it should be included.  It clearly states that a memorandum of association shall be provided and that any subsidiary of the company shall have a memorandum of association which will have to be approved by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In future if the Authority is setting up subsidiary companies, it will be brought to the attention of the Ministers for approval.  It will give the Ministers an active and immediate interest in the affairs of the company and its subsidiaries. I hope it will help transparency and alertness by ensuring proper management of the Authority's affairs from a political point of view and on behalf of <Col N="288" /> the people, particularly taxpayers, who will have funded the establishment of this Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with the language.  It is quite clear and I have no problem with it.  The drafts-persons are to be complimented on it.  I am talking about the necessity of including the phrase.  Section 11 states that the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, shall cause a private company conforming to the conditions laid down in this Act to be formed and registered.  That applies to the company and its subsidiaries.  They can do nothing without the agreement of the Minister. In other sections, it is necessary to act within the policy approved by the Minister. They cannot move without his agreement.</P>
      <P>I am just drawing attention to the fact that I agree with the Minister.  This phrase is included simply because it is always included in legislation.  However, I equally make the point that it is unnecessary.  I do not think it is required to be there but I am not opposing it.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 14.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 14 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 14 deals with the objects of the company.  The object detailed in paragraph (a) is to give effect to the Annexes of the Chicago Convention specified in the Schedule except in so far as they relate to the making of agreements within the State and other states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (h) states that one of the objects of the company is to regulate for the purposes of paragraph (a) the registration, airworthiness, operation <Col N="289" /> and maintenance of aircraft and &mdash; this is where I have the problem &mdash; the competence of persons engaged or associated with design, manufacture, maintenance and repairs of aircraft.</P>
    <P>We will shortly discuss the personnel who will constitute the board of the company. I do not want to anticipate what the Minister may say but I will be inquiring as to the criteria he will apply in their selection. If the board is to have responsibility to regulate the competence of persons engaged or associated with the design, manufacture and so on of aircraft, we are talking of people who reside in the United States, South America, Japan and other countries.  Is the Minister seriously suggesting that the board can exercise authority over the competence of the designers and manufacturers of aircraft in countries outside our jurisdiction?  Am I misinterpreting the provision?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is clear. Obviously if we pass laws here, they can only operate within the territory of Ireland.  If we accept international treaties and they are binding on us, they are administered here as if they were Irish law and we operate within the parameters which they lay down.</P>
      <P>The Authority will have the legal power and competence to ensure that people involved in the design, manufacture, maintenance, repair and modification of aircraft and the supply of parts and materials for aircraft in Ireland are up to recognised international standards. Under no circumstances can planes be either manufactured, serviced, repaired or passed for flying unless they have clearance from the Irish Aviation Authority while they operate in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with the maintenance, repair and modification of aircraft or parts and materials for aircraft. However, is the Minister seriously suggesting that we are on the threshold of designing and manufacturing aircraft in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I also looked at this section and I was travelling down the <Col N="290" /> same road as Senator Howard.  One must examine it more closely.  We have regulations for almost every form of transport, regardless of whether we manufacture or design them.  We do not manufacture or design motor cars but we have specific regulations governing them. I do not know of any place where locomotive engines are manufactured but we use and regulate them.</P>
      <P>I assume that this section is to give effect to international standards.  It enables us to regulate a plane in Irish airspace or airports just as we regulate emissions from motor cars which we do not manufacture here.  We must always retain the right to set or implement international standards of safety and control. I presume that is the rationale behind the section.  If not, there is an aircraft industry working away somewhere about which nobody told us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with a wider issue.  This section deals with the functions of the new Authority.  When discussing the name I mentioned that we sometimes describe functions which are too narrow.  In other areas, such as capital, we have given functions that are far too wide.</P>
      <P>The Bill represents an easy way out. There is a large technical section at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications concerned with air navigation and related matters and to parcel those functions together and put them under this new Authority must have seemed the obvious thing to do. However, although it may have been obvious and easy, I do not think it was right.  These functions, which are being retained by the Department, are referred to as the economic aspects of aviation policy.  This gets back to my point with regard to the name.  One aspect of that policy, which should properly stay with the Department, is the negotiation of international air agreements with foreign countries.  That is the right of a Government Department and the Minister.  I do not suggest otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, what is not properly a right of the Government Department or a <Col N="291" /> Minister is the approval or rejection of applications by airlines to operate on routes in and out of the country.  It should be a normal commercial enterprise.  This important function probably should be carried out by an independent State agency operating at arm's length from the Government.  It should have a measure of independence or at least of separation from Government and it should do its business in a visible way open to examination. That is the reason for a civil aviation authority in most other countries which adjudicates on these applications. We need such a body here.  That is why I had a problem with the name because the Authority does not have that right.</P>
    <P>Why do we need it?  The main reason is that the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, by virtue of its responsibilities, cannot be independent of some of the interests involved.  It is responsible for our national carrier, Aer Lingus.  To put it crudely, Aer Lingus is the Department's client and it is part of the Department's job to look after Aer Lingus.  I have no problem with that and it usually does a very good job.  There are occasions, however, when it does not, if it did perhaps Aer Lingus would not be in its present trouble.  Looking after Aer Lingus is one thing, adjudicating on route applications from the viewpoint of Aer Lingus is another matter.  The national interest may well, in some cases, be different from the narrow interests of Aer Lingus.  For example, if we wish to develop Shannon to its full potential we must be willing and ready to give many different airlines rights to fly in and out of Shannon.  It is madness to make those decisions from the point of view of Aer Lingus especially when it is scaling down its interest in Shannon.  It is a crucial point and it must be made.  The powers in this section are too narrowly drawn.</P>

      <P>There is merit in what Senator Quinn says but heavy politics are also involved.  It is a matter for the Government to decide what airlines should operate here and it is a matter <Col N="292" /> for the Authority to regulate the system through which they fly.  It is not in the interest of the Authority to be involved in deciding whether Ryanair flies into one place and Aer Lingus flies out of it.  It is a matter for Government to decide what airlines can fly in from the United States, the United Kingdom or other countries, ours is a small country with a small number of international airports.  The aviation Authority should regulate the system, operate on a commercial mandate in the ancillary activities and make the contribution we believe it can to commercial opportunities in the aviation area in the future.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Senator Howard, to which Senator Magner alluded, the planes which fly into the country should be &mdash; and we are satisfied that they are &mdash; obliged under international law to conform to international criteria.  Obviously they are designed and manufactured elsewhere. However, in this country people, as a hobby or for other reasons, design and manufacture their own small planes and the Authority must be able to control that.  There was a major project in Sligo some years ago involving various State agencies in which, as a contribution to aircraft manufacture, job creation and skills in that area, a group of young people recruited from third and second level schools manufactured a plane.  It is to cover such eventualities that nobody can design, manufacture and fly an aircraft here unless they have a licence from and are under the control of the aviation authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear what the section means.  Does it give the Minister power to add any aviation function to those of the company or does it only give him power to add functions &ldquo;connected with the functions for the time being&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>I am in two minds regarding this section.  On the one hand, I want the powers to be wide; in other words, I would like this body to have the potential to become the wider body it should be. On the other, if that transformation is possible, I do not think it should be done only by ministerial order.  That would allow radical change in a casual way.  The right way to do this is to make a radical extension of powers subject to the approval of the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not mean we would have an amending Bill; an order would be enough but it would first have be debated and approved by both Houses.  It is quite easy to write in such a requirement.</P>
      <P>However, this depends on what the section means.  Is the Minister's power limited to variations on the present functions or is it wider?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinn made a good point.  This section gives the Minister the power to make an order assigning additional functions to the company and making any necessary provisions in relation to that assignment.  This provision is intended to enable the Minister to respond to future changes in circumstances. Technological and other developments which cannot now be foreseen may, in future, make it appropriate to assign other functions to the company and this will give the Minister the power to do so without having to bring new legislation before the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, section 5 (7) provides that an order cannot be made under this section unless the draft of it has been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and has been approved by a resolution of each House.  It will, therefore, not be possible <Col N="294" /> for the Minister to extend the remit of the Authority without the decision being subject to full parliamentary scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 16.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 16 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify section 16 (c) (i) (ii) relating to the appointment of the chairman and the directors of the new company.  Subsection (c) (i) states that each director (including the chairman) shall be appointed for a period of four years and shall be eligible for reappointment.</P>
      <P>Subsection (c) (ii) states:</P>
      <P>of the first directors, other than the chairman, 2, who shall be selected by lot at the first meeting of the directors, shall hold office for a period of 1 year, 2, who shall be selected as aforesaid, shall hold office for a period of 2 years, 2, who shall be selected as aforesaid, shall hold office for a period of 3 years and 2, who shall be selected as aforesaid, shall hold office for a period of 4 years;</P>
      <P>I raise this to ask whether it is the norm in semi-State bodies that a director may be appointed for what could eventually end up as a one year term and whether it follows that, as the directors are drawn by lot to determine the duration of their period up to a period of four years, they are eligible for reappointment within that time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important section of the Bill and deals with the general duty of the company.  I wish to refer to certain points raised such as the duty of the company &ldquo;to conduct its <Col N="295" /> affairs so as to ensure that the revenues of the company are not less or are sufficient taking one year with another.&rdquo;  It goes on to outline the charges and costs which are properly chargeable to the revenue account.  It requires the company to &ldquo;generate the capital that it requires and remunerate its capital and pay interest on and to repay its borrowings and to conduct its affairs at all times in a cost-effective and efficient manner.&rdquo;  That provision is aspirational and what we would all say in relation to any company or industry or anything else in which we would be involved in establishing. However, it is important that the Minister outlines what steps are open to him to ensure that these aspirations are fulfilled. When I say that, I have particular regard to the performances of some semi-State operations in recent times.  Section 16 (2) states: &ldquo;Nothing in section 14 or this section shall be construed as imposing on the company, either directly or indirectly, any form of duty or liability enforceable by proceedings before any court to which it would not otherwise be subject.&rdquo;  I have a fair idea of what this means, but for the benefit of the House it should be clarified.  What steps are available to the Minister to ensure that what are simply aspirations in that measure will be the practice during the operation of the company?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood from the Minister's Second Stage speech that this company should find it impossible to get into debt.  Its charges are regulated, as I understand it, by the international aviation body and, in turn, the Irish operation is entitled to recoup whatever expenditure it incurred in exercising the civil aviation authority within the State. Therefore, technically, and this is where I share some of the concerns expressed by Senator Ross, this company should never get into debt.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask a question on this section but it is probably similar to a previous query.  Since I came into the House I look at any legislation <Col N="296" /> for a new State Authority in the way I would look on it outside the House to see if it is treated in the same way.  This section reflects an attitude to the place of capital in a business undertaking that is wrong.  This attitude is traditional in the public service and has caused untold troubles for State companies in the past. Section 16 a (i) imposes on the company the obligation to generate from revenue the capital it requires.  As a general principle that is unrealistic in business terms. This is a 100 per cent shareholder who says to the company that it is on its own where future capital requirements are concerned, that it must provide them out of its own earnings.  That is all very well when companies generate some capital out of earnings, &ldquo;some capital&rdquo; is the point.</P>
      <P>Many businesses, if they are to develop to their full potential, often need to go back to their shareholders or to the market for further injections of capital. The idea that that route can be fenced off for all time from the very start is totally unrealistic from a business point of view.  That unrealistic attitude has caused many difficulties for State companies in the past.  When that happens the State has to provide money to bail such companies out, as is happening in Aer Lingus.  That is not development capital, it is survival subsidy.  This would not have been necessary if a proper attitude to capitalisation had been in place from the very beginning. I am not suggesting that the State should invest capital everywhere.  I am saying that if there is a proper appreciation of the place of capital in a growing business, as that business grows capital needs to be provided, either by the State as a shareholder or by the State opening up a shareholding to some other parties. The myth that companies will never need more capital or any more capital injection from outside has caused some of our State companies in the past to be run into the ground.  That is really the point I am making about the assumption that no more capital will be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am puzzled by this section and I am not sure whether it was included in legislation setting up other bodies of <Col N="297" /> this sort.  There is very little point in a section of this sort because it seems purely aspirational.  Will the Minister tell me what &ldquo;a general duty&rdquo; means?  It seems to be a phrase put into the Bill to tell the company that it ought to make money in a vaguely commercial way. Subsection (2) says that nothing can be done about it if it does not.  There is no place in this Bill or in any legislation for an aspiration that a body of this sort will possibly, in various circumstances, subscribe to commercial criteria, but that if it does not nothing can be done.  I do not know whether that makes it legal but it makes it totally irrelevant.  The Minister is saying in this Bill that we would like the company to make money and to be able to raise the capital necessary out of its revenue, but that if it does not, we will think about doing something else.</P>
      <P>I agree with some of what Senator Quinn says about generating capital from revenue, it seems that we will never learn the lesson that Telecom should have taught us.  When Telecom was in a similar situation to which this clause addresses itself, it said it was intending to raise the necessary £225 million it needs per year in terms of capital expenditure from revenue. That is pie in the sky.  It will not and cannot happen and its solution was to look for EC funds, which it did not get.</P>
      <P>This provision appears to require that capital must be generated from the profits of this company which simply will not happen.  We are talking about £60 million, the figure the Minister quoted in his speech, so the first thing we should do is to define this general duty, say whether it is just an unenforceable aspiration, and if so to delete it from the Bill.  Will the Minister explain what &ldquo;general duty&rdquo; means, whether the words are enforceable, and how this ties in with the fact that the Minister has given the company guarantees of £80 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will expand on what Senator Howard said in relation to the memorandum.  It is par for the course when compared to all State-sponsored <Col N="298" /> bodies.  I would like to know what powers the Irish Aviation Authority will have to confiscate planes in the case of a company getting into debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Senator Ross, it is not true to say that Telecom Éireann has not got European support. In 1987 when I was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Finance one of our responsibilities was negotiating the Valoren programme and under that programme Europe supported the laying of fibreoptic cables, etc., around the country.  That is one thing I remember clearly.  At present we have an application in the National Development Plan for further support for Telecom Eireann.  There has been European support and we are happy with the attitude the EC Commission has adopted toward the plan, particularly in the telecommunications area.</P>
      <P>I have listened with great interest to the points made about the financial basis for the operation of the Irish Aviation Authority and in particular the question of profitability.  As I indicated, the main revenue source for ANSO, as it will be for the Authority, is the Eurocontrol on-route charging system.  This system operates on the basis of a three year cycle.  In the first year we estimate the cost and traffic for the second year and base the unit charge on those estimates.  In the third year we make whatever adjustment is necessary to ensure that the costs incurred in the second year have been properly and fully charged and collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this system is that if we underestimate traffic for any year the unit charge is set at too high a level and we make a surplus.  We then have to make a compensating repayment to users in the following year.  If we were to remove the phrase &ldquo;taking one year with another&rdquo; from section 16 and required the Authority to make a profit every year it would not be in a position to make this compensating repayment to the users and would, therefore, not be in a position to comply with international agreements. This is the basis of international aviation <Col N="299" /> agreements and we are obliged under the ICOA convention to operate that system.</P>
    <P>We have deliberately chosen the format of a normal commercial company for the Irish Aviation Authority for two main reasons.  First, we believe the company format is best suited to providing the most effective efficient means of delivering service to the users, compatible, of course, with safety standards. Second, we believe that the company format is best suited to exploiting the commercial opportunities that exist for the provision of training and consultancy services.</P>
    <P>The services that ANSO currently provides, that is the regulatory and operational functions, are public utilities.  In general we expect and demand that public utilities operate efficiently and effectively.  However, we expect that where public utilities &mdash; the ESB is a perfect example of this &mdash; have a surplus that that surplus is ploughed back into the business either to make it more efficient or to reduce the cost to the customers. Similarly with ANSO and the IAA, any profit ANSO makes on its core business must be ploughed back into reducing costs to the users.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years ANSO has strategically structured its finances so that it would do a little better than break even.  In 1992 there was a modest profit of £1.7 million on its operations.  Similarly, the projections we have made for the Authority indicate there will be a modest annual surplus amounting to £2 million.  ANSO has adopted the strategy of aiming for a small annual surplus or profit on its core functions.  To budget for a strictly break-even situation could result in a temporary loss &mdash; and I stress temporary &mdash; which would oblige the Exchequer or the Authority to finance that loss.  If ANSO or the Authority incurs losses on its core business they can be recovered from the users through higher charges in the following years.  The vast majority of ANSO and, in the future, Authority users are foreign airlines.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that losses can be recovered we take the view that the <Col N="300" /> Exchequer should not have to be temporarily burdened with such losses. Hence our determination to plan and budget for annual surpluses.  Once the Authority becomes operational it will be active in the market for specialist consultancy and training services.  These activities which are outside its core business will have to be fully viable on a purely commercial basis.  There is no question of the Authority entering into substantial speculative investment funded or supported by the taxpayer. These would have to stand or fall on normal commercial criteria.</P>
    <P>We do not foresee the need for substantial investment in the Authority's consultancy and training work.  Mostly what the Authority will be selling is the skill and expertise of its staff.  Profits made in these activities will be used to fund dividend payments to the Minister for Finance and to further expand the employment potential of these activities.</P>
    <P>The capital base which we propose, and I have made this clear in some of the debates, is £30 million by way of transfer of State assets to the new Authority.  That will be funded by equity of £15 million on the State's side and a borrowing or debt of £15 million on the Authority's side.  In return for the capital base &mdash; the assets &mdash; the Authority will return £15 million to the Minister for Finance. Operating on the basis that it is getting these assets and will operate under normal commercial criteria with the normal funding that any commercial company would have, the Authority is expected to perform.  To see that it performs up to the commercial criteria there will be a chairman and a board of directors and a special unit in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications working in close co-operation with the Authority to ensure that the regulations and the parameters laid down are implemented.  The State, the Government and the various Ministers will be endorsing the efforts of the company to expand its operations and we are already making arrangements that this should be the position between now and the establishment <Col N="301" /> of the Authority and once the Authority is established.</P>
    <P>In direct response to Senator Burke's point about confiscating planes in a default situation where planes would not be paying their route charges, there would be a facility in co-operation with Eurocontrol whereby confiscation could be arranged.  There is a mechanism in the Eurocontrol system and in the international convention where that could be done.  It would be the extreme case as most airlines meet their obligations.  We have to take into account a situation where, if there was an international crisis, like the Gulf War, air traffic activity could be reduced immeasurably and could have a detrimental effect on the Authority's finances.  There is an allowance for that situation in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to return to the point about the &ldquo;general duty&rdquo;.  I do not know what that is or what it means.  Perhaps I could put it in another way.  What will happen to the company or what measures would be taken by the Government if the company fails in this general duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We start with a positive attitude.  We have confidence in the new Authority based on the track record of ANSO as an agency of State within a Government Department.  This is a monopoly, as was mentioned on Second Stage.  It will be giving a regulatory service in a lucrative area.  The exigencies on it, the commercial criteria and the commercial profitability that the company will have, are regulated internationally. If we overcharge for Irish air routes people will divert from us so the company has a fundamental duty to maximise traffic opportunities, enticing them into our airspace and to get a reasonable price for going through that airspace. That is the basic thrust of the company's initial policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be a general duty laid down in that the conditions are there for commercial State-sponsored bodies.  The Government has reviewed that situation over the past year.  On his appointment <Col N="302" /> the chairman will be given specific instructions and documents and he will be obliged to operate to those criteria. The board will be made fully aware of that at their first meeting, the chief executive will be fully aware of that from when he is appointed and the management and staff of the company will be fully aware of that situation.  It is expected that the 600 staff who have a track record as dedicated civil servants will be fully aware of the demands and their responsibilities, the responsibility and the policy of Government and that they will carry them out.  In the event that that is not done the Government will take a serious view.  The board will be questioned and may have to be changed.  Drastic action would have to be taken but we are confident that we will not find ourselves in that situation.  We have to be prepared for every eventuality.  We are confident that we have totally committed experts and if they get a good board with a commercial mandate we believe they will succeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not answer my question.  I presume he is saying the general duty is unenforceable, that in the event of the failure of the board or the company &mdash; as the Bill describes it &mdash; the only option is for the Minister to change the board.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Senator is correct.  If we appoint a board with a management in position and a staff on duty and if at the end of the year the company fails to return a profit, then we would have to take account of that situation.  However, that would be normal commercial analysis and it is not expected that each year the company may be able to return a profit.  The international aviation situation regulates itself and there are surpluses and deficits, and based on clear commercial operating systems, the company should be able to trade forward and successfully.  If we were not satisfied that a genuine effort was made to make a commercial success of the company, then the Government would have to take a serious view of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> The normal laws of the country are enforceable against staff, the directors and so on, but there is no law or no action we could take against any individual if they were not able to return a profit.  If that is what the Senator means that is not possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It was in the ancillary businesses where Bord na Móna went wrong &mdash; for example, investment abroad.  The Government were made aware of the situation, but after the event.  A similar situation arose with Aer Lingus.  After the event is no good.  I believe we can have commercial semi-State bodies without keeping the owners in the dark.  The owner in this case is the State and I do no know what the unit within the Department &mdash; in any Department &mdash; was doing if it could not at least monitor the wisdom or otherwise of investments, how they were progressing and how they came about.  I see nothing that would detract from the commerciality of a project with the unit of the owner looking at how these commercial decisions are made.  At present the supervision comes after the mistake and it comes too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That should be the function of whatever unit the Minister puts in place to oversee this body, not the technical side but the investment side.  The Minister mentioned that their ancillary activities will be the selling on of skills.  We know from experience that companies which were set up and given a commercial mandate where we assumed they were simply selling on skills, were also selling other things and investing in companies abroad and it all went wrong.  I believe we must <Col N="304" /> be extremely careful in that area.  If the Minister's unit within the Department has any function, its main one should be to watch the money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not anticipate that the risks in this company are anything of the magnitude of other companies that may have been established. On the core business side, we are talking of providing a regulatory service for international and national air traffic.  On ancillary activities, we are talking about professional expertise by way of training and consultancy services to given by the company and the investment there would be in staff and technology.  We do not see the company going into high risk areas in unknown commercial fields which would not be within its remit.  We are confident that with the record Ireland has, with the respect there is for that record and with the tremendous expertise in ANSO, the services which this company will provide can be sold on and that, apart from the normal commercial risks faced by any corporate entity which has to operate in an international climate, we do not anticipate that we are going to be in a major risk situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>God bless the Minister's confidence, but I suspect that every time a body of this sort has been introduced in this House every one of the Minister's predecessors said exactly the same; indeed, it would be extraordinary if they told this House they expected the relevant company to make a loss.  I remind the Minister that companies which can make profits can make losses, and that appears to be something which, unfortunately, is not considered a possibility for this company at this stage.  I am aware that this company is a monopoly which gives it an advantage, but it will be competing in the international arena and it may face difficulties in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> However, considering that the Minister is so confident of the company making a profit, he might advise the House what dividend policy is anticipated as being applicable for this company.  As we have seen, because of its huge debt, Telecom Éireann will not pay a dividend to the Government next year, despite the fact that it is reporting nominal profits.</P>
    <P>I am confused about Government policy regarding dividends.  The Minister rarely demands, and no Minister in this Government has had the luxury of demanding many dividends from State owned companies because so few of them make profits.  However, as we anticipate profits from this company perhaps the Minister could tell us in what circumstances he will be demanding a dividend and in what circumstances he will be allowing the company to retain its profits.  I believe I detected in his reply a contradiction in that he said profits would be ploughed back into the company and then he went on to speak of a dividend.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful if we knew Government policy on dividends from State owned companies.  Perhaps the House could have guidelines regarding what circumstances and under what profit figures the Minister would expect this company to declare a profit and in what circumstances it would be better for the company to retain its money.  In other words, say the company did borrow £80 million &mdash; a facility the Minister is kindly giving it &mdash; and then reported small profits, what would the Minister's attitude be to a dividend?  Could the House have an outline before we see any final figures, of what the Government's dividend policy is in relation to this company?</P>

      <P>I do not believe I said I expected the company always to make a profit.  I said that given the exigencies, sometimes there would be a profit and sometimes there might be a slight loss. That is the nature of the business in which the company will be operating.  What we would expect is that the company should make a profit within reason, that it would discharge its taxation liability, that it would pay a reasonable or modest dividend <Col N="306" /> to the Minister for Finance which would be agreed between the Minister and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications after due consultation, and then the company would be able to plough back into its business the remaining profits.  In other words, if there was an international contract in the offing and if the Authority was able to show, in the interests of Ireland and of employment, that we could provide services which required a certain capital investment, either in staff or technology, we would expect that the Authority would get a breathing space from the Minister for Finance of the day to ensure that it could make the investments from its profits for that type of opportunity.</P>
      <P>That is the way we would expect to proceed.  As regards a new company which had to operate under Civil Service conditions, and which must operate in the future under international conditions, and which at present must operate under both sets of conditions, we cannot say at this stage that it must produce a certain dividend.  We must give it breathing space and let it create its own commercial track record.  Certain parameters and conditions are laid down. Everyone involved will be aware of the requirements to perform commercially and successfully.  However, they must be allowed to make their own decisions.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy O'Dea, to the House.  In October 1990 a young Chinese student, Mr. Lau, who had joined the huge demonstration for democracy in China, arrived in Ireland having escaped arrest, been accused of treason and tortured.  Instead of being treated humanely when he arrived in this State seeking asylum, he was detained for seven months in Mountjoy.  Subsequent to his release the Minister for Justice determined that he did not qualify for recognition as a refugee and no public explanation was given for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> On a Friday in November 1990 four Sri Lankans arrived and sought political asylum, but they were deported by the following Tuesday.  On the same day two more Sri Lankans arrived and they were deported two days later, despite the civil difficulties and political unrest in their country.  In one week the Department of Justice had returned them to India without taking any action to ensure that they would not be sent to Sri Lanka from India or that their safety would be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>At a time when we agree to admit to this country a number of Bosnian refugees, a lone refugee from Yugoslavia, who did not belong to the main group, arrived unannounced and sought political asylum.  He was flown to Paris before any consideration was given to his application. When the full details of his story became known, the Government had to agree to his return to Ireland and had to give him permission to remain here.</P>
    <P>There were extraordinary scenes in Shannon Airport 12 months ago when a large number of Kurdish refugees were physically forced back on a plane to Canada.  Individuals who were concerned about their plight and who wished to ensure that they had access to legal help were not allowed to get involved at Shannon Airport.  The refugees were forced out of the country before their position could be independently clarified.</P>
    <P>On 28 July 1993 the Human Rights Committee, established under Article 40 of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, reported its concern at Ireland's &ldquo;discriminatory treatment in some respects of non-nationals, including refugees and asylum seekers&ldquo;.  This is an indictment of the Government for its failure to deal with this important area of human rights. It is clear that the present approach to processing requests for political asylum is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 10 December 1948 states that everyone has a right to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution in other countries.  This State is a party to that convention.  The United Nations <Col N="309" /> convention relating to the status of refugees which was completed in Geneva on the 25 July 1951 and the Protocol to that convention completed in New York on 31 January 1967 details the specific procedures to be applies by the signatories to that convention to application for political asylum and the protection to be afforded to applicants.  Ireland became a signatory to the Geneva convention on 28 November 1956 and to the Protocol on 6 November 1968.</P>
    <P>Despite our international obligations and our accession to the Protocol and convention, we have not enacted legislation to reflect their provisions in our domestic statute law.  Basic legislation which applies to non-nationals seeking to enter this State and who are not citizens of any other European Community member state is contained in the Aliens Act, 1935, and in a series of statutory instruments made under that Act since it came into force.  A substantial number of these have been repealed or rendered irrelevant over the years.</P>
    <P>The 1935 Act predated the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva convention.  This Act was introduced at a different time in Ireland; it was introduced before our Constitution.  According to some lawyers, the Act is illegal and unconstitutional because it leaves the Minister with an unfettered discretion in relation to aliens and it does not outline legislative policy.</P>
    <P>During the past decade concern has been expressed about the manner in which this State treats the small number of people who arrive at points of entry and claim political asylum.  Demands in the early eighties for greater protection for asylum seekers resulted in the then Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government having discussions with the representative of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees who was based in London.  It was agreed to incorporate in our practices procedures for the determination of refugee status and asylum applications in Ireland.  These were designed to reflect our national obligations under the <Col N="310" /> Geneva convention.  The United Nations High Commission was anxious at the time to have legislation enacted in Ireland, but the view of the then Government was that the limited number of asylum applications received in this country did not warrant legislative action incorporating the relevant procedures.</P>
    <P>It is now seven years since these procedures were agreed with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  It is the unanimous view of those who have worked to assist persons who have sought refugee status and political asylum in this country that the current situation is unsatisfactory and that there is a need for legislation which would fully implement in our domestic law our international obligations under the Geneva convention.  This would not only incorporate the procedures agreed by the Government in December 1985, but would also fill a number of gaps left by these procedures.</P>
    <P>This unsatisfactory manner in which we have dealt with applications for political asylum, some of which I have already outlined, has given rise to a series of court cases which would not have arisen if the individuals concerned had felt they had been given proper opportunity to state their cases clearly and fairly and have their applications determined.</P>
    <P>Although the courts have stated the procedures agreed with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 1985 will be regarded as enforceable against the State, it is clear some of those who come here to seek political asylum are not informed of the procedures, and the procedures are not applied in their cases.  Indeed, few have had real opportunity to vindicate their rights before the courts when those rights were not respected.</P>
    <P>It is also clear that in a number of respects the present procedures, even when properly applied, are inadequate. For example decisions are made in secret and no written details are published about the individual to which the convention principles are applied in individual cases.  There is no reason such <Col N="311" /> information could not be made available while preserving the anonymity of the individual where necessary, either for his protection or the protection of members of his family if they remain in the country from which the person has sought to flee. No details are published of the country of origin of persons who are either granted asylum or who have had their applications for asylum turned down and there is no independent right of appeal.  These defects are addressed by the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>The number of people who seek political asylum in the State annually is not large compared to the numbers in most EC member states &mdash; it is extremely small.  In 1988 there were 49 applicants; in 1989, 36; in 1990, 62; in 1991, 31; and in 1992 there were 38.  I understand this year there has been an increase in the numbers and the current figure is about 60.  In 1988, two applications for political asylum were granted and in the years 1989 to 1992 one applicant was successful. This year to date several applicants have been granted political asylum. A small number of applicants, although not granted political asylum, have been allowed to remain in the State but the majority of those who sought political asylum were forced to leave.</P>
    <P>We do not know the criteria applied in determining whether any of these cases were valid.  In most cases we do not know from what countries these people came or why it was determined they did not qualify for political asylum.  Although the number seeking political asylum in Ireland is small we have an international obligation under the Geneva convention to respect the human dignity of each applicant and to ensure not only that each applicant's legal rights are protected but that they are treated in a humanitarian way and with respect.</P>
    <P>At present the fate of the asylum seeker is in the hands of the individual official with whom he or she first comes in contact at the point of entry.  The manner in which that happens is not open to public scrutiny.  There is a growing and widespread concern that many who seek <Col N="312" /> political asylum in this State are not properly treated, their rights are not respected and the spirit of the Geneva convention is not applied.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of this Bill a refugee is defined as a person who, owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion or nationality is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to the country of his former habitual residence and not having a nationality and being outside his former country is unable or owing to such fear is unwilling to return there.  This definition derives directly from the Geneva convention.</P>
    <P>The Bill will ensure every person who seeks recognition as a refugee and who seeks asylum will first have the right of access to legal advice and representation and access to an interpreter and will be informed of such rights.  Second, it ensures a person who seeks asylum will be notified of all information obtained by the Minister for Justice with regard to an application made and will be afforded a reasonable opportunity to respond to such information.  Third, it ensures a person who seeks asylum will be interviewed by an official familiar with the provisions of the United Nations convention and this State's obligations under it.  Fourth, it guarantees a person who seeks asylum will be entitled to communicate independently with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and will be advised in writing of the decision reached and the reasons for it.  Finally, the Bill provides for a right to appeal to a newly established refugee appeals tribunal.</P>
    <P>In the determination of applications for refugee status and asylum the Minister for Justice will have the following obligations under the legislation: no asylum seeker can be removed from the State without being given an opportunity to properly present the case; every application received would have to be examined in accordance with the State's obligations under the UN convention and the Minister will be required to seek the views of the UNHCR and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in respect of all applications <Col N="313" /> received.  In determining applications received the Minister will have to take into account not only the views expressed by the applicant and the communications received from the UNHCR and the Minister for Foreign Affairs but also the views expressed by other bodies and organisations, including Amnesty International and the Irish Refugee Council.  I pay tribute to those two organisations for their work in promoting this issue and their other functions.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill an applicant who is dissatisfied with a decision, within a period of 21 days from receipt of notification of such decision, will be entitled to appeal to an appeals tribunal.  This independent tribunal will fully hear the case made by the applicant and the decision will be final, subject to an appeal to the High Court on a question of law. Appeal hearings from the tribunal will be in public unless an applicant requests they be held in private, in which case such requests will be granted.  While it is desirable that decisions made by the tribunal be transparent, it is recognised that in many instances it may be necessary to hold hearings in private to ensure nothing said would place at risk the applicants' lives or the lives of family members or friends who remain in the applicants' country of origin.</P>
    <P>The tribunal will be required to publish an annual report detailing its work and the decisions made.  This provision will ensure a degree of transparency about the decision making process and Members of the Oireachtas and the public will see how the legislation is working and the manner in which we are complying with our international obligations.</P>
    <P>Section 1 details the Title of the Bill. Section 2 provides the Bill will come into operation within six months after its enactment.  Section 3 is the definition section.  It contains the definition of refugee already referred to, which corresponds exactly to the definition contained in the Geneva convention.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the applications for recognition of refugee status and for asylum and provides that any person who <Col N="314" /> is within the State or who arrives at the frontiers of the State may apply to the Minister for Justice to be recognised as a refugee and to be granted asylum.  This section provides that an appeal may be made against a decision of the Minister to a refugee appeals tribunal.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (3) and (4) details certain circumstances in which an application for asylum is in accord with the Geneva convention. Primarily the Minister may decline to determine an application in circumstances where there is another State to which the applicant may apply for admission as a refugee, whose laws and practices comply fully with the Geneva convention and with which the applicant has closer connections than this State and where there are no special circumstances requiring the Minister to consider and determine the application.  The Minister may also decline to process an application where a final determination has yet to be made on an application for asylum by a person to such a State or where the application has been refused recognition as a refugee in such a State.</P>
    <P>Section 5 requires the Minister for Justice, prior to determining an application for asylum, to seek the views of the UNHCR and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  This makes part of our statute law the procedure which is supposed to be applied under the arrangements agreed with the UNHCR in 1985.  Prior to making a decision the Minister must also have regard to communications received, not only from the High Commissioner for Refugees and the Minister for Foreign Affairs but also the other bodies I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that every person who seeks recognition as a refugee and who seeks asylum shall be entitled to access to legal advice and representation and, where necessary, a right of access to an interpreter.  Moreover it requires that every such person be informed of their rights in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that every person recognises that a refugee must be granted asylum.  Section 8 prohibits the Minister or any person acting on the Minister's behalf from deporting or removing from <Col N="315" /> the State or returning a person to any other state where their life or freedom would be threatened on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, nor can such a person be removed to a third state until the Minister is satisfied that the state would not so deal with them.</P>
    <P>Section 9 details a number of circumstances in which a person will cease to be a refugee and cease to be entitled to political asylum, for example, where a person previously granted asylum voluntarily returns to his or her country of origin.  Section 10 excludes certain sections from entitlement to protection as a refugee and a grant of political asylum.  For example, refugee status will not be extended to a person who has committed a war crime or a crime against humanity or who has committed a crime of genocide under the meaning of the Genocide Act, 1973.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the making of regulations by the Minister for Justice for the making, consideration and determination of applicants under the Bill. While conferring on the Minister a general power to make regulations, this section specifically requires that regulations be made to provide for the following matters: immediate notification to the Minister by immigration officials of the making of an application; the interviewing of all applicants by an appropriate person familiar with the provisions of the convention and the State's obligations thereunder; the representation of applicants at such interviews by a solicitor and the provision of the services of an independent and competent interpreter where necessary; notification to all applicants of their right to legal representation, access to an interpreter and of the right to appeal against any determination made; notification to all applicants of information obtained by or on behalf of the Minister with regard to the application made and to afford reasonable time to the applicant to respond to such information.  This section also recognises the importance of the United <Col N="316" /> Nations High Commission for Refugees' handbook on procedures.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that nothing contained in the Aliens Act, 1935, or in any other orders made under the Act shall be taken to require or to authorise any action which contravenes the State's obligation under the convention.  It also provides that in the event of any conflict between the terms of any order made by the Minister for Justice under section 11 of this Bill and an order under the 1935 Act, the order under this Bill should have priority.</P>
    <P>The need for the legislation which I have outlined is widely recognised.  It is my hope that the Bill will be received constructively by the Government.  It should not be seen as a party politically contentious piece of legislation but as a constructive measure designed to ensure that those who seek refugee status in Ireland and claim political asylum are treated with dignity, humanity and respect and that their rights under international law are fully respected.  Political asylum is essentially a humanitarian approach by the State to provide protection for those who are vulnerable, in fear of persecution and in urgent need of sanctuary.  Over the centuries many of the people of this country sought such sanctuary in other countries.  In most cases they were received humanely and had their dignity preserved.  Surely this country owes it to the international community to treat people who are persecuted in like fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice has asked me to convey to the House that she had intended to be here tonight to listen to this important debate personally but unfortunately she is unable to attend due to illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of refugees and applications for refugee status is an important one and it is appropriate that it should be debated in this House.  As Senators will be aware, only last May there was a full debate in the other House on this topic and it gave an opportunity to many Deputies to put forward their views.  The Minister is <Col N="317" /> interested in obtaining a wide range of views on the topic as, since she took office as Minister for Justice, she has taken a personal interest in the question of refugees. She was looking forward to hearing the views of this House on the issues involved but, unfortunately she cannot be here through circumstances outside her control.</P>
    <P>I am sure all Senators will agree with me that applicants for refugee status and refugees must be treated not only in a fair and equitable manner but also with compassion.  By definition they are strangers in a foreign land and we must take extra care to ensure that their rights are respected.</P>
    <P>The Minister agrees with Senator Neville that our practices and procedures in relation to applications for refugee status and refugees should be put on a legislative basis.  Our current administrative practices are not always perceived to be fair and comprehensive and also they are not in keeping with the legislatively based systems which have been established in other countries, such as our EC partners.  It is for this reason that the Government has decided that legislation should be introduced as soon as possible.  I will deal further with these legislative proposals shortly but before doing so I want to refer to the existing situation and to mention some initiatives that have been taken already.</P>
    <P>Ireland acceded to the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees in November 1956 and to the related 1967 Protocol in November 1968.  Since our accession we have fully honoured our obligations under both instruments.  Let us be clear; while I am not saying that our existing procedures are perfect, I totally reject any suggestion that we are, or ever were, in breach of our international obligations.</P>
    <P>When Ireland acceded to the UN convention it was decided to implement it on an administrative rather than on a statutory basis.  In the mid-1980s, procedures were revised in consultation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  The position, therefore, when the Government <Col N="318" /> took office was that there were administrative procedures in place which met the requirements of the UNHCR, which involved consultation with the UNHCR in every case and, if necessary, an applicant could resort to the courts to ensure that these procedures were complied with.</P>
    <P>Despite the existing administrative procedures there was a perception that our arrangements were not sufficiently transparent.  For this reason the Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment that our policy towards the treatment of refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants will meet the highest international standards and that procedures will be introduced to guarantee rights of hearings, appeals, access to legal advice and access to the courts.  Therefore, from the day that this Government took office it was made clear that it intended to reform the procedures regarding refugees.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach to this reform has been on a two-fold basis.  She has examined what could be done on a non-legislative basis as well as examining what needs to be provided by way of legislation. The most obvious shortcoming in the existing procedures is that there is no appeal mechanism for persons who apply for refugee status but whose application is rejected.</P>
    <P>Developments in recent years have resulted in almost every other EC country adopting some form of appeal mechanism. Having considered the question of appeals the Minister decided as an interim measure to appoint a retired member of the Judiciary to deal with appeals against refusals to grant refugee status under the existing procedures.  I am pleased to announce to the Seanad that Judge O'Malley, a former President of the Circuit Court, has accepted this position.  The Minister would like to take this opportunity to express her appreciation to Judge O'Malley for taking on this duty.</P>
    <P>A further part of the review of procedures which was initiated by the Minister relates to the training and guidelines available to immigration officers who are, <Col N="319" /> for the most part, the first people to meet applicants for refugee status.  It is therefore extremely important that they shall be equipped with the appropriate skills and knowledge to handle the applicants with a high degree of sensitivity and expertise.  Over the years immigration officers have been issued with written guidelines which indicate clearly that a person should not be returned to a country to which he or she is unwilling or unable to return owing to a fear of persecution, nor should he or she be returned to a country where his or her personal safety might be seriously threatened as a result of the political situation there. When it appears to an immigration officer that the person might be an applicant for refugee status his or her instructions are to refer the case to the Department of Justice immediately.</P>
    <P>Immigration officers have performed these duties very well but there are no areas in our administration that are so good that they cannot be improved.  The Minister is determined that from the very first contact with the authorities in this State, applicants for refugee status should know their rights and entitlements and should receive a full user friendly transparent and expert service.  With this in mind she has accepted a kind offer of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to assist in the preparation and presentation of a programme of training specifically designed for immigration officers to assist them in dealing with applicants for refugee status.  The first course of this programme will be held next month with the full co-operation of the Department of Justice under the auspices of the Garda authorities, who share the enthusiasm of the Minister in relation to user friendly services.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also concerned that immigration officers should have their training backed up by revised and updated guidelines and have at their disposal information leaflets which they can give to applicants for refugee status which will set out in simple terms and in a variety of languages their basic entitlements. Appropriate guidelines and information <Col N="320" /> leaflets will be issued in the near future.  Senators will readily understand that applicants for refugee status often arrive in this country disorientated and not even sure what country they are in. For obvious reasons, they can be distrustful and suspicious of officials.  I hope that the measures I outlined will help to allay some of the difficulties faced by these unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>I have outlined some non-legislative measures taken by the Minister since she came into office and which have been, or are about to be, implemented.  However, the main initiative required is that our procedures be put on a legislative basis. The Minister is also of the view that such legislation should not be rushed &mdash; it requires careful consideration and full consultation.  To this end, the Minister established an interdepartmental committee to examine policy and practices with regard to non-Irish persons resident in the State and in the area of persons who apply for refugee status.  The committee comprised representatives of the Department of Justice, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Enterprise and Employment and it invited submissions from the public, by way of a notice in the national press, in June this year.  A considerable number of submissions were received from different groups and concerned members of the public.  There were also discussions with, among others, representatives of the UNHCR and Amnesty International to ascertain their views.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the interdepartmental committee are extensive and cover more than refugees.  Due to the urgency of this topic, however, the committee decided to prepare an interim report dealing with such matters as; giving statutory effect to the UN convention; the rights of persons recognised as refugees in the State; the procedures for dealing with applications for asylum and refugee status and an appeals procedure.</P>
    <P>The Minister is determined to introduce legislation as soon as possible and, to avoid delay, she gave instructions to officials of her Department to commence <Col N="321" /> work on a Bill dealing with refugees and applicants for refugee status parallel with the work of the interdepartmental committee. A draft general scheme of a Bill has now been prepared in her Department. No final decision as to the contents of the proposed legislation will be made by the Government until the Minister has given the necessary consideration to the interim report of the interdepartmental committee.  The Minister is confident, therefore, that the general scheme of the Bill can be finalised quickly and, depending on the time available for its drafting, she hopes it will be published before Christmas.</P>
    <P>A similar Private Member's Bill was presented by Deputy Shatter to the other House earlier this year and was fully debated in May.  The Government's position was made clear and the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to address the relevant issue was reaffirmed.  While the general thrust of the Bill was acceptable, time was required to consult interested parties and review the issues involved before the Government introduced its own Bill on the matter.  In the light of the assurances in May and the progress since then, there is no need to proceed with the Bill. Senators will have an opportunity to fully debate the issues involved when the Government proposals are presented in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Minister agrees with the principle behind the Bill and with many of the measures proposed.  As I made it clear, however, the Minister agrees that our procedures for dealing with refugees and asylum seekers should be given statutory effect.  All the issues involved will be addressed in the Government Bill, which, as I said, will be brought forward shortly.  The Minister does not necessarily agree, however, with all the provisions of the Bill now before the House and she also feels it is not comprehensive. If we are to implement the UN Convention by statute, it would seem logical to implement it in full and not just selected parts of it, as proposed in the Private Members' Bill before us tonight.  For instance, the convention, in Articles 12 <Col N="322" /> to 20, sets out in detail the rights and entitlements of a person recognised as a refugee but no provision for such rights are included in the Bill before us today.</P>
    <P>However, I do not want to go into any great detail on the provisions of the Bill we are debating.  Suffice to say that the Government is opposing it for a number of reasons.  As I said already, it is not comprehensive; this is a complicated and intricate topic, involving areas in which we have no legislation to date, international obligations arising from conventions and international co-operation arising from our EC membership.  These factors mean that considerable thought and work must go into the preparation of the Bill.  This is being done at the moment in the interdepartmental committee and in my Department.  The Government's Bill will reflect this detailed preparatory work.  I am satisfied that we should wait for that Bill, rather than proceed with this Bill, the drafters of which have not had the benefit of all the work that has gone into the preparation of the Government Bill in recent months.  To proceed with this Bill would mean ignoring that work and building on an insecure foundation if an attempt were made to amend the Bill on Committee and subsequent Stages.</P>
    <P>As I stated, the Minister will be bringing in legislation to give statutory effect to the UN convention and she will be open to considering any amendments Senators may wish to suggest in the context of that Bill.  However, for the reasons I outlined, she must oppose the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, Senator Neville referred to the incident at Shannon Airport involving Kurdish refugees.  The Minister has asked me to say that she is in receipt of correspondence from a legal adviser, acting on behalf of persons claiming to have been involved in the incident.  Following the receipt of the report from the gardaí, for which she has asked, the Minister will reply to that correspondence. In general, it would be inappropriate to comment in regard to specific cases, given that it is a confidential matter and that there may be <Col N="323" /> certain inherent dangers for the applicant and, more particularly, for the family at home.  However, the UNHCR is consulted with regard to each application and no Minister for Justice has ever refused to accept the advice of the UNHCR as to whether a person is suitable or should be successful in their application for refugee status.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I also congratulate Senator Neville on his Bill.  Senator O'Toole and Senator Lee would also like to be associated with my remarks because there is not enough time for all of us to speak in this debate.  Senator Neville is to be praised for introducing this Bill and one of his main functions seems to be urging the Government to bring forward its own Bills.  I am delighted to hear that the Minister intends to bring in her Bill before Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am optimistic but I am also realistic.  I am glad that the non-legislative work is in progress, especially with regard to the courses for immigration officers.  The Bill contains safeguards for the provision of independent legal advice for asylum seekers; provision of competent interpreters; the advisory role of the UNHCR and the right of the refugee to speak to them confidentially; the right of appeal and for an independent tribunal and to be informed of all their procedural entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I agree there are omissions in some areas in the Bill.  I would like changes in section 4 which deal with the <Col N="324" /> grounds upon which the Minister may refuse to consider and determine an asylum application and the criteria applied to asylum seekers who may have sought protection in a third state.  Ireland is a signatory to the Dublin Convention, determining the state responsible for examining applications for asylum lodged in one of the member states or in the EC. The Dublin Convention is not mentioned in the Bill or referred to in the Minister's speech.  The Refugee Protection Bill should make explicit reference to Ireland's obligations under the Dublin Convention and its provisions concerning the appropriate measures for its implementation.  I do not want to appear obsessed with ratification.  Last week, I asked when we could have ratification of the Protocols to the Geneva Convention of 1949.  They came up in 1977 and after 17 years, I was told legislation was still in progress and I do not want to see the Dublin Convention taking that long for ratification.</P>
    <P>The special circumstances mentioned in section 4 should also be elaborated upon.  These might include a significant connection with Ireland, immediate or extended family members living in Ireland and an ability to speak the language. Also, there is no time limit on how long the Minister can take before he or she gives a decision.  The refugee, after all, is entitled to a reply within a certain, reasonable length of time, unless there are good reasons it cannot be given.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;satisfied &ldquo;is used many times in the Bill.  I am not sure what that means.  Section 8 (3) states: &ldquo;where the Minister is satisfied such a person would endanger public security if allowed to remain in the State&rdquo;.  What does that mean?  Does it mean shoplifting, rape or the abduction of a citizen?  It is rather vague.  Section 14 requires such a person to appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal within 21 days of receiving notification of the Minister's decision.  I suggest two months would be a more reasonable period.  I know it would cost money to keep a person here, but not many people apply for political asylum in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> Important entitlements for refugees referred to in the Minister's speech have been omitted, for example, the right of refugees to receive work authorisation has not been referred to.  While it is current practice, this right should be codified. The right of a recognised refugee to be joined by members of his or her family has not been discussed.  Indeed, the status of the refugees' dependants is not considered in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The power of the Minister to grant permission for entry and leave to remain on humanitarian grounds is briefly mentioned in section 12.  However, the Bill fails to address the rights of individuals granted such status, for example, whether they are entitled to work authorisation and family reunification.  We often deal with refugees by allowing them to stay on humanitarian grounds.  This means they may eventually be able to return to their own country, but it leaves the person in limbo and in an insecure position while in this country.  This may be difficult for people who do not have individual claims regarding refugee status, for example, the fear of persecution, but who come from countries in crisis, they are <i>de facto</i> refugees.  The difference between humanitarian and refugee status should be looked at.</P>
    <P>A major omission is the failure to address unaccompanied children.  In a country from which citizens feel they must flee, it is not uncommon in panic for families to be separated and a child may end up travelling with other adults or on his or her own.  Children in such situations are entitled to special protection and the guidelines of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child should be followed.  The UNHCR has guidelines on how unaccompanied children should be treated.  The child should be legally represented and a guardian appointed. Initially the child should be interviewed by a person with expertise in child development, preferably with a background similar to the child's.  This person should help to establish the child's right to refugee status.  For example, the child's idea of a well founded fear, explained in the 1951 convention, may <Col N="326" /> be different from that of an adult and expressed in a different way.  The age of the child is important and the questions should be appropriate.  We must ensure that this important group is not left out of the legislation.  Unaccompanied refugee children should have the right to be reunited with their parents and siblings in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is no reason anyone should be put in prison in this country.  Since it was founded, the Red Cross has run refugee centres in Dublin and subsequently in Ennis when Shannon became an important point of entry.  I hope we do not see people being detained unnecessarily in prison because it is a shame on the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and my party, the Progressive Democrats, supports it.  I commend Senator Neville for bringing this legislation before the House.  It is designed to put in place a set of procedures which would guarantee the rights of persons seeking refugee status in this country.  It is human rights legislation and a human rights issue.</P>
      <P>The Bill, if passed, would put in place an appeal system promised by the Government in its Programme for a Partnership Government.  It would provide a system of access through the mechanism of appeal on a point of law to the High Court.  We are dealing with a matter relating to fundamental human rights.  As a nation we are good at lecturing the rest of the world when it departs from human rights issue, but we are slow to put our own house in order.  We believe we have a special and unique role to play in the way Irish foreign policy is conducted through the UN, but when the UN puts forward a convention in relation to the treatment of refugees, we sign the convention, yet fail to enact laws to put it in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amnesty International, the Red Cross, the Irish Refugee Council, Senator Neville and Senator Henry ask for less rhetoric and more action.  The Minister of State said the Minister for Justice hopes to introduce legislation before Christmas, but we must remember that <Col N="327" /> when refugees arrive they have one chance, they cannot wait for legislation to be passed.  We have been given one chance, yet we have failed to grasp that opportunity.</P>
    <P>A number of Members have experience of refugees because they represent a Dublin, Clare or Limerick constituency. Although I do not represent those areas, I have a Polish sister-in-law who was involved with the Red Cross.  She dealt with eastern European refugees because she spoke their language and she has spoken to me about this matter.</P>
    <P>We commend the work done by Amnesty International, the Red Cross and the Irish Refugee Council.  They want us to implement this Bill rather than have a further delay because the Bill is inadequate.  The Government may table amendments on Committee Stage if they believe they have a case.  Nobody could disagree with the fundamental principles of the Bill and, I believe, the majority of the people support this Bill.  Although the Bill was defeated in the Lower House six months ago, that is no reason to delay this matter.  No Member can happily vote against the Bill this evening.  Those fighting for the rights of refugees, including Amnesty International, who have lobbied for some time are not prepared to accept more excuses.  If we vote in favour of this Bill, we will be doing something of which we can be proud.  I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Students in Trinity College who are members of Amnesty International lobbied me and, I presume, other Members in regard to this Bill.  As a member of Amnesty International, I am aware of the importance of this letter writing campaign.  I note the tremendous work by Amnesty International all over the world in raising injustices.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  I discussed the issue with him before this Bill was brought before the House.  I am apprehensive about saying the Bill is flawed but many sections of the Bill need to be amended.  Senator Honan suggested that the Bill should go to Committee Stage <Col N="328" /> where it could be amended.  However, we would probably be here for the next five to six weeks trying to improve it.  I agree with the spirit of the Bill.  As Senator Honan said, we call on other countries to improve their human rights and, therefore, we should take the lead in this regard.</P>
      <P>I have little experience of refugees. However, during my childhood my family went on holiday to Youghal, County Cork, where we met a family, the Bojoraks, from Hungary.  The family left Hungary during the uprising in the 1950s and they were given refugee asylum in Ireland.  When one considers the fact that we accepted asylum seekers and refugees in the 1950s, I was disheartened to hear some Senators say that we have been remiss in the services we provide.  I used the analogy of the Hungarian family because recent events in eastern Europe and the Balkan region have made us aware of the refugee problem faced by the EC on a scale not seen since the Second World War.  To tackle this effectively will take a huge interaction among all agencies in the EC; not only involving the Irish Red Cross, the Irish Refugee Council, Amnesty International and the UNHCR, but with all levels of similar bodies in the EC.</P>
      <P>The concept of asylum is the cornerstone of a State's humanitarian response and obligation to provide protection for those who are vulnerable, in fear of persecution and in urgent need of sanctuary and shelter.  Asylum is a matter of State co-operation.  It is the State that decides if citizens of other states are to be admitted.  However, the map of Europe is rapidly changing and Europe needs to respond to this change.</P>
      <P>Before considering new legislation it is important that consensus is reached on what exactly that legislation hopes to achieve as well as the best ways of implementing its intentions.  One of the faults with the Bill presented by Senator Neville &mdash; and I am not doing this on a political party basis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Senator Neville will respond to that shortly when he has more time.  As Senator Henry said, we have other obligations towards different conventions.  This Bill does not take into account our obligations under the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees which is very technical and must be included in the overall framework of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am heartened by the fact that, before legislation comes before the House, the Minister for Justice decided to set up a body to hear appeals, under the chairmanship of Judge Peter O'Malley.  We have to take cognisance of the fact that decisions of the Minister for Justice and her predecessors have all complied with advice given by the UNHCR, which is the ultimate world body dealing with the protection of refugees and granting asylum.  The existing formal arrangements for dealing with these applications were agreed with the UNHCR.  We have to consult them on the best method of enforcing their intentions as well as the input they would like to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is an important signpost to future legislation and we have been assured by the Minister that such legislation is on the way.  I noted with sadness the reaction of Members on the other side of the House when the Minister said he hoped that legislation would hopefully be introduced before Christmas.  I am sure they are aware that drafting legislation of this type cannot be done quickly or easily.  The main drawback is the lack of consensus in current legislation.  We need consensus to ensure that when refugee status is given there is proper support for the refugees living here.  We also need <Col N="330" /> consensus to make it easier to segregate those who do not have a genuine claim to refugee status.</P>
    <P>I hope that my final point is not contentious. I refer to section 11 (2) (e) which states that the regulations shall provide for notification to all applicants of information obtained by or on behalf of the Minister with regard to an application made and to afford reasonable time to an applicant to respond to such information.</P>
    <P>Taken in a general sense, this is not a very contentious point.  However, if somebody with a criminal or dangerous record was seeking asylum or refugee status here and the Minister obtained information which affected public security, then I do not think he or she should be obliged to release that information in the interests of protecting public safety. As a result of this subsection, the Minister could be ordered by the courts to release information or material that would be injurious to the State.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Senator Neville on once again highlighting issues that need to be highlighted and in bringing this Bill forward. Unfortunately, I cannot support it for the reasons I outlined, in addition to the technical flaws I see in it.  I hope that when the new legislation comes through there will be another lively debate in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed by the Minister's speech as it bears no relation to reality.  He talked about the situation confronting potential refugees in this country as being &ldquo;user-friendly&rdquo;.  Ask any unfortunate person fleeing terror or persecution in their own country about the manner in which they were chased around airport lounges, pushed to the ground, reloaded on aircraft either to Cuba or the old Soviet Union, and were victims of considerable force.  Ask them how user-friendly they found the services <Col N="331" /> of this country.  I support Senator Neville in putting forward this particular measure.  I commend him, as other Senators have done, for his commitment and his social conscience in seeking to address problems and wrongs that the underprivileged and voiceless in society, in Ireland and beyond, have to contend with.</P>
      <P>Senator Neville is doing more than that.  As with many other social issues, he is acting in a caring and responsible manner as any legislator in Parliament should.  The Government, by responding in a negative way, is not only frustrating the worthy objective of a caring legislator, it is showing contempt for the role and function of the Seanad.  I say that with the greatest respect for Senator Crowley's contribution.  By adopting this attitude, the Government is implying, in effect, that no Member of the Oireachtas, apart from a Minister, has the intelligence or the intellectual capacity to prepare and put forward simple legislation. This is a reflection on every single Member of the Seanad, it should be treated as such and rejected by them.</P>
      <P>If the Government perceived a weakness in the Bill put forward by Senator Neville, then it had the option of putting forward amendments to achieve the improvements it felt may be required. The Bill seeks to enact in domestic law commitments solemnly entered into by Ireland when it signed the Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees almost 40 years ago and the Protocol 25 years ago.  For almost 40 years we, as a country, Government and Parliament, have sat back and refused to give effect in our domestic law to international commitments into which we freely entered and solemnly signed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the intervening years we lectured other countries on their perceived failure to honour international obligations and, more particularly, on the human rights standards some of them applied.  If Ireland's standing on human rights were to be judged on how we dealt with unfortunate people fleeing terror and persecution <Col N="332" /> in other countries and seeking refuge and asylum here, we would be, deservedly, almost at the bottom of any league table.</P>
    <P>Nothing puts our position in perspective better than the statistics quoted by Senator Neville.  Between 1988 and 1992 216 people sought asylum here, only three of which were successful, yet we pretend to value human rights.  The right to sanctuary from persecution and terror is an internationally recognised human right.  We should be ashamed of Ireland's record over that five year period in terms of the number of applications accepted.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville's Bill seeks to bring transparency, honesty and justice to an area where all three are sadly lacking and to restore some measure of decency to Ireland's human rights record.  It also seeks compliance with our international obligations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astounded by the Minister's reply.  It is reminiscent of similar replies in this House to Opposition Bills. It is a flagrant insult to the work of Senators, including Senator Neville.  It is reminiscent of a similar Bill we discussed not too long ago, which proposed to abolish capital punishment.  The Government of the day advanced spurious and similar excuses as to why such punishment could not be abolished and then proceeded, when it found new Coalition partners who breathed more strongly down its throat, to introduce an identical Bill to the one it had defeated a few months earlier.  It is an appalling reflection on this House's parliamentary system that Governments are incapable, for reasons of pride, to accept Bills from the Opposition and later introduce Bills which almost exactly duplicate those they rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's excuses are flimsy, unacceptable and disingenuous.  He objects to the Bill because &ldquo;it is not comprehensive&rdquo;. He says: &ldquo;Suffice to say that the Government is opposing it for a number of reasons&rdquo;, but does not detail them.  He goes on to say &ldquo;it is a very complicated and intricate topic&rdquo; as if the Seanad is incapable of dealing with such <Col N="333" /> topics.  This may be what the Minister thinks of the Seanad but the Opposition introduced a Bill with which the House could easily deal.</P>
    <P>In May Deputy Shatter introduced this Bill in the Dáil.  It is now November.  This Bill possibly has not reached the Cabinet table as it is not a priority.  On being challenged as to whether it will come before either House before Christmas, the Minister said it will not as it is not considered a priority by the Government. This is a great shame.  Ireland prides itself on, and wrongly boasts about, its record on human rights.  We have far from a good record on this issue but are very good at our public relations on it.</P>
    <P>I have serious problems about the case mentioned by Senator Neville involving refusal of refugee status to anybody from China.  I have problems about refusing such status to people from other countries which practise the death penalty. What happens if someone from China requires refugee status here but is sent home to a country where the death penalty is in operation?  What happens if we have a refugee from Iraq?  We do not care too much about Iraq.</P>
    <P>Ireland, which is proud of its record on human rights, very openly, and rightly in moral terms, took a strong stand against South Africa and led the charge to maintain sanctions on it because we disapproved so strongly &mdash; more strongly than any other European country &mdash; of the South African apartheid regime.  That was a noble and wonderful stand as everybody disapproved of that regime. We were able to take a stronger stand against apartheid because we did very little trade with South Africa.  At the same time we were taking this extraordinary stand, we were trading as if there was no tomorrow with Iraq, where the abuses of human rights were as great, or far greater, than in South Africa or any other country.</P>
    <P>We should examine our attitude to human rights, political asylum and refugees. I suggest our criteria on these matters are, and always have been, determined not by any misplaced and bogus interest in human rights but by <Col N="334" /> trade.  Our relations with other countries are determined not by conscience but by trade.  That is why I find it so difficult to believe that the Labour Party, the great party of moral conscience, liberal attitudes and concern for human rights, will oppose this Bill.  It may be inadequate but if it is we should debate it.  There is nothing wrong with proposing this Bill on Second Stage and the Labour Party moving amendments on Committee Stage.  There is nothing in this Bill or in any Bill of this sort which cannot be amended.  I fear this Bill will be defeated, to the shame of the Labour Party, and that a Bill will not be introduced in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator Ross recognises the important role the Labour Party has always played, and will continue to play, on behalf of the disadvantaged in society and elsewhere.  I am not long past my student days when, in the true sense of education, we broadened our ideas and attitudes, discussed national and international affairs and adopted stances on various issues.  This came to mind on receipt of correspondence from students of Trinity College, my <i>alma mater,</i> advocating the adoption of this legislation.</P>
      <P>I do not disagree with the need for legislation dealing with refugees, not only to incorporate the UN Convention on the Status of Refugees, which we ratified as far back as 1951 and by the Protocol in 1967, but also to provide a way we, as a civilised nation, should deal with other human beings.  There is an obvious need for laws which deal in a humane fashion with refugees who land on our shore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We pride ourselves on our compassion and deem ourselves to be a progressive society.  Our work as a nation in the Third World is second to none.  We have voluntary workers in every Third World country.  I had the privilege of meeting many workers on different occasions.  I met Concern workers in Cambodia while I was overseeing the first democratic elections there.  It was amazing to see what they do, their energy, compassion and empathy were obvious in the way they <Col N="335" /> worked and lived with the poorest of the poor, and helped them to gain a degree of self-esteem and worth by giving them practical help and attention.</P>
    <P>We have an excellent reputation across the globe in the fields of charity and international aid.  We never fail to respond to international crises.  When asked to contribute to any fund we did deep into our pockets and clap ourselves on the back as a nation for so doing, which is just.  However, is there an element of hypocrisy in our attitude?  We can deal with problems abroad in our usual fashion but it is a different matter when the problem lands on our doorstep.  Perhaps that is why our treatment of refugees is nothing of which to be proud.</P>
    <P>This point also covers other issues.  I often question how we can reconcile our charity abroad with how we deal with our own people &mdash; the disadvantaged, the marginalised and the minorities who live among us.  This evening I will confine my remarks to the issue of refugees and how we deal with them.  In fairness, we have granted political asylum to many reaching our shores and continue to so do. We have happily accepted refugees from Vietnam and more recently from Bosnia. However, it is time to develop a proper, comprehensive, compassionate and, above all, fair system to deal with refugees in the future.</P>
    <P>We cannot be proud of the current situation.  Many applications for asylum are made in airport arrival lounges by people who refuse to get back on the aeroplane.  When the heavy hand of bureaucracy falls upon them and the maze of administration begins, the problems are endless.  More often than not, these people are detained at the airport until some official deems fit to deal with them.  Then they are dependent on the Department of Justice and the luck of the day.  I have seen many cases where official decisions were made quickly and without proper, or perhaps any, consideration. The unfortunate individual is despatched back post-haste.  This makes me furious.</P>
    <P>In instances where a person has entered the country illegally and is <Col N="336" /> caught, they are again at the mercy of the official of the day.  Even when a deportation order is made, the individual in question will be put into custody pending determination of how to put this order into action.  We have read in the newspapers where one individual was detained in an Irish prison without bail for one year before the Department even considered his future.  Several months in custody is not unusual.  That is disgraceful. These people have committed no offence in this country and, therefore, this country has no right to treat them in the way it does.  Dogs are treated better here, at least they have the protection of the ISPCA.  Our refugees and asylum seekers have nobody.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution may not provide procedures for such persons, after all it was written in 1937 and this may not have been a problem then.  However, it does lay down principles of justice which govern our administrative procedures. The concepts of natural justice, human rights, fair procedures and so on are well enshrined in our laws.  Yet, we have not adopted a system which would treat refugees and asylum seekers fairly, and be seen to do so.  These people are not citizens of this State or the EC but they have rights on our soil nonetheless, by virtue of their being human beings and entitled to the limited protection of the UN.</P>
    <P>Is it that our State thinks these people might be hopeful immigrants getting through the back door?  Even if this is the case, it is time we addressed the problem of how we deal with potential immigrants generally.  We should get rid of our hidden racism, fear, hypocrisy and so on, and determine how best to treat individuals entering our State, or wishing to do so, and lay down principles and procedures for so doing, once and for all.</P>
    <P>With reference in particular to our treatment of refugees, I am pleased to hear the Minister has begun to reform our administrative procedures in this area.  I urge her to continue with these reforms post haste.  However, I still believe in the need for legislation not only to comply with our undertaking under the UN convention <Col N="337" /> but also to place such procedures on a proper statutory basis.</P>
    <P>I applaud what Senator Neville has attempted to do and he deserves personal credit for bringing this Bill before us. However, the Bill does not appear, from my reading of it, to be comprehensive and I am advised of certain flaws in it.  I am a lawyer and I have studied this with great care but I am not completely happy with it, although what it purports to do is long overdue.</P>
    <P>Our Programme for Government recognises the need for legislation in this area; this idea is not the exclusive possession of Senator Neville.  The Programme for a Partnership Government states:</P>
    <P>Our policy towards the treatment of refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants will meet the highest international standards.  Procedures will be introduced to guarantee rights of hearings, appeal, access to legal advice and access to the courts.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party insisted on this commitment, as I am sure Senator Ross will recognise.  We have discussed it at many levels and we are determined that our commitment will bear fruit.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental committee formed by the Departments of Justice and Foreign Affairs has completed its final report.  I approve fully of what this Bill purports to do, but I would suggest that time be given for the Department to bring forward legislation based on the report it has prepared.  Otherwise, we jump the gun on our own procedures and that would result in anarchy.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business the legislative programme was called for.  The Programme for a Partnership Government answers that.  We have a job to do, which includes introducing legislation to deal with this matter.  I propose, in fairness to Senator Neville, that the Order Paper be left as it is until the Department finalises its draft, as long as the Minister undertakes to do that as soon as possible, and I mean as soon as possible.  I want this matter tackled urgently but I want it done properly and comprehensively.  The <Col N="338" /> matter lies in the hands of the Minister and I urge her to take immediate action.</P>

      <P>I am glad Senator Neville has once again prompted the House in the appropriate direction.  It is interesting that on a number of occasions such a move has originated in this House.  I am thinking particularly of Senator Neville's Suicide Bill which was whipped away from this House and introduced into the Dáil and the Bill proposed by Senator Ross to abolish capital punishment.</P>
      <P>I would like to comment on the contribution by Senator Gallagher.  With regard to Bosnia, we cannot really congratulate ourselves on that because the Bosnians were invited here and we set specific numbers.  It is not as if they just landed here and demanded asylum; if they had they would have got the bum's rush, as many other people did in the past.</P>

      <P>With regard to the 1937 Constitution, the Jewish people in Germany at that time would perhaps have thought there was a requirement for asylum for refugees.  One final point, and I do not want to be too critical, I was concerned when Senator Gallagher said that this matter was not the exclusive possession of Senator Neville.  Of course it is not, nobody suggested it was.  I would hate to think people became territorial about it, but it seems the Government has adopted a dog in the manger attitude&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and will not accept legislation except on its own basis.  I think that is a pity.  The Minister has a perfect opportunity to amend the Bill.  The Minister of State said it is not good enough because it does not include Articles 12 to 20.  The Minister has every opportunity to put down an amendment incorporating these provisions and strengthening the Bill, so that is no argument against it.</P>
      <P>I refer to the coded language in the Minister's speech.  He said:</P>
      <P>When Ireland acceded to the UN convention it was decided to implement it on an administrative rather than a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>We all know what that means: one can either do what one likes about it or ignore it totally.  The administrative way in which it has been applied in this country leaves a great deal to be desired.  The Minister said that he was unaware of any situation where human rights had been infringed.</P>

      <P>I am glad the service for refugees is going to be &ldquo;user friendly&rdquo; and that the Minister is not optimistic. I hope they will be user friendly; they certainly are not at the moment and there is no question about that.  On Monday night's &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; Deputy McManus said that dealing with the Aliens Office is like trying to get into Fort Knox and the same can be said of people who operate in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was happy with some of the points the Minister made.  Language skills and language facilities are a very important area, as is the commitment to the establishment of an independent review by a named judge.  That is an advance and <Col N="340" /> something concrete.  It is hopeful but there is not a firm commitment.  There is no mention of a date and nothing said about progress before Christmas.  I have seen this so many times before that I worry about whether this will happen, particularly when I see it said that more time is needed to ascertain what are the views of Amnesty International.  I know what they are and I am surprised that the Minister does not.  Those in the Visitor's Gallery know what they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>They know so firmly that they were nearly asked to leave for applauding when somebody attacked the Government for not introducing and supporting this Bill.  The Minister says that she agrees with the principle, so let her do something about it.</P>
      <P>I would like to give a couple of examples, some of which I was aware and some of which I was reminded of in a shoal of letters that arrived in the last couple of days from the Trinity College branch of Amnesty International.  I thank them for that.  They reminded me of the case of Ji Yao Lau, a Chinese student who was involved in the Tiananmen Square demonstration, who was put in prison for seven months until the case was reviewed by Mr. Justice Hamilton. Is the Minister satisfied with that little bit of administrative application of the law? That is administrative; that is what happens when you do not implement international law in the domestic law of the country.</P>
      <P>I remember the case of Marey Al Gutrani because I was in Cork for a number of the hearings.  It was made perfectly clear from the bench that, although the Irish people and the judge hearing the case might be sympathetic, as long as the conventions were not incorporated in Irish domestic law there was very little that could be done.  Is seven months in prison for exercising freedom of conscience in Tiananmen Square acceptable?  I do not believe for a minute that it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case of the Kurds at Shannon airport was reported both in the Irish and <Col N="341" /> British newspapers.  The report in <i>The Irish times</i> of 17 November 1992 is rather interesting.  Even on a human level I find it fascinating that the newspaper was telephoned by an employee of Aer Rianta. That is not somebody who is automatically associated with a pressure group or lobby group; it is a human being who saw something so distressing that he took it upon himself to telephone the newspapers to express his disquiet.  The article states:</P>
    <P>An employee of Aer Rianta telephoned <i>The Irish Times</i> last night to object about the incident involving the Kurds.  He said that he and other Aer Rianta workers were &ldquo;very, very upset&rdquo; and shocked at the way they had been treated.</P>
    <P>Apparently the duty-free area of Shannon airport was cordoned off for seven hours as 27 Turkish Kurds refused to reboard an Aeroflot aircraft.  The description in <i>The Observer</i> is more detailed and also more horrifying.  It states:</P>
    <P>Twenty seven Turkish Kurds who arrived at Shannon Airport seeking asylum were allegedly beaten by police and refused any opportunity to apply for asylum.</P>
    <P>They were denied the opportunity to apply for asylum.  We are required under international law to give them that but it was apparently refused in this instance.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that as an example of administrative implementation of human rights.  Some of the people were considerably distressed. The husband of one woman was alerted to the fact that they were landing in Shannon and had made the difficult journey from London at short notice.  He was allowed half an hour with his wife.</P>
    <P>There are more incidents which I could mention.  Marey Al Gutrani was a Libyan who had criticised Gadaffi and we were sending him back to a country where there is capital punishment.  We have abolished it here.  Are we happy to wash our hands and send him back to a country where he may be executed?  I am sorry <Col N="342" /> there is not more time but I am happy to allow some to my good friend Senator Sherlock.</P>

      <P>What better place to have this motion debated than in this House of the Oireachtas?  If the Seanad agrees this motion, it will be very significant and show that the House has a meaningful role to play and is sincere about what it is doing rather than engaging in the empty rhetoric which we have heard on this vital issue.</P>
      <P>I am critical of the failure of the Government to introduce promised legislation to provide legal rights for refugees and asylum seekers.  If the Irish illegals in the United States were treated in the same manner as illegal aliens and asylum seekers in this country, it would create outrage amongst the Irish people.</P>
      <P>I call for a total review of Government policies and particularly for the introduction of legislative guarantees to ensure that nobody is deported without a judicial hearing at which the person is legally represented and allowed to make a case against any deportation order. Irish people have been rightly proud of the steps taken to cater for Bosnian refugees. However, individual asylum seekers or those who find themselves in this country without proper documentation are treated very differently.  This is especially so if their skin happens to be any colour other than white.</P>
      <P>At present, people in this situation can be arrested and held in custody pending deportation with no entitlement to legal aid or advice and there is no automatic right to judicial review.  If the person is aware of their rights or has contacts here, legal proceedings can be initiated. However, those whose deportation is sought often do not have contacts or knowledge of our legal system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the case of the Liberian nationals in Shannon.  Mr. Doe, for instance, arrived in Ireland on 25 June 1991 and spent almost 18 months in custody. He was taken from Shannon Airport and, after a brief interview with a garda sergeant, placed in Limerick prison pending an investigation of his case.  The <Col N="343" /> Department of Justice informed him that he was to be deported a week later and this only failed because of the refusal of an airline pilot to take him on board a flight back to Jamaica.</P>
    <P>I am sceptical about the capacity of the alien section of the Department of Justice, dominated as it is by a policing approach, to adapt to the more humane standards needed for dealing with refugees in the modern world.  We must ensure that nobody is deported without a proper judicial hearing at which the person would be legally represented and allowed to make their case.  Persons should not have to be held in custody pending such a hearing.  In the longer term, there may well be a case for taking these functions away from the Department of Justice and establishing an independent office which would be responsible for processing applications for asylum or citizenship, a sort of ombudsman for refugees.</P>
    <P>In 1990 there were an estimated 400,000 asylum seekers in Europe.  Some 62 of them applied to Ireland; one was granted.  In 1991 just one of 31 applications succeeded.  In 1992 three out of 39 were successful and in 1993, as was mentioned, three out of 65.  This is not a record which provides any grounds for satisfaction.  Countries which face far greater political and economic problems than Ireland have a superior record.  I support the motion and I ask the House to do likewise.</P>

      <P>In addressing this debate I am influenced by two personal experiences: one somewhat distant and the other very immediate and moving. The first occurred some years ago when, in the Bahamas, I met a Haitian who was being deported because his status as a refugee in the Bahamas was terminated. <Col N="344" /> I can never forget the fear and dread in that man's eyes.  He was being deported to a regime that was and still is known throughout the world as being repressive beyond any human standard; he was only one of countless thousands who were being subjected to that same fear and repression.</P>
      <P>The other experience is very immediate. I turned on the television news when I was preparing for this debate and I wish to give the House a flavour of what is now the pattern of suffering, horror and inhumanity across the world.  Today in Burundi children have been burnt alive. There is a political repression of a kind that is impossible for us, in the cosy comfort of the Upper House, to understand. It is equally impossible for interdepartmental committees, in their detached atmosphere, to understand. Angola is a scene of horror and repression beyond anything we would tolerate.  In Bosnia children are being slaughtered every day because of the inadequacy of the United Nations, the European Community, the family of nations and the political consensus which should rebel and say this is intolerable. Our people every day see mothers, with young children strapped on their backs, slaughtered and children decimated.  This is happening even as we address this issue in the Seanad.  It is on our screens today; the reality of what is happening out there is much worse, more intolerable and less acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Normally I would be reasonably reassured that we are adhering to the standards of the United Nations and the UNHCR.  However, when I look at the failure of the United Nations &mdash; and I am not blaming the United Nations as such but its members &mdash; to address issues of this nature I believe there is a chance for us now, more than ever, to break out of the shell, to be ahead of the rest and to take action that will demonstrate that we, at least, share that sense of pain and suffering that has been imposed on so many countless millions.  It happened in Tiananmen Square and it happened in the Soviet Union at a time when some did not want to know or pretend it could <Col N="345" /> happen among brother socialists.  It did happen however, and now we know the full story.  For that reason I believe the sense of urgency that is coming across in this debate is well timed.</P>
    <P>I know from my experience in Government that it is necessary to have these things studied and properly implemented. Nevertheless, if nothing more comes through to those in the interdepartmental committee who are studying this matter &mdash; and interdepartmental committees are a feature of Government at all times &mdash; they will get a clear signal from this House that we regard this as a matter of the most fundamental urgency.</P>
    <P>The legislation they produce may be flawed but no legislation introduced in the Oireachtas in my 27 years experience has ever been perfect.  I know that Senator Neville's legislation has flaws, and he would recognise that but I do not think that would justify us saying that this legislation should not pass.  The legislation the Minister will introduce &mdash; as is my hope and expectation &mdash; will also have flaws, no matter how much thought is given to it.  The Minister of State has indicated that the legislation will be introduced soon and he means what he says. I hope it will be introduced before Christmas.  We have seen a speedy response to Senator Neville's initiative with regard to the Suicide Bill.  I think even Senator Neville was surprised at the speed of that response and I hope we will get the same type of response now.</P>
    <P>Our response to other groups in crises, for example, the boat people with whom I was involved, may compare with the best in the world in many ways but, because of the level of repression and inhumanity that is a pattern in life today and because of the failure of the United Nations and other bodies, we are facing a more obvious degree of urgency now than ever before.</P>
    <P>Although I knew David Owen well, I was never convinced of his capacity to deal with major issues, such as the emerging independence of Zimbabwe as it became known, and in Dublin two days ago he advised that we might have to suspend aid to Bosnia and the former <Col N="346" /> Yugoslavia because it is falling into the wrong hands.  If that is not an admission of the inadequacy and failure of the nations which sent him there &mdash; I do not mean this personally &mdash; then I cannot think what is.  If we suspend aid because we cannot prevent those tyrants and warlords from using it for their own purposes while they slaughter the innocent and the young, then it is a terrible indictment of the world in which we live.</P>
    <P>This debate has given us an opportunity to express our impatience with the present situation and our determination to do something sooner rather than later. I am sorry the Minister could not be here as I know she has a commitment to this area, but I am happy the Minister for State is here.  I and other Members will be impatient for action.  I hope the interdepartmental committee will not operate like similar committees because one can spend all one's time consulting.  It is time the results of its consultations were brought before the House, and I hope that will be before Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Not long ago a committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas considered whether we needed some system of administrative justice in the considerations that led to the creation of the Office of the Ombudsman.  At that time the people who represented both Houses were happy that this area could be left to the administrators in our Aliens and Immigration Service.  Things have progressed in the ten years since then.</P>
      <P>At that time I made a submission arguing that our laws in this area are fundamentally racist.  They are not secretly racist; they are openly racist because, as one Senator said earlier, if a person is not white he or she has a difficult time at our borders.  This Bill was introduced in the other House by Deputy Shatter.  It was a good and timely motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made submissions on a number of occasions in the last 14 years about the need for change in this area.  It is a matter of public record that I believe our laws are seriously deficient and do us no service. Our aliens service operates to prevent Ireland becoming a back door to <Col N="347" /> Britain, so we are effectively operating British colonial racist policies which do us no credit.  It is about time we stopped.</P>
    <P>Like Senator O'Kennedy, whom I thank for sharing his time with me, I too will be impatient.  Something good has been done here tonight because we have given a very clear signal, as was given on the last occasion in the other House, to our administrators in this area, that we are not satisfied with what is happening. It reflects no credit on the Irish people.  I await with impatience the introduction of the Minister's Bill in this House in December.  I wonder why we always have to introduce the laws on the Government side.  Why can we not transcend party politics on an issue like this?  If this legislation does not appear in the very near future I expect we will debate this issue again in the Seanad.  I expect progress on this issue in this House because I, like other Members read those reports and I feel ashamed to be Irish.</P>
    <P>I too had a personal experience.  Many years ago in the dying days of the Brezhnev regime in the Soviet Union, I took a group of third commerce students from UCD there and we spent two very memorable weeks travelling around and at the end of that period, one of those people came to us and said she was about to travel to Cuba, and she was contemplating leaving the aeroplane in Shannon. I had to point out that if she did there was nothing more certain than that we would put her on another plane and return her to Moscow.  I remember, like Senator O'Kennedy, the feeling of self loathing I had at that time.  I wrote during the time of the Oireachtas all-party committee suggesting that this was an area where we should have Ombudsman oversight. I submitted articles and they were published, in fact they were cited in this House by Senators from both sides when the Ombudsman legislation was going through.  We need urgent action here.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this Bill and compliment Senator Neville for introducing it and Deputy Shatter for introducing <Col N="348" /> it in the lower House.  I am glad to hear that there is so much support for this Bill on the floor of the House from all sides including the Government parties. The onus is now on the Government parties to accept that they have an opportunity here of showing their goodwill by not challenging this Bill to a vote this evening.  It is important that the work done by the Opposition be recognised and that the usefulness of the Seanad be recognised in allowing Second Stage to be read here tonight.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have an opportunity at a future date to table amendments and I am sure Senator Neville will agree that this Bill is not perfect, nor does he claim it to be perfect.  He will be open to taking a variety of amendments on Committee Stage and as the Minister is well in advance at the moment in relation to a draft Bill, surely by the time this comes to Committee Stage that Bill will be drafted and she will be in a position to change the sections that do not comply with her Bill by proposing amendments to Senator Neville's Bill.  I suggest that the Government take that course of action.</P>
      <P>I hope that Senators, in particular Senator O'Kennedy, as they go through the lobbies tonight, will think of the fear and dread that he spoke of in the eyes of the refugees as they were being put back on a plane.  We must recognise, for a country that supposedly lays such emphasis on the right to life, that tonight in many cases we are deciding on the refugees' right to life on their return to their own country.  That fundamental issue must be addressed and I hope people will think of that when they are making their decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why there are so many complications in relation to accepting the Bill.  The UN convention is in place for a number of years.  There have been various amendments to it, the last in 1985.  The whole framework is in place, it is only a matter of getting it into the form of legislation.  I appeal to the Government to accept the goodwill of the Opposition in tabling this Bill, a Bill that is addressing a fundamental issue of human rights.  I disagree with speakers <Col N="349" /> who have said that we have a good record in relation to the issue of refugees here in Ireland.  Over the past four years over 156 people sought refugee status and only three were granted it.  That is a very small proportion.</P>
    <P>I am familiar with many of the cases that have been mentioned here tonight because most of them arrived into Shannon airport, mostly off flights transiting through Shannon airport.  They arrive and get off the plane and they refuse to get back on.  In many cases huge questions have been raised in relation to the tactics adopted.  First, the facilities in the airport are totally unsuitable for provision of the basic humanitarian needs dealt with in the Geneva Convention. There is no proper facility in the airport or in Shannon Garda station for dealing with the refugees.  Most of them arrive jetlagged and exhausted.  Most of them are unable to speak English.  They are coming usually from a system where they are totally suspicious of any officialdom. Proper facilities should be in place to deal with them and afford them every possible opportunity to explain their case.</P>
    <P>I welcome a number of announcements made by the Minister tonight in relation to what has been done and what will be done by way of providing guidelines and training for our immigration officers. Unfortunately many of them have not actually been provided with this training. I do not blame them, I blame the Department. It has taken this issue as something not to be dealt with, something that does not really worry us too much.  Our fundamental objective in dealing with many of the refugees is to send them to some other airport off our shores.  That is the reality, I am aware of it myself.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the Kurds who arrived in Shannon airport.  I was in Shannon airport the evening the 24 Kurds refused to leave the airport.  I take this opportunity of complimenting Amnesty International.  I met a young man there who was involved in Amnesty International in Limerick, who did a great job on a voluntary basis and who was out there doing his level best to get around officialdom and to protect these people's <Col N="350" /> human rights.  The case has been gone through here this evening.  The situation that occurred was most unfortunate. More time should have been afforded and a completely different approach adopted.</P>
    <P>I have often had phone calls late at night and during the weekend from solicitors acting on behalf of individuals who have disembarked at Shannon.  This thing goes on and on.  Senator Neville here this evening is providing a statutory basis on which facilities can be provided.  The onus is on the Government to ensure that this Bill is accepted.  It would be most unfortunate if we adopted the tactic of brushing this under the carpet and saying that all the wisdom in regard to this issue is within the Departments of Justice and Foreign Affairs.  Every Member of this House has a wealth of experience in a variety of areas and are quite capable of putting together something of substance, as Senator Neville proved here this evening.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville and Fine Gael are more than prepared to accept amendments put forward by Government.  The Minister specifically refers to the omission of a section dealing with Articles 12 to 20 of the Geneva Convention in relation to the rights and entitlements of a person who has been given refugee status.  Senator Neville will deal with that issue and is prepared to take amendments. Many speakers have referred to making the Seanad relevant.  Here is an opportunity for the Government to show its genuine commitment to that by accepting this Bill this evening.  I hope that, while Senator Neville is concluding, the Minister will change his mind and advise the Leader of the House to accept the Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate and who agreed on both sides of the House with the thrust of the Bill.  I am disappointed that the Government will not accept the Bill, which is operable.  The issues as outlined in the various conventions are addressed in it.  The Minister states that Articles 12 to 20 of the Geneva Convention are not <Col N="351" /> included but I have no problem about accepting an amendment to include them or any other amendments.  No Bill, as Senator O'Kennedy said, is perfect. Amendments are accepted, for example, only last week in dealing with the Matrimonial Home Bill the Minister accepted a significant amendment from this side of the House and we thanked and congratulated him for that.  We ask him to do something similar tonight in accepting this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said he hoped to introduce a Bill before Christmas.  I hope he will.  I was promised in November 1991 that a Bill would be introduced if the Opposition withdrew its Bill.  It did so on the understanding that the then Minister for Justice would introduce a Bill decriminalising suicide before Christmas 1991.  I will not go through the various events but by April 1993, a year and a half later, the Bill had still not been introduced by the Minister.  In frustration, this side of the House reintroduced its Suicide Bill, 1993.  The result was that on the day we were to debate that Bill the Minister produced a Bill, a year and a half after we had obtained a commitment from the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke on a Bill.</P>
      <P>Now we are told that the Minister hopes to introduce a Bill before Christmas.  How can we have confidence that will happen?  We wait and hope that it will.  I assure the Minister of State that if he does not introduce a Bill we will handle it as we did before, reintroduce this Bill and again debate it.  I put the Government on notice that this will be our approach.  We have no confidence that he is prepared to introduce a Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State talked about interdepartmental committees and interim reports and said that a Bill should not be rushed.  Let us look at the history of this Bill and the issue of trying to get legislation through to ensure that refugees are properly protected.  This legislative procedure started in March 1993 when Deputy Shatter produced a Bill. He gave the Government two months to respond or to produce their own Bill and <Col N="352" /> nothing happened.  Even in May 1993 the Minister for Justice would not give a commitment that she would introduce a Bill.  She said it was unnecessary and the Bill was voted out.  At the end of June 1993 I published a Private Members' Bill in the Seanad similar to Deputy Shatter's Bill.  We heard that legislation might be produced and now we are told that legislation will be produced.  The Minister and the Department have had more than adequate time since last March to produce legislation it they had wanted it. We delayed the introduction of this Bill from last June as we hoped the Minister would introduce legislation but we have no confidence that will happen.</P>
    <P>This is the typical approach to Private Members' Bills.  The Government does not accept anything from the Opposition, as if it is incapable of producing anything worthwhile.  The Government will vote it down and the excuse given will be that legislation is being prepared.  Many people said that this Bill is signposting legislation to come.  We hope it is but we are not convinced.  The Minister said that the present procedure is adequate and working well.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Norris, in my introduction I gave examples of problems which have arisen.  I would like to give another example &mdash; in which Senator Norris was directly involved &mdash; of the case of Mr. Marey Al Gutrani, a Libyan national who left Libya because he would have been conscripted by Colonel Gadaffi to fight in the war in Chad.  He fled the country because he did not wish to fight and it was obvious that if he returned he would be dealt with severely by the establishment there.  He was arrested by the police in this country in 1991, sent to Mountjoy Prison and then to Wheatfield Prison for 18 months where he was placed with sex offenders who beat him up and abused him because he was different.</P>
    <P>He was treated disgracefully, eventually a solicitor took his case to the High Court and he was released.  It was the view of the judge that his continued incarceration was unreasonable, unfair and unjust.  During the period he was incarcerated an attempt was made to deport <Col N="353" /> him.  He was taken to Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, in a State car with his hands and feet tied.  If the US Government did that to illegal Irish immigrants in the US we would parade and demonstrate outside the US embassy and there would be fears for the safety of the people inside.</P>
    <P>Senator Crowley said this was an important Bill which heralded future legislation.  Although I hope we will have a change of mind on the vote this evening, realistically I do not believe we will. Senator Crowley should ensure that his party is as supportive of this as the Labour Party &mdash; although it does not seem to have the courage of its convictions on this matter unlike the Progressive Democrats in the previous Government when they forced two Private Members' Bills to be accepted in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Senator Crowley has concerns about information being given which impinges on security.  In natural justice if a decision is taken against anybody he or she should know why it has been taken and given the full facts to introduce counter arguments or even be satisfied that the decision was just and fair in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I was impressed with Senator O'Kennedy's contribution.  I hope the House takes note of it and supports our Bill. The Minister said he wished to have the full views of Amnesty International.  In fairness, the Seanad has the views of Amnesty International through the Trinity College branch which I congratulate for its campaign, not alone for the Bill in this House and in the other House, but generally for endeavouring to bring about this legislation.  If it does come about eventually &mdash; I hope before Christmas &mdash; it can take a lot of the credit for ensuring that people are made aware of the difficulties and support those who are anxious that the situation is changed.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that we will be putting this to a division.  We hope we have convinced the other side of the House they should support the Bill.  If they do we will be happy to accept amendments and ensure that the legislation is improved but if the Minister votes this out I reiterate that we will not walk away from it.  At the appropriate time, under Standing Orders, we will reintroduce a similar Bill and we will not stop until basic human rights legislation is introduced.  All one has to do if one wants advice on this is to look at the United Nations convention, the Protocol to the convention and the Geneva convention to see how this situation should be handled.  We do not need interdepartmental committees and interim reports to outline this &mdash; it is in black and white in those conventions.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 16 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be useful to have an indication of the Government's proposed dividend policy regarding this semi-State body.  As the Minister knows, there has been an anomaly in relation to Telecom Éireann in recent times in that they declared profits but decided against paying a dividend because of the high borrowing level.  Without giving any figures the Minister anticipates there will be dividends from this new company but he does not give us an indication of the criteria which will be used.  It might be helpful in teasing out the attitude of Government to State-sponsored bodies and to dividends if he could at least tell us what yardsticks are to be used.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough to say that some years will show a profit and some a loss and that it will depend on various factors. Will he say what multiple of earnings or return on assets would determine the issue?  What will be the price to earnings ratio?  How many times will the dividend need to be covered by earnings if the Government will require a dividend from this company?</P>
      <P>There is a danger the company will borrow £100 million and then another £15 million from the Minister for Finance so it may borrow £115 million without any great difficulties.  It may be in debt to this extent, have spent the money on justifiable capital expenditure and report profits of £5 million to £6 million, perhaps more.  Will the Minister then take the attitude, as has been done in the case of Telecom Éireann, that the Government does not require a dividend because it is more in the interests of the company that the debt be paid?</P>
      <P>Government policy on the payment of dividends by semi-State bodies seems to change from year to year.  Last year when Telecom Éireann's debt was £998 million the Government made it pay a dividend. This year when the debt is similar or identical the Government has decided not to require a dividend.  We should know what projections the Government has for this company, what profits it projects for it and what return it expects on the money borrowed and on capital employed.  Perhaps the Minister could also give a forecast of future profits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great interest to Senator Ross.  I gave a long dissertation in response to this section earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within international regulations this company should not be making a profit on its core business.  It is supposed to provide a service to the users on a cost recovery basis.  We are commercialising the company to give it opportunities in <Col N="357" /> ancillary services, mostly training and consultancy.  We must give the company some breathing space.  We will be putting in position a solid professional board, giving the company a commercial mandate and the board a commercial brief with good management and committed staff in the organisation.  We will be taking sound financial advice from professional consultants and others <i>vis-à-vis</i> the future development of the company.</P>
    <P>At this stage it would not be possible to say what dividend might be returned by a new company being established to provide this service which has certain international parameters.  We expect that it will return a modest profit.  We would expect it to make a modest contribution in its earlier years but we must give it up to three years to establish itself and, over that period, to have clear criteria through which to make a contribution to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>Senator Ross, we have had a long debate on section 16 and on section 7.  Perhaps we can try to clear the section as quickly as possible.  Have you a further query to the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I have.  I can understand the Minister wanting to give what he claims is a breathing space.  Presumably any new company, setting up as this one is, has a budget, forecasts and projections.  If it is projecting that it will not make any money in the first three years, fair enough.  That is normal in many companies setting up, but can we not hear the projections?  We are being asked to take this completely on assurance.  This company in its old form reported profits and apparently now the Minister is unable to tell us whether it will go in its new form into losses or profits.  Any company in the private sector which went to a bank looking for money &mdash; and this is what in effect this particular company is doing &mdash; and said it did not have any forecasts, did not know whether it would make profits and wanted a breathing space, would be laughed out of court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody will necessarily hold the Minister to it but we want detailed profit or <Col N="358" /> loss and expenditure projections in its first few years.  That is a perfectly reasonable request for the Minister to answer when he is asking the House to authorise guaranteed loans of £80 million.  He is not providing us with any information about the other side.  If the Minister came before the House and said they were expecting to lose £10 million in the first year, £5 million in the second, nothing in the third and move into profit in the fourth, fifth and sixth years, I would not accept it as a reasonable proposition but at least we would know where we stand. At the moment we are being asked at one level to give authority for exorbitant loans without being told if this company will go into profit at all, or if it goes into profit what will happen, or whether it will be in loss and if so, why.  It is totally unreasonable for anybody to come before this House and expect us to give a blank cheque for the Exchequer to guarantee loans.  It is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not come into this House and ask the Legislature to effect a decision and transform a Civil Service organisation into a semi-State commercial body that would create an imposition on the taxpayer.  We have done analysis and looked at the past performance of ANSO.  We have done projections for the future and I am happy to say that based on the performance last year, and the years before, we expect to make, on average, £1.95 million at the end of this year to about £2.5 million profit by the end of 1996 and I am optimistic that we can deliver.  I believe we are making a major transformation and the company is entitled to an opportunity to perform.  I am confident it will make a return to the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very satisfactory and I am grateful for the information.  It may not be correct to raise this under this section but could the Minister be as specific as possible about the purpose for which the loans will be used?  Perhaps that comes under a separate section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this point in error earlier.  Could the Minister explain the system of rotation of directors in subsections (2) (c) (ii) and (2) (d), &ldquo;the directors may act notwithstanding one or more vacancies in their number&rdquo;?  There have been occasions in the past where some boards of semi-State bodies have taken decisions that have been subsequently questioned by the Minister &mdash; for example, where an alleged cabal has operated within the board of directors or there was a very powerful chairman.  Is the Minister satisfied that safeguards are in place, notwithstanding subsection (2) (d)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 17 (h) illustrates Senator Ross' point.  Under this section the Minister appears to be giving wide ranging powers to this committee and its subcommittees to raise funds for various functions which are covered in the memorandum of association.  I agree with Senator Ross and I oppose giving such powers to the committee.</P>
      <P>Under section 17 (2) (a) the number of directors to be appointed shall be nine and the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts should be on that board. As public representatives we have no rights when it comes to any State-sponsored bodies or boards.  How can this be when we are elected to the Dáil and Seanad and are answerable to the people? I propose that the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts should be on the board.  I also suggest to the Minister that the employees should have a say in who is on the board and they should have their own representative on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the line promoted by Senator Burke in relation <Col N="360" /> to the appointment of the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts to the board of directors of the new body. Senator Burke correctly said that there is a lack of accountability by semi-State organisations to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If there were more accountability and more powers within the Oireachtas to scrutinise semi-State operations there would be fewer problems in that sector.  One of the deficiencies of semi-State operations is not the extensive powers vested in them by these Houses but their lack of accountability.  It is important that an initiative be taken in this new semi-State organisation and that there be accountability to these Houses through the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We will be tabling an amendment on Report Stage to include the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts as a director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be my great desire to be in a position to appoint the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts to a State board.  From my information it seems that under the regulations for membership of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann a Member of the Legislature cannot be a member of a semi-State body or a director thereof. There would be conflict between the legislative position, where we represent the common good, as distinct from the particular interest that a member of a board would have in pursuing the good of the company.  I know of cases in the past where people were members of State boards, were elected to the Oireachtas and automatically had to resign their membership of the State board.  I am almost certain it is included in the regulations for membership of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a review of semi-State bodies last year when the Minister for Finance issued strict guidelines to the chairmen on the boards and Government Departments involved with State bodies &mdash; my own Department has responsibility for many semi-State organisations.  This new system, which has not been used since the Central Bank Act, 1940, is a <Col N="361" /> good one.  We believe this because we have looked at it and the existing composition and structure for other semi-State bodies.  It maintains an experienced board in office, brings in fresh thinking and allows it to make decisions for the company at all times.  The whole board will not leave office at any time unless a serious situation arises and one will have that continuity of commitment, application and decision making, coupled with fresh thinking on the board.  The thrust of the section is that members of the board would not end their term in office on the same day.  If this were to happen and the Minister had not appointed their successors in time, the company would be left without a board and could not function properly.  It is a new and welcome departure, it will maintain continuity and bring about fresh thinking on the board at all times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister's comments with regard to two points.  I understand the reason behind the spread out term of office for board members which was well explained by the Minister. I also support the view that Members of both Houses should not be on State boards.  The Minister may not be correct in saying that the barring of Members from these boards is part of the rules governing the Oireachtas, but it is part of the rules governing each State company. It is a good rule because if a State company is to work with independence and freedom, it should be able to work independently, and to make its decisions and not have to report back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>What Senator Quinn has said is fair enough, but the advantage of having Members of the Dáil and the Seanad on semi-State boards is that they are far more accountable than these boards are at present.  What worries me &mdash; I mentioned this on Second Stage last week &mdash; is that there does not seem to be precautions or safeguards in this clause to protect us from the sort of disasters we experienced from these boards in the past.  It is easy to accept assurances here, but there is general public unease about <Col N="362" /> political appointments to State boards, not only because of the obvious political patronage involved and exposed in the past, but because in certain cases, people have been promoted regardless of their knowledge or expertise in the area.  If responsibility for the dreadful situation at Aer Lingus lies anywhere, it is with the board.  An examination of the board members would not reassure one into believing that they have expertise in the aviation area.  What worries me is that we will again have people on this board, sitting in judgment on matters about which they are unqualified to speak or to make decisions on: that is the history of State boards.</P>
      <P>Last week, the Minister assured me that it would not happen in this case.  I welcome that assurance and the fact that it is on the record.  However, the Minister should have considered taking this body out of the political arena.  It is possible, as was shown in the Environmental Protection Agency, to devise a model which takes directorships and the office of the chief executive out of the Minister's hands because even if a good and impartial Minister is involved, he will still be open to the charge of political patronage, even if it is not true.  All parties have been guilty of this practice &mdash; I am not trying to score a political point against the Minister &mdash; and it should, and can, be removed from our political system. Will the Minister, when appointing the board and chief executive, consider following the Environmental Protection Agency model, which is a more reassuring one to the public, who are concerned about this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also worried about a repetition of the situation in Bord Telecom, where the board, after deciding to purchase the Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien site, seems to have gone to ground &mdash; it has disappeared.  Nobody seems to have been held accountable for that action.  I sit on the Oireachtas Joint Committee of Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies and that body, already referred to under this section, is inadequate.  It has no power to compel witnesses to come before it, it has issued multiple reports, which, up to <Col N="363" /> recently, have not been debated in either House.  The Minister must assure us that, under this section, the directors will be experts in their fields and be accountable. If we got that sort of assurance, I would be happy.  However, I would not be satisfied with a mere assurance &mdash; not that I doubt the Minister because he is a man of integrity, but his successors might not honour it.  As long as that power is there, the temptation for those with power to look after their friends and supporters by appointing them to State bodies as rewards will be too great, all Members know it happens.  Those who primarily suffer as a result are the taxpayer and the companies themselves, because some people on boards who know nothing about the matter in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of what Senator Ross has said is waffle and casts a slur on the many decent and honourable people who served on semi-State bodies since their foundation.  I suggest to Senator Ross that perhaps the main problem arose, not with the type, selection or number of those on semi-State bodies but on the flow of information, or absence of it, from the employees at higher management level, who took corporate decisions and subsequently informed their boards, who were left to clean up the mess.  The final arbiter is the Minister. Not only, as Senator Ross correctly pointed out, has the Minister the right to appoint, he also has the right to remove.</P>

I will recommend to the Government that those with a proven commercial track record, who have experience in various commercial activities who are competent, efficient and able would sit on the board.  I would like to see a good mix in it &mdash; people from the financial and travel industries and from other facets of business activity.  My colleagues and I will not appoint political hacks or friends to this board.  Board members will be carefully selected and I assure Senator McGennis that I too would like to see a gender balance.  Although I am not the final arbiter in this matter, I will do my best to ensure that a balance is maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply which was given with integrity and honesty.  I am worried, not by what the Minister said, but by what Senator Mooney said.  Senator Mooney has just exonerated &mdash; this is relevant to the section &mdash; the board of Aer Lingus.  If that is the Government's attitude to the boards of semi-State, we should not appoint a board.  If the Minister appoints a board of nine people and there is a catastrophe similar to that in Aer Lingus will he return to the House and, in the words of Senator Mooney, exonerate them?  The board of Aer Lingus is to blame for what happened in that company, it is ultimately responsible in this regard.  Perhaps this betrays the attitude of certain politicians, that the boards of semi-State bodies are basically stuffed dummies, they do not know what they <Col N="365" /> are talking about and they would not know a Boeing from a balloon.  If something goes wrong and they get into debt of £550 million, it is not their fault, it is the fault of the chief employees.  I never heard anything as fatuous.  If boards do not know what is going on we should not appoint a board.  The Minister must decide whether these boards are important and responsible or rubber-stamps. Boards must be fired if companies get into difficulties.  Senator Mooney's comment was highly irresponsible, but revealing.  I am sure the board of Aer Lingus would be delighted to hear it because that is not what Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said when she was Minister for Transport and Tourism.</P>

      <P>Regarding objective criteria, in Guinness, for example, you were appointed to the board if you were the son of the owner or the current MP.  That was the criteria and the system which Senator Ross has lauded from time to time in his article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  When Senator Ross refers to well run companies, he means companies where families are in positions of trust.  It is not possible to protect against mismanagement, fraud, etc., in the public or the private sector.  A Government can only take steps to ensure that the public purse is protected.  That is what we expect the Minister to do.  We do not not need lessons from the private sector.  Who was involved in the Telecom Éireann scam? Was it the public or the private sector?</P>

      <P>Regarding shares, on vesting day the company comes into possession of the assets.  Receipt of these assets are balanced in two ways, partly by issuing shares to the Minister and partly by the creation of a debt to the Minister.  We have not been told how many of these assets will be covered by the shares and how many will be covered by the debt.  For example, if assets totalled £100 million, equity could amount to £100, while the debt could total £99.9 million.  In other words, the company could be saddled with a considerable debt at the outset which could affect its ability to pay its way.  This is a stupid way to capitalise the company.  All the assets should be turned over to the company in return, exclusively, for shares.  We should not hang a burden of unnecessary debt round the neck of a new company like this.  I may have misunderstood it, that may not be the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State should get its rake-off in the proper commercial way, in a dividend on the basis of its shares which should reflect the profitability of the company, if there are no profits then the State gets nothing. If one takes the debt route the State gets an immediate and short term payoff. However, it is doing so at the expense of <Col N="368" /> the company's viability.  The debt burden is restricting the company's ability to grow and is an unnecessary added cost to the company.  One has to remember there are extra costs such as the cost of funding pensions.  I am not sure if we have covered that one.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a view that these new State companies are a bottomless pit, that one can keep loading them with costs which can then be recouped by charging more for the services they provide. That is the quick route, I suggest, towards pricing yourself out of business and I hope that will not happen here.  I know it may not be what is intended.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to Senator Quinn.  The effect of this section is that on vesting day the Minister will transfer to the company the property used by ANSO; mainly air traffic control equipment, other communications equipment, office machinery and supplies as well as some lands and buildings. The total value of what will be transferred will, as I mentioned earlier, be <i>circa</i> £30 million.  In return for that the Minister for Finance will get shares to an agreed value of approximately 15 per cent or £15 million.  There will be an agreed quantity of debt equal to another £15 million.  It will be a balanced situation.  The total value of the shares and debt will be equal to the value of the transferred property. If any land is transferred at a later date the company will issue debt to the Minister for Finance to the value of the land. We are giving assets, the assets have been paid for by the taxpayer from the Exchequer and, based on that, the company will write shares to the value of 50 per cent of that asset base.  It will borrow the balance of it, fund that and transfer same.</P>

      <P>The Minister says it is normal in legislation of this sort, but that <Col N="370" /> is not necessarily reassuring.  If the Minister does have power of this sort, which is considerable, it would be open to him or her to transfer that power to anybody. I cannot see why this particular power is not restricted in legislation.  Why is it not possible to say that these powers can only be transferred to principal officers or people of that level in the Department, or to lawyers?  Why is there no restriction in this legislation?  It is another blanket permission for the Minister to transfer these extremely important powers to anyone, whereas a restriction would be far more reassuring.  The Minister should not be defensive about this.  This is not a reflection on him, the Government or anybody else.  It is simply a matter of bad law to give blanket permission to Ministers, until kingdom come, to have powers of this sort which &mdash; perhaps in 20, 30 or 40 years &mdash; could be abused. That is really the importance of this section.  It is not relevant in the Minister's case but we are making legislation which will not be repealed in the next few years. Will the Minister state why, in legislation of this sort, there is not a greater restriction on the transfer of these powers?</P>

      <P>Senator Ross is technically correct in that the Minister for Finance can exercise his power absolutely and transfer those shares and powers of attorney to whosoever he sees fit.  Since the foundation of the State this has been done and there has never been any difficulty with it.  Over the last few years, where there were problems in various semi-State bodies, the Minister for Finance was able to send in very fine civil servants to represent him.  There is no point in giving the Minister political responsibility while at the same time tying one of his hands behind his back. In particular situations it may be necessary for the Minister to appoint a lawyer, financial consultant, economist or accountant to attend a meeting, and give him powers of attorney.  We must allow the Minister to have the flexibility, in any given situation, to do this in the best interests of exercising control and exploring the relevant information that may be <Col N="371" /> required to satisfy him, his Department, the Government and, indeed, Parliament that may ask certain questions.  We must give that flexibility to the Minister.  It has never been abused in the history of the State and I think it will be wisely used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 20, subsection (2), line 32, to delete &ldquo;£80 million&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£1&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is clear, it is to remove the power of the company to borrow under State guarantees.  We cannot have it both ways.  This is either a commercial company or it is not.  If it is commercial, even though it is owned by the State, it should borrow money in a commercial way on the backing of its assets and track record and the viability of its development proposals.  There seems to be a knee jerk reaction to State guarantees for companies like this &mdash; if it borrows let us guarantee it.</P>
      <P>There is a sloppy argument in favour of State guarantees which we have heard <i>ad nauseam</i> and no doubt will hear again today.  The argument is that State guarantees allow a State company to borrow more cheaply and therefore the State saves money which we all favour.  This argument is sloppy because it ignores reality.  If a company with a State guarantee seeks a loan the bank will roll out the red carpet.  We are used to banks doing this.  The bank is making a profit and the State is taking the risk.  The bank could not care about the State of the company or the viability of the proposition being put to it because the bank does not take a risk as long as there is a State guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is bad business for the State.  If companies like this had to borrow under normal criteria the banks would think carefully before parting with their money.  They would vet the proposition with great care.  That vetting would be a safeguard for us as taxpayers and for the State.  It would mean professionals would apply their slide rule to the borrowing proposal and if the sums did not add up they would reject it.  None of this happens when there is a State guarantee.  The only vetting is done by civil servants who, although they may have the best will in <Col N="374" /> the world, are not professionals in that area.  We are asking people to vet and approve proposals, some of them involving huge sums of money, who do not have the qualifications or business experience to do so.  This is mad; worse than that, it is a growing habit.</P>
    <P>Every Bill of this kind which has come before the House since I became a Member last February contained a provision for large State guarantees.  We should stop this madness.  We should stop creating new State guarantees and work instead at reducing and removing some of the borrowing powers under existing guarantees and force each State company to argue its case and have it vetted by the bank before it is given a loan.  In this way we will be safeguarded and somebody other than us will examine and make the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinn's amendment looks attractive on the surface.  In a normal commercial situation a company presents a proposal to a bank and pledges its property and assests as security against any loan.  If the bank approves the loan it does so on the basis that it can acquire the factory, equipment, stock and all other assests.  If the Irish Aviation Authority were to seek a loan of £50 million, what security could it provide?  It has navigation equipment in Dublin, Shannon, Cork and other airports.  How could the bank acquire these assets?  If the Authority defaulted on the loan the bank would not go to the airports to acquire them.  It will say to the Authority that unless it provides a guarantee it will not be given a loan because the bank will not be able to realise any assets the Authority may pledge.  We may or may not include such a guarantee in a Bill but we will have no choice but to provide it.  We all know AIB, the Bank of Ireland or any merchant bank will not go to Dublin Airport to acquire navigation equipment. The Government will have to bail out the bank.</P>

I am not just referring to financial safety.  Senator Magner's argument is a business one. I want to be sure the Authority does everything properly and that the safeguards mentioned in the Minister's Second Stage speech will be provided.  I do not think the banks would be the least bit concerned about the safety of passengers.  They are only concerned about the safety of their money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not all be for the board.  I support Senator Quinn's amendment because experience with State guarantees has been disastrous.  All that happens is that the boards and the executives regard it as free money but do not really worry about how it is going to be repaid.  I do not know what the semi-State debt is at the moment but it is phenomenal.  The reason it is so large is the State guarantees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the situation is worse than that because even if the money is not guaranteed, the banks regard is as guaranteed anyway.  That is the reality of the semi-State sector.  If the Government gives guarantees on £80 million and it does not give guarantee on another £20 million, in reality a banker will regard the £20 million as being guaranteed as well.  It does not matter whether it is guaranteed.  I do not know if the Minister of State is aware of this, but little of the £560 million owed by Aer Lingus &mdash; and I am sure it is nearly £600 million now <Col N="377" />&mdash; is State guaranteed; I think only £30 million or £40 million is State guaranteed. However, those who loaned money to Aer Lingus will regard it as being State guaranteed anyway.  The reality is that the State will pick up the tab whether it was State guaranteed or not.</P>
    <P>Our problem is not just the State guarantee, it is the borrowing of the semi-State sector, because the banks and the lenders regard it as being guaranteed one way or the other.  They regard a semi-State company as blue-chip.  That means the semi-State body can borrow at advantageous rates and with a certain reckless abandon.  I support what Senator Quinn says but I think we should be looking at borrowings in the semi-State sector altogether because the experience &mdash; £580 million for Aer Lingus and £900 million for Telecom &mdash; is disastrous.  In those cases nobody knows how any of that money is going to be repaid.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to look at the whole semi-State sector and say what the attitude of the board is going to be to borrowing.  There should be serious restrictions on the board rather than allowances and enabling legislation; guarantees should be given to stop the board borrowing money because experience &mdash; and as I am sure the Minister of State will not deny it &mdash; in this area is disastrous, and will be disastrous for the taxpayer in the long run.</P>

The question must be asked: would it not be better for the Minister to leave this entire operation under ANSO with direct State control, income going directly back to the State and the supervision of the Minister and the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, rather than giving it to a semi-State body, creating another layer of bureaucracy and giving extensive borrowing powers, as Senator Ross said, a gilt edged guarantee?  There are many semi-State bodies at this stage and I do not think the taxpayer can afford to take <Col N="378" /> another which has been given unlimited guarantees.  The Minister of State may say it is limited but Senator Ross has outlined clearly how that limit can fluctuate up rather than down.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn is tabling an amendment which is fundamental to what the Minister said on Second Stage, that is, that this being a commercially viable operation.  It would not necessarily have to be in profit at all times but it should be in a position to do so.  In section 17 the Minister empowers the company to set up subsidiaries to undertake various activities.  There are activities which the company will be able to undertake in the area of training and so on, which I suggested on Second Stage.  There are many opportunities for it to be commercial and to operate as a viable commercial entity independent of the State. It is time the Government addressed their thinking in relation to semi-State bodies and the level of guarantees which the taxpayer should be asked to give them. Senator Quinn's amendment deserves support and consideration.</P>

This suggestion is ludicrous. <Col N="379" /> When I applied for a telephone I had to wait four or five years.  The suggestion that we should have cut the ties and told the organisation to be in profit and to provide telephones without giving it a penny, is nonsense.  I do not know the purpose of this debate.

      <P>I listened with interest. If I was borrowing money for safety and commercial reasons I would be happy to do so.  Consequently, my defence by my colleagues is pretty good.  If the amendment was accepted it would remove the capacity of the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that include Senator Kelleher?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.  It would remove the capacity of the Minister for Finance to guarantee borrowing by the Authority.  This section gives the Minister for Finance the power to guarantee borrowings by the Irish Aviation Authority of up to £80 million.  I must emphasise that the Minister is enabled in legislation to give these guarantees, he is not obliged to give them.  With the Minister's guarantee the Authority will be able to borrow at a significantly cheaper interest rate.  I am sure I do not have to emphasise that lower interest rate payments will give the Authority a competitive edge in the international market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In setting both the borrowing figure at £100 million and the guaranteed figure at £80 million we took into account the Authority's potential future borrowing requirements.  Over the coming decade or so, the Authority's capital development programme will cost approximately £60 million at current prices.  Senators have argued that if the Authority is a good credit risk it will not need a ministerial guarantee of its borrowings and that if it is a bad credit risk it should not be borrowing at all, which would be <Col N="380" /> stagnation.  That would be ideal but we must be practical in a commercial world.</P>
    <P>Its initial borrowing requirements will be determined by the capitalisation for the Authority involving fixed and current assets of £30 million and by its working capital requirements.  Thus, the Authority which must be fully operational from vesting day will have a substantial initial borrowing requirement of a minimum of £10 million and a maximum of £20 million.  The absence of a ministerial guarantee, especially in the initial years would make it difficult, expensive and perhaps impossible for the Authority to engage essential borrowings.  As the House will appreciate, to accept Senator Quinn's amendment would strangle the Authority.  Therefore it cannot be accepted.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the wider concern about £100 million and the £80 million guarantee and the comparisons made with the projected capital programme of £60 million.  The next decade will see rapid and unprecedented changes in air navigation services.  Satellites, synthetic radar and advance computing techniques will revolutionise airspace and air traffic management.  We must be sure that the Authority has the expertise and the financial capacity to meet those challenges.</P>
    <P>I would like to give some figures for comparison purposes.  In Britain, the Civil Aviation Authority has a borrowing capacity of £500 million, all of which is guaranteed as most of the borrowings are made direct from the Exchequer through the public sector borrowing requirement. We have a large block of strategic airspace and we intend to ensure that we will always operate effectively and efficiently.</P>
    <P>To deprive or radically reduce the Authority's capacity to borrow or have those borrowings guaranteed would give a strong and incorrect signal to the international aviation community.  Depriving or reducing these limits would be equivalent to a supermarket chain signalling that it did not intend to defend its market share.</P>
    <P>For some years ANSO has had a commercial insurance policy worth $1 billion to protect the Exchequer in the event of <Col N="381" /> a catastrophic accident.  We hope, pray and plan that we will never have to call on that insurance cover.  However, simple prudence dictates that we should have it. Similarly in the case of the borrowing and guarantee limits, they may never be reached or required but we are putting them in place to demonstrate our determination and commitment in this area.</P>
    <P>It is clear on any commercial criterion that if one has assets, one pledges them. Projection and anticipated performance is shown and borrowings are divided. One has one's equity ratio, liquidity and reserves and guarantees are given.  Personal guarantees may be given in normal commercial life by directors of companies but they do not have to given by the State.</P>
    <P>It is different in the State sector but in the normal situation subsidiaries are established and corporate guarantees are given by the parent company against borrowings by subsidiaries.  It is a normal relationship in any corporate operation. In this case, we are removing the organisation from the Civil Service, asking it to have shares, giving it assets, equity and a normal commercial mandate.</P>
    <P>In order for it to perform, we must put it in an environment where it has the security of the State as it is being asked by the State, on behalf of the taxpayer, to perform in a commercial environment without the security of the State carrying its expenditure.  We must maintain the guarantee so that it is given a fair chance to compete in a difficult international environment and expand to contribute to the nation.</P>

      <P>This body, in keeping with other semi-State bodies, can borrow abroad and in foreign currencies.  I see no problem with that.  To restrict it to borrowing in the currency of the State would be wrong and could cause some sort of commercial paralysis.  However, I ask what freedoms will be given to this body to deal in these currencies when and where it feels it is necessary?</P>
      <P>I refer specifically to the problems encountered by some semi-State bodies during the devaluation crisis earlier this year.  They felt they were coming under strong pressure not to deal in certain currencies because it was deemed to be unpatriotic by various Ministers and members of the Government.  Due to the political pressure they felt was put on them not to deal in these currencies and not to move out of foreign currency debt into Irish debt, certain semi-State bodies were reluctant to do so and were stuck with a very inflated foreign currency debt.  This debt could easily have been avoided if they had taken the same decision as people in the commercial world to sell their foreign currency debt and convert it into Irish pounds.</P>
      <P>Will this semi-State body be able to deal in foreign currencies freely and on a purely commercial basis?  Will the Minister give me an assurance that they will not be subject to political pressures in their dealings with regard to foreign currency debt?</P>

      <P>I have spent 11 years in this political system and six years as a member of Government and I never heard of political pressure being applied <i>vis-à-vis</i> borrowings or borrowing in any particular currency.  We do not envisage that this Authority will have major external currency requirement borrowings. Many of the demands will be made in the domestic area.  At the moment, we have a facility for ANSO's requirements. Obviously many of them are met in Irish punts, sterling and French francs.  We do not see a major requirement in that area.</P>
      <P>We are fortunate that the Government in its wisdom established the National Treasury Management Agency.  We have, as Senator Ross knows, cashed in some of our foreign currency loans at particular times to the advantage of the Irish Exchequer, thus reducing the foreign debt and easing the pressure on the taxpayer caused by repayments.  The National Treasury Management Agency, in co-operation with the Department of Finance and the Central Bank, has done an excellent job.  I am confident that it will do a greater job in future years and, more particularly, continue to give relevant advice on all currency requirements for borrowing to various State bodies.</P>

      <P>The NTMA, supposedly an independent body was, at the time of devaluation, subject to a political decision not to devalue.  The NTMA, with the Central Bank and the Department of Finance, acted according to that political decision.  As a result, the NTMA was unable to make commercially sensible decisions.  It was hidebound in its currency dealings and decided that it <Col N="386" /> could not sell Irish currency for reasons which I understand perfectly.</P>

      <P>Telecom, which also has a huge foreign currency debt, lost an enormous amount of money as a result of being unable to transfer it into Irish currency debt at the time.  It was thus landed with an extra 10 per cent debt because, as a semi-State body, it felt political pressure not to transfer the foreign debt into Irish currency debt.</P>
      <P>That may or may not be the right thing to do.  However, the point is that if this body borrows in foreign currencies on the foreign exchange market for good commercial reasons and, because of a currency crisis in this country feels constrained to hold on to that foreign currency debt, it will not then be acting in a commercial manner.  Telecom's foreign currency debt went up by 10 per cent overnight as a result of political pressure in this area.  I do not wish to make a judgement on this.  The flaw here is that it may decide in a commercial environment and according to commercial criteria to borrow in foreign currency but when it wishes to reverse that decision it will feel constrained not to do so.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that there will be no political constraints on its foreign currency dealings because they have occurred in the past.</P>

      <P>I listened with great interest to Senator Ross and, with all due respect to him, he is external to the decisions taken during the currency crisis and devaluation.  He is mistaken if he thinks it was a political decision to arrive at a conclusion at a particular time.  The agreement was reached between the Central Bank, the National Treasury Management Agency and the Minister for Finance and the timing was political.  The judgement of the Government and of the Minister for Finance was that it should be done at a particular time.  There was a consensus and if we had not acted at that time and in that manner we would <Col N="387" /> have been in serious trouble and forced into a second devaluation.  Our decision has clearly been vindicated.  We have stabilised our borrowing and interest rates, we have allowed the economic environment to proceed on a solid commercial basis and economic development has not stagnated.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross should think again because he cannot, under any circumstances, compare the borrowings we will require for this company to a major currency crisis that affected the world. As a small nation we held our own.  We stayed in the EMS and the great United Kingdom had to bow out.  We have been vindicated in the manner that decision was made.  It is a vindication of the ability of the Minister for Finance, with the support of the Government, to time the execution of that decision perfectly.</P>
      <P>Over 80 per cent of our revenues is in foreign currency.  Apart from that, we do not expect to deal in a major way in foreign currency exposure on borrowing. Any exposure will be alleviated by its revenues being in foreign currency, as Senator Ross accepts.  The National Treasury Management Agency is an independent body but it is there to advise the Government and agencies of Government on what is appropriate at any particular time.  Its services will be available and called on if necessary.</P>

My point was that if we had not executed it at a particular time we would have been forced to devalue again but the political wisdom, holding firm until the right moment, has been clearly vindicated.  By making the decision at the right time we did not expose the Exchequer or our currency to further impositions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 22, subsection (2), line 50, after &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;within 4 months of the end of the relevant financial year&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is related to the following section which is concerned with the annual report.</P>
      <P>I want to ensure a system of reporting in line with normal commercial practice and which subjects the company to the same constraints, pressures and disciplines placed on a company in the private sector.  Time is of the essence in company reporting and stock exchanges around the world have strict deadlines within which they expect companies to report.  They know that things can go wrong very quickly and if problems can be corrected the sooner that is done the better.</P>
      <P>We must send a clear signal in the company report that results are quickly notified.  We also must send a clear signal to the sponsoring Department to publish the reports immediately.  That is why the time limit specified in this amendment applies not just to the company reporting but to the entire process of getting it to the Oireachtas.  In the past, Departments have sat for months, sometimes for years, before publishing a report from a State body under its tutelage.  That is bad practice against which we should legislate. Annual accounts should be published immediately.  There is nothing for the Department to do but pass them along, that is the reason for substituting the four months at the end of the financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to talk about the other two amendments.  Their purpose is to reduce the delay before publication of the annual report.  I commend the Minister for having a time limit in this Bill, that has not always been done and is a welcome step forward.  It is the first time it has been in a Bill since I came into the House and I am delighted to see it.  I will be magnanimous in my welcome and will not refer to the objections to my suggestions <Col N="390" /> about incorporating such provisions in earlier Bills this year.</P>
    <P>Since we are providing a time limit, let us do it right.  Time is of the essence in reporting and the nine months proposed here is too long.  The world can change in nine months, the timescale I suggest is just enough to do the job properly but it is also the outer limit of delay at which the report can be really useful.  We need State companies to report in this time if the annual reports are not to be history books.  I am glad Senator Lee is not here because the last time I referred to something being history because it was delayed he seemed to take it as a reflection on history and, as a professor of history he was upset.  I do not suggest that there is anything wrong with reading reports as history but I know from my experience as chairman of An Post that it is possible to report very quickly.  We set very short time-scales for that.  You have to put your mind to it, if you want to create obstacles you can talk about the difficulty of getting the audit done and the problems it creates for staff, but if you want to do it you just do it.  We should show our willingness to do it by writing it into legislation.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to put the seal of quality on this section by getting the timing right.  There are three different amendments, all with the same objective, of getting any new organisation to report to its Government Department within three months, to have that Department report within a month to the Houses of the Oireachtas and to publish it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Quinn. Six months is far too long and when six months is coupled with the three month period before the report is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas there is a time lag of nearly 12 months.  I welcome the fact that the Minister set a time limit, at least, as Senator Quinn said, it is one step forward.  While it is very welcome we agree with Senator Quinn's proposed time limits of four months and one month.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinn's proposals make sense because, as he said, <Col N="391" /> the only value such reports have is when they are relevant and action can be taken. We have already discussed some of the gaps in regard to State companies.  I cannot support the amendment, but the unit within the Department should take its thrust on board and put pressure on to get reports within Senator Quinn's timeframe.  If that does not happen, the Government should come back with an amendment and make them do it.  That is a job for the unit within the department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for acknowledging that we have put in a time limit for reporting back.  As far as we are aware, it is the first time this has been done.  I am responding to amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 5.  The effect of the amendment to section 30 would be to require the Minister to lay the Authority's accounts before the Houses of the Oireachtas within six months of the end of the financial year to which the accounts relate.  I agree it is important that the Oireachtas should receive the accounts of semi-State bodies in good time.  It would not be appropriate to fix a time limit within which this must be done.  The Minister cannot lay the accounts before the Oireachtas until he has received the full, final, audited accounts.  For example, if there was a delay in completing the audit, which would not necessarily reflect on the performance of the Authority, the Minister could not comply with the requirement.  It would be inappropriate to impose on the Minister an obligation which it might not be within his power to meet.  However, I assure the House that there will be no undue delay in providing the accounts of the Authority to the House, which will normally be published with the Authority's annual report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 31 requires that the annual report be supplied to the Minister within six months of the end of the financial year and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas within three months.  These are maximum time limits and the accounts will normally be available at the same time.  Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 <Col N="392" /> would make the Authority supply its annual report to the Minister within three months and lay it before the Oireachtas within one month of receiving it.  While I deplore any delay in providing the information, six months is a more reasonable time limit for the production of the Authority's annual report, particularly if it is to contain audited financial information. An unduly short time limit might hamper the Authority in producing its annual report.  It would be preferable for the House to receive full information within six months rather than sketchy information within three months.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 would oblige the Minister to lay the annual report before the Oireachtas within one month of receiving it rather than three months, as is in the Bill.  Three months is a more reasonable time limit.  The Minister and his advisers will need to consider the report and may require additional information to be included in it.  This would take some time and a one month time limit would be unduly restrictive.</P>
    <P>I take Senator Magner's point that the unit in the Department would look at these accounts and this report, analyse it and make an internal report to the Minister who, in turn, may seek further information and clarification before he finally lays the reports before the Oireachtas for final consideration.  It is important to have put in the limits for the first time and it is important that we give that time to maximise the opportunity for the Department and the Minister to scrutinise the accounts and the report in detail so that when it comes before the Oireachtas, the Minister has all the information it may require.</P>

      <P>I will not press the amendment on the basis of what the Minister said.  He pointed out that it is a first step forward, I appreciate and recognise that fact.  However, I do not accept his general points and I will continue to urge that in all similar legislation we arrive at the same standards that have to be adhered to in the case of stock market quoted companies.  They are the standards expected, they have to be audited and <Col N="393" /> published within that time.  Therefore, we should aim at that and I appreciate the Minister's first step in that direction.</P>

      <P>I may be wrong but the period of three years seems to be a very long period to allow for the compilation of a report on technical and safety standards. I assume that safety standards are regularly monitored on a normal basis and that there is a daily check.  Something as important as safety standards, and Senator McGennis who is concerned with safety would, I am sure, endorse this, should be scrutinised and reported on every three or four months.  Unless there are stringent controls on a daily basis this report should be issued far more regularly.  I do not understand the thinking behind it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ross in relation to this section.  I raised this matter on Second Stage.  Three years is a very long time before a report is made specifically to the Minister in relation to safety standards.  I thought the Minister at this point might be able to come back and change that to six months or three or four months, as Senator Ross said.  We are talking here about something fundamental and although the section does provide the Minister with the power to send somebody to carry out a check within a three year period from the date of vesting, that is a long time in regard to safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One is familiar with and aware of the difficulties that can arise with technical <Col N="394" /> equipment, which can quickly become obsolete, and needs close monitoring.  It is unwise for the Minister to allow this to be removed completely from his and his Department's control without more regular intervention.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider this matter with a view to allowing him and his Department to have greater input at least every six months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great interest to what has been said.  Since I joined the Department earlier this year I have been impressed by the emphasis on safety.  One could compare the safety system operated to the auditing of accounts where the accountants operate in managing the funds and the books and the auditor then makes the final check and gives his report.  ANSO has a team of inspectors with wide ranging powers.  They can arrive in any airport, inspect any airplane and meet any member of staff at any time, which they do on a regular weekly basis around the country.  In-house, internal inspectors carrying out safety checks at all times on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>What we are talking about here is an auditing whereby external auditors will come in on a minimum three-year basis to do an aviation audit on the safety procedures operated by the company.  It would be our hope that it may be possible to do it once a year but with regard to safety the inspectors are constantly there. I have seen them and I am highly impressed with the way they operate, their professional standards and the powers they have.  Nobody can impede their inspections or their investigations at any time.  I am satisfied that the system is absolutely foolproof. We want external checking of the system to ensure that we conform fully with the standards laid by the ICAO and the Joint Aviation Authorities in Europe. That is the effect of these provisions and I am satisfied that it is wise to do so.  If we can it on an annual basis we would be delighted to do so.  It should be done in not more than three years.</P>

      <P>I agree with what the Minister of State said regarding what <Col N="395" /> ANSO has been doing.  We complimented them on Second Stage on their fine work and their high international standards.  However, 20 years from now when many of the present staff in the Department, who will go to the new Authority, have retired or left and there is a new set of people, what guarantee does this Bill give that the current monitoring system under ANSO will continue under the new authority?  There is nothing in this section to suggest that will continue in the new environment.</P>

      <P>We are confident there will be a continuity in staffing.  As people retire they will be replaced by people who are competent and proficient and have come up through the system.  The authority will be reporting to the Minister and the inspectors in the authority will be doing their work on a constant basis to the highest international standards. What we are talking about here is an external audit to international safety standards for our aviation services.  If they are not satisfied they report to the Minister and the appropriate action will have to be taken on the direction of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It would seem from this section that the chief executive can override the board.  This is a dangerous precedent whereby the chief executive can take the complete power at all times. Senator McGennis and Senator Ross spoke about safety standards.  The Minister of State says that the first report on safety standards will not appear until three years after the setting up of the board.  At that stage if the board wants to take a decision which is against the wishes of the chief executive a long rigmarole <Col N="396" /> ensues which could take another year.  When we are dealing with safety standards could be a dangerous precedent to give all this power to the chief executive.</P>

      <P>I endorse what Senator Burke said.  I do not understand the circumstances in which this conflict will arise.  Perhaps the Minister of State could describe how and where it might happen. Does it tell us something about the chief executive?  Is the implication that the chief executive is better qualified to make these decisions than the board?  I do not understand the circumstances in which there would be such a conflict about safety.  Perhaps the Minister of State could give us an example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross is absolutely correct on this occasion.  This provision is necessary because the directors of the company are unlikely to have the technical expertise of the staff.  Due to the paramount importance of safety in aviation it is appropriate to require that before the board of the company makes a decision likely to impact on aviation safety they should take into account all the advice and information available to them from the staff of the company, as conveyed to them by the chief executive officer.  Consequently, if the board takes a decision which is not to the satisfaction of the chief executive officer from an international safety standard point of view, this section empowers him not to have to carry that out and to report to the Minister thereon.</P>

It is sensible if a board which is comprised of lay people decides that the authority should do a certain thing that the chief executive should be able to say to the board &ldquo;Hold on.  You may be contravening a section of the Bill and I think you are wrong.  If we implement this we will cause chaos in the sky.

Someone with immense technical knowledge of traffic and safety regulations in the air will be appointed and will have a principal eye to safety. The Minister should give the granting of that appointment to people involved in the aviation industry, such as various sections of vocational groups in different areas of the aviation industry.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I call on Senator Naughten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I wish to raise is in respect of the early retirement scheme for farmers, I have not raised this issue to be critical.</P>
      <P>I welcome this excellent scheme but, unfortunately, it raises three or four major problems.  This scheme was approved in October 1993 by the Standing Committee on Structures and it will go before the European Commission, either at the end of November or early December next.  It is of vital importance to the farming and rural communities that defects in the scheme are resolved before it is implemented and gets approval from Brussels because, when it is approved, it will be extremely difficult to alter it.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that a retirement scheme was introduced in 1973 which collapsed because it did not meet the requirements of the farming community.  There were a number of difficulties with the scheme and, unfortunately, I see difficulties in the present scheme.  It is a pity that a scheme like this was not introduced 30 years ago to help to create a turnover and put the farms into the hands of young farmers much earlier.  Unfortunately, as we all know, a farm did not provide a living for two families.  That caused a drain from the land throughout rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and his Department to use maximum flexibility in implementing the measures.  One of the major difficulties with the scheme is the criteria for additional land.  I can understand why, with certain non-economic holdings, additional land would have to be obtained.  However, if an economic holding is being transferred from father to son, from uncle to nephew or indeed from neighbour to neighbour, there <Col N="399" /> should be no need for the requirement of additional land.  I can see that requirement creating major problems for some farmers, taking over holdings &mdash; and who will be the leasees of those holdings &mdash; because of the additional financial pressure that purchasing or leasing that land will cause.  A young farmers who leases or purchases land may be forced to purchase a far greater area of land than he would require under the terms of the scheme because parcels of land may not be available or suitable in his immediate area.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of this is a situation which could well arise where people in the better farming areas in Munster and Leinster may decide to lease land in the west, plant it with trees, lock the gate and throw away the key.  We have had our fair share of planting in the west and we do not want to see any more arable land planted in this region.  I can see major difficulties for younger farmers and others in certain parts of the country in getting the additional parcel of land which they need.  If there is a viable holding that requirement should be waived.</P>
    <P>Another major difficulty in the scheme is in regard to part-time farmers.  If the purpose of this scheme is to get land into the hands of young farmers, to give them an opportunity of getting a livelihood the scheme should be as flexible as possible. This part-time criteria should not be insisted on because it will have the effect of preventing the local Bord na Móna worker, who engages in seasonal work on the bogs, the temporary worker with the county councils, CIE or the Forestry from participating in the scheme, not because they have not put sufficient hours per annum into farming but because the income they will get from off-farm employment will be greater than that which they were earning from the land. That will create major problems in the west where there are so many part-time farmers.  I appeal to the Minister to get that derogation now because it is vital that land, used by part-time farmers at present, is placed in the hands of young farmers who have undertaken the 150 <Col N="400" /> hour course, done their term in agricultural college and are prepared to take over those farms and operate them in a satisfactory and efficient manner.</P>
    <P>There is also the whole question of the lack of a land policy.  This is not confined only to this scheme although we cannot discuss it without referring to this issue. I am deeply concerned about the amount of good land falling into the hands of either Coillte Teoranta or private afforestation. A significant amount of the land in the west, which was never suitable for farming, should have been planted 20 or 30 years ago.  However, unfortunately we have now reached a stage where farms on the market are bought by Forestry. They comprise good, arable farming land and when it is planted it goes out of agricultural production indefinitely.  That is a reality of life, indeed a tragedy, because when changes in the CAP and the GATT negotiations are completed and when matters settle, as happened with the milk quota regime, there could be a market for our produce.  Millions of people are starving all over the world but I have no doubt that, in time, they will be able to pay other countries to supply food.  For that reason we must be careful.</P>
    <P>Another important issue is age.  It would be a pity if in the first few years of the scheme the guideline of 66 years of age is strictly adhered to.  There is a pool of land held by bachelors who have no close relative to inherit it.  If they could avail of this scheme for a five-year period they might be encouraged to enter a leasing arrangement.</P>
    <P>It will also be difficult to persuade people in many parts of rural Ireland to change the leasing culture.  There is a tradition of 11 months leasing.  As you will know, a Chathaoirligh, all of the land leasing in your area is done on an 11-month basis.  It will require a change of culture to persuade people to accept the principle of longer-term leasing.</P>
    <P>Many more issues arise from this retirement scheme.  I welcome the principles of the scheme, which are excellent and will help put land in the hands of younger farmers.  I would hate to see this scheme spoiled because of the requirement <Col N="401" /> for additional land, the embargo against part-time farmers and the age limit, the three principal difficulties involved.  Before this scheme is approved by the EC Commission, later this month or early in the next, these adjustments should be made.  It would be a much better scheme and apply on a wider basis if these impediments were removed.</P>

      <P>I am glad to reply to the motion put down by Senator Naughten.  The occasion allows me to give an up-to-date report on progress in the implementation of this scheme.  The Government has formally approved the farmers' retirement scheme and it is expected expenditure under the scheme will amount to £150 million over the next five years.  The EC Standing Committee on Agricultural Structures has agreed to the proposals in the scheme.  These proposals must now be formally approved by the EC Commission before implementation and this is expected to happen in the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>The farmers' retirement scheme, which was one of the measures accompanying the CAP reform agreement reached last year, involves pension payments of up to £9,000 this year.  It is expected those payments will increase to £9,700 next year.  That applies to a farm of at least 24 hectares and will be for a maximum of ten years but not beyond the retired farmer's 70th birthday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme is the culmination of extensive and protracted consultations <Col N="402" /> between the Department and the EC Commission over the past year in relation to its detail and implementation in Ireland.  The scheme has also been fully discussed with individual farmers and their representatives.  The reason this proposal was so long in Brussels is the amount of detailed discussion I and officials of the Department had with the Commission to ensure this proposal was tailor made to Irish conditions as far as possible.  We wanted to meet the requirements so ably stated tonight.  The difficulty is the Commission is paying 75 per cent of the cost of the scheme and as the main contributors insisted on certain requirements and conditions.</P>
    <P>The objective of the scheme is to help redress two major structural defects in Irish farming, farm size and the age profile of farmers.  Because farm size is a problem the EC said it would provide £150 million but there would have to be an enlargement requirement.  Initially the Commission wanted a 20 per cent enlargement but in negotiation that was reduced to 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>I believe this scheme is attractive and flexible.  If we find a major difficulty in its implementation, we can return to the Commission and ask that it be amended. I believe the objective of the scheme, putting farms in the hands of younger people, is worthy and badly needed.</P>
    <P>I take the Senator's point that previous attempts at farmers' retirement schemes did not work because of various difficulties. Farmers are shrewd people and will not transfer farms if they are not sure of a scheme.  I do not blame them.  If a person of 55 cannot be certain about the outcome, he is entitled to be cautious. However I believe this scheme is sufficiently attractive.  One of its most appealing features is that for the first time it applies to transfers within a family.  The transferor will qualify for the pension in such a case.</P>
    <P>I am discussing PRSI payments with the Department of Social Welfare because some farmers involved may not have paid their full requirement in contributions. When the ten-year pension has finished I would like to see them receive a contributory pension rather than having to go through a means test <Col N="403" /> to receive the non-contributory old age pension.  I think that would be unfair to people who have retired and transferred their farms.  They should automatically qualify for the contributory pension.</P>
    <P>I want this scheme to work.  I know Irish farmers well enough to know that unless they are satisfied with the detail of the scheme they will not apply for it and it will be unworkable.  No one wants that because a considerable amount of money has been provided for it.  I allocated money in this year's budget so the scheme could be implemented straight away.  We hope to receive approval from the Commission in the next few weeks.  On the one hand people of 55 and upwards will receive a decent pension, some of them receiving a good income for the first time in their lives.  On the other hand I also want younger people to take over farms.</P>
    <P>One point raised by Senator Naughten was the enlargement requirement.  Under the regulation, where a transferee succeeds a transferer but has no land of his or her own, the transferee must buy, lease or otherwise obtain additional land to increase the size of the holding.  Where the proposed transferee already owns or leases land which has not been transferred to him or her by the transferer after 30 July 1992, the date the EC early retirement regulation came into force, then this land can be added to the released land to meet the enlargement requirement.</P>
    <P>As the Senator said, in some parts of the country it is extremely difficult to obtain suitable land, especially by purchasing it.  One could be a lifetime in a townland or a parish without a suitable piece of land becoming available. However we received a concession from the Commission in relation to leasing.  If one leases five hectares, which is 12 and a half acres, for five years, that will satisfy the requirement.  I feel this will cover most of the problems.  If a transferee has better land that is fine, and it will satisfy the enlargement requirement.  If they have not got it, then if they lease five <Col N="404" /> hectares or 12.5 acres that will satisfy the requirement.</P>
    <P>The Senator mentioned part-time farmers.  Applicants for the pension must have been farming as a full-time occupation for ten years prior to the cessation of farming.  Part-time is defined as deriving at least 50 per cent of income from and spending at least 50 per cent of time on farming or a combination of farming and forestry, tourism or craft activities. In the latter case farming must make up only 25 per cent of the total income. There will be reasonable flexibility there. More and more people must have off-farm income of some type and I make the point again that unemployment assistance or dole payments to farmers will not be treated as income and so will not affect the ratio of farm to non-farm income.</P>
    <P>This is a good and attractive scheme. In the case of a married couple, if one of the spouses is over the age and the other is under, the younger spouse can make the application and qualify for the pension. There is some flexibility there also. This scheme is worthwhile and will change the face of rural Ireland for the better.  If there is a particularly acute difficulty when we see it in practice, I will have no hesitation in going back to the Commission and stating that it is not working because of a particular problem and I want an adjustment or modification to it.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to spell out the up to date situation regarding this scheme.  I thank Senator Naughten for raising the matter and I expect detailed information on the scheme and the application form will be available within this month when formal approval is given by Brussels.  I have already asked officials in the Department of Agriculture, in addition to Teagasc, to have a series of information meetings throughout the country so that they can go through and if necessary assist in filling out application forms because there is tremendous interest in this worthwhile scheme.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 11 November 1993.</P>
