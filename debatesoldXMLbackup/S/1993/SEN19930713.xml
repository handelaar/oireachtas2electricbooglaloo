      <P>I have notice from Senator Roche that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to take urgent steps to deal with the domestic water supply crisis in south west Wicklow by giving sanction to the regional water supply scheme.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Burke of the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Education to provide Mayo Abbey national school with proper toilet facilities.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to outline the progress to date in implementing the recommendations of the Sixth Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State Sponsored Bodies &mdash; 5th Report on Bord na gCon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Roche, Burke and Neville as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Roche's and Senator <Col N="918" /> Burke's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put on record the congratulations of the House to Senator O'Sullivan on her election last night as Mayor of Limerick.  I wish her a successful year in office.  I would also like to put on record my thanks to people on both sides of the House and all those who play a part in ensuring that this House operates as it should.  I thank everybody for what I would like to think was a successful session of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Item 1, statements on the Opsahl report, from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. with 20 minutes per spokesperson and ten minutes thereafter. It is intended to leave that report on the Order Paper.  Unfortunately, Senator Wilson is not here today for various reasons and it would give him and others a chance to debate this important issue in the autumn.  Item 2, statements on Aer Lingus will be taken from 5 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. and I am suggesting ten minutes per spokesperson and five minutes thereafter. The Minister will speak initially and would like an opportunity to reply to the debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at about 6.30 p.m. Item 3 is the European Communities (Amendment) Bill and I suggest that we take all Stages tonight starting at 6.30 p.m., with 20 minutes per spokesperson and 15 minutes thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Leader in his message of congratulations to Senator O'Sullivan on becoming Mayor of Limerick and in thanking all those who made the working of the House so smooth over the past number of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On today's Order of Business, I am glad we have a chance to debate the Opsahl report and that it is being left open-ended.  However, I am not at all happy with the amount of time being <Col N="919" /> given to Item 2, statements on Aer Lingus.  This is a matter of grave national importance which demands more than &mdash; when one takes the Minister into account &mdash; about an hour of time for statements. It is also a matter where the House deserves the opportunity of say whether it supports the Cahill plan and, for that reason, I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business to insert Item 26 after Item 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Opsahl report will be carried over to a later date because I recognise that most Members on both sides of the House will want to be involved and it is useful that it should be on the agenda for the future.</P>
      <P>I agree with the point made by Senator Manning.  It is not good enough to squeeze the debate on Aer Lingus into just over an hour.  The Minister will take up half that time and, even without the Minister, an hour and a half is not nearly enough for an item which is of serious national importance and which is being discussed in every part of Irish society at present.  It is an insult to try and get it out of the way in that short time.  It deserves more time and, on a personal basis, I would like to second the proposal of Senator Manning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>May I begin, a Chathaoirligh, by congratulating Senator O'Sullivan on her election and by thanking you, all the people in your office and the rest of the staff of the House for their courtesy and help during the past session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Order of Business, the arrangements for the statements on Aer Lingus are totally unsatisfactory.  This is a matter of national importance; there are 1,500 jobs at stake and there is the whole question of Shannon.  We are being given ten minutes per spokesperson and five minutes thereafter which is totally inadequate. Brevity is to welcomed in the House but that is carrying it too far. There is another item after that on the Order Paper, the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, which is far less controversial.  It is important as it is <Col N="920" /> legislation but we are giving it much more time.  In that context what is being offered to us here is totally unsatisfactory and must be resisted.</P>
    <P>The House is not being run for the convenience of Ministers.  It is a sovereign House of the Oireachtas and we are here to give our opinion but, increasingly, we are not being allowed to give our opinion.  As I remarked previously on the Order of Business, more and more things are being done by executive action without any reference to this House.  I regard what is being done here as an insult to this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other people who congratulated Senator O'Sullivan and I wish her well in her office.</P>
      <P>I wish to call on the Leader of the House to make a statement regarding the recent scurrilous attack in a newspaper on the integrity and honesty of a deceased former chairman of Dublin County Council.  I would like to know the legal situation regarding relatives of the deceased.  How are they protected under law?  The deceased cannot now clear his name.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House, is it not now time to set up a press council or at least have a debate on the matter so that issues like this can be debated and an adjudication given on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I also join in the congratulations to Senator O'Sullivan on being elected as Mayor of Limerick.  In that office she is automatically a member of the Shannon Status Committee.  I also <Col N="921" /> congratulate Senator D'Arcy on his election as chairman of Wexford County Council.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning's proposal to change the Order of Business and I propose that Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to reject the Cahill plan.  Five minutes is totally inadequate and does not give us an opportunity to fully state our views.  Some of us come from areas in Dublin and the mid-west that are extremely concerned about their future.  Our economy will be devastated by the decision of the Government on this issue.  I ask the Leader of the House, in view of the fact that there will be a major transfer of jobs from the mid-west region to the Dublin area and that 2,300 jobs will be lost in the mid-west, to allow a full and proper debate on this issue by giving at least three hours to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader accede to some of the requests that have been made to extend the time for the debate on Aer Lingus and extend the time of sitting so that the European Communities Bill can be discussed later this evening?  The Leader may be able to arrange this after consultation with the Whips.</P>
      <P>I agree with the comments made by Senator Finneran.  I am not speaking here in the context of a former chairman of Dublin County Council but of a distinguished former member of this House whose character has been taken away after his death.  He later became a distinguished Member of the other House. A reporter has the nerve to suggest that because he had a small estate &mdash; a man who was in business for many years before he came into this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you please phrase a question to the Leader, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>He was in business during the time he was in this House. Will the Leader initiate a debate to see what can be done when a politician has his character assassinated after his death. Former Senator and former Deputy and Councillor Seán Walsh was a native of <Col N="922" /> Kilkenny and I know there is extreme consternation there at the treatment that has been given to that man after his death.  He was a well-known businessman in Dublin, he was a businessman in Kilkenny, and he had a modest estate when he died.  The man never owned a house &mdash; he lived in digs &mdash; and was well-known as a man who took care of himself and of those around him, but he never had a major capital expense in his life and if he can be attacked after his death, is it any wonder that politicians are regarded as being a little on the dicey side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the press council to address this matter and I also ask the Leader to request the Minister to do so also.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader get in touch with the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, to find out the situation regarding employment in the Garda Síochána.  Recently, a young man wanting to transfer from the English police to the Garda was told that he was below the height required to join the force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call made by Senator Manning, which was supported by a number of other Senators, to <Col N="923" /> ask the Leader to provide adequate time to discuss the Aer Lingus issue.</P>
      <P>I will be supporting Senator Manning's proposal that Item 26 be added after Item 1.  I have had the utmost respect for the manner in which the Leader has conducted business the House and I am surprised at the offer of an hour and a half to discuss this question.  To discuss this matter the period of an hour and a half, with a time limit of ten minutes on speeches by the spokespersons and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Leader that to confine the speeches to ten minutes for the spokespersons and five minutes to other speakers is a cynical attempt to smother debate on a report that has been produced by the most discredited management team in the semi-State sector and which affects the livelihood of 1,500 people in Senator Wright's area and undermines the economy of the region I come from.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Leader to treat the House in the same manner and with the same respect as he has done on practically every previous occasion.  This is not the time to smother debate on this issue and on the major issues that arise from it and, therefore, I put it to the Leader that the minimum time required for debate is three hours &mdash; 20 minutes for the spokespersons and ten minutes for other speakers &mdash; and I am prepared to press that to a vote, if necessary.  I want to say to those who would be tempted to turn this down and smother the debate that to reject the proposal we are making on this side of the House is confirming the dismissal of 1,500 people and is destroying the economy of my area.  The Senators on the Government side should known that that is what they will be voting for when they walk through the lobbies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> I ask the Leader to avoid that situation by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>In this proposal, I am attempting to provide Senator Roche and his colleagues with the opportunity to justify their stand on this issue.  There should be a three hour debate on this issue, with 20 minutes for the spokespersons and ten minutes for other speakers and then we will solve many of those difficulties.  The embarrassment that will be caused to colleagues on that side of the House who will vote to wreck the economy of my area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In relation to the comments of Senator Dardis that the House is being silenced, I thought it was well known that the Government has initiated Bills in this House and had allowed for long periods of debate on almost any topic during this session.  The difficulty has been that, from time to time, the Opposition speakers have been in short supply &mdash; it may be different today.</P>
      <P>The Seanad is constantly referred to as a place with no power.  I am amazed to discover that a decision on the Order of Business will put 1,500 employees in Aer Lingus out of work.  I never knew we had this awesome power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader to provide a proper length of time to debate the Cahill plan on Aer Lingus. This is a serious plan, one compiled without consultation with the concerned parties in Dublin or Shannon.  The plan is so serious that it will undermine at least 2,500 jobs in Aer Lingus and its semi-State subsidiaries.  In addition, 2,500 to 3,000 jobs in the mid-west and western region are in jeopardy.  This plan was presented by a man whose credentials are dubious in relation to the management of Aer Lingus and chairman of the board. <Col N="926" /> Members are aware of Mr. Bernie Cahill's record and that of the management of Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>This House, established under the constitution, must be given sufficient time to discuss in detail a matter of such relevance and concern, not only to the people of Dublin, the mid-west and Clare, but to Ireland.  It is a matter of fundamental regional policy; the economy of this country is at stake.  This Government is to take on board <i>carte blanche</i> a plan that does not stand up to arguments put forward on social, economic or any grounds.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to provide adequate time to debate this matter. It is unacceptable to allow only one and a half hours to debate a matter of such national importance.  Furthermore, it is unacceptable to give five minutes to Senators who get the opportunity to speak.  Only 12 Senators will be able to speak on this important debate, less than one fifth of the membership of this House.  I appeal to the Leader of the House, through the Chair, to provide adequate time and not to guillotine a matter of such fundamental economic importance.  Thousands of jobs depend on the acceptance or non-acceptance of this plan.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with the Cathaoirleach, but I am about to add to his problems.  Some months ago I requested a debate on the drug problem, particularly in cities.  I realise from today's Order of Business that it is difficult to please everyone.  However, I hoped that time would have been made available to debate this matter.  I commend the Navy and the Garda for this morning's cannabis seizure valued at £20 million.  I ask the Leader of the House to indicate whether this matter may be <Col N="927" /> debated before the end of this session or at the beginning of the next session.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Aer Lingus debate, from attending the huge public meeting at Dublin airport, I believe Aer Lingus workers in Shannon and Dublin are sick of political rhetoric and do not want to hear another word from any politician.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Finneran's call for a press council or an investigation.  A recent newspaper report has cast a slur on all local authority members.  I served with Sean Walsh on Dublin County Council and I do not understand how a newspaper of the calibre of <i>The Irish Times</i> and the two journalists involved in what was supposed to be a piece of investigative journalism could simply go to the public records to see what the deceased had left and suggest impropriety.  It is gutter press at its worst and is a slur on all local authority members.  I ask the Leader of the House to make representations to the relevant Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to note that acceptance of the Fine Gael motion could wipe out <Col N="928" /> Shannon because it does not mention the mid-west, Shannon or the effect this decision will have on the region.  I would appreciate an extension in the time allowed to debate this matter and I appeal to the Leader of the House to consider this.</P>

      <P>I will greatly miss the atmosphere of fantasy which exists in this House when we break for the summer.  I heard Senator Finneran appeal to the Cathaoirleach for legal advice in relation to libel laws, which I do not believe the Chair is professionally qualified to give.  Although the Cathaoirleach holds an elevated position, advising Senators on such matters is not part of his brief&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make one point.  Let nobody divert attention from <Col N="929" /> the real scandal, which is a series of outrageous planning decisions, particularly in North County Dublin.  That is the real scandal and nobody should try to draw a veil over that.  Why did we not meet at 10.30 a.m. and why can we not meet tomorrow?  I accept this is the last week. We will probably have a vote, thus leaving one and a half hours to debate the Opshal report.  That is an insult.</P>
      <P>I formally propose, and I believe this may be seconded, that we extend Item 2 until 8 o'clock.  That would allow time for a reasonable discussion.  I am not doing this to create difficulties for the Government, but we must seriously consider this important question relating to employment. A number of different views will be expressed.  I will resist the temptation, unlike other Members, to make a speech at this time.  Is is regrettable that we are meeting for only half a day to debate this matter; extra time should be allowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion to extend the time of the debate on Item 2.</P>
      <P>I join with Members in congratulating Senator O'Sullivan on her election as Mayor of Limerick, a historic city.  The same can be said about the commitment given to people in the Shannon region as was said about the Treaty of Limerick, &ldquo;that before the ink with which 'twas writ was dry...&rdquo;.  This issue is about people and for the Seanad to devote only one and a half hours to a major issue which is being talked about throughout the country is a scandal.  The time available for this debate should be extended, otherwise the debate is a nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, my sincere thanks for the good wishes of the Seanad.  I support the call for the extension of the debate on Aer Lingus and the Shannon stopover.  The Minister is speaking here and he has requested the right to reply. <Col N="930" /> I wish to bring it to your notice, a Chathaoirligh, that as I understand Standing Orders a Minister cannot reply to statements made in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the House has been requested at least twice, by myself and others, to allow a debate on the extension of disadvantaged areas, and one in relation to the financial institutions.  Both issues have been ignored.</P>
      <P>Another issue which should be discussed here is the action of the Minister for the Environment in notifying all county councils that he has made an order disallowing the taxation of cars for a three month period.  This is an attack on the poorer sections of the community.  I wish to point out to the Government, and to the Labour Party in particular, that 54 per cent of the people in my county tax their cars on a quarterly basis.  This is a vicious tax on poor people.  These people cannot afford to keep cars and tax them on either a six or a 12-month basis.  This Government will go to incredible lengths to bring in money.  The Government is getting three months payment in advance from the poorer sections of the community and this issue should be dealt with in this House.  I ask for time today or tomorrow to debate this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to hear the Leader of the House mention the co-operation he has received and for which he thanked Members.  I hoped that on the final day of this session this co-operation could continue.  We gave the Leader of the House notice last Thursday that we would be pressing our motion and that we would be insisting on extra time in order to debate a most important issue. I was interested in the contributions of Senator Lanigan and Senator Daly. Should this question come to a vote they will be very welcome on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, on an issue on which I am sure there will be total agreement, last Friday former head usher Peadar Lawless retired after almost 40 years service to this House, during which time he was of great help to all Members.  On behalf of <Col N="931" /> my group I send him our good wishes for a long and happy retirement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, call for extra time to debate the Shannon stop over and the Aer Lingus issue.  I must take issue with Senator Daly as the Shannon stopover issue is included in our motion regarding the Aer Lingus plan.</P>
      <P>I support Senator D'Arcy in relation to extension of the three months taxation period to six months.  The Government is depriving the poor people of the option of taxing a car for three months; the shortest period for which a car can be taxed is now six months and this is an indictment of the Government.  I call for this provision to be removed at once.</P>
      <P>With regard to marine matters, by the year 1996 the 20-mile zone will be reduced to 12 miles, and I ask the Leader of the House to request the Minister for the Marine to ensure that we put proper surveillance measures in place to safeguard our national fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to place on the record my concern about the changes in the motor taxation system.  The points made by Senator D'Arcy and others are quite correct and it is a pity that we do not have time to discuss the matter.  I also think it would be appropriate if we had more time to discuss the issue of Aer Lingus.  The semi-State bodies have been scandalously neglected over the years by both Houses of the Oireachtas and I wish to see more time given to debate these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder whether there is any way in which we can protect the character of people, whether they are public representatives or not, from McCarthyism in this country.  If Senator Norris took time to reflect on the finger pointing which has taken place with regard to a deceased Member of this House, he would be appalled.  I do not know whether there is a scandal.  If there is, it should be investigated and exposed, but it is wrong that a public representative or a citizen of this State has his character destroyed after death simply on the basis <Col N="932" /> of innuendo.  It is McCarthyism, it is the worst form of journalism, and it is time, and perhaps Senator Norris would agree with me, that we had a press council.  I do not know if there are scandals, I do not know if there is bribery.  If there is bribery, let it be exposed and let those who are involved be brought to justice, but we must have some standards in this country, and for a paper like <i>The Irish Times</i> to do what it did to the character of Sean Walsh is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>I was involved in cases of justice for Irish people who ran foul of the British Establishment.  It seems we should now be looking for justice for Irish people who run foul of self-appointed people in our own society.  It is wrong.  That is not to say that I condone any misdeeds in local authorities.  If they exist, they should be investigated and those involved should be brought to justice.  Early in the new term we should discuss the whole issue of a press council.  I will support any such proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am in a queue of speakers, Senator Cosgrave has stolen my thunder to some degree, but I wish to put on the record of the House the deep appreciation of many of us in this House to Peadar Lawless who retired as former head usher and who spent 38 years in the service of this House.  I knew him as man and boy; to give some indication of the extent of his service, he served here during the time my father was a Member of the House, and I have fond memories of his kindness personally to me.  I know I speak for many Members of the House in saying that he will be missed.  I wish him a very happy retirement. It was in his nature not to publicise the fact that he was retiring; therefore, many Members will be somewhat surprised to learn that he has now officially retired.  It would be remiss of me and of this House not to record his retirement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the call for a longer debate on Aer Lingus. If the Tánaiste and the Minister for Industry and Employment were given only five minutes to speak on their visit to the <Col N="933" /> hangar, would they have accepted the invitation of the workers?  I do not believe they would.  Of course, it would only have taken five minutes to make the promises; the promises made then were not about 1,500 redundancies.  The Leader of the House has given unlimited time for debates of major importance in this House over the past number of months. Surely Members of this House should have been given unlimited time to discuss this major issue which affects not alone many families in Senator Wright's constituency, but many families in mine.</P>
      <P>I also wish to support Senator D'Arcy's call in connection with the order made by the Minister for the Environment to the effect that people can no longer pay for their car tax on a quarterly basis. In my county there are 2,000 people in arrears in respect of loans and these same people are now asked to pay motor tax in advance.  Is this new Government policy? We should have an opportunity to discuss this order and the effect it will have on those concerned throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <P>I also wish to support the call to extend the time on the debate on Aer Lingus.  It is no harm to bear in mind that last year a previous Minister for Transport spent months considering the decision on the Shannon stopover.  That decision was eventually made before the election.</P>
      <P>I would also like to support the calls against a six-month minimum car taxation period.  Some people in certain areas, and especially in my own county, find it hard to travel with a car at all, whether it is taxed or not, because the roads are in such a bad state.</P>

      <P>As somebody who is not depending on Shannon or Dublin for a vote, may I make a comment?  It is hard to sit back here and stomach the hypocrisy about promises that were made in the hangar.  In rural Ireland people are saying that £170 million has been promised and committed to regenerate and restructure Aer Lingus and that that money should be going to restructure rural Ireland.  There are crocodile tears from those who predicted that rabbits would overrun Shannon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The problems of Aer Lingus will not go away tomorrow, they will not be solved by an hour's or six hours' debate in this House.  I am suggesting that in the cool, calm light of day, after the recess, we <Col N="935" /> come back and provide time for a full debate and discuss the future of Aer Lingus. The people of rural Ireland are interested in where the £170 million should go and the conditions attached.  It cannot be dismissed as only being a North County Dublin or a Shannon issue, it is a national issue. All of us are proud of our airlines but sometimes there is a price which is too much to pay.

      <P>I would like to condemn the article in yesterday's paper that tried to destroy the name of a dead man.  Seán Walsh was a respected and hard-working man.  I am really amazed at the number of calls for a press council because when Senator Cassidy and I tabled a motion in this House less than a year ago, with the exception of Senator Manning we got very little support for it.  There was nothing but praise for the integrity and honesty of journalists in this country, and it was said we did not need a press council. I am glad something has alerted people to the need for a press council.  I call on the <i>The Irish Times</i> to apologise to the family of the late Deputy Walsh for trying to make dirt of his name and honour after his death.  It is disgraceful. It is gutter journalism in a high-ranking paper.</P>

I want to order item No. 4 at the end of the debate on the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1993, and to say that Adjournment Matters will take place at the conclusion of Business.  Unfortunately, due to time constraints we could not organise a debate on drug abuse, as requested by Senator McGennis, but we will have such a debate at the earliest possible moment after the recess.</P>
      <P>May I make one comment on the article in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday? Is it right that someone can be politically exhumed after three and a half years?  Is it fair to their family? For a paper of the repute of <i>The Irish Times</i> to stoop so low is, in the words of the chairman of Dublin County Council, Deputy Rabbitte, distasteful. I certainly would welcome a further debate on a press council early in the new term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Opsahl report, it is disappointing that it is almost 3.20 p.m. on the day the Tánaiste has come here to speak in the debate on this important report.  The fact that this report is being <Col N="937" /> debated for the first time in this House, further endorses his commitment, and that of the Government, to the Seanad. I wish to reiterate that this item will be left on the Order Paper so that Members, like Senator Wilson, who do not contribute today will get a chance to do so in the autumn.</P>
    <P>With regard to Aer Lingus, may I make a few points?  Aer Lingus was debated for three hours in the Dáil which has 166 Members.  We have had several debates on Aer Lingus in this House and I am extremely surprised that some of those who shouted loudest here today were silent on this most important issue when they had the opportunity to debate it earlier.

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, thank you for your welcome.  I am glad to be back in the Seanad to join with the Members for what I consider to be a very important debate.  I am glad that we found the opportunity to have this debate at an early date.  I welcome that decision.</P>
      <P>This debate adds to the opportunities for dialogue on the subject of Northern Ireland which have been arranged both in this House and in Dáil Éireann in recent months.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Seanad for providing this occasion to assess the significance of the work undertaken by Professor Torkel Opsahl and his six colleagues: Pádraig O'Malley, Eamonn Gallagher, Professor Marianne Elliott, Lady Faulkner, Professor Ruth Lister and Rev. Dr. Eric Gallagher.</P>
      <P>The Opsahl Commission was established in May of last year by the independent citizens' group, Initiative '92, to inquire into possible ways forward for Northern Ireland and beyond with an opportunity to discuss and consider possible ways forward and to express their ideas, hopes and fears.</P>
      <P>In this goal, the expectations of the commission have been amply vindicated. In total, 554 submissions were received representing the work of around 3,000 people.  Six weeks of oral hearings were held by the commission throughout Northern Ireland and nearly two hundred presentations were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his introduction to the report, Professor Opsahl draws one central conclusion from this process, which is that <Col N="941" />&ldquo;the people of Northern Ireland do want dialogue, at every level&rdquo;.  This theme is echoed, indeed, in virtually all the submissions made to the commission.</P>
    <P>Indeed the report shows more than just that the people want dialogue.  One of its great merits is to illustrate how, beneath the apparently frozen lines of political division, there is a serious and mature process of reflection on the problem taking place in Northern Ireland.  People are not only willing to think of ways out of the present impasse.  They also took the trouble to formulate and communicate these views and showed, for the most part, a willingness to listen to the views of others.  The submissions are in general thoughtful, positive and constructive. This report refutes any notion that Northern Ireland is somehow a society bereft of political ideas.  It is rather a society which has so far failed to find a generally acceptable framework to mobilise these ideas and to harness the goodwill and the willingness to accommodate others which inspired them.  I believe that failure poses a challenge to political leaders in Northern Ireland, no less than to the two Governments, to develop an adequate response.</P>
    <P>For my own part, I welcome the stress the report lays on dialogue as an indispensable tool in the search for political consensus.  Nowhere is it of greater relevance and urgency, furthermore, than in the search for solutions to the problems of a divided society like Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i> places beyond all doubt the commitment of this Government to the pursuit of a lasting accommodation of the Northern Ireland problem founded on dialogue.  We made clear that a major priority for us is &ldquo;to recommence and sustain the process of dialogue with the parties in Northern Ireland and with the British Government, building on progress already made&rdquo;.  We indicated prominently our intention to seek &ldquo;an urgent resumption of political dialogue to address comprehensively all of the relationships involved in an open and innovative spirit, ready to discuss every <Col N="942" /> issue and to incorporate all agreed changes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are not just ready ourselves &ldquo;to discuss every issue&rdquo;.  We believe that such willingness on all sides is a precondition for a successful outcome to talks.  That was indeed the commitment entered into by all the participants in the talks process, when we agreed in the statement of 26 March 1991 that, &ldquo;in order to ensure a full airing of the issues, it will be open to each of the parties to raise any aspect of these relationships including constitutional issues, or any other matter which it considers relevant&rdquo;.  I believe that open-ended approach should be maintained.</P>
    <P>All of us in the talks process have recognised that our purpose is an ambitious one.  Our declared objective is to achieve &ldquo;a new beginning for relationships within Northern Ireland, within the island of Ireland and between the peoples of these islands&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To be faithful to the 26 March terms, we must be willing to explore every issue. We must be willing to go beyond the known and the familiar and to embrace new horizons in the search for agreement. We must be willing to follow whatever fresh paths our dialogue may open up to us.  If there is one conclusion which stands out clearly from any consderation of the problem, including this report, it is that past approaches have failed.  New ideas and new approaches are needed on all sides.</P>
    <P>Some apt lines from the poet Michael Longley serve as a foreword to the Opsahl report.  Longley speaks of the &ldquo;space&rdquo; offered by this initiative:</P>
    <P>for me</P>
    <P>And you to stay alive</P>
    <P>By sharing thought and word.</P>
    <P>He goes on to ask &ldquo;Are you within hearing? Am I being heard?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is, I believe, essential that we should all be able to create space for dialogue. We must give ourselves complete freedom in our search for ways in which we can reach better understanding and communication with each other.  The more we restrict the space for dialogue <Col N="943" /> by setting tactical or defensive limits or preconditions to it, the less likely it is that we can usher in the new thinking and new approaches that are so patently needed to come to grips with this problem.</P>
    <P>The Opsahl Commission has contributed admirably to the creation of such space.  It has brought together a wealth of ideas and insights across the entire spectrum of political thought relating to Northern Ireland.  It will, I am sure, stimulate considerable reflection over the months and years ahead both on the nature of the problem and on the solutions that may be called for.  It will enrich the public debate and will make its own special contribution to the task of deepening understanding between the two traditions in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Opsahl report bears powerful and moving testimony to the countless individuals and organisations in Northern Ireland who have steadfastly refused to succumb to fatalism and despair. However diverse the remedies proposed, their contributions to the Commission reflect in most instances a degree of honesty, commitment and tolerance for the viewpoint of others which is deeply reassuring and offers hope that a lasting and just accommodation is achievable.</P>
    <P>The late Professor F.S.L. Lyons posed a harsh question in a 1978 lecture that retains its validity today: &ldquo;...have we in our entanglement with history locked ourselves into a hall of distorting mirrors so grotesque that we can no longer distinguish the realities of what has happened in this island from the myths we have chosen to weave about certain symbolic events?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>True political leadership involves distinguishing reality from myth and offering a vision which suits the complex circumstances of the present rather than the comfortable simplicities of the past. A true coming together of both traditions in Ireland must involve transcending the legacy of history and re-defining our relationships with each other and the relationship between these two islands.</P>
    <P>The work done by the Opsahl Commission is a very helpful and constructive <Col N="944" /> contribution to this process.  It is a merit of the report that it stands back from dogmatic assertion and boldly questions many inherited attitudes and positions. It also presents a wide range of options on possible ways forward.  It is a welcome and wide-ranging stimulus to political debate on the realities to be addressed as part of the search for a lasting accommodation between the nationalist and unionist identities.  It has performed a timely and valuable service in reassessing traditional positions and in exploring common ground between the two traditions.  The report is, I believe, of great service in underlining, first, that the approach to a solution must be one of compromise between sincere, deeply held and legitimate positions, and, secondly, that such a compromise must be radical and innovative.</P>
    <P>One of the most striking and resonant themes to emerge from the submissions to the commission is the overwhelming desire for peace.  It is abundantly clear that people in both parts of Ireland and in Britain wish to see progress made as rapidly as possible towards a resolution of the conflict and the ending of violence and suffering.  An opinion poll which was commissioned in order to test the findings of the report found that the resumption of political dialogue is favoured not only by a substantial majority of those questioned in Northern Ireland but also by a clear majority of public opinion in the South and in Britain.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is the democratic duty of the two Governments and the Northern Ireland parties to respond to this unequivocal statement of public preference by resuming political dialogue without delay.  It is difficult to conceive of a task more compelling for democratically elected public representatives in Northern Ireland than to participate in discussions aimed at ensuring a future of lasting peace and stability for those whom they represent.</P>
    <P>The expectations of public opinion in this part of Ireland, in Northern Ireland and in Britain, are crystal clear.  Surveys have established a great public receptivity to the broad lines of the report.  Our <Col N="945" /> peoples wish above all to see a political agreement.  They find it difficult to understand those who obstruct the pursuit of agreement and frustrate their clearly expressed wishes.</P>
    <P>Both as Governments and as political leaders, our role is to serve the people. We are at all times accountable to our respective electorates.  Our efforts to achieve a political agreement are undertaken on their behalf and, as the agreed terms of 26 March make clear, the fruit of our labours must finally meet the test of their approval.</P>
    <P>This critical dimension to our work must not be overlooked.  The people are not remote from, or disinterested in, our efforts.  They wish us to return to the table immediately and to negotiate an agreement upon which they will be given an opportunity to pronounce at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>The wealth of insights and advice contributed to the Opsahl Commission by ordinary people in both parts of Ireland testifies to a profound public desire to see progress made at the earliest possible moment on this most intractable of problems.</P>
    <P>In reaching its conclusions and recommendations, therefore, the commission rightly emphasised the importance of consultation with the people, and of persisting in the search for a new and deep accommodation which all could ultimately support, irrespective of the barriers in the path to agreement.</P>
    <P>A continuing failure to resolve the fundamental conflict between the two traditions in Ireland will steadily undermine the appeal of constitutional politics and promote increased recourse to paramilitary violence.  It is in all our interests that we should devise urgently new political arrangements which will give expression to the identity and validity of both traditions.  No lasting stability will be achievable unless structures can be found which ensure complete equality of treatment between nationalism and unionism.</P>
    <P>This is one of the cardinal principles which the Opsahl report has highlighted. The report has identified the need for <Col N="946" />&ldquo;parity of esteem&rdquo; between the two traditions. It has also proposed that a Government of Northern Ireland &ldquo;should be put in place based on the principle that each community has an equal voice in making and executing the laws or a veto on their execution and an equal share in administrative authority&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This suggestion develops to a logical conclusion a fact of life which is becoming increasingly apparent in Northern Ireland.  Neither community has the capacity to dictate terms to the other. The path to progress lies in co-operation between them, on a basis honourable to both.  If fear of discrimination is one of the roots of mistrust between the two sides, are there not good arguments for a system such as this, where each community surrenders, as it were, every power or possibility of discrimination or unfair dealing into the custody of the other community?  I am also attracted to the proposal to give legal approval to the concept of &ldquo;parity of esteem&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are many other proposals and suggestions in the report which I found helpful and illuminating.  The recommendation in favour of a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland is persuasive.  The wide range of recommendations made in relation to discrimination and the combating of deprivation also match Irish Government concerns.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the emphasis laid on the creation of a cross-Border economic institution to develop the full range of economic co-operation between North and South.  Another crucial point emphasised in the report is the importance of the European Community dimension to the development of common ground between North and South.</P>
    <P>I am also happy to respond to the fears expressed in the report about the continued existence of the Adelaide Hospital.  In the period since the commission formulated its recommendations, the Government has announced measures which have, I believe, resolved this potential problem to general satisfaction.</P>
    <P>The importance of the commission's various conclusions and recommendations <Col N="947" /> lie in their role in encouraging a wide-ranging public debate which, I have no doubt, will be of significance in the context of a resumption of political dialogue.  The report has also furnished a comprehensive analysis of views in all sections of the community. Much of this strikes a sympathetic chord in this part of the island.</P>
    <P>What all of us must move towards, and what lies at the heart of the Opsahl report, is an abandonment of the concepts of victory and defeat in relation to a solution of the Northern Ireland problem.  These categories have no place in any rational approach to the problem. The only victory must be a common one; the only gain a shared one.  Domination by one community over the other, in whatever context, it always fated to fail because it is a permanent source on instability and injustice.</P>
    <P>We now have a compelling need for new thinking in which recognition of the validity of one tradition is not seen as a threat by the other, or affirmation of the rights of one not seen as denial of those of the other.  It is in that spirit that this Government has diligently pursued the process of political dialogue.  That continues to be our objective and I would hope that the two unionist parties will find it possible to join us at the table in a common search for a solution.</P>
    <P>If, despite all our efforts, we do not succeed in our shared endeavour to achieve a resumption of dialogue, it will inevitably be necessary for both Governments to take stock of the situation and to decide on further options.  The issues are too important for the Governments to succumb to immobility or ritual gestures or to allow themselves to become bereft of policy options in the face of persistent refusal to engage in dialogue. If one avenue to progress closes down, others must surely be looked at.</P>
    <P>One alternative, which I have already signalled, would be for the two Governments to consider how they could make best use of their joint resources in the search for a settlement.  We could together identify the key elements which <Col N="948" /> would need to be part of any new accommodation and could present proposals to the other participants on what we considered to be the right way forward.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and I and the Government remain utterly determined in our conviction that the only way forward in relation to Northern Ireland lies in the pursuit of a comprehensive political accommodation which is built on the rights of both traditions in Ireland.  I repeat the hope that all political parties in Northern Ireland will delay no further in joining both Governments in the discussion and negotiation of such an accommodation.</P>
    <P>It is for the two Governments and the political parties to heed this message, to reflect on the different views and ideas put forward both by the commission as well as the individual contributors and to move forward imaginatively to meet the overwhelming desire for lasting peace and stability.  In this, I pledge the unremitting dedication and commitment of the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>The gravity of the situation in Northern Ireland has been given fresh emphasis in the Opsahl report.  For too long, the people of Northern Ireland have endured hardship, division, political stalemate and unacceptable violence.  The Opsahl Commission has provided a voice for their concerns and that voice, insistent and compelling, demands an end to the present unacceptable situation and a commitment to seek new ways forward.</P>
    <P>I warmly congratulate the Opsahl Commission, all those who made submissions to it and all those who assisted it in an undertaking of singular value and importance.  It has been an extraordinary experiment in public participation and has provided a unique forum for public debate about, as Professor Opsahl puts it, the corner of our common Europe that is Northern Ireland.  It has been a vehicle through which many authentic and often perceptive and moving voices make themselves heard.  When the achievement of new structures in Northern Ireland, within Ireland and between both islands is at last realised, I believe the work of the Opsahl Commission will be <Col N="949" /> seen to have made its own contribution to this process.</P>

      <P>At the outset I wish to welcome the Tánaiste to the House and thank him for his participation in the debate this afternoon.  The most striking aspect for me of the Tánaiste's speech was his renewed call for dialogue among the political parties in Northern Ireland. I did not read his interview in <i>The Guardian</i> as an attack on the unionist community but, unfortunately, it was seen by many in the unionist community as such and as representing an abandonment of the whole policy of dialogue and a settlement based upon the widest possible consent between the various communities.  I am glad his speech today tones down that impression and commits the Government to renewed dialogue with all political groups in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am also glad the Tánaiste made clear in his speech that there will always be a point at which the sovereign Governments must follow their own dialogue and initiative and must be more painstaking, imaginative and innovative in their search for ways to break down the distrust between the communities and the two parts of the island.  I am glad the Tánaiste took the trouble to clarify many of the misconceptions which arose from his interview in <i>The Guardian</i> and which featured so strongly in the speeches at the various fields to mark 12 July yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the Opsahl report itself, &ldquo;A Citizens' Inquiry&rdquo; is one of the most valuable exercises that has ever been undertaken in Northern Ireland in the search for peace and reconciliation. It is on a par with the New Ireland Forum report which was the first attempt by the nationalist community on this island to analyse the problems and produce some sort of framework within which the problems could be resolved.  It is a great pity that at the time or afterwards the New Ireland Forum &mdash; which, as I say, was a nationalist analysis and prognosis &mdash; was not followed by a similar unionist analysis of the nature of the problem and ways in which it might be resolved.  There might <Col N="950" /> have then been the beginning of real dialogue.</P>
    <P>One of the great values of the Opsahl report is that it is a comprehensive omnibus analysis, an attempt to make use of the enormous amount of scholarship and study in various disciplines which has taken place over the past 20 to 25 years of the Troubles.  Secondly, it has attempted to talk to the real people whose everyday lives are affected by the continuation of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  Thirdly, it has set out to provide some remedies, some ways of finding solutions to the ongoing problems.</P>
    <P>The most moving part of the Opsahl report is undoubtedly the second section where the ordinary, and the not so ordinary people, of Northern Ireland talk about life there, the effect of the Troubles on them and the agony and nightmare in which they find themselves as a result of problems which they have not created. The report contains many useful ideas many of which were mentioned by the Tánaiste.  These ideas, where possible, should be acted upon and implemented in the areas of policing, the operation of the security forces, integrated education, integrated housing and the protection of human rights.  As far as possible action should be taken now on many of the worthwhile proposals in the Opsahl report.</P>
    <P>The report is one of the first great exercises in dialogue across the communities in Northern Ireland, a structured dialogue with the aim of producing worthwhile solutions.  The authors of the Opsahl report deserve the fullest commendation, not just for their objectives which I think all of us share, but for the way in which they have carried out their work.  I believe it will have a significant effect on the thinking of politicians on both sides in the medium term, if not in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>We do not expect a document such as the Opsahl report to produce solutions which can be immediately implemented.  We do not expect a document consisting of hundreds of pages and hundreds of thousands of words to make an <Col N="951" /> immediate impact in as sophisticated an age as today when so many other messages are being beamed at the community. Nonetheless, I believe and hope the fundamental underlying message will make an impact.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, however, there is little evidence that the thinking of the authors of the Opsahl report had much impact on the speeches or the behaviour at 12 July parades yesterday.  There, the staple political diet continued to be one of triumphalism and intransigence, with politicians who should know better joining in the fray and playing to the lowest common denominator, rather than trying to move forward along the road to reconciliation. The only reported exception to this trend was significant, and that was Mr. James Molyneaux whose speech and radio interviews yesterday looked pragmatically to the future and talked about better community relations, getting the talks back on the road and helping towards the restoration &mdash; or, as some would say, the establishment &mdash; of an accountable democracy in Northern Ireland.  He is a politician of significance and it would be encouraging to believe he meant what he said yesterday, that he seriously wants to move towards realistic talks and has generous proposals to make which would help in this process but, on past performance and in the present climate, there is little reason to be overoptimistic. In spite of the Opsahl report and the opinion polls which followed it, it is difficult to be other than pessimistic about the prospects for progress at the moment.</P>
    <P>As somebody remarked recently, Northern Ireland is not a community frozen in time but a community frozen in the present.  At its most fundamental level it seems to lack the will to tackle and surmount its own problems.  More than that, it seems to have a collective capacity to reject those who want to help to sort out the mess.  In saying this I am not being patronising, as many of my Northern friends have accused me in the past when I voiced these sentiments, which I am sorry to say are widespread <Col N="952" /> in the Republic.  What I am saying is, I believe, unfortunately a statement of fact.</P>
    <P>In this context one of the most depressing aspects of the politics of Northern Ireland, today is the virtual abdication of the political process by the middle classes &mdash; and the affluent middle classes, in particular.  Ms Nuala Ó Faolain had a fascinating and wickedly accurate, but ultimately repulsive, article in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday on life in north County Down.  It painted a picture of an affluent and almost idyllic lifestyle with big houses, rolling lawns, big boats, cricket and golf clubs, BMWs and Mercedes &mdash; a life almost without care with an affluence and low prices that few other parts of the world could match.  Above all, the article offered a picture of exclusivity; it was a picture of people who have a lot more than their fair share of good things in their society having done very well out of Northern Ireland, but who ultimately and fundamentally do not want to and will not get involved in the politics of their own society.  These people are very ready to sneer at and despise all politicians and to blame them for causing the problem and for not resolving it.  They see the problem as somebody else's and abdicate their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>What we have in Northern Ireland is the antithesis of a civic culture where people feel a sense of responsibility to their own society and translate it into support for, and involvement in, the political process.  Until those who own so much of the community, and have so much to gain from Northern Ireland being prosperous and stable, are prepared to participate fully in the process, an almost insurmountable problem will remain.  These are the people who in the Opsahl report's opinion polls support moderation and accommodation, but where are they when political leaders in their own communities attempt to push the boat forward by expressing new ideas and beginning to take risks?  They are nowhere to be found.</P>
    <P>One of the problems in Northern Ireland in recent years &mdash; in both communities, <Col N="953" /> but particularly in the unionist community &mdash; is that where politicians have been brave and sought to express ideas that were tribally unpopular the immediate reaction has come from the hardliners who attack such politicians. Rarely, if ever, is there open support from those who know better, but are not prepared to stand up and be counted.  No healthy society can exist without a strong sense of civic culture and, although there are many honourable and brave exceptions, for example, the people in the Opsahl report, unhappily within the large affluent middle class community on both sides of the sectarian divide in Northern Ireland that civic culture is not to be found.  Until it is, we will look very hard indeed for any solution that will last.</P>
    <P>Many down here were surprised and shocked by the words of the distinguished historian Dr. A.T.O. Stewart at the weekend, when he said that it was only a matter of time before the full effects of the Protestant paramilitaries were unleashed with a greater ferocity than seen up to now.  People should not have been shocked; Dr. Stewart was merely recounting the reality.  In our last debate on Northern Ireland in this House, I made the point that the Protestant paramilitaries are better armed and more disciplined, organised and ruthless than at any time in the past 20 years.  We in both communities ignore at our peril the capacity and the willingness of the Protestant paramilitaries to step up their campaign to a higher level.  There are powerful forces that can disrupt any peace process and unless there is a major political move forward they will continue to pose a threat.  They may well do so, even if there is real political dialogue.</P>
    <P>One of the most dramatic proposals in the Opsahl report is the recommendation that Sinn Féin be brought into the political process and that the political parties talk to that party.  It is certain that the forces which Sinn Féin represent will have to be part of any final settlement; that is common sense.  I would encourage any third party groups seeking peace and reconciliation who are capable of engaging in dialogue with Sinn Féin to <Col N="954" /> do so.  Anything that can be done to move Sinn Féin and those behind that political face away from the present paths of murdering and bombing would be welcome. Unfortunately, I do not believe that the constitutional political parties can engage in dialogue with Sinn Féin as long as that party continues its ambiguity about its relationship with the Provisional IRA.  It is in a sense the political front of the Provisional IRA and does not condemn the murder campaign of the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>During the last debate on Northern Ireland we were told there were straws in the wind that the Provisional IRA was beginning to change its attitude, that the political section of the movement was gaining the upper hand.  There was talk of a possible cease-fire and the beginning of real dialogue.  Unfortunately, none of that has come to pass and we have seen the continuation of the devastating bombing campaign designed to bomb the guts out of the life of Northern Ireland. The campaign has spread to Britain and murdering has continued.  Therefore, it is difficult to accept the Provisional IRA is in any way serious about entering the political process at present.  If it seriously wants to talk it should lay aside its bombs and guns and engage in the peaceful political process.  If it does so it will have a place but that is the only way that will happen.</P>
    <P>The problem for a constitutional politician is to discover who speaks for Sinn Féin.  It continually alternates between hard and soft postures.  There is always the danger of being duped or of talks with constitutional parties being part of an ongoing strategy.  The simple way for Sinn Féin to enter the political process is to persuade the Provisional IRA to lay down its arms and change from its murderous methods.  Sinn Féin will then find people ready and willing to talk to them in order to attain peace in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In recent times it has become fashionable to pour scorn on all Northern political parties and the failure of politicians. That theme runs through the Opsahl report to a certain extent, <Col N="955" /> although not in a sneering sense.  It is seen as a citizen's charter against the politicians but the interest of those two groups should not be mutually exclusive. Certain politicians and political parties in the North have a great deal to answer for and it is easy to be critical of them. Nonetheless recent years have seen all political parties in the North move some distance from their traditional stances. This is true even of the DUP, which was prepared to put forward ideas far removed from those it would have given credence to some years ago.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown how fragile some of these moves forward have been, how quickly and easily parties have backtracked. Experience has also shown difficulties can be great.  When politicians do move forward, the same people who tell opinion pollsters of their desire for peace, accommodation and moderation are nowhere to be seen to support politicians and parties who have taken a stand to help further the debate.</P>
    <P>There is little point in people from the South lecturing Northern politicians. They live in dangerous circumstances and their lives are frequently threatened. They sustain abuse from their own and other communities that few politicians down here would accept.  They live and work in a barren political climate.  Politicians in the Republic should make every effort to highlight the primacy of the party political process.</P>
    <P>Southern politicians should listen to our Northern colleagues from all parties. We should talk to and encourage them. During the long months of the summer recess those of us who profess interest in resolving the problems in Northern Ireland should travel there, talk to fellow politicians and invite them here.  We should at least ensure arguments are not accepted by default and there should be evidence of goodwill.  We should use our contacts.</P>
    <P>I wished to speak about the two sovereign Governments but I understand I do not have enough time.  I will close with remarks on the bombings in the Republic of Ireland 20 years ago, horrific <Col N="956" /> crimes against the people of Dublin and Monaghan for which no one has been brought to justice.  We have all heard the recent reports.  Everyone would like a full inquiry into these incidents to establish if members of British security forces were involved.  Such involvement would surely be without the knowledge of superior officers but the truth of the involvement should be uncovered.</P>
    <P>There is an easy way to set up an inquiry.  A tribunal in the Republic would have no jurisdiction over documents from Northern Ireland or Britain and an inquiry in Northern Ireland would have no such authority here.  This is an ideal opportunity for the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body to set up select committees in Westminster and Leinster House to inquire into the Dublin and Monaghan car bombing atrocities and make a joint report.  There would be no problems of jurisdiction and this would be an example of real co-operation among parliamentarians of both countries.</P>
    <P>I thank the Acting Chairman for his indulgence and I again commend the authors of the Opsahl report.  We could speak on it for many hours.  They have done a great service to the people of the North and the whole island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the opportunity to comment on the report and I welcome the Minister to the House to take part in this important debate. Those who contributed to the report did so courageously.  More research was done than in previous reports.  I have copies of reports prepared by many eminent people, reports such as <i>Together an Island that Works</i>, written by a number of clergymen in 1987, but this is the most comprehensive report I have yet seen.  It contains much information from people who know the day-to-day problems in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Northern Ireland is a good subject to talk about but it is difficult to produce any results.  With respect to my colleagues in both Houses, many eminent people have theories about the North and have spoken eloquently about it in terms which <Col N="957" /> cannot be applied in practice.  That is the tragedy.  I am closer to the North than most people because I have been involved for a long period in cross-Border structures.  I have met people of all shades of political opinion and I hope I have learned a little.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Tánaiste's statement.  I have his speeches of 25 March, 30 June and today.  Despite the reaction of Sir Patrick Mayhew to the speech on 30 June, I welcome the speech of the Tánaiste.  There could be much debate and pontification about new approaches until the end of time but 23 years have now passed and many lives have been lost.  The sincerity of the Irish and British Governments must be made clear and they must be active and prominent.  The Tánaiste's statement on 30 June was made out of frustration at achieving nothing in promoting talks.</P>
    <P>I also support President Robinson on her visit to the North for having no restrictions placed on who she might meet or whose hand she might shake.  As someone who campaigned for another candidate in the Presidential election I am entitled to say I support her visit and her decision to meet whoever she wanted to meet on that occasion.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity to clearly state that we believed in the talks that were initiated by both Governments.  It was clear to everybody involved in those talks that there were no preconditions and no agreement until there was complete agreement.  We now find ourselves in a position of stalemate.  The hardline unionists are laying down conditions that unless we indicate the removal of Articles 2 and 3 from the Constitution they cannot participate in any negotiations for the future of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and the Taoiseach would be foolish to indicate that they would remove Articles 2 and 3.  It would be totally dishonest of any negotiator from the South to tell the people from the North that we would consider removing Articles 2 and 3.  The people would not support such a proposal in a referendum. It is the lowest type of politics for anybody to impose such a condition because <Col N="958" /> it means they do not want to participate in talks.  Therefore, some other solution must be found.  Talks will not take place until an indication is given that Articles 2 and 3 will be removed from the Constitution but it must be said that no one could deliver on such a promise.</P>
    <P>There is no way forward in the North until there is respect for justice.  Recently I visited Swatragh, County Derry, and I met honest and fair-minded people who have suffered because of the troubles. They wanted to know how justice could exist in that part of Ireland when a number of High Court judges were marching on 12 July.  I do not deny the right to march on 12 July.  In fact, I applaud those who marched in Rossnowlagh, County Donegal, and I was pleased they could march with freedom and that they did not need protection.  This indicates our attitude towards those who march on 12 July.  However, it is wrong for a High Court judge to be part of that march and, at the same time, expect the ordinary people to respect the justice administered by that system.</P>
    <P>The credibility of the justice system is fundamental to its acceptance by the minority population of the North.  Until such times as justice is accepted in the North, there will be no progress.  No solution will be acceptable unless a proper justice system is established to which people can contribute.  This must be said to everyone involved in negotiations. Everyone knows there are cases, from Gibraltar to Strabane, which we must condemn.  In certain instances the justice system is by-passed.  This is not acceptable to the reasonable and fair-minded minority population of the North.</P>
    <P>I do not support the IRA.  They have contributed to the struggle in the North, they have made life a misery for many people and nowhere is this more true than in my own county.  There are seven major military bases making my county the most peripheral part of Europe.  One cannot go into County Donegal without on the way passing soldiers and passing through sophisticated electronic systems and barbed wire.  Such a situation cannot be found anywhere else in the world. <Col N="959" /> This cannot continue to be imposed on a people who are trying to promote industry and create jobs.</P>
    <P>We have a special problem in County Donegal and we have a special interest in helping to encourage a sensible approach to the Northern problem.  I say to the Tánaiste and to those involved in negotiations that a fair justice system in the North is the fundamental foundation for negotiations.  It is not outside the bounds of possibility to establish a just system which can be recognised.  If we do this, we will have achieved part of the solution.</P>
    <P>I can instance many cases where justice was not carried out.  There is a large area in County Tyrone which could be described as a no-go area.  For three months a breadman had his bread removed from his van and thrown on the road.  Nobody apologised.  Then he was shot from behind the hedge and nobody was caught.  It was the security forces who dumped the bread on the road and after three months he was shot in his bread van.  How can one expect a minority population to support a justice system which allows this to happen?  That is only one of the many examples I could give.</P>
    <P>I welcome the contribution made by many people in the Opsahl report.  One passage states:</P>
    <P>It is evident &mdash; from the views submitted to the Opsahl Commission &mdash; that a parliamentary system of government based on the Westminster model is not and &mdash; experience has shown &mdash; was not a suitable model for the governing of a fundamentally divided society.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the courage involved in making that statement.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the statement that the &ldquo;Unionist demands for the removal of Articles 2 and 3 of the Republic's Constitution were, according to Mr. Doherty, &lsquo;unadulterated blackmail&rdquo;&rsquo;.  These are courageous statements, they had to be made.  The Opsahl report is worth a debate in this House and I welcome the opportunity to comment on it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> The relationship between Britain and Ireland has never been better.  However, throughout the years there have not been enough people in Britain who were well informed on the North.  At present, the British Government is experiencing serious difficulties and it will not attempt under any circumstances to be forward thinking on the North.  It will accept the current situation.</P>
    <P>In the past we in the South were told that the North could not or would not join us because of the North's economic prosperity.  The South is now as prosperous, if not more so, than the North.  I am proud that our medical services, our social welfare and our levels of pay are as good and in some cases better than in the North.  I was pleasantly amused to see recently in a case that I was dealing with where an old age pensioner rented a house in Donegal at the cheap rent of 50p a week.  She called on a Friday to pay the landlord the 50p and to collect her pension in County Donegal and she lived in the North.  I can say she was not collecting a pension in the North at the same time.  The old age pension was greater in the North but now unemployment benefit for a single person is £57 in the South and £32 in the North.</P>
    <P>Across the social structure our benefits are now far in advance of those in the North of Ireland so that can no longer be an argument for the hardliners who will not move an inch.  Those people are getting more isolated and it is right to focus seriously on that arrogant tribal mentality. The day is coming when the EC will see that this cannot continue.</P>
    <P>Every time there is an explosion, injury or death in the North there is a call for more security.  I fail to understand what more security means because on a bus journey between Belfast and Strabane two children counted 88 armed British soldiers and 11 armed police.  More input to security is sought from the British in the North.  At the same time we, a small island with few resources, are spending £200 million on Border security; yet, we are blamed for being complacent, and for providing a safe haven for people who <Col N="961" /> want to cross the Border to commit atrocities.</P>
    <P>We are subjected to the worst of comments after something happens in the North.  We are told we are not contributing and that we are not serious about helping with security.  That is contrary to the facts; the Garda Síochána make a major contribution.  The number of searches carried out and the number of people imprisoned in the South &mdash; many of whom came from the North &mdash; show that the authorities in the South are serious in their commitment to security. I reject the comments about a lack of will in the South.</P>
    <P>The problem must be tackled on the ground.  Many systems have been tried. I disagree with the Diplock Courts and the &ldquo;supergrass&rdquo; trials.  Until such time as there is an acceptable justice system in the North no progress will be made. All we can do is hope that reasonable people will read the Opsahl report and I hope it is made available to all who are concerned about the future of the North. I hope that as many public representatives as possible in Europe and in America get a copy of the report and that they spend time looking at it because therein lies a recommendation which if accepted would contribute to the forthcoming talks on the North.</P>
    <P>Let there be no doubt, whether it is this generation or the next there will have to be talks that bring about a solution acceptable to all on this island.  This report indicates that there is a large number of people who are prepared to sit down together and talk.  I ask the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and those involved in discussions with the British Government to lay it on the line and say that there is no lack of intent on the part of the Irish people to a commitment to resolving the problems of the North. However, there is no magic solution.  The people of the North cannot be coerced; neither can an aspiration and a tradition of the people of the South be eliminated.</P>

      <P>I echo Senator McGowan's hope that the Opsahl report will be read by all reasonable people but my hope is that it would be read by all unreasonable people also because they are the people who really need to read it and take note of its contents.  I am delighted to see in the House today Mr. Andy Pollak who edited the report; he and everyone involved in that work is to be congratulated. I most definitely commend the report to unreasonable people but I also commend this report to the Seanad which is, I hope, a body of reasonable people.</P>
      <P>I want to talk about politics with a small &ldquo;p&rdquo; in Northern Ireland and how we might help that.  While all the groups in Northern Ireland mentioned in the report are talked about as being marginalised, there is one major group across the province which was politically marginalised. That group, comprising 50 per cent of the population, was women.  The dearth of women in the political process was seen as a major loss by many of those who made submissions to the Opsahl Commission.  In contrast, the efforts of women in community groups and in voluntary groups were enormous and their impact impressive on an intra-community and an inter-community basis.  However, in politics they are invisible.</P>
      <P>In today's London <i>Independent</i> newspaper there is a letter from Professor Ruth Lister who was a member of the commission and she makes this point. She talks about tackling discrimination and inequalities on a religious basis but she also says:</P>
      <P>Class and gender inequalities must also be tackled.  Many witnesses to the commission emphasised the importance of combating poverty and deprivation in both Catholic and Protestant working class communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She also referred to the &ldquo;inspiring work, <Col N="963" /> much of it spearheaded by women&rdquo; which is going on in working class areas and the achievements made in education and training.  It is most unfortunate that there is so little contribution by women to the political process in Northern Ireland. Women have a sharp focus on practical day-to-day situations and may be more flexible in considering new ways to create the future.  Their skills and their perspective have not been utilised at a party political level in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>However low we may consider the representation of women in politics in the Republic, with 20 women in the Dáil, eight in the Seanad and one MEP, there is no woman politician from the North in Westminster or in Strasbourg.  Many of the submissions point to this as being a serious problem.  Recommendation No. 3.5 by the commission urges support and funding to help women into political life in Northern Ireland.  The report also states that the Northern Ireland Office should set targets for the number of women on public bodies and that the political parties should give higher priority to the social issues that are of particular concern to many women.</P>
    <P>I stress this because I believe women have a great recognition of the immediate and often see it as more important that the long-term.  The immediate in Northern Ireland is very important.  There is continuous concentration on the long term but the immediate term requires consideration also.</P>
    <P>Several women presented individual reports.  I was impressed by one woman who said that while she understood that there were no women involved in the talks in Northern Ireland, there should be a group of them listening who, at the intervals, would give advice to those participating.</P>
    <P>How can we in the Republic of Ireland help with this?  Several submissions to the Opsahl Commission referred to the Council for the Status of Women and its value.  Our Government is way ahead in this area and the Council for the Status of Women already has contacts with Northern women's groups, both on a <Col N="964" /> formal and an informal basis.  The council and the Northern Ireland Women's European Platform co-hosted a conference in Dublin in 1992 on partnership and participation which was also attended by our sister organisations in England, Scotland and Wales.</P>
    <P>At present the Council for the Status of Women and the Northern Ireland Women's European Platform are discussing a joint stategy in relation to the European elections in 1994 as there are important initiatives for women for the whole island at issue in this election. Women Members of the Oireachtas have indicated that they will give both organisations support, help and advice.</P>
    <P>In the long-term the building up of relationships between women in both parts of the island, with the intention of accelerating progress on women's rights through co-operation could be important. Their economic problems are as serious as ours.  Chapter 8 of the Opsahl report, entitled &ldquo;The Economy and Society I: Some Hidden Agendas&rdquo; contains a section with the heading: &ldquo;Women: the other divide&rdquo;.  The content of this section could easily mirror the situation here &mdash; frankly, at times I believe it is marginally worse.</P>
    <P>It is an exciting concept to have a flexible approach across the board regarding problems such as these and Opsahl has advocated that the energy and work of women should be harnessed throughout the island of Ireland to address these problems.  We are in a position to support this because I believe that we probably have better structures and we can make positive efforts that will help women in the whole island.</P>
    <P>One has to admire the tremendous courage of many community activists in Northern Ireland.  For example, when watching the 12 July celebrations on television last night, who could have thought, given the trouble there has been around Clogher, that they could have a prize winning brass band?  Who could have thought, looking at the names, that you could work out their religious affiliation? We in the Republic of Ireland are in a more flexible environment and the <Col N="965" /> Opsahl report constantly calls for flexibility. It is, therefore, important for us show that we are not in a state of <i>rigor mortis</i> and that we will endeavour to make progress in every area.</P>
    <P>I have stressed the position of women as I have noticed that thus far, no one else has mentioned it even though there is constant reference to it in the Opsahl report.  However, among the areas where the Republic of Ireland was given credit in the report was in the establishment of a Government Department of Equality and Law Reform.  In this respect perhaps we could urge an extension of the Fair Employment Office in the North to become a type of Ministry for Equality.</P>
    <P>The Opsahl Commission and Citizen's Inquiry did not address the issue of communications on this island.  It is incredible that people in the North are unable to receive RTE so they have little notion of what we are like.  I understand this issue was raised at a recent Anglo-Irish meeting.  At present RTE transmits into some parts of the North but permission must be obtained from the European Broadcasting Union to transmit sufficiently strong signals to ensure adequate reception of the station there. I believe our Government should approach the European Broadcasting Union to endeavour to enable RTE to broadcast to Northern Ireland, not in an attempt to take over the airwaves but to try and ensure a better unerstanding of the two cultures.  I think the British Home Office would probably support such an application.  At present, north County Down, County Antrim and Belfast are unable to receive RTE, while there is appalling reception of BBC Radio Ulster in the Republic of Ireland.  As the Mourne mountains are likely to remain where they are, it is time to consider a way of by-passing them.</P>
    <P>Some months ago the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, addressed the Irish Association meeting in the Mansion House and he spoke of the danger of looking upon the unionists as &ldquo;...lapsed members of the United Irishmen&rdquo;. I believe it is important that we do not consider the unionists in this way. <Col N="966" /> They must be thought of as Irish unionists and not &ldquo;lapsed members of the United Irishmen&rdquo;, people who somehow will come to their senses and realise we should all be together.  I hope the Tánaiste will make that speech again in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning referred to the interview given by the Tánaiste to <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper on 8 July 1993.  I am sure they were not meant to infuriate unionists but to stress the importance of movement on the political scene in the North.  I am reminded of the time the Tánaiste said that there would be a Labour Party candidate for the Presidency even if he had to run himself.  The next day all the newspapers said: &ldquo;Dick Spring to run for President.&rdquo;  In fact, the Tánaiste had said that, if necessary, he would be a candidate for the Presidency in order to ensure an election.  In the context of <i>The Guardian</i> interview I believe the Tánaiste indicated that there would have to be movement or something would have to be done by both Governments.</P>
    <P>The divisions in Northern Ireland are intra- and inter-community.  Some of these divisions, as outlined in the Opsahl report, appear to be incredible.  Roman Catholic and Protestant deaf children in Northern Ireland are taught a different sign language.  When it comes to divisions of this kind the situation is very serious. I am sure Senator Norris will deal with the causes of these divisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to my colleague Senator Henry for once again sharing some of her time with me.  We have a good amicable relationship in this matter.</P>
      <P>I welcome the initiative of Professor Torkel Opsahl and his colleagues, and especially Mr. Andy Pollack who edited the report.  I had included that in my speech before I was made aware of the fact that Mr. Pollack is in the Visitors Gallery with some of the colleagues who worked with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The title of the report is significant: &ldquo;A Citizen's Inquiry&rdquo;.  However, even more significant is the massive citizens response.  If one looks at the map of the <Col N="967" /> various towns and villages included in the report it becomes clear that a conscious effort was made to reach all sections of the community, both geographically and culturally.</P>
    <P>Like the scattering of fish food on a pond, the announcement of the inquiry produced a sudden unexpected flurry of activity as individuals and organisations, many of them previously only partly visible, rose energetically to the surface. It is interesting through all this mass of material to look for a significant pattern. The pattern is there.  Just as the motivation of fish in rising to the surface of the pond is the desire for nourishment, so it is clear from all the diverse elements in the spectrum of opinion represented here the motivation is a virtually universal desire for peace.  However, inevitably, many of those taking part seek to place conditions upon the achievement of peace and some of these, at least at first glance, are quite irreconcilable.</P>
    <P>This is the nub of the problem.  In order to achieve a workable solution, it is necessary to meet the contradictory emotional, social, political and cultural needs of two entrenched tribal groupings simultaneously.  Broadly speaking, one tribal group is Protestant with a loyalty to the Royal Family, the Union Jack, &ldquo;God Save the Queen&rdquo; and the concept of Britishness.  This is precisely the background from which I come in the Republic of Ireland, even though on my mother's side there was an old Gaelic Irish family.  Therefore, I recognise all the painful adjustments that need to be made; that painful period of adjustment was a good learning situation for myself.</P>
    <P>The other tribal group is predominantly Roman Catholic with loyalty to the President, the Tricolour, &ldquo;The Soldiers' Song&rdquo; and a 32-County Republic. One simple outline framework of a method whereby both these needs which are as much atavistic and emotional as anything else could be met would be to create in the first instance some areas of common government.  This could be achieved perhaps on a federal basis, uniting the whole island in areas where <Col N="968" /> there are clearly shared common interests distinct from those of Britain, such as agriculture, tourism, justice and energy.  This would permit the Catholic nationalist minority to feel that they were participating in a 32-County situation in which they could give loyalty to their own chosen symbols.  To balance this, the island of Ireland might rejoin the British Commonwealth of nations, a move which would validate the Britishness of those who wish to retain that connection and allow them to participate in their chosen symbolic order without violating the concept of Irishness.</P>
    <P>I am aware, having already proposed such an arrangement on several occasions, that this may be described as naive.  Nevertheless, I am convinced that without some such structure that is capable of satisfying simultaneously two apparently irreconcilable emotional requirements, it will be virtually impossible to proceed towards peace.  I can remember saying this, almost in a deliberately provocative manner to my then colleague Senator Ó Cuív, de Valera's grandson, to see what he would say and he said the idea had a lot of sense.  I asked him what his grandfather would say, expecting that he would be spinning in his grave at the prospect and he replied his grandfather had actually suggested that to Fianna Fáil at one stage.  This is a possibility that might be explored, even though in outline as I presented it, it may be naive.  One of the most significant sentences in the Opsahl report confirms me in this view, where it is stated &ldquo;Simple majorities do not work in a divided society.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This kind of notion is further put in context in the Opsahl reort by the contribution of Dr. Ronny Swain from University College, Cork, in explaining the so-called GRIT Strategy, Graduated and Reciprocated Initiatives in Tension Reduction.  This was devised in 1962 as a means of reducing tension between the United States and the Soviet Union.  This GRIT Strategy was employed by President Kennedy 16 times and on each occasion President Khrushchev reciprocated <Col N="969" /> within 24 hours.  Dr. Swain explains the mechanism as follows:</P>
    <P>Suppose that you and I are negotiating about some issue fundamental to our interests.  Instead of demanding that you change your position as a precondition to progress, I announce my intention to make a small concession; I then do so in such a way that the action is publicly verifiable.  Taking the action involves a small risk for me, but does not entail a major erosion of my position.</P>
    <P>I then invite you to reciprocate, but do not demand that you do so.  If you engage in behaviour which escalates tension, I retaliate but only sufficiently to restore the <i>status quo</i> before continuing with my conciliatory strategy. As I persevere with my initiatives, it becomes more and more likely that you will make similar concessions. With each exchange of concessions, trust grows and tension is reduced.</P>
    <P>The next contribution in the report, by Mr. Michael Farrell who has a distinguished history of participation in nonviolent civil rights movements, underpins this approach where he says:</P>
    <P>I think a cessation of violence is most likely to come about through some kind of dialogue with those involved [in paramilitary groups] or their political allies.  However, an end to the campaigns of violence or even a lessening in their intensity would certainly help the process of discussion about the ultimate future of the area.  Perhaps the most practical scenario would be a graduated but steady deescalation of the violence, and the security measures which mirror and/or provoke it, resulting in a building up of confidence on all sides.</P>
    <P>So the GRIT Strategy and the view of Mr. Farrell are very close indeed.</P>
    <P>I regard it as inevitable that Sinn Féin would be involved at some stage in the discussions leading to a peaceful resolution. I welcome the fact that John Hume of the SDLP has taken the courageous step of talking and continuing to <Col N="970" /> talk to Gerry Adams of Sinn Féin, although I think that he was most unwise to issue a joint communique of the kind released after an early stage of the talks. Moreover, it seems clear from recent opinion polls that there is overwhelming support for the action of Mary Robinson in briefly encountering the leader of Sinn Féin, Mr. Adams.  It would have been most extraordinary and led to a further abnormalisation of the situation had she declined to do so.  It is apparently being ignored that there was at least as much political risk for Mr. Adams in acknowledging President Robinson as the other way around.  As far as the shaking hands aspect of the incident is concerned, this was not only a human, courteous and Christian thing to do but it also had the virtue of keeping at least one of Mr. Adams' hands occupied.  In the light of the Sinn Féin slogan about the ballot box and the armalite, I sincerely hope and believe that it may have been the hand that held the armalite that was momentarily disarmed.</P>
    <P>If one looks to recent political history in this State, one cannot but note the fact that it is the section of the republican movement that perpetrated one of the worst terrorist outrages in the Aldershot bombing that has made the transition successfully from IRA activity of a negative, counterproductive and inhumane kind to an active and valuable participation in the democratic process.  I speak here of the party that has now become the Democratic Left.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me that however distasteful their actions, a time must come when one must deal with the principals involved in the Northern troubles.  They should be encouraged to participate ever more in the democratic process and, for this reason, I have for many years opposed section 31 of the Broadcasting Act.  One must, after all, be consistent. If one seeks to entice dissident elements into democratic channels one cannot simultaneously deny them access to freedom of political expression however much one may disagree with the politics they seek to express.  Those who have been elected by the will of the people at local or <Col N="971" /> national level have got to be dealt with if one is not to be dangerously <i>á la carte</i> about the meaning of democracy.</P>
    <P>Few governments are hesitant about dealing with those whose behaviour they may privately consider criminal if and when it suits their interests.  One notes also that the British Government, so delicate of meeting with Mr. Adams, is quite happy to arm the Indonesian tyrant and assist in the genocide of the people of East Timor and to train the personnel of the Khmer Rouge who are also engaged in genocide against their own people, two million of whom died in the killing fields. It is, therefore, clearly not on a matter of principle that the British Government refuse to deal with those it regards as murderers.  Closer to home, a recent investigation suggesting a link between British Intelligence and the carnage of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974 must raise serious questions about the involvement of sections of the British military in behaviour that is completely and utterly unacceptable.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there is no doubt whatever that the Provisional IRA, supported by Sinn Féin, have been engaged for years past in nothing other than a sectarian civil war.  They have systematically eliminated young Protestant farmers along the Border, often the sons of widowed mothers, in isolated farm houses.  They have also systematically murdered those Catholics prepared to join in the RUC so that they can hypocritically declare the RUC to be a sectarian police force.</P>

      <P>I have grown up listening to the horror stories emanating from Northern Ireland.  It has gone on for so long that I wonder if the Irish people are depressed, weary and indifferent about Northern Ireland at this stage.  Then something happens and we start to look again from a different angle and a different perspective.  That is what the Opsahl report achieves; it breaks through the monotony and the deafening silence that has been forced on events in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report is different and this was referred to earlier.  The difference is evident from its title, &ldquo;A Citizens' Inquiry&rdquo;. The report is the result of a unique experiment in that it actually occurred to the powers that be to ask the people who live in Northern Ireland what they thought about their situation.  It publishes the ideas of people in all walks of life and of different persuasions.  In it we see the views of paramilitaries, women from the Falls Road and the Shankill, children, community activists and many others.  It is all too easy to pigeonhole people whether as unionist or nationalist, <Col N="973" /> Protestant or Catholic, and see it as black and white.</P>
    <P>This report is an enlightening experience for those who have time to read it. Anybody who believes that we have run out of ideas on Northern Ireland should immediately take up this report where ideas are endless.  For instance, Fr. Denis Faul rightly identifies the lack of local democracy and calls for the setting up of a number of county councils with a major voice in social services, environmental services, tourism, education, health, industrial development and other areas. A major issue identified in the report is the evident lack of accountability by the ruling powers in Northern Ireland.  Many people interviewed in this inquiry felt deprived of the basic political right to choose the members of their own legislative forum.  It is obvious that one of the effects of direct rule is the distance placed between those who make executive decisions and those who are affected by those decisions.</P>
    <P>The political system in Northern Ireland is undemocratic.  Those appointed by the Westminster administration to run the affairs of Northern Ireland are not answerable in any way to the people who live there.  Obviously, this leads to dissatisfaction.  In many countries, dissatisfaction with government is not unusual but in Northern Ireland it is more than dangerous as it leaves a vacuum into which the representatives of Sinn Féin, the UDA and others have jumped.  These groups have harnessed discontent in a politically successful way.  This is because Sinn Féin and others have not yielded to moral, political or church pressure to follow accepted patterns of behaviour.  The lack of establishment accountability has given rise to Sinn Féin's street credibility in giving advice to an alienated constituency. This is clearly identified in the report.  There are many options regarding what we should have in its place, such as different forms of PR elections and councils for Northern Ireland, but I will not go into those in any detail because I do not have the time.</P>
    <P>The Opsahl report achieved a lot just <Col N="974" /> by expressing the ideas and suggestions of the people who live there, but it will achieve more by coaching, embarrassing and encouraging the powers that be to look at themselves again, their role in Northern Ireland and their ability to tackle the complicated web that is the North.  That is why I am encouraged by this report.  Matters relating to the region are often discussed, and decisions made, in the absence of those who live there. This report is worthy of the highest commendation because it asked the ordinary people of Northern Ireland what they thought of their situation.  That is a start and I hope it marks a commencement of new thinking in dealing with Northern Ireland.  We must remember that those living there cannot democratically remove from power those who make the decisions which govern their lives.  It is no wonder that non-constitutional parties thrive in a system where the decision-making power never has to face the electorate. That must be rectified if we are to reach a political solution.</P>
    <P>On another level, the problems of Northern Ireland are exacerbated by the housing and educational apartheid that exists there. These factors deepen fears, create mistrust and widen the divide between communities which, when viewed from another angle, have so much in common.  The Opsahl Commission suggests that the housing executive should examine the feasibility of setting up a number of pilot integrated housing schemes, with subsidised rents and other support mechanisms to encourage people.  I raised this matter with concillors representing both the SDLP and the OUP last weekend at a Labour Party youth conference in Carlingford, County Louth, and the suggestion received worthy support.</P>

      <P>I wish to proceed, in an <Col N="975" /> unsatisfactory manner, to deal with this issue.  I would have preferred if the motion that my party had put before the House was accepted because we were calling on the Government to change their mind on the strategy plan for three reasons.  We did this because of the damage and the loss to the families of between 1,500 and 2,500 people who will lose their jobs as a result of this plan. Secondly, it also represents the reckless sabotage of the economy of the mid-western region and, thirdly, it signals the absence of a Government aviation policy. The plan is a product of the same discredited Aer Lingus management that, within three years, has reduced a once proud and profitable airline to a debtridden shambles, with projected losses this year of £116 million and a total debt of £540 million.</P>
      <P>Is there no one in Aer Lingus, the Department of Transport or at Cabinet level to be held responsible for this disaster, any more than anyone was held responsible for the £17 million that disappeared in Aer Lingus Holidays?  Who made the key decisions that brought about this disaster?  Will no one pay for the incompetence and the almost criminal mismanagement that resulted in this situation?  Are the penalties that are due elsewhere now to be borne by the work-force and the economy of the mid-western region and indeed, by a few politicians of principle and integrity, such as Deputies Killeen and de Valera and their 17 colleagues in County Clare?</P>
      <P>The proposal to shed 1,500 jobs is a cynical exercise to shift the blame to the wrong people.  We were told redundancies would be voluntary and Labour Deputies put on a great show in the Dáil last week saying that there would be no compulsory redundancies.  However, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, said in the same debate that there would be no compulsory redundancies in so far as it was possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned with the easy acceptance of the clearly flawed recommendations of Aer Lingus with regard to <Col N="976" /> the status of Shannon.  The figures in their report on the operational costs of their north Atlantic route were clearly contrived to support an anti-Shannon position and I condemn the weakness and the readiness of the Government to sabotage the economy of that area on what they knew were contrived figures. Aer Lingus, to bolster its anti-Shannon lies, added costs on to the Shannon gateway that did not belong to it.  For example, the lease-out and depreciation costs of the two 767's acquired for the Los Angeles route, which were never used, were charged to the Shannon-New York route.  This cost alone represented a major element of the supposed losses of the north Atlantic route.  Fares totalling £2 million, which were paid on the Dublin-Shannon and the Shannon-Dublin legs of the north Atlantic route were credited to the intra-European routes and their costs were charged to the Shannon north Atlantic operation. The profits from traffic handling in Shannon and New York were not credited to this route but to ancillary activities instead.</P>
    <P>For many years, Aer Lingus carried out a well-organised conspiracy against the status of Shannon.  The Minister willingly and knowingly accepted this and has immersed himself in that conspiracy. Representatives of Shannon made this known to the Minister in recent weeks and it was done by reputable people in organisations, but he has ignored them. They supplied figures and provided information which questioned the basis of Aer Lingus' case against Shannon.  The Minister ignored them, just as he has ignored the actions of the chairman of Aer Lingus in refusing to accept his own directive to prepare a rescue plan in accordance with the Government's decision in relation to Shannon on October 1992.</P>
    <P>What will be the effects on Shannon? The US Immigration Service based there, the only one in Europe and, therefore, capable of development and expansion, is likely to close because of insufficient numbers.  It is impossible to maintain the basic number of 350,000 people per annum passing through it without the <Col N="977" /> stopover.  Its establishment was opposed by Aer Lingus because they recognised that it anchored the position of Shannon and was against their long-held desire to withdraw from there.</P>
    <P>Is Aer Lingus' long term strategy to withdraw from Shannon?  By abandoning Shannon and opening up the Dublin-New York route, they can then sell out its north Atlantic interest to an American airline that would serve Dublin only.  Aer Lingus knows that the Government cannot renegotiate the bilateral agreement with the Government of the United States without opening up the Dublin-New York route to American carriers. Aer Lingus have shown they are totally incapable of dealing with competition and renegotiating the agreement is an invitation to an American carrier to take them out of the north Atlantic route.  No one in Shannon has been taken in by the crude public relations effort of stationing a couple of ageing and shortly to be scrapped 747s in Shannon for a few years. The industrial base and the tourism industry that developed from Shannon in the mid-west and along the western coast is now to be sacrificed for a doubtful result.</P>
    <P>It has not been shown that Shannon's status has contributed to Aer Lingus' financial difficulties, except on the basis of contrived figures.  It is a sad day for democracy when a Government allows the chairman of a semi-State body to regard with impunity the expressed instructions of the Minister and accepts <i>in toto</i> the conclusion of the report, which was based on contrived figures.  Tourism traffic will be transferred from the mid-west to Dublin.  The main plank of regional policy, and the only successful one in the west, will be gone and direct flights to Dublin, promoted by Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte in the United States, will be to the detriment of the Shannon area and the west.</P>
    <P>This is a false plan.  Its authors are largely the same team who have destroyed Aer Lingus over a few years and its unquestioned acceptance by the Government is a recognition that incompetence, mismanagement and reckless <Col N="978" /> administration in the semi-State sector deserves reward.  The redundancy figure referred to at the moment is something over 1,500, but this ignores the fact that every part of Aer Lingus, except the core air traffic business, is on the market. When the subsidiaries are sold, nobody can guarantee that further redundancies will not take place.  The figure of 1,500 is the minimum that can be projected at this stage, but with the disposal of the subsidiaries that figure will probably increase by at least 1,000.  Many thousands of jobs in industry, tourism and construction in my area are at stake.</P>
    <P>I would like to develop a number of points in relation to this matter, but this afternoon's vote allowed the Government to limit the amount of time devoted to a discussion on this important issue. They took refuge in procedural technicalities to deny this House the opportunity effectively to discuss and put forward an alternative plan for the benefit of those who will lose their jobs in Aer Lingus and for the economic benefit of the region I represent.  The Minister knows this is a disaster.  Figures were supplied to him from the Shannon region which undermined the credibility of that report, but he refused to accept them.</P>
    <P>The only thing I can give the Minister credit for in this sorry episode is that he has single-handedly undermined and shattered the most successful party machine Fianna Fáil had in the country. It is a sad day for Aer Lingus and the economic development of my region and no amount of waffle will conceal these facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cahill plan for Aer Lingus focuses almost exclusively on cost cutting proposals to resolve and restore the financial viability of the company. Nobody will question the need for financial viability, particularly those in the Shannon and the mid-west region, but the role of management extends way beyond cost cutting, however urgent that may be.  The viability of Aer Lingus, like any other enterprise, cannot be achieved unless there is a well researched and dynamic forward plan for future development. <Col N="979" /> Those charged with the development and implementation of that plan must have a high level of professional competence and imagination given the highly competitive nature of the aviation business.  I question whether those at the helm have experience of or competence in the highly competitive aviation business.</P>
      <P>They must also have the loyalty and support of the workers which is based on mutual confidence and respect for leadership, as is the case in any enterprise.  That has always been a feature, if not a unique feature, of Shannon under the direction and guidance of Brendan O'Regan, his successors and associates in management. It has been a primary example of the kind of commitment and determination we want to see throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I know County Clare.  I was a student there from 1948 to 1953.  I have seen what has been achieved and I will not tolerate any undermining of that special achievement. Shannon has been built and sustained through many difficulties and challenges by the readiness of all involved to row in behind enlightened and concerned leadership.  This leadership has always worked in common purpose with Aer Lingus in recognition of the mutual interdependence of Shannon, the region, Aer Lingus and the country, as Brendan O'Regan recently underlined.  That same spirit of mutual determination and planning must now be put in place and pursued confidently in the changing international aviation environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret to say there is no evidence in the Cahill plan of such dynamic forward thinking.  Mr. Cahill has experience of rationalisation in Siúcra Éireann and now in Greencore.  Unlike Siúcra Éireann &mdash; and I was involved at that point &mdash; or Greencore as it is now called, Aer Lingus and Shannon do not have the comfortable cushion of a guaranteed protected quota.  During that period, under Mr. Cahill's chairmanship, Siúcra Éireann did not seek new options for the development of alternative products from sugar beet, despite my requests to them to do <Col N="980" /> so and the introduction of partners interested in joint ventures.  Instead, they relied on a so-called rationalisation programme involving closures and the shedding of jobs to reduce labour costs. Aer Lingus and Shannon cannot survive, much less develop, with such a narrow based strategy.  What is needed is an outward looking and confident strategy that is not evident at this time.  The question must be asked, rhetorically or otherwise, are the chairman and the board suitably equipped and qualified to meet this challenge? I am not aware of anything in their background, particularly that of the chairman, to suggest that they have this unique and necessary qualification.</P>
    <P>It is time to seek new and profitable links with Europe from Shannon and the rest of the country, given the unique attraction of Ireland, particularly the west for tourists and tourist-based activities. Has any thought been given to developing Shannon as an international co-operation centre in view of Ireland's prominent role internationally in development co-operation and the fund of goodwill that exists towards Ireland in developing countries?  There is an international co-operation desk at Shannon Airport, but it is not sponsored by Aer Lingus.  It is sponsored by those who have always and will always believe in Shannon, those closely associated with the development and building of Shannon. Will Aer Lingus build on that special link?</P>
    <P>There was no consultation with Shannon or the entire mid-west region prior to the meeting on 26 June at which the chairman, Mr. Cahill outlined the plan. What thought was given to the fact that there are 449 flights each week to 23 locations in the US direct from London? This explains why 55 per cent of transAtlantic traffic is routed via London.</P>
    <P>Recently &mdash; and may I add, belatedly because I brought this to the company's attention some time ago &mdash; Aer Lingus has at last become involved in common fare ratings from distance locations such as Japan and Australia.  It is a great incentive for people to travel from these destinations to countries in Europe involved <Col N="981" /> in this programme.  For example, a tourist from Japan or Australia may book from Tokyo, Sydney or Melbourne through Lufthansa, Sabena or Air France, not only to Germany, Belgium or France, but at the same fare and at the same time to other locations in Europe that are part of the common fare rating.  The one exception was Aer Lingus.  One arrived in Paris, Frankfurt or Brussels and had to pay Aer Lingus to fly to Ireland.  How did that affect the development of tourism and Aer Lingus?  A short term advantage was achieved at great long term cost.</P>
    <P>The failure of Aer Lingus to become involved in this over the years can be seen in the dearth of tourists from such locations to Ireland.  Japanese tourists are queuing up to play golf in Belgium, of all places.  We have more good golf courses in one county than they have in the entire country.  Why are these people not queuing up for recreational activity holidays in Ireland when we have many more attractions and facilities than those on offer anywhere else in Europe?</P>
    <P>The development of Shannon is not just about Shannon Airport or County Clare.  It is about the determination and confidence of people in any place which as recently as 40 or 50 years ago was regarded as a depressed area.  It is about a dynamic regional development policy which has been successful to date and which should be the pilot scheme for all regional development programmes throughout the country.  It does not make sense to undermine what has been successful; rather we should follow it in a confident and a vigorous fashion in all regions.</P>
    <P>The motion as proposed does not have my support.  I do not condemn the Government for dealing with the plan that has been proposed.  The executive chairman who was chairman was apparently unaware of the financial implications of the proposals then made, to the extent that when he did become aware of the situation in his capacity of executive director, he could justify that as being a change of the overall strategy which originally envisaged maintaining Shannon. I cannot see how any chairman <Col N="982" /> worthy of the name should not be in a position to get all of the information, whether he is executive or not, and in an executive position, without the necessary experience in the aviation area and without respect for the kind of dynamism that we all know is part of Shannon, I am not so confident that that man and that plan will realise the potential that is there in Shannon airport.</P>

      <P>This is the only plan on the table.  It is definitely the one the Government will implement.  We must recognise that reality.  However one might disagree with particular aspects of the plan, unfortunately it is clear that any survival plan for Aer Lingus will look something like this one.  I wish to draw attention to one of the main mistakes which contributed to this regrettable situation.  If we recognise and acknowledge our mistakes then we may avoid making the same mistakes again in the future.  If we do not recognise our mistakes, then we condemn ourselves to making them again.</P>
      <P>The most serious mistake made in the past few years in Aer Lingus was that it was allowed and encouraged by successive Governments to take on more people than it needed from a strictly commercial point of view.  The result was that eventually the airline became totally uncompetitive and non-viable and required the surgery we see in this plan. Other mistakes were made but I suggest that this was the central one, and it is the mistake which carries the most important lesson for the future in regard to other situations.  Instead of taking people on only when it was commercially necessary, Aer Lingus became a tool of Government jobs policy.  Government policy was to create jobs and State companies were used for that purpose.  Not only were the jobs so created non-viable but they dragged other jobs down with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when competitive forces <Col N="983" /> were strengthening in the marketplace and when the market itself was shrinking, Aer Lingus was adding people to the pay roll.  That is commercial suicide in any business and the proof is before us today. Sooner or later the reality of the marketplace catches up with companies who do that and the later it happens the bigger the price that must be paid.  Today, therefore is an unhappy day when we see a loss of a potential 1,500 jobs, but it needs to be said that it is not possible to create jobs.  No Government or company can do that.  It is possible to create opportunities for serving customers' needs in a competitive way.  From that, and only from that, sill jobs flow, but if a company is reckless enough to create jobs independently of customers' needs, then that company is creating a serious threat to the viability of the business and eventually to those jobs.</P>
    <P>It has been Government policy for a long time that State companies contribute to the job creation effort by taking on as many extra people as they can.  I am governor of a Dublin hospital and I remember during the 1970s we used to receive a letter each month from the Department of Health asking us how many people we had taken on in the hospital as part of the Government job creation project.  This policy was stopped in the health services during cutbacks in the 1980s, however, the mentality unfortunately persisted in other commercial State companies.  That mentality persisted in the case of Aer Lingus with the result that we see today.</P>
    <P>If we do not keep the number of jobs in a State company strictly in line with the commercial needs of the marketplace, the eventual correction that has to be made will be much more drastic.  It is not just a question of putting off the evil day; what we do is make the evil day much worse when it eventually comes, and by then it is far too late to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>A truth we may not yet be ready to listen to but which I hope we are ready for is that jobs cannot be created.  Jobs that are not justified commercially by <Col N="984" /> the needs of the marketplace cannot be artificially maintained.  We should make sure that this mistake which has brought Aer Lingus to the present state is not repeated elsewhere.  How many other similar situations exist in the business world?  We should concentrate our attention on ensuring that no other such situations are allowed to continue, while we still have a chance of influencing the outcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief as I am not an expert on this area.  I listened with great interest to Senator Quinn, as I am sure we all did, and I agree in principle with him.  Creating jobs which cannot be sustained by the needs of the marketplace is a counter-productive policy which ultimately results in greater hardship, disappointment and dismay. However, I query the Senator's implication that the needs of the marketplace are somehow objectively decided out there.  He himself has shown in his own business that needs are not something given, that needs can be created to some extent, and that high quality management can affect the demand for one's services.</P>
      <P>I do not want to become involved in the question of the quality of Aer Lingus management.  Much of that is water under the bridge now, how far it was a question of management and how far it was a question of almost illegitimate Government pressure.  If I understood Senator O'Kennedy correctly, he was at least partly arguing that certain opportunities were not seized by management, and that there other opportunities could be seized by management in the future if that management were of adequate calibre.  That must be the case in as dynamic and highly competitive an area as air transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am speaking mainly because of my concern for regional development.  The Aer Lingus situation is now essentially one of crisis management and the only aviation policy we have as far as I can see and perhaps the only feasible one in the short term, is one of crisis management. That is the problem confronting the Minister <Col N="985" /> and the Government, but there seems to be very little connection between the policy of the State-sponsored company involved.  Government policy towards it, and the problem of regional development.  They seem to occur in almost two parallel sealed tunnels.  I do not know whether this is the responsibility of any individual, and I am not blaming any individual, but it seems to me that Government policy in general, which we have heard time and again suffers from fragmentation in a range of areas, is particularly vulnerable when an issue of this type arises where there are two legitimate conflicting criteria, the financial viability of the company on the one hand and the question of regional development on the other.</P>
    <P>It is a pity Shannon should be suffering this body blow because it has been the engine of development in the mid-west region.  In the Culliton report, for instance, one of the few specific proposals for regional development singled out the idea of cluster development in Shannon.</P>
    <P>The implications of what is now in store for Shannon and the mid-west region in general seem potentially frightening to me.  It may be that in the heat of the moment representatives of the area may exaggerate the possible impact, but that impact is certainly frightening.  I cannot see any evidence that the implications have been thought through, in so far as they can be, and that a supplementary regional policy dimension is being put in place.  I do not mean task forces and the like; they take the heat off the immediate problem but do not confront the issue for years.  It is not only in the area of overloading State-sponsored companies with unsustainable demands from Government for job creation, but also in trying to find a link between the policy of State-sponsored companies and regional development, that the lessons of this unfortunate debacle can be drawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is anger and sorrow in the mid-west, not only over the past week but going back a few months.  The sorrow is that we see our fine region almost brought to its knees by fears that <Col N="986" /> the key to regional development is going to be partially removed from us.</P>
      <P>The anger is far stronger.  It manifested itself publicly at a meeting that was held in Shannon when Mr. Cahill came down to speak to public representatives.  Those who were there with me will probably agree that we were never more publicly humiliated or insulted than we were that evening.  It was because the decisions had already been made and our opinions simply did not matter.  Many of us there were county councillors and, as a county councillor I represent at least 1,000 people.  My views were ignored, therefore, the views of 1,000 people whom I represent were equally ignored.  Their view is that Shannon is important to the economy not only of the mid-west but of the west, south-west, and north-west.  In fact, the whole western seaboard feels that a link is being broken that will never be replaced.</P>
      <P>A recent survey of US-based industry in the mid-west showed that about 89 per cent of companies indicated that Shannon airport was a significant influence on their initial decision to set up in the region.  Many of these companies are desperately dependent on that link with the US.  My sister works in such a company and without that link I am not too sure her job or the jobs of her colleagues are safe.  Some 51 per cent of those companies indicated that they would not have located in the region but for Shannon airport.  Over 80 per cent of them indicated also that Shannon was crucial for the ongoing development and future viability of their companies, and that they would not consider long term investment in the Shannon area but for the guarantee that was given to them that the status of Shannon would be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The package presented by Mr. Cahill and his team contained no options.  There was no room for manoeuvre.  It was a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; situation, Hobson's choice.  I and many members of my party, would have been much happier if there had been a closer look at alternatives. I would also like to have seen a study undertaken on the regional implications of this plan which seems to focus narrowly <Col N="987" /> on Aer Lingus and its future without taking the wider implications into consideration.  Those implications may, in the long term, be as important as the future of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Our market has been too narrow.  We have allowed ourselves to look westwards too much when we should have been looking to the east and developing markets there.  By that I mean Europe, eastern Europe, into Russia and Asia.  As Senator O'Kennedy pointed out, the market is there but we have not developed it.</P>
    <P>My one ray of hope is that a management team will be set up to manage Shannon and its traffic.  Shannon has not been fully marketed or developed by Aer Lingus.  In fact, there have been many public indications of how Aer Lingus and its pilots have deliberately sabotaged Shannon.  They have deliberately overflown the airport at times when there was no need to do so.  They have given all kinds of excuses, including adverse winds on the runways, when people on the ground waiting for passengers to arrive saw other planes take off.  If a plane can take off I cannot see why a plane cannot land.  There have been numerous examples of this and I have one personal experience of it.  Shannon has been sabotaged at times.  It is essential that Shannon should have its own management team.</P>
    <P>In the mid-west area we have shown that when SFADCo got around to managing our affairs it did remarkably well, so well that it is the envy of other regions who are calling for their own regional development agency.  It is that local expertise which, if applied to Shannon and its traffic, will ensure that Shannon continues as a vital link between the region and the outside world.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to reconsider the entire regional aspect of this problem between now and the time it takes to negotiate deregulation with the US authorities. We all acknowledge that Aer Lingus is losing money daily, and that is a situation that cannot be allowed to continue.  We ask the Minister, however, <Col N="988" /> to please take a look at the effect this is going to have on the entire region before we finally commit ourselves to deregulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cahill plan for Aer Lingus cannot and will not work. It is a document hastily drafted by the company's board of management, and we all know that this group of people are now panicking for their own survival. Unfortunately, before they pulled this plan together they did not engage in any type of consultation either with the unions and workers in Dublin and Shannon or the various interested parties in the west, mid-west and along the west coast.</P>
      <P>The plan fails on a regional development examination.  No mesurement whatever has been taken of the effect of the plan, if implemented, on the social and economic fibre of Dublin and the mid-west region.  This is fundamental to any national strategy.  The plan is a subjective interpretation by the board and management of Aer Lingus who have grossly mismanaged that company's affairs over the past three to four years. The Cahill plan proposes an equity injection of £175 million.  About eight months ago the same Mr. Cahill proposed an equity injection of over £400 million for Aer Lingus.  How can the Minister justify, or indeed accept this proposal, from a man who has proposed such disparate figures in such a short time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must question a Government, which claims that jobs are its top priority, when it proposes that £43 million of the £175 million equity be used to make 1,500 people in Aer Lingus unemployed. Where is the commitment to jobs?  Where is the sincerity of the pre-election promises to the people of Dublin, Clare, the mid-west and western regions by both parties in Government and on which they are now reneging?  Fine Gael totally rejects this plan.  The proposers of the plan have produced neither market research nor financial projections to illustrate how their proposal to divide Aer Lingus into four business centres will rescue the company.  The plan is full of <Col N="989" /> hopes and aspirations but it is founded on little substance.  On close examination the hopes and expectations of the plan do not add up and cannot be substantiated. It is clear that baggage handling, catering, Cara and Parc will be privatised and sold.</P>
    <P>A decision to change the status of Shannon will have a catastrophic effect on Clare, the mid-west region and the west coast of Ireland.  The cornerstone of regional development in the area will be removed and tourist traffic will be tunnelled to Dublin and to an already overloaded infrastructure.  The future of industrial companies, from Cork and Castleisland in the south to Loughrea in the north, will be put in jeopardy.  Many of these companies depend for their existence on early morning flights into Shannon. Changing the status of Shannon immediately threatens 1,500 jobs in the industrial sector in the west and mid-west region.  In addition to that, over 2,500 jobs will be threatened in the ancillary services and the tourist sector.  The Government must reject this proposal.</P>
    <P>When announcing her decision last November the then Minister involved, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, said that she was maintaining the transatlantic status of Shannon because she was satisfied, on sound economic, social and regional grounds, that it was in the best interest of the nation.  She went on to say that the status of Shannon was a fundamental issue, as was the issue of jobs, and that interference with the status of Shannon would jeopardise jobs.  How can the Government now say that this has changed fundamentally during the past six months?  Is the Minister now telling us that a change of status will not jeopardise these jobs?</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has claimed that Shannon created extra costs.  That is untrue.  Two thirds of all passengers coming into Ireland disembark at Shannon and the Shannon stop is the most economic way of meeting this cost.  In addition, revenue in excess of £2 million is generated by Aer Lingus from passengers who travel on transatlantic flights between Shannon and Dublin.  If Shannon created extra <Col N="990" /> costs, how can Aer Lingus pretend it will save money by flying Shannon-Dublin-New York-Dublin-Shannon?  How can the Minister say the company will save money when, in some instances, it will cost more to fuel in Dublin direct flights from Dublin to New York than to fuel in Shannon?  Where is the reduction in cost there?  I have yet to get an explanation and when we had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Cahill and his people in Shannon they were unable to answer any question put to them.  I concur with Senator Kelly's comments in that regard.</P>
    <P>Misleading statements have been made in relation to the higher proportion of Irish-bound traffic travelling through London and Manchester.  This is due to the greater number of access points in the United States.  Aer Lingus and the Government should attempt to negotiate additional access points for Aer Lingus in the US.  Instead, they are undermining their trump card, namely, the bilateral agreement.  Shannon and the Irish tourism industry need more connection in relation to the bilateral agreement.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Government is being led by the board and the management of Aer Lingus, a group which, because of its inaction in the past three to four years, is ridiculed as a disaster in the semi-State sector.  Our sympathy goes to the unfortunate workers of Aer Lingus who are victims of this mismanagement and of the lack of political action on the part of the Minister's predecessors, in particular the former Minister, Deputy Séamus Brennan, who failed to take any action on Aer Lingus.  If he had taken the action that was required over two years ago Aer Lingus could now be in a strong position in the European context.</P>
    <P>Shannon, the mid-west and the west coast of Ireland have been betrayed.  The Government's hasty, unplanned and unstructured proposed reversal of the Shannon stopover has taken away the region's main negotiating card and the cornerstone of regional development. The plan is not part of an overall aviation policy or part of a transport policy. Therefore, there is no framework to make decisions about Aer Lingus or any <Col N="991" /> other transport matter.  At best this plan will only provide short term relief for Aer Lingus.  It does nothing to help the company to adapt to the realities of the air travel market in Europe or in North America.  Aer Lingus urgently needs links, agreements or joint ventures with other companies.  An airline that is close to insolvency and which needs Government assistance to sort out its balance sheet is not in a good position to make such agreements.  It has nothing to offer potential partners except routes and they can be taken over by serious competition.</P>
    <P>The Government must reverse this decision to adopt the Cahill plan.  The plan was drawn up without consultation and without examination of the social and economic effects on the regions, particularly the Clare, mid-west and western regions.  It was drawn up in haste and after a subjective interpretation of company accounts.  The Minister has been misleading in his statements during the past week, in suggesting that there is an urgency to change the status of Shannon because the change cannot occur for at least 12 months.  I call on the Minister to look again at the calibre of the people who make this proposal, people who have proved their inability by their failure to manage their own company. It would be foolhardy of the Minister or the Government to be led by such people on a fundamental issue of regional policy.  If the Minister pursues the proposed plan there will be economic disaster in the entire mid-west and western region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to ensure the commercial future of our national airline as part of our overall air transport policy. This has been the Government's primary objective in its consideration of the serious financial position of Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's decision to endorse the broad strategy for the future of Aer Lingus, prepared by the board, was taken in the context of the unprecedented crisis <Col N="992" /> facing the airline which called for a fundamental change of course.  The general thrust of the Aer Lingus strategy is to restore the company to a strong and viable position at the core of Irish aviation.  As shareholder, the Government will make a major contribution to the achievement of this goal.</P>
    <P>While we can be justly proud of Aer Lingus' past contribution to the national-economy and of its aviation expertise, we must be equally aware that past achievements alone will do nothing to revive the company's fortunes.  We must not lose sight of the fact that this is a commercial company operating in a tough international environment.  Its competitor airlines must operate in accordance with strict commercial criteria to survive.  Aer Lingus is no different in that regard.  It must face up to the situation in which it now finds itself in order to safeguard its future prospects.</P>
    <P>The airline's annual internal operating costs must be reduced by £50 million in order to restore it to day-to-day commercial viability.  Now that the extensive public debate on Aer Lingus' problems has taken place and the political decisions have been made, it is up to the management and unions in the company to come up with the necessary cost savings in the negotiations which are now starting. This crucial aspect of the strategy must be tackled with the utmost urgency if the company is to secure its own future. The Government has already approved a voluntary retirement severance package to help achieve this.  How precisely it is to be achieved in terms of the £50 million cost reduction, is a matter for negotiation between the two parties.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Labour Relations Commission has been asked to give advice on the best industrial relations practice to be followed.  The involvement of the Labour Relations Commission, with its expertise, will ensure that meaningful negotiations can take place with a view to the urgent resolution of the issues involved.  As I have already stated, these negotiations must be accelerated in the interests of saving the company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="993" /> The strategy which Aer Lingus management has had to devise, and the Government's decision to broadly endorse it, did not involve easy choices. Time is fast running out and the time has come to act in order to save Aer Lingus and to preserve its role at the centre of Irish aviation.</P>
    <P>In taking its decision, the Government noted that at a meeting between the Cabinet sub-committee on aviation matters and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 22 June last, it was recognised and agreed that: the underlying financial position of the company was very grave and unsustainable; the core airline business would have to be returned to operating viability; all sides are committed to achieving the reduction in numbers required in Aer Lingus through a voluntary scheme; the question of participation by Aer Lingus employees in the future success of the company should be explored as a tangible form of recognition for the additional contribution being asked of the workforce at present; a special enterprise development unit would be set up immediately, to consist of representatives of the unions and Aer Lingus, together with the IDA, Fingal Council, FÁS, and the Department of Enterprise and Employment, to identify new employment opportunities within the Aer Lingus structure.  I want to reaffirm here and now the Government's commitment to fully honouring this agreement with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>The Government, as shareholder, has agreed to invest £175 million of taxpayers' money in support of Aer Lingus' strategy, £75 million in the current year and £50 million in each of the next two years.  The payment of these equity injections would be futile without the other key elements of the strategy being in place.  Accordingly, the shareholder's contribution is subject to the following conditions: a full and comprehensive agreement having been reached between management and unions in Aer Lingus on the necessary £50 million annual reduction in internal costs essential for the return of the company to commercial <Col N="994" /> viability; production of satisfactory evidence that the necessary measures proposed are being implemented in full; and a formal indication by the European Commission that it will raise no objection to the proposed State equity injections. I intend to seek, as a matter of urgency, formal clearance from the EC Commission for the Aer Lingus strategy.</P>
    <P>The role of EC competition law and State aid regulations may not be fully understood at this point.  I point out that the European Commission may decide in certain cases that aid may be granted to individual airlines which have serious financial difficulties provided certain conditions are met.</P>
    <P>One of these conditions is that the aid must form part of a programme, to be approved by the Commission, to restore the airline's financial health so that it can within a reasonably short period operate viably without further State aid.  In other words, the financial assistance must be once-off and it must be an integral part of a restructuring programme to restore the financial viability and competitiveness of the airline.</P>
    <P>In this context an intrinsic element of Aer Lingus' strategy for survival is the judicious disposal of a number of assets which are not essential to the core airline business.  This is essential in order to relieve the current huge burden of the company's debt and to achieve a fundamental reduction in interest charges.</P>
    <P>When the debate on Aer Lingus took place in Dáil Éireann last week I deliberately approached it in a non-contentious manner because I believe that partnership and a consensus approach are the best way forward.  I intend to continue in that vein.</P>
    <P>Constructive criticism is to be welcomed.  I regret to have to say, however, that some of the political reaction to the Aer Lingus strategy has been purely negative in tone and at times opportunistic in nature.  There have been calls for the rejection of the strategy put forward by Aer Lingus, despite the broad acceptance of the fact by all concerned that its general thrust must be implemented if the national airline is to <Col N="995" /> be saved.  This is not helpful in view of the gravity of the situation and its national importance.  No other realistic solutions have been put forward by those who find it convenient to knock.</P>
    <P>There have been claims that the Government has no aviation policy despite the fact that I have articulated on numerous occasions exactly what is our aviation policy.  Some people have tried to portray the Government as working in a policy vacuum.  That is not true.  We have now, and have had for some time, a consistent and coherent framework within which we have developed the Irish aviation sector, with considerable success I may add.</P>
    <P>Some people's idea of an aviation policy is basically a return to the preliberalisation era in Europe and elsewhere. This is pure fantasy.  We cannot live in the past.  As I stated in Dáil Éireann, times have changed and so must we.</P>
    <P>As both I and my predecessor have already dealt publicly with the subject of the Government's aviation policy on a number of occasions in the past, I do not intend to repeat here the details what has been said before.  However, for the benefit of this House I can summarise the essence of the Government's aviation policy as being to get access for Irish operators to as many international markets as possible and to ensure that they can compete on an equitable basis with competitors in these markets.</P>
    <P>This policy has been devised and pursued against a background of the international economic regulatory environment which has become more deregulated and liberalised; Ireland's peripheral geographical location in Europe; and national agreements with the social partners where the emphasis has been on expanding existing air services, introducing new services and ensuring access costs are competitive in the interests of tourism and business travellers alike.</P>
    <P>The aviation policy the Government is pursuing is evolutionary in nature.  It continually takes cognisance of changes <Col N="996" /> in the external environment and is adapted to reflect these changes.  It is essential that the policies pursued by the Government be flexible and capable of adapting to change in a rapidly changing environment. Aer Lingus itself must also be capable of facing this change.</P>
    <P>The foundations of current policy have been laid down by successive Governments during the 1980s, including Governments in which the main Opposition parties have participated.  I readily acknowledge this.  It is, of course, the prerogative of anyone to disagree with elements of the Government's aviation policy.  However, I believe that, in fairness, it should also be acknowledged that both this and the previous Government's policy has been unreservedly endorsed by both the Culliton and Moriarty committees. The membership of these committees included representatives of a wide variety of national interests including distinguished representatives of the banking and business communities, as well as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>Finally on this subject, I quoted in Dáil Éireann some statistics which bear testimony to the success of our aviation policy.  I want to put them on the record of this House also: visitor numbers to Ireland rose to 3.1 million in 1992, an increase of over 50 per cent on 1987; over 27,000 jobs have been created in tourism between 1987 and 1992; increased income generated in both the tourism and air transport sectors amounted to over £500 million since 1987; travel by business travellers has increased by almost 50 per cent since 1985 which undoubtedly has helped our merchandise export drive; and at least 3,000 direct jobs have been created in the air transport and related industries since 1987.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out, as Senator O'Kennedy said, that the issue is not simply a cost cutting exercise.  There is no down-sizing of the existing routes proposed in this strategy and the same level of service is envisaged.  What is clearly required is a more efficient provision of that service in order to maintain the successful <Col N="997" /> indicators continuing on an upward trend as I outlined already.</P>
    <P>Before taking its decision on the Aer Lingus strategy, the Government considered very carefully the position regarding the Shannon stop policy.  The following key facts were among those taken into account: Aer Lingus accounts for 70 per cent of scheduled traffic through Shannon; without Aer Lingus there would be no Shannon; Aer Lingus' transatlantic operations lost £9.5 million in 1991-92, £14.4 million in the current year and if nothing changed that would be expected to increase to £22.8 million in 1993-94.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>On contrived figures, the Minister knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Excluding the B767 operations, the pre-interest losses in 1993-94 would be about £12 million as compared with £9 million in 1992-93.  Aer Lingus have confirmed that these losses are based on a uniform <i>pro rata</i> allocation of both costs and revenues on their transatlantic routes.  Unless these losses are reversed, given the precarious nature of Aer Lingus' present position, it would have to pull off the transatlantic service completely.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus maintains it must tackle losses on all routes if the company is to be returned to viability.  This is patently obvious.  A change in the Shannon stop policy is an integral part of its strategy to return the transatlantic operations to profit.  It states that its transatlantic strategy has been specifically designed to protect its interests in Shannon and emphasises its commitment to the Shannon region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is underlined by the fact that for the first time Aer Lingus will have a separate business unit to run its transatlantic services.  When I met interests from the Shannon region it became very clear to me that one of the great bones of contention is the absence of that cost transparency, where the Shannon operation was not looked at and operated independently. What is now being set up is a separate business unit for Shannon for <Col N="998" /> the transatlantic fleet which will be operated, marketed and managed in Shannon by people who believe in Shannon.  This unit will have its own management team based in Shannon whose absolute priority will be the championing of the transatlantic business in and out of Shannon. As a substantial down payment of the company's new strategy, Aer Lingus is committed to the location of the B747 fleet at Shannon, as well as accompanying technical and cabin crew staff.</P>

      <P>Both I and my officials have met delegations representing public representatives in the region, the Status Signal groups, and I have had discussions with Shannon Development, members of the Shannon task force and Aer Rianta. The Government carefully considered their strongly held views before deciding on a change in policy.  However, there were other considerations which had also to be taken into account, principally developments in world aviation.  While we have decided to seek a change in the Shannon stop policy, I want specifically to reassure the people of the west and the mid-west that this Government's commitment to the development of the regions is as firm and resolute as ever.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As a further example of the Government's commitment to the Shannon region, I would ask the House to note the results of the Shannon Estuary Initiative which the Government has been pursuing in recent years.  There has been an enormous increase in port activity in the Shannon estuary in tandem with spectacular port development which has seen <Col N="999" /> the volume of trade in the estuary increase from 400,000 metric tonnes in 1966 to over 7 million tonnes in 1992.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Tonnes do not mean jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>They do, in fact.  The outcome of these efforts is that the Shannon estuary is Ireland's premier deepwater port and the aim of the Government, as outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government, is to have the Shannon estuary developed as the best deepwater port in the EC.  In this regard, the feasibility of establishing a strategic economic trading bridgehead in the Shannon estuary to boost maritime traffic and create jobs is being examined at present.  I mention that only to say that there are a number of ways in which one can provide regional development initiatives.  In relation to the one we are discussing this evening, Shannon airport itself, as I stated in the Dáil last week, the Government's decision to seek a change in the Ireland-US bilateral air agreements to modify the current Shannon stop policy was made in the context of developments in European and US aviation policies.  In addition, there is an increasingly strong movement within the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, which is the international organisation responsible for the regulation of world aviation, for a much more liberal regulatory regime worldwide for civil aviation, in line with a freer trade regime for goods and services under the GATT.</P>
      <P>I emphasised in the Dáil, however, that because of our commitment to the people of the west and mid-west, we will manage the change proposed in a constructive manner by seeking to ensure that Shannon will be sufficiently developed to a point where it can stand alone as an airport operation and the existing level of air services to the region will at least be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, I am pleased to inform the House today that I have granted rights to Aeroflot to operate a new service between Shannon and Barbados as <Col N="1000" /> an example of this.  Aeroflot will operate the service using IL62 aircraft with 156 seats on a once weekly basis to cater for the growing leisure market travelling to Barbados from Ireland.  The service is planned to commence in mid-August. Surely this is further evidence of a confident and outgoing policy direction.</P>
    <P>The granting of these traffic rights is further evidence of the Government's continuing support for Aer Rianta's strategy to develop a north Atlantic hub at Shannon for Aeroflot.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not for Aer Lingus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's support for the Aer Rianta strategy has already resulted in the introduction of new services to Shannon from Russia, Ukraine and the Republic of Belarus.  A special traffic development task force to boost traffic for Shannon has already been set up for the airport with a budget of £1 million over the next two years.  In addition, in negotiating the bilateral air agreements with the USA, I will seek to ensure that traffic through Shannon can be developed further in the future.</P>
      <P>Returning to the Aer Lingus strategy, I need hardly emphasise that it is the responsibility of the board to ensure the continuing viability and development of the company.  The board have fulfilled their obligation in this regard by presenting to Government, as shareholder, a strategy to return the company to commercial viability.  It is now imperative for all concerned that the strategy be implemented without delay.  The strategy cannot be treated as <i>á la carte.</i>  It must be implemented in full.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I believe it is timely to repeat the words which I used in Dáil Éireann on 12 March last in a statement on Aer Lingus:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adapting to change is rarely easy. The whole airline industry is now operating in a much changed scenario. These changes can reach right down to local communities and families, causing uncertainty and anxiety.  Our <Col N="1001" /> task is to confront the challenges of change, calmly and resolutely.  These challenges are not something which can be resolved overnight.  What we must all seek to do together is to set ourselves on the right path.  Change is now a reality, not just in the airline industry, but in every business, in life itself.  There is a quantum leap to be negotiated.  The whole competitive culture has changed.  We are no longer dealing with cyclical or intermittent change, we are dealing with constant change.  We must be as fast as the rest in adapting if we are to survive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate today as it is of great importance not only for the country but for the Aer Lingus workers and particularly for the Shannon region.  One of the frustrating features of the debate is that the entire Cahill rescue plan for Aer Lingus has not been published in full.  This is totally unsatisfactory because, as I said, the whole situation is so serious not just for the future of Aer Lingus but for the thousands of people it employs and the implications for the west of Ireland which is facing a future of total uncertainty.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the Government has not published the Cahill plan in full, if reports are to be believed we all know that Aer Lingus is bankrupt and is currently losing £1 million a week.  Therefore, major corrective action is required. This may be the last chance we have to rescue the airline and to restore it to operational profitability.  If Aer Lingus were any other business it would have ceased some considerable time ago.  It owes its bankers some £550 million.  The real disgrace is that instead of taking action earlier the airline's problems have been allowed to fester for some years now.  Apportioning blame at this stage serves no useful purpose.  The company's sorry state is a dreadful indictment of all those who have had responsibility for it in recent years.</P>

    <P>If the company's problems are to be successfully and permanently dealt with we must learn some lessons from the <Col N="1002" /> mistakes of the past.  While British Airways was reducing costs to compete in a deregulated market, Aer Lingus was employing an extra 4,500 people. Whereas Aer Lingus is on its knees and facing a huge crisis, British Airways is one of the most successful airlines in the world.</P>
    <P>The Aer Lingus approach to air transport has not been sustainable since 1986. Instead of facing up to the challenge posed by deregulation and grasping the opportunities it became obsessed with its sole competitor, Ryanair.  By chasing Ryanair into the regional airports it ensured that neither would succeed. Instead of losing £8 million a year I think Aer Lingus should be capable of making £20 million.  Its failure to recognise that Ryanair had its own niche market shows a frightening lack of judgment on the part of those who were running the company. I think it also explains some of the other blunders that were made in the 1980s.  It indulged in a spending spree buying new aircraft without properly evaluating the return.  This explains why some of these aeroplanes have been sitting in Dublin airport at a cost of $750,000 a month.  We must also ask, what of the Aer Lingus Holidays debacle?  Nobody has ever told us what happened to the £17.5 million involved there.  Why has nobody ever been prosecuted for that scandal?</P>
    <P>Deregulation has been good for Irish tourism.  Since 1986 the value of foreign tourist earnings has doubled and, contrary to predictions, average tourist spendings have not fallen.  A different approach to the question of deregulation would have been the life blood of Aer Lingus.  We must look at what needs to be done now if Aer Lingus is to be turned around and be capable of operating successfully in a deregulated market.</P>
    <P>I believe Air Lingus should publish the full report.  If taxpayers are being asked to spend £175 million in equity for Aer Lingus, then they should be allowed to evaluate the whole package.  The Irish public should be able to look at the facts for itself and should be told whether the proposals being made by the Minister are capable of succeeding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1003" /> The Minister has insisted, rightly so in my view, that the investment must be in the form of equity and not in the form of subsidy.  As he has said, Aer Lingus must reduce its operational costs and increase its revenue.  However, if there is gross overmanning and bad work practices in Aer Lingus it is the fault of past management and cannot be laid at the workers' feet.  The workers in Aer Lingus feel genuinely betrayed.  We must have comprehensive and meaningful negotiations with the workforce representatives if we expect them to take the huge redundancies being demanded at present.</P>
    <P>We must welcome the strategy involving the Government, Aer Lingus unions and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, establishing a framework for dialogue. The suggestion from the trade union movement that the workforce be afforded some form of equity participation would be supported by the Progressive Democrats.  It would mean that if the workers are expected to share in the pain they would inevitably also share in the gain of an efficient, competitive Aer Lingus which we hope will be the case soon.</P>
    <P>If Aer Lingus is to succeed it must concentrate on its core business which, obviously, is running an airline.  It would have to sell its other assets but this must be done at the right time; I do not think it can get rid of them immediately.  For example, this is not a good time to sell the Copthorne Hotel group.  Rushing into something such as this should be avoided. With regard to increasing its revenue and reducing its costs, payroll costs account for 80 per cent of the controllable costs and obviously there is no way to avoid significant redundancies.  It is quite obvious that Aer Lingus is top heavy with management and if there is to be restructuring of staff and redundancies then management will also have to take its fair share.</P>
    <P>I hope the necessary redundancies can be secured on a voluntary basis but this will be quite difficult as Aer Lingus offered a redundancy package in recent years with the result that there are few <Col N="1004" /> workers over the age of 55 years left in the company.  In order to achieve the savings required by the Minister there will have to be approximately 1,500 redundancies and approximately 250 of those will come from TEAM Aer Lingus. I understand over 700 will come from contracting out the cleaning and catering services and that the present workers will operate on a sub-contract basis. However, there is still quite a substantial number of redundancies to be found and I think it will be quite difficult to get these on a voluntary basis.  The Labour Party said in the other House last week that all of the redundancies would be on a voluntary basis but I understand there will be some sort of privatisation, for example, in the catering and cleaning services, and there will have to be forced redundancies to achieve the number required by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The workers in Aer Lingus are being expected to bear much of the pain and the taxpayer is being asked for a substantial injection of capital.  I believe the banks must also carry some of the restructuring costs involved.  I know the Minister has said that the loans that are outstanding to the banks have been secured on the assets of Aer Lingus.  However, the assets of Aer Lingus would not meet the total outstanding loans to the bank at the moment.  As happened with other companies such as Goodman International and GPA, the banks should take some of the pain.  I believe they should be asked to be involved in the restructuring and carry some of the costs.</P>
    <P>The change in the Shannon stopover is of particular interest to me as all my family live in Shannon.  The genuine fears of people in the region are understandable. Much of this arises from the alteration in the present policy but it is compounded by the apparent chopping and changing of the elements in the Cahill plan affecting Shannon airport.  I do not accept that Shannon is the essential problem dogging Aer Lingus; yet, it appears the Government is intent on doing a u-turn on the promises made last October in relation to its policy on the airport.  If the Govenment is going to do this, then <Col N="1005" /> it must be in a position to offer legally binding and meaningful guarantees on future operations and agreed practices. The Government cannot gamble with the future of the people of the mid-west.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties of not publishing the plan in full is that the people cannot see what is going to happen.  They have been given figures by the Government, many of which they do not accept, and I think it is difficult to blame them.  The full facts should be laid before them. They are distrustful of Governments due to the promises made in the past and any future agreements will have to be all-party agreements and everything will have to be signed, sealed and legally binding.  Otherwise the people will not be prepared to move forward.  Most of them are concerned about what can be salvaged from the situation.  It was interesting to listen to Brendan O'Regan on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; last week who said that the people in the mid-west would be united in their adversity and would move forward.  I think they will move forward but they cannot do this until all the facts are laid before them.</P>
    <P>Essential in all of this is that none of the changes should be brought about until the bilateral agreement is renegotiated and signed, sealed and delivered. The Government is giving the impression that it can bring about changes in the bilateral agreement.  It must be made clear that the present arrangements about Shannon are terminated if any airline inaugurates scheduled services between Dublin and the United States. This could mean, in effect, a transatlantic free-for-all irrespective of the consequences for Shannon, Dublin or Aer Lingus generally.  It is not acceptable for the Government to give guarantees or assurances regarding the future of Aer Lingus.  As has been said already, other services must be developed.  The Government has already given a commitment to this and I think these will have to be put in place.  We will have to open the airport up to Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that in the circumstances you will appreciate that there is widespread anxiety which has been reflected in the debate.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to express my regret that many Fianna Fáil members of the county council and Dáil Deputies representing Clare have resigned the party Whip.  I am especially worried about that in view of the fact that Shannon has been inextricably linked with the development of Fianna Fáil and Fianna Fáil with that of Shannon.  Fianna Fáil established the airport, the development company and invested huge amounts of money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in successive years in the development of the whole region.  I think it is inconceivable that a Fianna Fáil-led Government would take actions which would in any way damage Shannon. The questions must be asked why this decision was taken, what will be the immediate and long term effect on the region as a whole, can the decision be reversed and, if not, how can the Government guarantee to the people of that region that the long-term prospects for security, stability, employment opportunities and development in the region will be vigorously pursued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put on record my own total commitment to Shannon, a commitment I demonstrated positively during my term of office in Government.  In Cabinet I made no secret of my position on Shannon because I recognised, as many Members do, the vital importance of the development of Shannon from a regional <Col N="1007" /> point of view and to balance the developments that have taken place in this city. It is important to keep in mind the huge developments in Dublin which have created enormous problems for people living here while we in the west still have the problems of emigration and unemployment. We need major development and investment to enable the regions to keep in with the developments here.</P>
    <P>I would also like to acknowledge the work done by Signal and the Status organisations, both of which actively compaigned for many years on this matter and brought to our attention some of the shortcomings in the Aer Lingus strategy for survival.  We take the point that the future of Shannon is linked to the success of Aer Lingus: we in Shannon know Aer Lingus' value in terms of employment and the opportunities for further industrial development.  Nevertheless, there are fears in the region that must be allayed by strong Government commitment.</P>
    <P>One of the major fears in relation to the establishment of Aer Lingus Shannon is that, in the event of its not being viable after a period in operation, because it is a separate subsidiary company it could be wound up.  There is also a fear that the jumbos that will be based in Shannon as part of the transatlantic fleet are planes that are nearing the end of their commercial viability as aircraft.  We would like firm assurances from the Minister that this fleet will be replaced and that the time frame for replacing it will be brought forward.  These are really serious questions that are causing many people doubts and anxieties.  Many believe that the viability time schedule set down in the proposal is too short and that, even with the best will in the world and taking account of Government investment in the strategy, setting down a firm deadline for viability is putting undue pressure on finance and staff.  If there was an extension of that time limit over, for example, a two to five year period we could have a viable airline company and, at the same time, save many of the jobs that are threatened at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> We in the mid-west region also need to know the outline of the procedure for the renegotiation of the bilateral agreement on which negotiations will commence soon and which is a key element in this strategy.  We need firm indications from the Government as to how the bilateral agreement will be renegotiated to ensure, as the Minister says, that more business will be available at the end of the day through the renegotiated agreement for Shannon than under the present arrangements.  There is a genuine fear that the proposed viability plan includes the present passenger throughput with Aer Lingus; if there is no increase in passengers there is a fear that part of the business which is at present done in Shannon will be transferred to the Dublin area and that is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I want to say a quick word about the motion which the Opposition wanted to put forward in this debate.  The Senator who was quoting from the motion earlier did not complete the wording.  I want to put the second part which he left out on the record, and I quote: &ldquo;and urges [the Government] to bring forward a fully costed alternative plan to put Aer Lingus on a sound footing&rdquo;.  This is a totally blanket motion without any mention of the preservation of jobs in Shannon.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the event of some other proposal being put in place.  Listening to Clare Radio on my way here today I was impressed when I heard Dr. Brendan O'Regan say that Shannon has a good future, that we have to be positive <Col N="1009" /> about the proposed developments and handle them in a way that ensures we get the maximum benefit for the economy of the region.  A similar view was expressed by Stan Power of the hotels association in the mid-west who said we have to take urgent steps to minimise any adverse effects these decisions might have and repeated by Séamus O'Sullivan, the vice-president of Ennis Chamber of Commerce, who said we have time to rebuild and to be positive.  Unless we adopt that attitude we will do further damage to Aer Lingus, to Shannon and to the national economy.</P>
      <P>Neither the country nor Shannon can afford to be left at the mercy of international carriers, without a national carrier to enable us to continue the national development in which we have invested so much time, money, effort and human resources in since the foundation of Shannon Airport.  It is vitally important that wherever possible we contribute as best we can &mdash; between now and renegotiation of the bilateral agreement and putting the final details of this package together &mdash; in an effort to ensure the same kind of prosperous development in the mid-west region as we have had since the foundation of Shannon Airport.</P>

      <P>The Cahill plan proposes an equity injection of £175 million into Aer Lingus.  A sum of £43 million of that equity is now earmarked for redundancy payments.  It is proposed that 1,530 employees at Aer Lingus will be made redundant.  It is very sad that a Government which claims its top priority is job creation in using taxpayers' money to destroy so many jobs in the Dublin <Col N="1010" /> region, which has the highest unemployment in the country.  Like many others, I believe the redundancy figure is not finite.  This week we have seen 300 workers let go on a temporary basis from TEAM Aer Lingus and I understand 150 will be let go shortly.  When the subsidiaries are sold the redundancy figure is likely to be well over the 2,000 mark.</P>
      <P>The case for Shannon has been put very well here by Members who represent the mid-west and I welcome the contributions they have made for their regions.  However, in the time available to me I want to point out the effect these redundancies will have on the economy of Dublin.  The Minister scored an extraordinary goal tonight.  He made a speech running into 14 pages and never mentioned Dublin &mdash; an area where there will be 1,500 redundancies.  When Digital was lost in Galway it was all over the papers and the television; the Minister and the Mayor flew out on a rescue mission. Dublin was not mentioned once tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not mention the word &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo;.  Manufacturing employment has declined significantly in the Dublin area over the past two decades. This has happened through a combination of market induced and policy factors which encouraged location away from the traditional core.  While this drift from urban areas is a common phenomenon, it is now a matter of serious concern for Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin has 29 per cent of the population, 31 per cent of the labour force and 32 per cent of all unemployment.  The proportion of national unemployment in Dublin has risen constantly for many years.  There are now 90,000 people out of work in Dublin, many of whom are long-term unemployed.  If nothing is done <Col N="1011" /> to improve Dublin's unemploymernt problem, by 1996 the figure will be 120,000.</P>
    <P>The decline in Dublin's industrial employment was no accident.  A recent study by the chamber of commerce showed 48 per cent more industrial grants were spent per head outside Dublin.  As a result, Dublin did not get its share in the industrial sector.  The increasingly competitive environment arising from our entry to the EC and changes in demand for older industrial products placed traditional firms in a difficult position. Many contracted or closed and the most significant losses occurred in the food, drink, tobacco, textile, clothing and footwear industries.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that while we are discussing 1,500 redundancies at Dublin airport, Guinness which at one time employed 4,000 people in this city is now seeking to reduce its workforce from 900 to 500. An undue concentration of the nation's unemployment problems in the capital city has a depressing effect socially, economically and commercially.  In deprived suburbs and inner city areas, 70 to 80 per cent of people are unemployed.</P>
    <P>Dublin has many features which have not been fully utilised.  Tourism must be vigorously promoted, making use of Dublin's all year attractions.  To start this a national convention centre capable of catering for 3,000 people is needed.  This would have an immediate effect on tourism development.  Birmingham has such an investment.  Like other cities that fought their way back to economic growth through tourism the convention centre is now the core investment in that city.  Tourism-related jobs in Birmingham increased from 10,000 in 1975 to 100,000 last year.  The conference centre is expected to lead to the creation of 12,000 to 15,000 additional jobs.  The former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, set up an interdepartmental committee to examine the feasibility of having such a centre in Dublin but no decision has been made yet.</P>
    <P>I hope, as the Minister promised tonight, that substantial funds will be <Col N="1012" /> invested in the mid-west region and also in Dublin to overcome unemployment problems.  With high unemployment in the capital, one can appreciate public representatives are alarmed by the redundancies in Aer Lingus and Guinness. Some 2,000 people may now be added to the unemployment figures.</P>
    <P>The notion has been abroad for some time that Dublin could look after itself while the rest of the country was given employment.  I wish to dismiss that notion tonight.  Dublin has serious economic and unemployment difficulties.  It is impossible for the city to bear another 2,000 redundancies in one week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cahill plan for Aer Lingus will not work.  The outcome within the predicted life of this Government will be that Aer Lingus will either cease to exist or will continue only as an airline with a small commuter air service.</P>
      <P>The change in the status of Shannon is a shameful betrayal by the Government parties of the mid-west and west of Ireland.  It is a vote of no confidence in the concept of regional development. The one instrument that successfully promoted regional growth has been removed.  The mid-west has now been downgraded to a marginalised, peripheral area rather than the jewel in the crown of Irish regional development policy.</P>
      <P>What is the result of the change?  I quote from last Thursday's <i>Limerick Leader:</i></P>
      <P>Jobs and money have been lost to the region within hours of the Government decision to end the Shannon stopover.</P>
      <P>One air tour operator confirmed this Wednesday that the company will now switch its base to Dublin.  The real fear is that this is just the start of the loss of thousands of tourists to the region.</P>
      <P>[The reporter quotes:] &ldquo;I have already been speaking to one tour operator whose company would be bringing 40 people a week into Shannon during the summer and they are now definitely going to Dublin with that business&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1013" /> Less tourists, a loss of the pre-clearance customs service and hundreds of jobs losses in tourist and allied trades are now feared...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What they have done is transferred the stopover to Dublin for the winter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The sop offered by the Minister originally was that three redundant jumbo jets were to be put into Shannon.  This has now been reduced to two.  This is not going to work.</P>
    <P>Once the present bilateral treaty is changed there will be a free-for-all on the US route.  Mr. Frederick Sorensen, head of the Transport Policy Division of the EC Commission was quoted in a Sunday newspaper as saying the Irish Government has no legal right under EC law to renegotiate its agreement with the US.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Sorensen has said the EC has exclusive competence in this area and member states cannot renegotiate bilateral agreements with a non-community country unless given a specific mandate to do so by the Council of Ministers. If this mandate was given, why was the Dáil not informed of this?</P>
      <P>Mr. Sorensen has further said the EC was currently formulating a common external aviation policy and negotiations were to open with the US within 12 months.  I ask the Minister to confirm this is the case.  If it is, we are not being told the full story.  If this does happen, the status of Shannon will be completely abolished according to Mr. Sorensen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I quote from the statement of the Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, from eight months ago:</P>
      <P>The decision to retain the stopover was made on sound economic, social and regional considerations.  A change in policy would lead to over-concentration of aviation and tourism investment in Dublin and the east coast.  It would also cut the real time tourists spend here.  At present US tourists arriving in Ireland via Shannon are proved to spend more time in Ireland that those who arrive via other routes.  Shannon airport's status and air services have been a major factor in attracting US investment to the region and to the west of Ireland generally. Many industries are dependent on these services.</P>
      <P>I fully agree with her and suggest to the Minister he consider the statement. Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn further stated:</P>
      <P>In examining this issue over the last few months I have not seen solid evidence that additional US carriers would use Ireland if we had done away with the stopover.  What I have seen is a Dublin-based push for a change in policy which would ensure that Dublin would grow at the expense of the regions and which would add to the pressure on Dublin's already overloaded infrastructures.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister previously responsible for Transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke in the Seanad in November 1992 and March 1993 and at other public meetings, I outlined the gravity of the financial position in Aer Lingus as I saw it at the time through daily contact with the company. This was done at much cost to me electorally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1015" /> On June 22 of this year the Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions said in a statement there was a clear recognition by both sides that the underlying financial position of the company was grave and unsustainable.  In that context it was agreed the core airline business would have to be returned to operational viability.  That is the kernel of the overall problem.</P>
    <P>We listened tonight to Senators rightly representing their areas.  If the financial position of the company is not recognised there will be no Aer Lingus in Dublin, Shannon, Cork or elsewhere.  We must recognise this fact before we make any other proposals.</P>
    <P>The statement issued by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Government reiterated the belief I held many months ago.  At that time I tried to be constructive by proposing various ideas which I thought would be in the interests of the company.  Unless Aer Lingus becomes commercially and financially viable, we will have another Irish Shipping debacle on our hands.  Those on the other side of the House would know all about that.  It is something of which the Government does not want to be part.</P>
    <P>Some of the proposals I made at the time were that a viable plan must be forthcoming, that equity must be made available, the compulsory Shannon stopover must be dealt with, employee share option schemes should become part of the company's policy and EC funding for mobile assets should be vigorously fought for.</P>
    <P>The Cahill plan is the only plan on the table at the moment.  It is now Government policy and we must all work within that to ensure it is successful in the interests of the company.  It is now clear from the statement issued by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Government that it is their intention to work towards this aim.</P>
    <P>I listened to the debate this evening and plan B from the other side of the House is a blank sheet of paper.  There have been no constructive ideas from Members on that side.  They are bankrupt <Col N="1016" /> of ideas.  This is not in the interests of the company or the employees.</P>
    <P>With regard to equity, Members on the other side of the House may argue that not enough money has been given to Aer Lingus.  However, the Government has put £175 million of taxpayers' money into the company.  I say to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, that if various issues, which are in the interests of the company, are dealt with in the negotiations between management and the unions and if other moneys would help the company to become viable, I hope the Government will not be found wanting.</P>
    <P>I asked that the compulsory Shannon stopover be dealt with and I welcome the development in this regard.  Does anyone here seriously believe that the number one tourist spot in this country will not be promoted by the Government, the State's agencies, Bord Fáilte and so on, or that market forces will not decide they want to land in Shannon?  I quote from a recent speech which was given by Dr. T. A. Ryan, chairman and chief executive of GPA at the official opening of Shannon Turbine Technologies on 28 June 1993. It states:</P>
    <P>Neither Lindbergh nor de Valera nor Brendan O'Regan nor their successors looked for guarantees when they selected Shannon as the launch place for Ireland's entry into the world of civil aviation.</P>
    <P>We should not waste time looking for guarantees now.  We should press ahead with the development of the World Aviation Park in Shannon &mdash; offering quality products and services to a vast international customer base.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard many people from the commercial world in Shannon echo those sentiments on the radio today.  It would help if those who represent the area would support people who have been successful in business and who <Col N="1017" /> believe that Shannon has a lot to offer.  I have no doubt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that in a few years time Shannon will be a thriving enterprise area because market forces will dictate that and the Government and its agencies will respond.</P>
      <P>I said we should look for funding for our mobile assets.  Throughout Europe the roadways and highways are the link between the various European countries and they are important for tourism.  Our link is our planes and ships.  I hope the Minister will let us know if funding is still being sought because it has been granted elsewhere and it is something we can seek.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the morale of the work-force is extremely low.  Many months ago I suggested that an employee share option scheme should be part of any proposal to revive the company.  I am confident that those involved in the company want this.  The unions would like to see it happening and it would boost the morale of the company.  I have no doubt Air Lingus will return to profitability and those who have played a major role in the company, the employees, should be part of any profit-sharing arrangement. The Government should do all in its power to ensure that legislation, if it is needed, is introduced to deal with this issue.  We must be seen to support the employees of Aer Lingus in their efforts to make the company successful in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister will Aer Lingus be allowed to compete on all air routes in the future?  I live among the Aer Lingus employees and their families and I am aware of the human cost of the Aer Lingus crisis.  The success of the company was achieved by the endeavours of its employees and its future will depend on its employees.  The long-term viability of Aer Lingus depends on the Government. Those who represent public opinion and have a role to play should support the company instead of criticising it.  The last <Col N="1018" /> thing any employee in Aer Lingus wants to hear about is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is it any wonder the public have no regard for politicians? This evening we were reminded of the promises made by the then Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, about the Shannon stopover issue and the reasons it should not be removed.  We also heard about the promises made by the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring, and the Deputy Leader, Deputy <Col N="1019" /> Quinn, at the meeting in Dublin airport about the viability of Aer Lingus, the provision of equity and the assurance that no redundancies, other than voluntary redundancies, would take place.  We know what has happened since then and what the position was at that time.</P>
      <P>I take issue with what the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, said last Tuesday night in an interview outside an hotel in Galway about the vote in the Dáil on the Aer Lingus issue.  He was asked about the promises that had been made and he said they had been made in good faith.  In other words, the Minister was trying to tell the people that at the time of his visit to the hangar in Aer Lingus he was not aware there was a serious problem in the company.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, and I, when I was a Member of the other House, were invited by the then management of Aer Lingus to learn about the serious situation facing Aer Lingus.  Each Member of the Dáil had an opportunity to visit the Shelbourne Hotel and we knew about the situation in Aer Lingus. It was unfair of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, to say last Tuesday night that promises had been made in good faith during the election on the basis that he was not aware of how serious the problem was in Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>We are aware of the situation that has developed.  Some 1,500 jobs will be lost. The Cahill plan will not provide the future which Aer Lingus requires.  There will be more job losses and by the time interest payments are made and all of the other sales of assets are completed, at a time when it is nearly impossible to sell anything in Ireland, there will be far more redundancies and many more people will be put out of work to satisfy the partners in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read today with interest a call by the people in north County Dublin for a task force, and rightly so as they are entitled to call for whatever help may be available. There are many Aer Lingus employees who live in my constituency and who <Col N="1020" /> were all informed at the time of the last election that they would be looked after when the new Government was formed. I would like to think that in the eventuality of a large number of these people in both constituencies being made redundant that the same help will be made available to provide jobs for those who will lose their employment as a result of compulsory redundancies that will have to be implemented under this plan.</P>
    <P>It is easy for the trade unions to agree with the Government, given that the Labour Party is in Government, in saying that this number of voluntary redundancies will be found.  However, if you listen to the people who represent the Aer Lingus workers in the different sections of the unions they say that in one area where there is a total of 700 people employed in no way would the required percentage of voluntary redundancies be reached, that only ten people would choose to take voluntary redundancy. Both parties in Government, by agreeing to the Cahill plan, are responsible for this situation.</P>
    <P>We have no long-term plan and I agree with the comments made by Senator Doyle.  In the Minister's speech there was not one word about the 1,500 people who will be made redundant or about the effect in Dublin and throughout the country.  I would like to think that these people would have had top priority quite apart from the change in the Shannon status.  The bottom line is that the Government has hung its hat on the change in the Shannon status as the saviour of Aer Lingus and it will not work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The question before us is whether Aer Lingus can be restored to commercial viability by this plan.  I submit it cannot.  We are going to provide £175 million pounds of equity to Aer Lingus but it will be phased in over a three year period.  In view of the debt servicing the airline is faced with at present, is the Minister confident that amount of money will be adequate to solve the problem or are we going to be <Col N="1022" /> back here in five years time doing the same thing and looking for more equity?</P>
      <P>With regard to the Shannon stopover is it essential that it be brought into the debate at all?  It is a red herring.  We have gone to Brussels to seek £8 billion to address the peripherality problem that exists in the European Community and we have argued our case.  However, when it comes to addressing peripherality within the country we are sadly deficient. There is also the rhetoric of our commitment to regional development and that is not evident.  Will we get to a point where all we have in Shannon is a museum that the tourists coming to the country through Dublin may visit and see aircraft that flew 20 years ago?  I imagine that is the case and what is being proposed does not fit with regional development or tackling peripherality.  It is a red herring.</P>
      <P>We should be debating the motion outlined by Fine Gael.  It should be put to the House and we should vote on it so that at least we can find out how people on the other side of the House would vote.  At least there was that satisfaction in the Dáil which we are not afforded in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The crisis in Aer Lingus is a problem the Government has not inherited but one it has caused.  Therefore, it is doubly unacceptable that it should repeatedly stand back from it. The laying off of 500 TEAM Aer Lingus workers is the beginning of the bloodletting. TEAM Aer Lingus and its staff have been subject to a whispering campaign since the beginning of the Aer Lingus controversy and now they are apparently seen as the first and softest target for job shedding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister if it is true that TEAM Aer Lingus is owed £32 million and that, as I am told, it has turned away work in the past few weeks from Ryanair and from Teamlift?  We were not told either that TEAM Aer Lingus does not carry out the servicing of some of Aer Lingus's own fleet, the Fokker 50s.  The Cahill plan will destroy Aer Lingus as an independent national airline.  Aer Lingus <Col N="1023" /> will not survive the loss of 1,500 jobs although there seems to be an opinion, especially in the Labour Party, that the job losses are acceptable if they are voluntary. This takes no account of the effect on the company itself of such large-scale job losses.</P>
    <P>The change in the Shannon stopover is a huge blow struck at the region.  It proves beyond doubt that the Government is to sacrifice the livelihoods of the people in Aer Lingus and Shannon in the interests of their policy of fiscal rectitude.  The Government is to put £40 million into redundancies for Aer Lingus workers while they should instead invest the recommended amount of equity in Aer Lingus, that is £400 million, together with a fair share of the £8 billion of Structural Funds in the Shannon region and show that the people really matter.  I am reliably informed that it was the Government who instructed Mr. Cahill and that is why he was not able to have proper discussions with the Minister at Shannon. It was the Government who instructed Mr. Cahill that the Shannon stopover must go.  In so far as this Government is concerned, the people do not matter anymore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Action must be taken immediately, otherwise Aer Lingus will come to a full stop.  In this context the Government had to take a decision and had to take it quickly.  I believe the injection <Col N="1026" /> of equity of £175 million will secure the future of Aer Lingus if we all work together on that task.  However, there is one aspect of the Cahill plan I do not agree with and I have indicated this publicly and also within my party.  Mr. Cahill included the Shannon stopover in his plan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;despite the fact that initially this was not to be part of his brief.  This should not have happened. I do not believe the Shannon stopover should have been part of the solution to the problems in Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator now blames Mr. Cahill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There were many difficulties in the mid-west region over the past number of weeks regarding the various statistics presented by Mr. Cahill in relation to his plan and, as other Members have said, there is still concern about the future of Shannon in the Cahill plan.  I accept that in the world of aviation competition some action has to be taken. However, I do not accept it will be good for the future of Aer Lingus that the Shannon stopover should be included in the Cahill plan.</P>
      <P>There are many questions I wish to ask today and while, I am aware that the Minister will be unable to provide immediate answers, there are concerns in the Shannon region especially over the whole question of regional development. As was said by some Members in the House today, the EC has a policy of regional development and a policy of strengthening the peripheral regions. While I accept that the EC also has policies regarding competition, I suggest that the attempt to weaken the emphasis on regional development in the mid-west is in contravention of EC policies on regionalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the question of renegotiation, there has been some disagreement <Col N="1027" /> on the part of some of the MEPs from the Munster area and EC representatives quoted in this House.  I do not know myself the EC position on this question and I believe that this must be answered before the issue of going forward in the mid-west region can be resolved.  I am quite sure there will not be any changes in the status of Shannon until the bilateral agreement is renegotiated and I understand this could take anything from six to 18 months.  In the meantime there are many questions being asked in the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus is hoping to have managed change in the bilateral agreement.  What will happen if that is not possible?  There are many other questions, for example, on the pre-clearance facility at Shannon, and what will happen to winter flights?  I accept there will be tourism traffic in the summer but there is worry about the winter and the jobs that are dependent on flights in the Shannon area at that time of year.</P>
    <P>Those are many of the concerns and questions being raised in the Shannon region.  I have said many times in this House when discussing other issues that there should be monitoring of progress in relation to the implementation of Government policy.  The same should be true of the Cahill plan.  I believe the plan should be monitored as it may not be perfect.  The mid-west region is resourceful and its people will fight back and will, as Brendan O'Regan has said, seek to develop the region.  However, there are many questions being asked by people in the region and I believe they should be addressed.</P>

      <P>The Government decision to end the Shannon stopover will not have the catastrophic effect that many people in the mid-west region fear.  There are three reasons I believe the Shannon stopover as we know it will disappear in any event within the next two years.  First, there has been a fundamental change in <Col N="1028" /> the past four years due to deregulation. The stopover was a restrictive practice introduced in 1958; it is a policy that is completely outdated in the context of aviation development and is no longer practical.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the number of passengers from the USA entering Ireland indirectly has increased dramatically over the past few years, from 40 to 55 per cent in 1992 alone.  An aviation expert has predicted that if this situation were to continue, by 1994 some 70 per cent of the people entering Ireland from across the Atlantic Ocean would be entering via London.</P>

      <P>Shannon has great development potential but it is essential to that development that the Government put in place a strategic development plan for Shannon as the gateway to the west of Ireland.  Fundamental to that development plan is a realisation by Government, which I have to say is not there at the moment, that Ireland's economic future lies not in manufacturing industry and not in agriculture, both of which are contracting, but in making Ireland the most prestigious destination in Europe from the US, mainland Europe and from the east.  Central to the implementation of that policy will be the development of direct flights from the US into Shannon throughout the year and from 12 major European cities.  The challenge for all politicians from the west at local and national level is to get a commitment from the Minister and from the Government that this policy and plan will be put in place and that it will receive significant Government and ESF funding over the next five years to market Shannon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Government is using the Cahill plan as a means to demolish Shannon.  Birds are the only things that will be flying through Shannon in a few years' time.  The western region will be decimated when this plan is fully implemented.  If the two previous Ministers, Deputy Brennan and Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, look after their present portfolios as they looked after their previous one, they should resign because they were both faced with this problem and did nothing about it.  Last October Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn endorsed the Shannon stopover but today we are presiding over the abolition of Shannon and the decimation of the west.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to hear Senator Fahey talking about bringing tourists to this country because, today and yesterday, there were calls from the Opposition spokesperson on tourism and the Government side of the House to implement a new emergency plan to bring tourists back to the country.  We have had no tourists this year.  Senator Fahey spoke about his great expectations and the future route which would be the lifeline for Shannon.  The present proposal to fly Shannon-Dublin-America was discussed on the &ldquo;The Pat Kenny Show&rdquo;.  Mr. Kenny could not believe his ears and made a mockery of the proposal. That will not last.</P>
      <P>The people in the public gallery, the public representatives from the Shannon region know only too well what has happened. It is obvious because only statements are allowed, there will not be a vote.  The Government side are afraid to vote.  It is amazing that a Deputy from the Government side was carried shoulder high when he returned to Clare because of his stance in the Dáil last week.  The only reason he was in that position was because a Fine Gael motion was put during Private Members' Time in the Dáil to try to save Shannon.</P>

      <P>Shannon and the whole western region is banjaxed.  There is absolutely no commitment from this Government to the west.  For years we have heard from Fianna Fáil, the major Government party in the last number of years, details of its commitment to the west, how it has won two of every three seats in most constituencies and that it is the party for the survival of the west.  It has no commitment to the west.  We have seen the Digital episode and now Shannon. In view of the fact that there will be no major international airline in the west I call on the Minister to at least put something in place to enable us to upgrade the railway lines into the west.  All the tourists coming into this country will be coming into Dublin, they must be dispersed throughout the country and we need proper railway lines in order to bring them to the west.</P>

      <P>Over the last three or four days I was in the west and I took particular notice of the infrastructure in that area.  Anybody who gives the impression that this infrastructure does not depend on Shannon is lying.  It is immoral and devastating to that region that people can decide that aeroplanes which have been relevant to Shannon since 1958 will not be landing there any more.  People might say that those involved in the Shannon region should get up off their knees and get on with it but I do not think so.  Much of the money which has gone into that region is because of Shannon airport, it is unbelievable that <Col N="1033" /> a politician on any side of the House could suddenly decide that there should be one stop and that the eastern side of Ireland should gain everything.</P>
      <P>There are more important decisions to be made and it is wrong that the capital should get everything.  It is totally immoral to limit the role of Shannon airport.  How could Aer Lingus create a situation where the people on the western side of our country are without a service? It is untrue to say that the losses are the fault of Shannon airport.  Two parties that claim to represent the working class propose to spend £43 million on eliminating 1,500 workers.  That is not my idea of creating jobs or of saving a company.  The idea of putting in £100 million over a three-year period and then £50 million over every other year confuses me.  The infrastructure set up in the west, as regards Shannon Airport, from the town of Gort to Limerick is so vital to the region that no politician of any party could agree with the plan.  They should have looked at the case as a whole. I compliment Mr. Cahill on railroading this through &mdash; it was not within his brief to refer to Shannon at all &mdash; and annihilating all of the west in one stroke.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three points I wish to make.  First, this debate has typified old and ancient politics.  Governments, irrespective of their colour, only look at State enterprise when it is far too late and it is in dire trouble.  When the Labour Party were in Government with Fine Gael, we had to recognise that it was not financially possible to save Irish Shipping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Shipping is still there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cregan knows that it is not there and we sat in the same councils and decided that we could not conceivably save Irish Shipping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the high moral tone of Senator Dardis and the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley sat on the problems in the PMPA for over two years which were eventually faced up to by the late Deputy <Col N="1034" /> Cluskey.  We are all guilty of those sins and do not pretend that we are not.  If what came from the other side today is leadership, then God help not only Shannon but the rest of the country.  The remedy they have is to dispense liberally a huge amount of money because they have nothing else to offer.  It was said earlier this evening that the alternative to the Government plan &mdash; no one said that it was perfect; even the Minister accepted that it was imperfect &mdash; is a series of mini-criticisms.  Not a single big idea has come from the Opposition, either in the Dáil or this House, that could be tested on any logical grounds.</P>

I agree with Senator Honan that at least the contribution <Col N="1036" /> now being made by the Government is by way of a capital injection and not loan capital.

We also do not have the expertise to control the State-sponsored bodies within our departmental sector.  Each time we have a crisis, we look for a scapegoat and in this case, it is Shannon airport.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>In the few minutes available to me, I would like to ask the Minister to take on board some of my points, which were made to me by the staff of Aer Lingus.  The Cahill plan, as has already been said, is the only one before us.  I have reservations about the <Col N="1037" /> plan.  I believe it is flawed for two reasons. First, there has been no input from the staff representative organisations and, second, it takes a totally narrow view, based purely on bookkeeping, and the commercial decisions taken do not appear to me to have been fair.</P>
      <P>The core of the plan states that Aer Lingus must become cost-effective and that it must be competitive.  It is difficult to insist that they become more competitive when it is operating under different commercial guidelines from other airlines.  Their costs are higher, especially on the Dublin-London route, because they cannot land at Stansted.  The cost of the Shannon stopover also has to be borne by Aer Lingus because of a decision in relation to regionalisation.</P>
      <P>I want to raise the matter concerning semi-State jobs and was surprised by the comments made by Senators Lee and Quinn.  I do not have any problem with semi-State organisations being used as a vehicle for creating jobs.  I ask the Minister to tell me what is a productive job. I know there are problems with Aer Lingus, but I want the Government to listen and to answer this question.  What is the cost of the dole being paid out to 60 per cent of those in parts of my constituency?  The Government may save money in Aer Lingus, but what is the knock-on effect of that kind of unemployment? A Senator from the other side of the House said that creating unsustainable jobs is a mistake.  I totally dispute that statement.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision of £175 million in equity.  It is lamentable that this was not referred to by Members on the other side of the House.  I commend the Minister for making a decision.  Members on the other side of the House have said that nothing was done, yet when something is done it is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this late stage it is disastrous for a Government to admit that it only has a fix on the Aer Lingus problem.  The Minister in his statement mentioned aviation policy.  I dispute that we have an aviation policy.  We may have had an aviation policy, but we do not have a future policy.  The Minister said this is <Col N="1038" /> evolving.  Policies do not evolve, we decide on them.  Part of the plan states that Aer Lingus cannot fly on new routes until its old routes become profitable. That is not a policy.</P>
    <P>Regarding Shannon, the Minister must be doing something right because one Fine Gael Senator berated him for making a decision said to be anti-Dublin while another made a similar remark about Shannon.  Perhaps they are confused. I support Senator O'Sullivan's call that this plan should be monitored.  We must not look back in three years and say this is still not right.  I do not want the Aer Lingus workers who will lose their jobs to pay that price for nothing.</P>

      <P>The European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1993, which is before the Seanad provides for certain amendments to the EC Treaty concerning the Statute of the European Investment Bank; for the incorporation into domestic law of the European Economic Area Agreement; for the transfer of the statutory functions of the former Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and for the retrospective confirmation of ministerial regulations previously made under the European Communities Act, 1972.</P>
      <P>There is a growing awareness in the Community that action must be taken to stimulate growth and promote employment. This awareness is not limited to the Community.  The Tokyo Summit of the most economically powerful countries last week accepted that economic recovery had to be a top priority.</P>
      <P>In addition, and this has a bearing on other aspects of this Bill, the Community has established close co-operation with the EFTA countries within a wider European approach on economic recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Council at Edinburgh <Col N="1039" /> in December 1992 launched a &ldquo;growth initiative&rdquo;.  Among the elements included in this initiative is the setting up of a European Investment Fund.  The European Investment Bank will be a major shareholder as well as the Community itself and other major financial institutions.</P>
    <P>This Fund will provide financial guarantees for borrowings and so facilitate private financing of infrastructural projects.  The Fund will have an endowment of 2 billion ECUs, about 40 per cent of which comes from the EIB and 30 per cent from the Commission on behalf of the Community, the remainder being contributed by major financial institutions.</P>
    <P>As a result of the prudential ratios, the 2 billion ECUs are expected to cover approximately 5 to 10 billion ECUs in guarantees.  This impetus to infrastructural investment in the Community will help stimulate economic activity and jobs.</P>
    <P>Infrastructural works in Ireland are eligible for grant funding under the Cohesion Fund and the Regional Funds. The European Investment Fund, which is a loan or guarantee instrument rather than a grant instrument, will be available to Ireland, It will also apply in areas of the Community where the Structural and Cohesion Funds are not available for such works.</P>
    <P>To enable the European Investment Bank to be a shareholder of the Fund, it is necessary to amend the Protocol on the Statute of the European Investment Bank, which is part of the EEC Treaty.</P>
    <P>The agreement between the member states making the necessary amendment was signed by the member states, including Ireland, on 25 March, subject to ratification.  With a view to ratifying this amendment to the EEC Treaty, it is proposed to add this instrument to the list of Treaties constituting the European Communities in section 1 of the European Communities Act, 1972.</P>
    <P>Early ratification by Ireland of the necessary change to the Statute of the European Investment Bank will be an <Col N="1040" /> indication of the urgency with which this country views the need for European and world action to stimulate the international economy and employment.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to add to the list a purely technical Treaty signed in 1975.  It was not considered necessary to add this to the list at the time.  However, in the interests of clarity and completeness, we considered that we should now add it, along with the 1993 amendment.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House will also enable Ireland to ratify the EEA Agreement which was signed by the EC and EFTA states in Oporto in May 1992.</P>
    <P>This agreement, which was approved by the Dáil last October, was due to come into effect on the 1 January this year. However, following its rejection by the Swiss people in a referendum last December, an adjusting Protocol was negotiated to take account of Swiss non-participation. It is hoped that the agreement and adjusting Protocol will come into effect in the near future following ratification by all the parties.</P>
    <P>The EEA Agreement will establish a significantly closer and more structured relationship between the EC and the EFTA countries.  Its objective is continuous and balanced strengthening of trade and economic relations in conditions of equal competition and based on the same rules.  At its heart is the achievement of the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.  The agreement sets out the competition rules that will apply and provides for strengthened co-operation in areas such as the environment, research and development.</P>
    <P>The EEA is an important element in the new European architecture emerging following the dramatic geopolitical changes in Europe since 1989.  It is intended to give fresh impetus to the special relationship which links the European Community and the EFTA states which is based on their proximity, the importance of their economic relations, their common values of democracy and a market economy and their European identity.</P>
    <P>The EEA Agreement is not directly concerned with the question of EC <Col N="1041" /> enlargement and is not neceessarily a prelude to membership for the EFTA states.</P>
    <P>In a separate development however, a number of these states have applied for membership and negotiations are currently taking place with a view to early accession by Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden.  The accession negotiations for these countries are undoubtedly facilitated through the work already done in the EEA on much basic Community legislation.</P>
    <P>I attach considerable importance to the early entry into force of this agreement. This is because of the significance to our relations with the EFTA states and because the agreement itself is advantageous from an Irish point of view.</P>
    <P>The agreement establishes closer and more intensive relations between the EC and the EFTA countries with which Ireland has always enjoyed excellent relations and which share a similarity of outlook with us on a range of international issues.  It represents a market opening by both sides and Ireland's already strong export performance towards EFTA can be improved with the further removal of barriers.</P>
    <P>The special fund to be established under the Agreement to help reduce economic and social disparities in the EEA will also be of benefit to Ireland.  It will involve for Ireland the provision of 50 million ECUs in grants and 150 million ECUs in soft loans over five years.</P>
    <P>I turn to the issue of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the proposals in this Bill to transfer the statutory functions of the former Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities to the new committee.</P>
    <P>The work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs since its recent inception is most impressive.  As I have already made clear, I warmly welcome the establishment of this committee.  It provides an opportunity for regular and reflective discussions across the entire range of foreign policy issues.</P>
    <P>I attended the Dáil Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, along with the Minister <Col N="1042" /> of State, Deputy Kitt, on 18 June for the examination of the Foreign Affairs Estimate.  I found the open debate that took place on foreign policy issues by members of the committee &mdash; many of whom have considerable expertise in this area &mdash; has been a positive contribution to the quality of our political culture.</P>
    <P>I also attended the joint committee on 29 June to discuss Irish participation in the UN operation in Somalia and to hear the views of the members prior to the debate on the motion to dispatch the Irish contingent to Somalia.  Officials of my Department have appeared before the joint committee and briefed it on a wide range of issues including Bosnia, East Timor, the reform of the United Nations and enlargement of the Community.</P>
    <P>The new committees are, in terms of Irish Parliamentary tradition, an important innovation on which we should build and the current Bill transfers the legislative scrutiny functions of the old joint committee to the new Foreign Affairs Committee.</P>
    <P>The new committee will be able to monitor fully all aspects of Irish foreign policy of which EC affairs are such an essential component.  With the powers transferred to it under this legislation the committee will be able to revive and continue the vital task of monitoring secondary legislation as its predecessor was empowered to do under section 1 (1) (b) of the European Communities (Amendment) Act, 1973.</P>
    <P>It is important to reflect on the powers being given to the committee in this area. The powers now transferred will enable the committee to recommend to Houses of the Oireachtas the annulment of any ministerial orders made under the European Communities Acts subject to a resolution in both Houses to that effect.  This power ranges over the entire spectrum of ministerial orders made under the Acts.</P>
    <P>The old joint committee was diligent in the use of these powers and reported regularly to both Houses on regulations made by ministerial order.  The most recent committee, which sat between 1989 and 1992, made 14 reports to the Dáil and Seanad.  The main failure in the <Col N="1043" /> existing system was the fact that the Dáil and Seanad did not debate or discuss these reports.</P>
    <P>I hope that they will respond more readily to reports from the new committee. I would urge them to ensure that this is the case at the very least when the Dáil and Seanad come to debate the annual report of the committee as provided for under section 13 of its terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Apart from its power to examine and recommend the annulment of ministerial orders, the Foreign Affairs Committee has extensive powers to examine proposals made by the EC Commission which form the basis for implementing national legislation after they have been passed by the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 10, sub-paragraph 1, of the terms of reference of the committee permits it to consider:</P>
    <P>such programmes and guidelines prepared by the Commission of the European Communities as a basis for possible legislative action and such drafts of regulations, directives, decisions, recommendations and opinions of the Council of Ministers proposed by the Commission.</P>
    <P>My Department sends copies of all Commission proposals to the committee and to Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>My officials and officials of other Departments are available to assist the committee in implementing this part of its mandate and in advising the committee in regard to the subject matter and implications of the issues under examination. I am prepared to look sympathetically at any proposals the committee may wish to make arising out of its experience of this task for additional help in examining measures.  Other interest groups, such as the social partners, also have an interest in advising the committee in their specific fields of competence and I would welcome their participation in the task of ensuring that the committee has the fullest range of expertise possible at its disposal in its work.</P>
    <P>If Commission proposals are considered <Col N="1044" /> in good time then the committee will have an opportunity, after consulting the various interests, to put on record its views on these proposals for the information of the Minister concerned, before they come to the Council.</P>
    <P>If this is not enough, I am prepared, as I have said, to look again at the arrangements for the scrutiny of EC legislation in the light of the committee's experience to ensure that the most comprehensive arrangements possible are in place to facilitate it in its on-going work, not only after the legislation has been adopted by the instances of the Community, but also in the formative process.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the State must continue the process of implementing European Community legislation.  The present Bill is intended to do so in respect of the three elements it contains, as well as to ensure, in advance of the Supreme Court decision in the Meagher case, that existing ministerial regulations under section 3 of the European Communities Act, 1972 will in so far as necessary be validated retrospectively as from the time when they took effect.  The effect of the High Court judgment in this case was to declare part of the regulation-making powers in section 3 (2) of this Act to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Subject to the outcome of the State's appeal to the Supreme Court this judgment creates a serious defect with implications not only for the present and the future, but also for the past in the State's implementation of its obligations under the EC Treaties.  I am advised that such implementation depends to a considerable extent on regulations made under the 1972 Act as from the time when we joined the Communities.  Furthermore, I am advised that as the State is about to accede to the EEA Agreement the implementation of our obligations under that Agreement would also depend to a considerable extent on regulations made under the 1972 Act as adapted pursuant to section 4 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The three measures contained in this Bill represent a number of important aspects of our Community membership.</P>
    <P>First, the Bill will enable the European <Col N="1045" /> Investment Bank to enhance its capacity to provide finance for development. While the European Investment Fund may be a relatively minor aspect as far as the Community's development effort in Ireland is concerned, it is nevertheless an important indication of what the Community can contribute to our development. The current negotiations on the Structural Funds and the Government's clear determination to maximise the allocation of these funds to Ireland underlines the importance of the Community in our strategy to tackle unemployment and stimulate economic recovery and growth.</P>
    <P>Second, in an increasingly interdependent Europe the advent of the European Economic Area is an aspect of Community policy that will impact favourably on our relations with other European EFTA countries with whom we already have important economic and political links.  We look forward when the current negotiations are complete to welcoming four of these countries, Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway, as members of the Community and of the European Union.  The Irish economy can only benefit from these developments.</P>
    <P>Third, the transfer of the legislative scrutiny functions from the old Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation to the new Foreign Affairs Committee will facilitate the scrutiny of EC legislation which will henceforth be consolidated in the new committee, which with these transferred powers will be able to continue the essential task of monitoring the secondary legislation of the Community.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It is important that we address the reason this Bill is before the House.  As the Minister said, it results from the Meagher case which was taken to the High Court and subsequently to the Supreme Court.  We need to be far more vigilant in future in relation to how we transpose EC legislation into domestic legislation and how <Col N="1046" /> we implement specific EC regulations. Undoubtedly there are hundreds of regulations and directives going through Europe and it is difficult for all Departments to monitor these but we should now have learned a lesson and have recognised that in the future we need to be more vigilant in relation to how we address Community legislation.  It is adequate to deal with the Treaty of Rome, the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty, which are the basic foundations of our European legislation, but beyond all these are the directives and regulations which must be transposed into legislation here as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I read a report recently in which Ireland featured quite well.  It was fifth in the league of European member states in transferring directives into legislation and as the Minister was speaking it crossed my mind that perhaps he might in his diplomatic way be able to use that particular rating within Europe to greater advantage in his negotiations in Europe. In particular I refer to the debacle during the Taoiseach's visit to Edinburgh last December and the subsequent promises that emanated from there in relation to the Structural Funds.  I hope the Minister will not continue to be a party to the current behaviour in relation to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is relevant, it has to do with funding, the Investment Bank and all the details relating specifically to this Bill.  It is fundamental to the issues being discussed here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not be party to current events in relation to the Structural Funds.  It appears the Government are attempting to convey the impression that the commitment the Taoiseach supposedly got in December in Edinburgh will stand up and that we will get over £8 billion in Structural Funds.  It is not fair to mislead the people, to attempt to transfer £1 billion from the 1989-1993 tranche of funds to the 1993-1997 tranche <Col N="1047" /> and say that we have received the £8 billion.  That behaviour is not acceptable and if this line is proceeded with it will be highlighted for the fiasco it is.  It is important that the Minister would not involve himself in this type of carry on.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the fund and the fact that the European Investment Bank will be a shareholder. It is important that it will provide guarantees for borrowings, particularly to the private sector, in relation to infrastructural projects.  I hope the Government will be vigilant in ensuring that Ireland uses these funds to the maximum capacity in areas of potential growth, particularly in industry and tourism where there is an opportunity for growth if these funds are used prudently.  The economic area agreement is welcome as is the inclusion of four states applying for EC membership; Norway, Sweden, Austria and Finland.</P>
    <P>It is important that they are included and that we work closer with them in future.  It is easy to say we welcome those four countries because they are economically affluent and would be an asset to the European Community.  I notice that the Minister did not address the more serious element of EC enlargement through the addition of states that would be far less viable economically.  It is important that this matter is addressed by the Government as well as the implications of enlargement for Ireland from the point of view of affluent states as well as disadvantaged states which could prove to be a financial and economic drain on the EC.  We must recognise that we have a moral obligation to address that issue and not ignore the possible fallout.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has been working effectively since its establishment, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Ministers of State have addressed us on at least two occasions.  That is a breakthrough.  I welcome section 6 in this Bill which provides that the former Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities is to be included as part of <Col N="1048" /> the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. The establishment of a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is prudent and will lead to more effective monitoring of European affairs.  I hope that the assurances we have received from the Minister regarding the availability of his officials can be fulfilled.  I hope that when these sub-committees are established the officials will be able to cope with demands from a variety of areas.  There has been such an extension of committees and sub-committees that there is a drain on staff.  We have good staff but their current workload is beyond what is humanly possible; it is unfair of us to make those sort of demands.  If the committee system is to be effective the Minister should address that matter.</P>
    <P>The power of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to examine and recommend the annulment of ministerial orders is a major breakthrough and gives real teeth to the committee.  I hope that Members will act on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis on the committee rather than in accordance with the Whips.</P>

      <P>I am not too sure who Senator Taylor-Quinn was having a go at there but she was quite pleasant in her attacks anyway, and I suppose since Clare were beaten by Tipperary last week we will give her a week or two to settle down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a technical Bill and the changes would in other days have passed through both Houses without anyone paying attention to them. However, at present where there is an unemployment crisis of ferocious magnitude in the EC, whatever can be done to attempt to alliviate it is welcome.  I was sorry to hear the Minister say that there is a &ldquo;growing awareness&rdquo; in the Community that action must be taken to stimulate growth and promote employment.  Anybody who has lived in the real world for the past number of years must have been aware of the magnitude of the problem of lack of economic growth within the Community as well as the growth of unemployment.  I am sorry that certain countries within the EC are only now taking cognisance of that fact.  The lack of employment was hidden by the fact that certain major countries had strong economies in which the unemployment content was low.  Over the past couple of years we have seen the reunification of Germany which has created problems there.  It has shown the Germans that there is a problem within Europe, because until reunification they did not <Col N="1050" /> accept there was a problem or that they should pay any attention to it.</P>
    <P>If it is used properly, the European Investment Fund can stimulate growth but there is no point in suggesting that such growth in employment can be stimulated if we use the moneys generated in this area totally for infrastructural development within the Community. Infrastructural development is necessary to stimulate growth to a degree but it does not provide long-term jobs.  It can only be a method of providing jobs if industries can be provided which are associated with the growth or development of infrastructure.  Spending money on infrastructure without creating jobs is the greatest waste of time, money and energy that could be devised because you get rid of the money and end up with the most magnificent system of roads and telecommunications.  These are things that people appear to want but there is only a shell behind them.  It is like going to a Hollywood studio and seeing all the beautiful facades on which money has been spent but behind them there is nothing.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the recent G7 meeting in Tokyo and the fact that last week's summit of the most economically powerful countries accepted that economic growth must be a top priority.  I understand that the G7 group said that countries must cut down on social spending, suggesting that too much money is spent on support for the unemployed and socially deprived.  The group has not come up with one specific idea which will lead to the creation of one extra job in this or any other country.  If those countries cannot produce a single job in this country how can they, as the most important and the richest countries in the world, suggest that they are serious about the alleviation of the problems of lack of growth and increasing unemployment in Europe?</P>
    <P>In Ireland we have attempted to be superior by suggesting that our education system produces people who are so well educated that they will change the economy of this country.  Unfortunately, <Col N="1051" /> they may change economies but they will not change this country's economy. People who are at present leaving college with a master's degree cannot even get interviews for jobs so they must go abroad.  How will they stimulate our economy?  We are spending money on the provision of educational facilities and we are exporting our educated young people to support economies which will not put the same amount of money into their educational system.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn tried to make political capital on the divergence of opinion about the EC summit in Edinburgh and the amount of money this country will receive as a result.  It is irrelevant whether we will receive £8 billion, £8.5 billion or £7.9 billion.  What is relevant in the long term is how the money will be used.  I have no doubt that we will receive about £8 billion.  We could pour money into an enterprise but if it is not productive the money is useless.  That is why I am worried about the areas in which money from the Structural Funds is spent and where money from the new European investment fund will be invested.</P>
    <P>The fund will provide financial guarantees for borrowings and thus facilitate private financing of infrastructural projects. However, infrastructural projects, like Governments, cannot provide a job. A Government has never provided a job not paid for by a taxpayer and no infrastructural unit can help society unless it provides a service that is of benefit to the community.  There is no point in building a road in the middle of a bog unless, at the end of that road, there is an industry which needs to transport something out again.</P>
    <P>The fund will have an endowment of two billion ECUs.  I am not sure exactly how much an ECU is worth at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If £1.6 billion is divided among all the countries in Europe it is hard to see how it will be of tremendous value.  It is of some value but not much.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the incorporation in domestic law of the EEC-EFTA Agreement on a European Economic Area and it is necessary legislation. However, it will not make a great difference to this country.  The transfer of the statutory functions of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is of importance because the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EC was an extremely busy committee.  I was a member of that committee when the President was its chairman.  The quantity of retrospective material that came before the committee was enormous. One thing was certain: the printers in Europe had a ball sending material throughout the EC.  It was of little value, however, because the material was retrospective and, by the time the committee met to discuss regulations, derogations and other matters, their reports were six months late.  The Minister said the reports were not addressed in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  They were discussed in this House on numerous occasions but often up to 18 months after publication.  We have discussed statutory reports from the EC &mdash; although I do not think we have yet reached those of 1990 &mdash; in this House but they have never been discussed in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Taylor Quinn that if the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is to function properly it must have the resources to do so.  I compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs for their diligence since that committee was established. Personnel from the Department of Foreign Affairs were never before obliged to <Col N="1053" /> appear before a Dáil or Seanad committee and now they must atttend every week.  They have had to incorporate a large amount of extra work into their daily routine and the material they have produced for the committee has been of extraordinary value.  Even <i>ad hoc</i> questions are answered immediately or an answer is supplied shortly afterwards.</P>
    <P>Some people say that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs cannot take on board the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committe on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. I disagree because the work can be delegated to sub-committees of the committee.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has worked very well in its first month and I hope that will continue.  The establishment of the committee was long overdue and the Minister for Foreign Affairs need not have any worries about appearing before the committee, submitting papers to the committee or allowing officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs to appear before the committee to answer questions or in an advisory capacity.  In the past this Bill would have gone through the Seanad and the Dáil without discussion. In view of our continuing and increasing involvement in Europe it is essential that it be given a proper reading. The Bill is of relevance and will be very useful in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the part of the Bill which discusses the European Investment Fund.  I understand Senator Lanigan's concern that few jobs are provided by infrastructure projects and I wish to link that with the debate we had earlier today on the Opsahl report.  The economy and society recommendations of the Opsahl Commission stressed economic co-operation with the Republic.  I hope that perhaps some of these funds for infrastructural projects could be used towards, for example, the road to the North, the railway, electricity and gas links and other such matters.  The Minister in his speech mentioned the dramatic geopolitical changes since 1989 and a few dramatic geopolitical changes around <Col N="1054" /> here might not be any harm.  These could be improved by funds from the European Investment Fund and I hope that this will happen.  It could give great impetus towards better cross-Border co-operation. I am sure the Minister is in a position to discuss with ministers in the North and Sir Patrick Mayhew reciprocal arrangements with regard to the funds they may get towards cross-Border projects. I certainly share the Minister's view that it is extremely good to see the early accession of Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden.  We have ancient ties with two of them and I am sure we can develop ties very rapidly with the others.  They are two financially sound countries which is always useful.  I hope that this work within the EEA goes forward very rapidly and that there will be early entry of these countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss this important legislation which unfortunately has received scant attention from both the media and political representatives in recent times.  In ways this is understandable. Issues such as Aer Lingus have dominated the headlines but I believe that this reflects a broader lack of debate on the issue of Europe and more importantly Ireland's role in a rapidly changing Europe.  This lack of real debate permeates our political and media structure and has often led to issues of profound importance being debated at the level of caricature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowhere was the lack of depth of debate more evident than in last year's referendum on the Maastricht Treaty.  As I was vice-chairman of the Irish Council of the European Movement at the time I had a particular interest in, and a close involvement with, the debate on the Treaty.  It was all the more depressing, therefore, to observe the low quality of debate and the level of scaremongering that took place.  The outrageous scare regarding conscription was the most blatant example of serious debate reduced to the level of crackpot slogans. Europe is of vital importance to this country and serious and provocative <Col N="1055" /> debate must be at the very heart of the Irish political process.</P>
    <P>What also became clear as a result of the Maastricht campaign, not just in Ireland but also in Denmark and France, was the lack of public awareness of the European Community &mdash; of its purpose and workings and especially of its future. Interestingly there was no shortage of actual information on Europe during the referendum campaign; in fact there may have been a glut of such information. What was missing, however, was actual comprehension of the debate.  In this sense the Maastricht debate in Ireland was characterised by a comprehension deficit.  This has not disappeared; it is on-going and colours our debate on Europe. As long as this comprehension deficit persists the level of our debate on Europe will remain impoverished.</P>
    <P>I am relieved to note that there are signs that this situation is improving.  The new Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs will allow for a new forum in which to discuss these important issues, under the able stewardship of Deputy Brian Lenihan.  This is but one step forward. There is much more that needs to be done if we are to tackle the comprehension deficit.  Radical measures are needed if we are to create the informed atmosphere in which the important process of debate can take place.</P>
    <P>We must begin with our education system.  I find it both disturbing and regrettable that our young people are passing through our education system without an adequate knowledge of the Europe of which they are now part.  They are left unaware not only of the basic workings of the European Community but also of the broader issues that confront the Europe of which they will be citizens.</P>
    <P>Learning is about preparation for life and we are doing our young people a tremendous disservice by not providing a fullblooded European studies curriculum as part of their formal education.  As such they are deprived not only of practical knowledge, but they are also desensitised to the potential of Europe.  For them <Col N="1056" /> Europe remains an abstract, not a reality and this in turn perpetuates the comprehension deficit.  We must break this vicious circle of ignorance.  I call on the Minister to give serious consideration to asking the Minister for Education to introduce a European studies curriculum at second level, as a full examination subject, as part of the overall process of educational reform.  To ignore this issue would represent a grievous oversight.  I urge the Minister to give this matter the most serious attention.</P>
    <P>I wish to take the opportunity to thank two organisations which in their own ways are working to tackle the comprehension deficit, the Irish Council of the European Movement and the Institute for European Affairs which is the brainchild of Professor Brendan Halligan.  The IEA, of which I am a member of both the executive and council, has been producing excellent research material on European issues and Ireland's role in Europe for some time now.  This material is characterised by rigorous analysis and clear thinking.  I urge my fellow Senators who are interested in EC issues, as they all should be, to find the time to read these documents. They are an invaluable source of analysis on Ireland's role in Europe and will provide the basis for many useful debates in the new committee.</P>
    <P>Structural Funds dominate the debate on Europe in this country and that is understandable.  This funding is of vital importance to Ireland and securing the maximum funds is an important national objective, but there is considerably more to the European Community than Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>There are other broader issues which will have a huge bearing on Europe and Ireland's place in Europe.  At present these issues are receiving scant attention in both the political and media arenas. This lack of forward thinking is indeed lamentable.  Are we doomed to react only to important developments when they are about to cave in upon us or can we respond to our duties as parliamentarians <Col N="1057" /> and initiate and develop broader public debate and awareness of these issues?  I believe we can.</P>
    <P>One such issue, perhaps the most important, facing the Community is that of enlargement.  It has huge implications for the Community and for Ireland's role in an expanded Community.  To begin with there are grave resource implications. In an expanded Europe encompassing the poorer countries of eastern Europe there would obviously be less funding available to Ireland. Enlargement also has huge implications for the decision-making process of the Community.  In a much expanded Community this process would have to change if it were not to become cumbersome and unwieldy.  Would Ireland maintain its voice in such a Community or would it have a much diminished role and be overwhelmed by other interest blocs in the Community?</P>
    <P>I have two or three times in this Chamber called for a debate on enlargement because we should be thinking through its implications in the public and political arena now and not leave this important issue solely for deliberation by the Civil Service.  Enlargement poses a range of challenges for Ireland and the Community as a whole.  I have already referred to the issue of institutional arrangements and voting rights.  It is not enough simply to add pieces to existing structures.  Instead, the issue of representation at Commission and parliamentary level must be addressed.</P>
    <P>This debate should be tackled in conjunction with the debate on subsidiarity and in the spirit of greater involvement of national parliaments in the whole process of European Union.  The notion of subsidiarity, enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty, is one that merits serious debate. There are those who would argue that one cannot have subsidarity at European level when it does not exist in a meaningful way at national level.</P>
    <P>To my mind the European Community can only develop and enlarge with the solid support of its peoples.  This in turn demands more openness, democracy and improved two-way communication <Col N="1058" /> between citizens and their leaders.  If anything, the Maastricht process illustrated that the leaders of Europe had lost touch somewhat with their electorates.  The Treaty engendered much debate and confusion. The European Community has been described as a &ldquo;Europe of the elites&rdquo; and that is no longer sufficient. We must set about creating a Europe of the electorates where there is real participation by the peoples of the member states.  This is a prerequisite to enlargement.</P>
    <P>We must be clear as to the objectives and responsibilities of the expanded European Community.  One of the fundamental problems of the Maastricht Treaty was that it was utterly impenetrable to the layman.  The Community must be absolutely clear about its aims and then back them up with the necessary human and financial resources.  Vision in itself is not enough, it must be backed up by practical measures.</P>
    <P>Enlargement poses serious implications for Irish foreign policy.  I believe that we have yet to address these implications in a serious manner.  However, we cannot afford to stick our heads in the sand for much longer &mdash; we must formulate our own responses to the fast changing political and security situation in Europe.  We cannot afford to ignore what is happening.</P>
    <P>I have focused on enlargement in this contribution but there is a whole range of other issues.  What of Ireland's neutrality in such a time of change?  Does it evolve with changing circumstances or should it be removed?</P>
    <P>How can the principle of cohesion be most effectively realised?  This means more than simply Structural Funds.  It means a consistent set of cohesion policies Community wide.</P>
    <P>What of the new policy competences to be introduced by the Maastricht Treaty? How should they be developed?  What direction should they take?  What should Ireland propose in this regard?</P>
    <P>What is the future of the Common Agricultural Policy and what are the implications for Irish agriculture?  How can Ireland best adapt and prosper?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1059" /> Bearing in mind the recent currency crisis, what is the future of European Monetary Union?  How can Ireland best participate in this process?  What are the implications of the two-tier Europe?</P>
    <P>These and other issues to be addressed are legion.  However, at present we are acting as if these issues are peripheral, as if they exist merely in the abstract.  These issues are anything but abstract, they will shape this country in the decades ahead. As parliamentarians and as a country we must face up to these challenges and be prepared to play our part in a vigorous and forward-looking manner.  If we do otherwise we are relegating ourselves to a role on the sidelines of European history.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I also welcome the Bill. The Minister began his speech by saying there is a growing awareness in the Community that action must be taken to stimulate growth and to promote employment. Over the last number of weeks there has been a major reduction in interest rates on house mortgages but there has been no decrease in commercial interest rates.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices to try to reduce commercial interest rates because it would be one way of stimulating growth within our economy and providing jobs.  On previous occasions in this House I asked the Minister for Finance to see what he could do to reduce commercial interest rates. Such reductions are the basis of any economic revival in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also stated that the European Council at Edinburgh in December 1992 launched a growth initiative. Among the elements included in this initiative is the setting up of a European Investment Fund.  The European Investment Bank will be the major shareholder as well as the Community itself and other major financial institutions.  This fund will provide financial guarantees for borrowings and facilitate private financing of infrastructural projects.  Does this mean that from now on local authorities will be in a position to apply directly to the fund for borrowings to carry out their work <Col N="1060" /> and thus alleviate the pressure on our own economy?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Structural Funds, I hope that the uses to which they are put will provide the basis for leading this country into the next century.  The Taoiseach was quoted in the media last week as saying he would negotiate on the £8 billion and was willing to accept less.  I was amazed to hear Senator Taylor-Quinn stating that the 1989-93 Structural Funds were now being used to prop up the present fund so that it would be seen that we are getting £8 billion now.  I do not think this would be very acceptable to the public and I hope the Minister will ensure that we will get £8 billion in addition to the funds we were promised for the 1989-93 period.  On national radio last week the EC Commissioner, Mr. Flynn, stated we were entitled to £8 billion and that we would have no problem in obtaining it.  I hope we will get £8 billion in addition to what we were promised for the period 1989-93.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Minister came back to the House a second time in the same day underlines the importance and urgency of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I wish to dwell on three points.  First, as clearly acknowledged in the background to this legislation, the recent record of the European Community in terms of the impact of economic policies has been a failure.  Not before time the EC has reacted to the need to demonstrate to its citizens that it is relevant, has a concern and a programme for what for them is the only priority, security and employment in their own place.  All the statements, and sometimes platitudes, which emerge from meetings of European institutions at Commission, Council and Parliament levels are sometimes very remote from the reality of life from the Cap Suniom at the end of the southern tip of Greece to Northern Ireland or the very tip of John O' Groats.  For that reason it is welcome to find at the highest level of Government a focus on what is relevant, real and crucially important, namely, employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not before time, even the latest <Col N="1061" /> annual report from the Commission acknowledges that the present situation in the jobs market is very grave indeed. I do not think I can recall a report from the Commission being so honest and blunt in recognising reality.  It underpins the urgency by pointing out some startling statistics relating to 1992.  The 1993 statistics may show that conditions have deteriorated since 1992.  Only 60 per cent of the EC's population of working age were in employment in that period, a frightening disclosure.</P>
    <P>We have all been sadly aware of unemployment in our own country, we do not need to dwell on the reasons and structural causes behind it and the programmes of Government to try to alleviate it.  When we find that throughout the EC generally only 60 per cent of the population of working age is in employment, which is way below that of the United States and Japan who are normally seen as the EC's competitor regions, obviously urgent remedial and positive development action is required.</P>
    <P>It is now belately recognised that, for one reason or another, in the development of policy in the EC each member state pursued its own education policy independently.  Accordingly, there was no co-ordinated education policy.  Only relatively recently have the member states become aware of the fact that without education in its proper and effective function there will be no success in tackling what has almost become the endemic unemployment problem.  To illustrate that, over the years here the Social Fund, which is a major element in the EC Structural Funds, was applied almost exclusively through training agencies under the Department of Labour.  I do not want to denigrate the role of the training agencies but our capacity to draw down maximum funds was not matched by our capacity to put them to the most effective use for permanent employment, which would be achieved particularly through education.</P>
    <P>Education for permanent employment is considerably more effective than training for short-time employment.  It is considerably more effective than the plethora of administrative schemes which <Col N="1062" /> we have seen develop and expand in the last number of years through some of the agencies under the Department of Labour.  We developed such a reputation for this that the newer member states of the European Community, notably Portugal and Greece, came to Ireland to consult us.</P>
    <P>Education policy is now being presented as a priority in Europe and at home right through third level.  I hope we will have institutions which are geared not just to the current reality but to the future potential in every aspect, such as linguistic ability in business and familiarisation with the cultural attitudes of other countries.  We have much to do to be effective in that area.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to something which I find rather startling.  In the course of recent research I discovered that the position of the European Community and its record of achievement in relation to women's issues is not what it should be, considering the priority which it says it attaches to these issues.  On going through the list of the staff of the Commission recently I was appalled to find that, probably uniquely among the administrations of Europe at national or any other level, the role and place of women is scarcely recognised.  I am conscious of this because during my short period as Commissioner I made what was seen as a major breakthrough in appointing the first lady director general to the commission services, Renée van Hoff, who is director general of the interpreting and conference centre.  I should now refer to her as Renée van Hoff-Haferkamp because since then she has married my good friend and former colleague in the Commission, Willie Haferkamp.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any major development since then in what is now being properly called &ldquo;equality proofing&rdquo; by the Commission for the Status of Women.  If the European Commission, which is charged among other things with the social action programme, with equity in all of these areas and the dynamic which can be implemented through recognising the role of women in society at every level, will not give due recognition <Col N="1063" /> to this in their own organisation, how can we expect those to whom they preach in the private sector to give this recognition?</P>
    <P>I wish to illustrate my case by referring to the fact that there are 41 heads of service in the Commission service.  Most of those heads of service operate at the level of director general, some at the level of director.  Two of the 41 positions are filled by women.  The other woman in addition to Renée van Hoff is Colette Flesch in DG X which deals with media, information communications and culture. I do not wish to denigrate the significance and role either of the joint interpreting and conference programme or the media, information, communications and culture section.  However, it is fair to say that neither of them would be regarded as the economic and social powerhouse of European policy.  To the extent that they are not, it is time to expand the purely administrative role which has been allocated to these two efficient and highly qualified ladies &mdash; they would not be where they are unless they were even more efficient and qualified than their male counterparts.</P>
    <P>There are, as far as I know, 20 Community offices in the member states such as the information office in Molesworth Street in Dublin.  One of the 20 offices is headed by a woman.  It is reasonable to ask if it is possible that there might be some reasonably qualified ladies to take on that responsibility within the European Community.  The European Community and the Commission in particular is nothing if not consistent in this because if we look at their external offices we find a consistent pattern.  Of the 90 external offices of the European Community three are headed by women.</P>
    <P>With regard to those who would lead us into the next generation of enlightment and suggest programmes to us for equality in all these forms could we just ask &ldquo;Who is guarding the guardians &mdash;<i>quis custodiet ipson custodes</i>&rdquo;?  The evidence does not suggest that they are supervising their own records too closely. I thought it would be appropriate to mention <Col N="1064" /> that at this point because if we are speaking of enlargement of the Community we should also think about enlarging our attitude and recognising that the dynamic which is necessary in Europe, where we have seen so much introspection over the last number of years, cannot be released fully unless and until we channel all the energies which are there.  I do not think that can be achieved on the basis of what might be called a unisex approach within the Commission service as well.</P>
    <P>I should say in passing that there was one lady who dominated Europe for some time.  I attended many European Councils with her and I hope there will be not too many like her among the ranks of those I hope will emerge from the Commission.</P>

Through the force of her personality &mdash; and not because of a great European vision, which I found singularly lacking&mdash;she managed to have the EC contemplate its navel for ten years on one question: how much Britain had put in and how much it was getting back.  In passing, may I say I believe it is one of the great tragedies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the great tragedies of the EC is that Britain might have taken a much more vigorous, positive and confident approach &mdash; for its own good as well as that of the EC &mdash; but was prevented from doing so by a very <Col N="1065" /> negative image constantly conveyed by that good lady whose name I do not want to repeat.</P>
      <P>I want to make a point in relation to enlargement and the establishment of the European fund under the European Investment Bank.  There has clearly been a rebalancing in the Community with the most recent enlargement in the south of Europe.  We do not want the status of being the only worse off area.  However, there is pressure on EC funding to maintain the cohesion and conversion policies to ensure that the peripheral regions will always have a balance against those at the centre of the market.  We need a further rebalancing from those countries who have the resources and capacity to bring this new dynamic to the Community.</P>
      <P>Those at the centre of the market will always do well from the EC.  The shop in the main street will always do better than the one at the edge of the town.  There is no apology to be made to Holland, Germany, France or Belgium &mdash; and certainly not to Luxembourg which has done very well from the EC &mdash; because those of us on the northern and southern periphery simply want to balance the advantage held by those at the centre of the market against the disadvantages we experience at the periphery.  We want to balance those disadvantages with the convergence and support funds which are now part of this renegotiation under the Structural Funds.  It is difficult to do that while the demands on the Structural Funds are as onerous as they are now, with the southern countries making a reasonable and necessary claim for their entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why I welcome the application of Norway, Sweden, Austria and Finland. It is important for the economic balance of the EC, but it is also important for the cultural balance of the Community. Incidentally &mdash; to distort a well known statement &mdash; just as we cannot set a limit to the march of a nation, we cannot set a limit to the development of the EC.  In time, and not before long, other countries to the east, the previously totalitarian states of eastern Europe, will <Col N="1066" /> also join the Community.  They will not have the same resources as Norway, Sweden, Austria and Finland and therefore it would be best to establish cohesion with those countries before further enlargement takes place.  Let us not forget Turkey has been knocking on the door for the past 20 years and for the most part the EC does want to know about Turkey.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I had to convey a subtle message to the Turks that the door was not about to swing open to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps.  If we are to have enlargement, even just to include the four countries we have discussed, we should also remember that the institutional framework of the EC is already grossly overburdened.  There must be a library of reports on institutional reform, for example, the Three Wise Men or <i>Les Trois Sages</i>, which will be of great interest to research students in future years, studying how reports were accepted by the Council and then consistently ignored for years.  At least 12 years ago a report suggested that there should be just one commissioner from each member state, so that the central executive could function reasonably efficiently.  It was apparent even then that the Commission was distorted in favour of the major powers and that this distortion was not in the interest of the development of the EC.</P>
      <P>The executive is already grossly overburdened; for each commissioner there is a huge administrative back-up.  I was amazed to find out that the number of personnel in the Commission has grown by around 50 per cent since I was responsible for administration and personnel &mdash; and not all of that is necessary for helping the people of the EC.  It is important to remember that as the Community expands it should also become more efficient.  The mushroom growth of the Commission must stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our record on implementing European legislation is not what we would <Col N="1067" /> expect it to be given our wish to proclaim, and our interest in proclaiming, ourselves as committed and effective Europeans who do not simply react to Europe but who take a lead role.  These regulations are the consequence of what we ourselves at the Council level decide on, unless we do not know, and we should, what is happening at the Council.  I wish the Tánaiste and the Foreign Affairs Committee, which has taken over the role of the secondary affairs committee, every success in overseeing this programme.</P>
    <P>The latest figures released by the European Commission on progress at national level in implementing the Single Market legislation show that Denmark is the best performer, with 94.7 per cent implementation. The poor Danes are very conscientous; they argue longer at Council meetings about the effect these regulations will have, because they are serious about putting them into effect.  Some of the other member states do not even bother to raise questions and bother less about implementing regulations.  The UK is also inclined to be conscientous because they, too, argue and question, and they have an implementation rate of 90 per cent.  Even Italy has an implementation rate of 90.5 per cent.  Ireland, I regret to say comes third last with a rate of 80 per cent and that is not something of which we can be proud.  To be consistent on all fronts, I believe we should look closely at what has prevented us from implementing legislation we have been involved in passing.  Otherwise, we are carrying on with the notion that someone out there is making decisions for us without our knowing about them.</P>
    <P>What has been agreed at Edinburgh should be implemented as agreed.  The European Community should not set the precedent that an agreed share of Structural Funds be subject to further negotiation. That would be a major departure from the procedures I encountered either as a commissioner or as a member of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in the twilight of this session of the Seanad.  I welcome <Col N="1068" /> the Minister to the House and I apologise for detaining him for half an hour because we did not keep to the order we had established this afternoon.  It did not reflect well on the way we conduct our business.</P>
      <P>This is important legislation and I disagree with those who suggested it is a response to the Meagher judgment or a technical matter.  It is far more significant than that.  There is nothing seriously defective in it and its passage through the House should be effected.  The time given to this legislation is in marked contrast to that given to Aer Lingus.  That is not to say one is more important than the other but there are lessons to be learnt from this.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan showed a cavalier indifference to billions of pounds when he stated he regarded the way the money was spent as rather more important than the £8 billion we hope to receive in Structural Funds.  Both are extremely important.  We have not always used the money to best effect in the past and we must use it well in future.</P>
      <P>If we secure £7.9 or £8 billion that should not be represented as having secured what we thought we had achieved in Edinburgh.  It does not take into account the devaluation of the currency. We can argue whether £700 or £800 million should accrue to us but we should concentrate on the percentage to be given rather then the sum of money. We must maximise what we receive from the Community and use it to good effect. It is not relevant whether the year for which the figure applied has passed but it is important we secure the sum represented as a victory at the Edinburgh summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My first query about the Bill concerns the European investment fund and the relationship the European Investment Bank would have with the system of central banks and the European central bank proposed at Maastricht.  When we establish these structures under that treaty what part will the EIB play?  Will it remain outside the ambit of the European central bank or the central banks <Col N="1069" /> system as an entity unto itself?  That is not clear.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's point that it is a matter of guarantees rather than grants. In the absence of continuing Structural Funds, will Ireland look to the EIB to fund the infrastructural investment required to make the country cohesive with other European countries?  In that event what types of projects will be allowable? I understand the moneys from the EIB are for large national projects and are not used for the smaller projects aided during the Structural Funds period. When we come to seek money from the EIB it can only be used for large civil engineering works.</P>
    <P>I agreed with the tone of Senator Lydon's contribution this afternoon.  He mentioned the scaremongering on defence, European union and neutrality during the Maastricht debate.  There was also much confusion about the perceived imposition of a European code of morals on the Irish people.  It was never and would never be the intention of the European Community to impose such a code upon us.</P>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned the &ldquo;compression deficit&rdquo;.  I think I can claim to be the author of that phrase.  To go down in history for that reason is to have greatness thrust upon one.  There was concern about an information deficit.  There is no such thing because, as Senator O'Kennedy has said, reams of literature and volumes of materials come from Brussels. The problem is getting people to understand what comes from the EC.  We have spawned an élite who like the jargon of &ldquo;pillars&rdquo; and &ldquo;institutional frameworks&rdquo;. These nice cosy phrases can be discussed at conferences without references to the fact that most people do not understand them.</P>
    <P>We have to make the Community relevant to its citizens and to do so the Commission and those responsible for disseminating information must make it accessible to people.  They have failed badly in that respect.  Senator Lydon is a member of the Irish Council of the European Movement which made strenuous efforts in the Maastricht <Col N="1070" /> debate to produce accessible literature and assist the system.  As he said, Members of this House should become involved in the Institute of European Affairs.  That body does not seek to direct the way we address Community issues but it seeks to inform in a non-directional way.  It would be of value to Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas to be involved in the institute because it would improve their knowledge of how the European system works.  The Minister is due to attend a function at the institute later this week and I know he supports that organisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the European Economic Area Agreement was not directly concerned with EC enlargement and was not a prelude to membership of the Community by the EFTA states.  I accept that, but I think the two are related.  Entry of EFTA states to the agreement has facilitated progress towards membership of the Community and towards enlargement. I welcome enlargement and the impending accession of Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden.  I would also welcome the accession of Hungary and the other newly democratic countries. However, I would have reservations about the accession of Turkey.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless enlargement will cause even more difficulties for the so called &ldquo;institutional framework&rdquo;.  Will the institutions of the Community be flexible enough to be relevant to EC citizens when the Community has been greatly enlarged?  It will also cause problems when we enact the Maastricht Treaty provisions, especially those for economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>The reunification of Germany caused difficulties and the economic and currency problems we experienced were a direct consequence of that reunification. We will now bring in other countries with different economic growth rates, different levels of unemployment and different national debts.  It seems to me that it will be difficult to achieve the criteria under the Maastricht Treaty which are required for us to advance to monetary and economic union.  I would <Col N="1071" /> like to see economic and monetary union becoming a reality because I subscribe to the &ldquo;F&rdquo; word, federalism.  However, I believe it will be difficult to achieve.  I cannot understand how enlargement will be consistent with achieving what has been laid down for us in the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations with regard to the provisions of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1993, which relate to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  I hope that matters of secondary legislation will not become submerged in the burden of work which the committee must do.  I fear this area will be sidelined, but I hope it will not happen.  I also fear the area of secondary legislation and our relationship with the EC on a legal and regulation directive basis will submerged because the committee must discuss, as it should, important matters.  This matter is not as attractive as some of the other matters discussed by the committee.  Will the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs be obliged to deal with matters of secondary legislation or will they deal with them at their discretion?  I am not clear about that.  I have already referred to the Structural Funds and I hope they will be used prudently and well.</P>
    <P>This is not only technical legislation, it is good and important legislation and we should facilitate its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is unique legislation in one respect, I cannot find &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; in the Bill.  The parliamentary draftsman of this legislation must be congratulated.  The &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; disease has been halted at one stroke by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We mentioned in previous debates the extent to which &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; has crept into the language, even when it was unnecessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions.  As I said at the outset, although this is a technical Bill to some extent, it is important in the context of our relationship with the European Community. I say to Senator Dardis that I <Col N="1072" /> understand how democracy can occasionally keep Ministers waiting.  I have no problem with that because issues need to be dealt with and we must show flexibility in these situations.  I am glad of any opportunity to address matters in the Seanad as this is an important House.</P>
      <P>The Bill addresses a number of issues arising from EC membership.  It also addresses the complex question of retrospective confirmation of ministerial regulations, previously made under the European Communities Act, 1972.  I compliment Senators on their contributions to the complex issues.  I agree with remarks about the complexity of Europe and European legislation.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important that we make every effort to focus as far as possible, in layman's language, on what is happening at EC level and on remarks made about the Irish Counciil of the European Movement and the Institute of European Affairs.  These are improtant institutions and in recent years they have tried to explain and provide facilities for debate on these complex issues.  It is important to work with them and provide a focus of the the debate.  There are times when the amount of technicalities involved in explaining te European institutions would bewilder the most technical of people.</P>
      <P>One of the main issues arising from the debate this evening was unemployment and growth.  People seem surprised at the language used in terms of the growing awareness of this issue.  I must restate that unemployment was not on the European agenda until recently, although people may find that difficult to believe.  Our European colleagues did not pay the same attention to this issue.  Perhaps the reason was that, until recently, they did not have the same pressing unemployment problems we have in Ireland. It is only in the last 12 months that we have succeeded in putting this issue at the top of the agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from the conclusions of the Edinburgh Summit and the Maastricht Treaty, one is aware of the problem of economic recovery and the serious unemployment which have befallen the Community. <Col N="1073" /> The Maastricht Treaty aspires to the promotion of a high level of employment. Economic growth alone may not be sufficient to solve unemployment, but it has an essential contribution to make in that battle.</P>
    <P>Ireland attaches considerable importance to the European &ldquo;growth initiative&rdquo; launched at the European Council at Edinburgh last December and enforced at the Copenhagen Summit.  The &ldquo;growth initiative&rdquo;, of which the European Investment Fund is but a part, has been pursued by the Community since the Edinburgh Summit.  It was given a further impetus at the Copenhagen Summit.  In addition to growth, the European Commission is specifically studying the question of employment and how it can be promoted. Ireland attaches the highest priority to this area of the Community's work. Everything which can stimulate and revitalise the economy in Europe must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The European Investment Fund is part of that &ldquo;growth initiative&rdquo;.  Section 2 of the Bill opens the way for Ireland to ratify the necessary change to the statute of the European Investment Bank.  Senator Dardis asked how this fund interrelates with the European central banks.  The EIB stays outside the ambit of the system of central banks.  It is a development bank.  We do not rely too heavily on it for funds because of our access to Structural Funds.  It lends mainly to telecommunications and energy projects, although there is an effort underway at present to make loans available to small and medium sized industries.  We have an interest in this.</P>
    <P>Transposition of Community legislation was mentioned by a number of Senators.  The transposition of Community secondary legislation into Irish law has given rise to extensive discussion. This is correct because it is extremely important.  It is often said that our rate of transposition is poor and that we compare badly with other member states.  The process is complex and extends to the area of responsibility for a number of Ministers.  The situation is changing and some measures are transposed.  New <Col N="1074" /> measures become due for transposition and other measures are superseded by newer ones.  That is almost verging on a European language, if I may say so myself.  In this fluid situation Ireland's position in the league table of transposition is by no means lagging behind.</P>
    <P>We only need to turn to the tenth annual report of the Commission on the state of transposition of EC law to appreciate how advanced this country is in its implementation arrangements.  The most recent report from the Commission records the position of each member state at the end of 1992.  Ireland shows a satisfactory rate of 91.1 per cent.  It is in fifth place after Denmark, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. In some sectors, for example in customs union, direct taxation, recognition of diplomas and rights of establishment and competition policy, the rate is 100 per cent.  The rate in other sectors may not be as high.  A recent analysis shows that there are only 23 cases where the Commission is in correspondence with the Irish authorities about the alleged delays in the transposition of EC legislation into Irish law.</P>
    <P>When the laws are passed in Europe, it is important, as has been said in the contributions here this evening, to take steps to ensure that transposition takes place.  Otherwise, we are likely to play games and we are fooling ourselves to some extent because ultimately, it only causes problems.  There is room for improvement and we will always strive to improve our performance in this regard. I can assure the House that every effort will continue to be made with a view to ensuring that EC legislation is transposed into Irish law as expeditiously and as carefully as possible because it is important to get it right.</P>
    <P>The question of Structural Funds has arisen and, apart from Senator Taylor-Quinn's comments which were slightly provocative, the approach has been quite healthy.  In the context of the present debate it is important not to lose sight of the fundamental benefits Ireland has received and is getting from these funds.</P>
    <P>The Edinburgh Council in December <Col N="1075" /> 1992 provided for significant increases in the funding.  It provided in explicit terms for a concentration on the four least prosperous member states.  It set aside an amount of 85 billion ECU which is about £68 billion pounds for the Cohesion Fund and for Objective One regions for the period 1993 to 1999.  This makes it possible for commitments to the four to double between 1992 and 1999.  We are negotiating with the European Community to obtain a share which the Government considers justified under the terms of the Edinburgh agreement.</P>
    <P>The concentration on the least prosperous member states should mean that Ireland would get an increase at least in line with the average for the Objective One regions outside the four least prosperous countries.  There would be little point in going into detailed figures until the amounts have been fully agreed.  We are in a negotiating position and what is important is that a clear message goes to Brussels that we are going to maintain that negotiating position until we get the share we feel we deserve.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry suggested that there is scope for greater cross-Border co-operation with regard to the funds.  I agree with that and I am sure the Senator is aware of my statements in that regard.  I can inform the House that there will be a considerable cross-Border content in the forthcoming national plan.  Joint projects will be submitted to Brussels for funding and this is important in terms of the social and economic areas where I would like to think we can make progress without upsetting anybody.</P>
    <P>With regard to the funding in 1993, the Members will be aware that the Taoiseach in his report to the Dáil on the Edinburgh Council in December 1992 referred to a seven year period and that is recorded clearly in the Edinburgh Conclusions. This referred to 1993 to 1999.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon and others spoke about explaining the EC and its work to its citizens.  In the past we have all been somewhat slack in relation to bringing the people with us and keeping them involved in what is happening at EC <Col N="1076" /> level.  In the Dáil recently I dealt with a question about a third level institution to look at European issues or the Department of Education trying to introduce European studies at second level.  It is important in the context of our involvement with Europe that at a young age our citizens would become familiar with the European Community and its aims and objectives to which we are all firmly committed.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy pointed out that the EC will be judged by its deeds and this involves dealing with the unemployment crisis.  Education which he referred to in some detail and co-operation in that area is an important means of improving employment prospects.  He also mentioned the role of women in the European Commission.  I am sure the Commission will take careful note of the arguments put forward on this issue.  The role of women is extremely important in all of our institutions.  They are under-represented and the Government is insisting and ensuring that there is a gender quota applying to all State boards and with regard to all appointments made by the Government.  It is important to ensure that there is a proper role for women in all institutions, both national and European, and I will do anything possible in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I could entitle this: &ldquo;Water, water, everywhere but not a drop to drink without boiling&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The water situation in west County Wicklow now borders on the farcical. It is quite unspeakably bad.  While the reservoirs of County Wicklow are virtually bursting at their banks because of the inclement weather over the past two months for what has passed, laughingly, as a summer, and the streams and wells are practically in flood spate, parts of west County Wicklow are now as parched for a public water supply as the Gobi Desert.  In the Glen of Imaal people depend on a water supply that was put in place by the British army when it moved in to the Glen during the reign of King Edward VI.  In Rathdangan the water supply could most charitably be described as episodic.  In Grangecon, a sizeable village, there is no public water supply at all and there are private wells serving the village.  In Baltinglass, which is an important market town with its own hospital, the water supply depends on the level of the rain.  Wicklow County Council admits that the situation is unacceptable and that there should be a reservoir.  The county council also admits that the low pressure in the town for lengthy periods of any given year could impede fire fighting <Col N="1079" /> operations in the event of an emergency.</P>
    <P>The picturesque town of Stratford on Slaney, which should be known to the Minister of State, should be a tourism mecca.  It has been placed first in County Wicklow in the Tidy Towns Competition for virtually all of the last 15 years.  That is an unparalleled record for any village in any county in Ireland.  The town has put much effort into attracting visitors but they are greeted on their arrival by Eastern Health Board signs warning that the water is unfit for human consumption unless it is boiled.  In Hollywood, the gateway to the heart of west County Wicklow from the eastern part of the county, the same dreaded signs are there.</P>
    <P>In a county which is dedicated to improving jobs and improving the local rural economy through tourism, the situation is unacceptable.  It is especially unacceptable for a country that should be dedicated to having an acceptable standard of living for its citizens.</P>
    <P>There is now the farcical situation existing in County Wicklow, especially in that part of the south and the west of the county where a Leader programme is in operation.  One of the strategies to be developed under the programme is rural tourism, yet the most the basic requirements of civilised living, a proper water supply, is missing.  For years there has been talk about the mounting problems but no progress has been made.  For years plans have been discussed, plans have been drawn up and they have been shuttled backwards and forwards between the relevant Government Department and the local authority but no money has been put in place.</P>
    <P>Tonight in this House I am asking the Minister of State, and through him the Minister, to cut out the red tape.  A brave decision should be made.  There is a substantial population in a large area with a huge potential in tourism.  However, that potential can never be reached and the people will not have the standard of living they have a right to expect today unless a full regional water supply is put in place <Col N="1080" /> serving the entire community to the south of Grangecon and the west of Baltinglass.</P>
    <P>I believe there has been too much bureaucratic delay and too much equivocation on this issue.  I do not believe it would take a vast amount of funds to provide the water supply which is necessary and I ask the Minister to do what he can to help the people of west County Wicklow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): I thank Senator Roche for addressing this issue.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made in the provision of water and sewerage infrastructure in Wicklow under the public capital programme.  Some £30 million has been allocated to the county and its urbans in the past six years and a number of important schemes, cofinanced by the EC, have been completed under the current water and sanitary services operational programme.  These include Wicklow town sewerage contracts 2 and 3, £8.8 million, Baltinglass sewerage, £1.9 million, and the River Dargle flood protection scheme, £1.2 million.  In addition, a major sewerage treatment works for Greystones is at an advanced stage of planning.</P>
      <P>The Senator will be aware of the major construction programme that has taken place over the past number of years in the water and sanitary services area.  Significant EC funding has been received to aid this programme and this support will continue over the next few years.  Notwithstanding this level of commitment, however, it is still necessary to prioritise schemes.</P>
      <P>The proposed south west Wicklow regional water supply scheme is designed to serve a widely dispersed rural population. A prelimminary report for the scheme was approved in 1985 and contract documents have been received in my Department.  The scheme will provide for reservoirs, a booster pumping station and 150 mm diameter trunk mains to avail of a source which has been provided as part of the north Carlow regional supply scheme at a cost of £350,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> It has always been intended that use of this source would be promoted through the formation of group water schemes in the area.  In this regard, my Department is currently undertaking a review of the group scheme position in south west Wicklow and as soon as this review is completed we will be in a position to make decisions on this matter.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the review I would remind the Senator that there are many competing schemes for the limited finance that is available.  Each scheme has to be assessed, taking into account the priority given it both locally and nationally and having regard to the existing commitments under the water and sanitary services programme.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Roche for his contribution in this House tonight and I can assure him that his comments will be borne in mind in the evaluation of the scheme.  I appreciate the difficulty outlined by him, especially in the areas around Baltinglass, Stratford on Slaney, Hollywood, Rathdangan and Grangecon. I can assure the Senator that every effort will be made in the Department of the Environment to give the matter full priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.</P>
      <P>The excellent services that exist in north east County Wicklow was due at least in small part to the fact that the area was well represented in the Oireachtas until very recently.  Unfortunately this will not cut ice or supply water to the people in the south and west of the county which is the area I am concerned with at present.  Therefore, I will be returning with this issue to the Minister in the autumn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish her success in her portfolio as Minister for Education which is not at any time an easy office.  I have had a number of motions put down in this House and they all appear to relate <Col N="1082" /> to education.  The Minister is, I believe, well aware of some of the educational problems in County Mayo and I do not believe there is any need for me to elaborate on these at present.  However, I am immediately concerned with the toilet facilities at Mayo Abbey national school at Claremorris, County Mayo.  It saddens me to have to raise as an issue in this House in 1993 a national school which is over 100 years old and with over 80 students where, in order to go to the toilets, those students have to go over 100 yards from the entrance of the school. Mayo Abbey was once one of the foremost educational parts of Europe in the times of the monasteries and monks.  I can only say the toilets in Mayo Abbey national school nearly date back to those ages.</P>
      <P>The school is a national school with three classrooms and there are no facilities for the teachers.  They have to eat their lunches in the classroom and in this day and age that is not acceptable.  It is a vibrant community with many new facilities, including new football fields and a new church and they desperately need to have something done about toilet facilities in the school.  I would like the Minister to come to the school when she next visits Mayo.  Then perhaps the necessary work will be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline exactly how we are going to respond to this problem. We are talking about the teachers and parents of pupils in Mayo Abbey.  It is a three-teacher school with 71 enrolments. I absolutely accept that the toilet facilities in this case and, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, in many other schools including your own local schools, are less than ideal and that they are causing hardship to the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we wish to raise the accommodation standards of schools, the resources available are never quite sufficient <Col N="1083" /> to meet the needs.  The Department has to ensure that the moneys voted through the Dáil for primary education accommodation purposes are spent expeditiously and to the best possible advantage.  The Senator is probably aware that there has been some delay in this case because the Department was endeavouring to amalgamate another school with Mayo Abbey and there was a local reluctance to pursue this matter which arose before my time in the Department.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper on Education which was published this time last year outlined the ideal of a four-teacher school.  The Department officials were considering the future of this school and whether the money should be spent on what was deemed in the Green Paper to be an ideal situation.  As the Senator is aware, Mayo Abbey did not feel that it slotted into that.  The position taken in the Green Paper was one which governed the Department when they were looking at the application from Mayo Abbey.  The options and alternatives are under consideration and I am assured by my officials that they are nearing completion. We expect to convey a decision to the chairman of the board of management by the end of July so that adequate facilities will be provided for the school in line <Col N="1084" /> with modern standards and requirements.</P>
    <P>I hope I will be in a position as Minister to ensure that it will not be necessary to have this debate again because we all agree there are basic facilities which are required.  I believe the Senator; a visit from the Minister might short circuit that in this particular case.  There are over 100 schools where the provision of sanitary facilities could be considered to be inadequate and I think that before we begin designing greater and more expensive facilities, that is a basic facility which we should put in place.  I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline that.</P>
