      <P>At the outset I take this opportunity to welcome Deirdre Lane back to duty and to thank Jodie Blake, who acted in the capacity of Clerk of the Seanad, for her competence and excellent performance.</P>
      <P>I have notice from Senator Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to take steps as a matter of urgency to protect the important archaeological site at Christchurch Place, recently uncovered, which contains an impressive portion of the pre-Norman town wall and 13th century mural tower, which is threatened by commercial development and infill.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction the appointment of a home/school liaison officer at St. Anne's primary school, Rathkeale, County Limerick, in view of the large number of travelling children attending this school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" /> I also received notice from Senator Burke of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to give an up-to-date report on his reason for granting a permit for salmon fallowing cages in the Annagh Bay area north of Achill Island.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to extend the urban renewal scheme to Wicklow town and to further parts of Bray, County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Norris, Neville, Burke, and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters of Senator Norris and Senator Neville and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Burke and Senator Ross may given notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>I endorse the sentiments expressed about Deirdre Lane and Jodie Blake.  Today's Order of Business will be items 1, 2 and 20.  Item 1 will be taken until its conclusion; item 2 will be take when item 1 is concluded and until 6 p.m.; item 20 will be taken from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader of the House make time available today or tomorrow for clarification on the Government's tax amnesty proposals? Will he confirm that this measure, which discriminates against law-abiding PAYE taxpayers in favour of what the trade union movement terms &ldquo;social criminals <Col N="627" /> who evade tax&rdquo;, has the full support of the Labour Party?</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That item 14 be inserted before item 1.</P>
      <P>I have raised over the last number of weeks the accommodation available to the Independent Senators.  I appreciate the efforts you, a Chathaoirligh, have made in that regard.  Unfortunately, despite numerous meetings, I still have not received a clear understanding of how the situation is to be resolved.  I propose that item 14 on the Order Paper be taken as part of today's Order of Business to allow a discussion of the disgraceful conditions in which we and our staff are expected to work.  The facilities are not appropriate and the situation is unacceptable. I recognise the help I have received and I regret having to interfere with the smooth running of business but the situation is impossible.  We have a duty to the people who work with us and as legislators we have a responsibility to do our work properly which we cannot do at the moment.  I have made a proposal to the Government Chief Whip that a room to be made available to us but there are apparently other problems.  To draw attention to this problem I moved an amendment to the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Leader of the House about his statement last week regarding legislation which is to be dealt with between now and the summer recess.  The Criminal Law (Suicide) Bill, 1993, is not included.  Is it the Government's intention to bring in this legislation prior to the summer recess and, if so, why is it omitted from the list?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for an early statement and, if possible, a debate on the proposed tax amnesty, if it is an amnesty rather than a gift.  Perhaps the Leader can comment on whether the fact that there is a 20 per cent tax rate in the Isle of Man has anything to do with the 15 per cent rate proposed in this measure.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate if there are any legislative implications or if there will be any legislation coming before the House as a result of today's Supreme Court decision on the interpretative centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to allow time for a discussion on the current Dublin Bus strike.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to allow time in the near future for a debate on school transport.  Initially when school transport was provided in some areas it was because a school closed.  However, circumstances are changing and the House should review the situation.  There should be a debate on the issue because it is important.  Those who need school transport most should be considered and I ask the Leader to arrange a debate as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support previous speakers who asked for clarification on the proposed outrageous tax amnesty. Will the Leader of the House state whether the proposals are in breach of the Finance Act?  Of course he will not say that they are in breach of the Act but have they been considered in the context of the present Finance Bill and particularly of sections of the Finance Act, 1984?  I know people have been prosecuted <Col N="629" /> because of an oversight under that section of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House provide time to debate in the House today's Supreme Court decision on the Mullaghmore and Luggala cases because they are matters of extreme importance in relation to public policy? We would like to know the Government's plans on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second Senator O'Toole's amendment to the Order of Business.  Perhaps those Members who are interested in its substance might care to look at the text of the amendment which we have tabled.  We feel strongly about this matter because we are being asked to make bricks without straw.</P>
      <P>Could I also ask if the Government might consider as a token of goodwill, in the wake of the disastrous intervention in removing from this House the Suicide Bill, taking, for example, a small item such as the Interpretation Bill, which seems to have disappeared from the Order Paper and which I intend putting back?  This would cure certain difficulties recently experienced in legislation and would indicate goodwill in terms of participatory democracy from all sides of the House.  I would like the Government to consider accepting this or another Private Member's Bill or a Bill from the Independent benches.</P>
      <P>I wish to support the remarks on the tax amnesty and it is important to debate it.  People who have been taking immense amounts of money from this State are apparently being given some sort of leeway in contrast to the treatment of ordinary people.  Recently, a 95 year old relative of mine received a demand threatening the intervention of the sheriff for a debt of less than £200.  It is an astonishing contrast in behaviour and should be examined.</P>
      <P>Finally, might I ask you, a Chathaoirligh, to seek with your usual tact and discretion, some sounding from the Government with regard to item 19 which concerns the possibility of establishing a press officer for the Oireachtas?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request to the Leader of the House for a debate on the interpretative centres following the Supreme Court decision.  This has wider implications because the Office of Public Works is building projects without planning permission and if this is wrong, then every other development must also be wrong and outside the law.  It is time for the matter to be clarified and for the relevant Minister to explain the Government's views on the issue.  Another case was decided in the High Court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Bill, 1992  [  Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil ]  : Report and Final Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 82, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purport of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  The only <Col N="633" /> matter, therefore, that may be discussed is the amendments made by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>For the convenience of Senators I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of those amendments.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>As you said, this Bill has been passed by the Dáil and the amendments which I am introducing today arise directly from the Dáil debate and from the previous Seanad debate. Amendment No. 1 will oblige the nominated officer in the Department of Justice &mdash; the person to whom the application is made in the first instance for an interception &mdash; to maintain a record of any oral authorisation given.  While I do not accept that as the Bill originally stood there was any scope for abuse, nevertheless, the view was expressed during the Dáil debate that when the High Court judge who is entrusted to review the legislation is viewing various interceptions he might not find a record of any oral authorisation. I do not think there is scope for abuse in the Bill as originally drafted. Nevertheless, this amendment reinforces that assurance.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 can be explained together.  Under the Bill as originally drafted the request for authorisation to the nominated officer of the Department of Justice had to be made, in the case of the Garda Síochána, by the Garda Commissioner, and, in the case of the Defence Forces, for military intelligence purposes, by an officer of the Defence Forces not below the rank of colonel.  For the sake of uniformity it was decided to accept the Opposition amendment in the Dáil &mdash; changed slightly &mdash; to the effect that in the case of an application for an authorisation from the Defence Forces the application must issue from the Chief of Staff.  I have used the terminology &ldquo;Chief of Staff&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Chief of Staff of the Permanent Defence Forces&rdquo; because it is in line with the definition of Chief of Staff in the Defence Act of 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> I accepted amendment No. 4 on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  The designated judge, the High Court judge who will review the legislation, was obliged under the legislation as originally drafted to report to the Taoiseach at least once every two years.  The two year period was the maximum time that could elapse between each report.  Despite this obligation to report at two yearly intervals there is provision in the relevant section for the designated judge to report, from time to time between the main reports, to the Minister for Justice and to the Taoiseach on any matter that may concern him.  In view of the fact that there was no guarantee that two years would not elapse between each main report, I decided to reduce the period from two years to one year.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 9 are technical amendments which arise from the change in the name of the Department as a result of the formation of the new Government and the creation of the Department of Tourism, Energy and Communications.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 is consequential on amendment No. 8 which arises from a point made by Deputy Gallagher of the Labour Party on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  It concerns the release of metering information: the number of calls made, how long each call lasted, how many units were used and so on.</P>
    <P>The Bill as originally drafted sought to ensure that if the Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces sought this information from Telecom, they would have to do so in accordance with the provisions of the section.  To strengthen that provision I accepted a recommendation from Deputy Gallagher and included the requirement that if such a request is made in the case of the Garda Síochána, the garda who requests the information from Telecom must produce an authorisation signed by a Garda officer not below the rank of chief superintendent.  In the case of military intelligence such a request to Telecom must be authorised and signed by an army officer not below the rank of colonel.  That will not only strengthen the legislation but will also reassure the <Col N="635" /> public that information about their telephone bills is not being released at the request of just anybody.</P>
    <P>The amendments are the product of the cumulative wisdom of the Dáil and the Seanad and will improve the Bill. They will provide for more transparency, which is a fashionable word at present, and I commend them to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the passing of the Bill and look forward to its early signature by the President.  It is 12 months since the Bill was initiated in the Seanad and the legislation is welcome and long overdue.</P>
      <P>I welcome amendment No. 1 as it removes the fear that oral authorisation may be abused for interception of postal packets and telecommunications.  It provides that applications for formal oral authorisation will be made in the same way as those for written authorisation. Therefore, a record will be kept by the nominating officer of the oral authorisation. It helps to minimise the opportunities for abuse.</P>
      <P>I welcome amendment No. 2 and I remind the Minister that I proposed this amendment in the Seanad on Committee Stage last June.  In fact the Minister made a strong case that it should be an officer not below the rank of colonel rather than the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces as is now the case.  I welcome the Minister's conversion to this point of view and he should also give credit for this amendment to the debate in the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome amendment No. 4 which was also debated in the Seanad.  It requires the High Court judge to report at least once each year or after each year rather than after a two year period.  I welcome the fact that the views of my party were taken into consideration and that the Minister has changed the reporting procedure.  We believed it <Col N="636" /> would improve the credibility of the Bill, especially in the earlier days of its operation. Amendment No. 8, which provides that a request by a garda to a person employed by Telecom to make a disclosure in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2) (a) shall be in writing and signed by a garda not below the rank of chief superintendent, is also welcome.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been improved, although not to the level we had hoped to achieve, on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  We are glad that the Dáil accepted some of our proposals and we are pleased to support the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I share the view that the legislation has been improved by its passage through the Dáil.  I have no objections to the amendments.</P>
      <P>The main point of the legislation is that, while it is important that the State and the custodians of law and order should be able to appropriately investigate matters, that must be balanced against the citizen's rights to privacy and protection.  There have been some regrettable incidents in the past and it is the desire of everyone that this legislation will prevent such incidents occurring again.</P>
      <P>I have some technical questions which the Minister may be able to answer. There may be some questions that cannot be answered and if that is the case I will accept it.  In relation to the amendment to section 8 and the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, could it be the case in the future that if we did not have a Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications, this section might not apply? What would be the situation if we only had a Department of Communications or a Department of Energy and Communications? I assume it would not alter the substance of the legislation, but I ask the question because it should be asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a question in respect of amendment No. 8 to section 13.  As a principle, it is important that as few people as possible should be involved in these procedures, <Col N="637" /> and that is why I would welcome the earlier amendment that the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces would be the appropriate person to issue authorisations. How many Garda officers at or above the level of chief superintendent are there in the country?  How many Army officers ranking at or above the level of colonel are there in the country? Does the Minister have information on the numbers of people who would be empowered to sign authorisations under this legislation?  I realise that question is obscure and that it is one to which the answer may not be readily available.  I am sure only a small number of people would be involved.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  In addition I would like to record my appreciation of the contributions made by Senators when we first debated this Bill almost exactly a year ago.  I also acknowledge that some of the amendments I have just explained were first raised in this House.  I refer in particular to amendments Nos. 2 and 3, concerning the role of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces in applying for an authorisation for interception.  The time scale for the submission of reports by the designated judge to the Taoiseach was also first raised and debated in this House.  That I am now coming back here with these amendments in no way undermines the position of this House.  On the contrary, it shows what can be achieved through an accumulation of argument in both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other amendments were discussed in this House, and later in the Dáil, which, for a variety of reason, I was unable to accept.  I know it is sometimes difficult for Senators to understand why their amendments cannot be accepted. However, I have tried in this Bill to be as accommodating as I could and I can give an assurance that many hours were spent examining amendments and consulting other Departments and semi-State bodies about them, to see if they could be accepted, or if we could instead introduce other amendments, either as a <Col N="638" /> compromise or covering the same point. We now have a better Bill than the one introduced last May, and again I thank Senators for the part they played in ensuring that this was the case.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis raised a number of points.  I have received advice to the effect that if the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications were changed, the functions of the existing Department of Transport, Energy and Communications would be transferred to the new Department.  It would not require an amendment to legislation nor would it render the Bill inoperative.  I do not have the information the Senator seeks in regard to the number of chief superintendents and colonels, but I can get it for him if he wishes.  Amendment No. 8 deals only with the release of metering information; it does not deal with the release of content of telephone calls. It is a considerable improvement on the earlier situation, and the situation that existed at common law.</P>
    <P>Until the introduction of this Bill, any member of the Garda could request metering information from any account on the basis that he or she was investigating a crime, and Telecom employees had a common law duty to supply that information. Under this Bill the garda will have to produce an authorisation, signed by an officer not below the rank of chief superintendent.  The same situation applies to Army intelligence.  Any soldier could say that he was a member of Army Intelligence and that he needed this information for the purposes of protecting the security of the State.  Under this Bill he will have to produce an official authorisation, signed by a colonel.  This authorisation will entitle a person involved to receive metering information only about how many calls were made over a period of time and long they lasted.  The actual content of telephone communications is not available under this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this document; it is a good response to the Culliton report which we discussed here some time ago.</P>
      <P>It is amazing that we have so much unemployment because we never had so many agencies and organisations trying to help people.  Despite Eolas and FÁS, we have not overcome the unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>Something about the problem struck me very forcefully a couple of days ago. The county council has spent a lot of money over the past three years on my village but in that time, not one person asked me about getting a job working on the roads.  I questioned the area supervisor and he said that nobody looks for work on roads nowadays.  That amazes me, because years ago so many people were looking for jobs on the roads that even on minor relief schemes there was a rota system &mdash; week on/week off.  With so much unemployment, why are people not looking for work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> A factory in my area was looking for ten workers &mdash; men and women &mdash; and they advertised through an RTE programme promoting jobs.  They only got two people &mdash; one lad from Limerick and another who returned from England. However, at county council and health board offices there are often a couple of hundred people going for a couple of clerical jobs.</P>
    <P>It is time for a proper survey of the types of employment available and the jobs the unemployed could do.  We should categorise all our unemployed people, to see how many of them are bricklayers, computer operators, etc.  We could then see exactly what kind of jobs we should be trying to generate.  This could alleviate the problem because there are jobs people do not know about, and some people are looking for jobs for which they are not suited.</P>
    <P>An entrepreneur embarking on a project should be able to get a list from either Eolas or FÁS of the number of electricians, technicians, etc., available in the immediate area; the list should detail the nature of unemployment in that area.  We should encourage business people and entrepreneurs to create job opportunities for the people who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>We should also develop the old technical school concept of work experience during the last year of a course, in other words, on a four year course, in the fourth year emphasis was put on on the job experience.  Training moved from practical work to the theory of woodwork, metalwork, home economics, etc. Perhaps, we have too many people who could write 40 foolscap pages on the shape of the new penny and never say it was round.  It is time for a return to practicalities.</P>
    <P>Many of my contempories made a success of their lives and of their businesses. It amazes me that people are not more successful today.  Perhaps we should return to the day when there was not so much red tape or as many inspectors. Mr. Campbell of Campbell Catering said recently on television that if he was starting in business today he would not be <Col N="641" /> nearly as ambitious, or start as big as he did, because the system would not allow it.  I could not agree more.</P>
    <P>When I started in business in the early sixties a person who had saved some money, went to the bank manager for financial backing.  It was easy to start a business because there were few bureaucratic procesures, such as planning reports, environmental impact studies, reports for the Revenue Commissioners and so on.  A notebook of creditors and debtors was maintained and these were dealt with as they arose.</P>
    <P>It was a simple system that made money and created employment.  Today, however, there is too much streamlining and bureaucracy.  There is too much time spent obtaining tax numbers, VAT numbers and so on.  Any firm starting up today, unless it is a big operation, cannot afford the administrative costs involved, despite the assistance through State sponsored agencies.  For example, an inspector called to my garage when I was repairing a car.  I undertook to provide him with the information he required within two months.  However, I decided to close the garage and I told the inspector that, as a result, two men were out of work, that I would continue to make a living but that nobody like him would be telling me what to do.</P>
    <P>This story illustrates what is wrong today in business.  There are far too many people creating bureaucratic red tape.  If we want to encourage people to create work we must simplify the procedure. There is far too much bureaucracy involved in starting a business and I note that a person of the calibre of Mr. Patrick Campbell takes the same view.</P>
    <P>If a business employs three to four people, one will be working for the Revenue Commissioners keeping the books, the second will be working to maintain the business and the employer is lucky if the remaining employees are working to repay the bank and the overheads.  The book keeping and other procedures in business are excessive and must be curtailed. A person I know flew back recently from a small airport in Greece no larger than the airport in Sligo.  There <Col N="642" /> are 36 flights a day from that airport although they are at the stage of development at which we were 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>This is a good report and contains many fine ideas.  However, we must tackle the problem of high taxation.  For example, an employee must earn approximately £240 per week to take home £160 and this costs the employer approximately £300 per week.  It is not possible to maintain a business, incur those kind of overheads and comply with all the bureaucratic rules and regulations now in force.  For every one Government Department offering assistance, there are two Departments ensuring that the business will fail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and the opportunity to discuss the Government's response to the Culliton report set out in the document <i>Employment through Enterprise.</i>  I agree with the point made by Senator Hillery when discussing this report two weeks ago that solving the unemployment problem will be the bottom line for the Government.</P>
      <P>There is general agreement that unemployment is at the core of the State's most serious social and economic problems. Because of this, the Culliton report has been welcomed and accepted as the most serious attempt for decades to develop a strategy capable of resolving these problems. The Culliton report is seen as the means by which a spirit of enterprise can be encouraged.  It is generally agreed that this is needed more than anything to solve the problem of unemployment.  I agree with the point made by Senator Farrell about the difficulty of getting involved in enterprise.  The task of the Government is to encourage people to become involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government and the Minister accept the broad thrust of the Culliton report and have promised to improve the environment in which enterprise might flourish.  While I accept a number of the issues dealt with in this report, such as training and education referred to by Senator Henry earlier in this debate, there are two issues which would do more <Col N="643" /> than most to improve the environment in which enterprise might flourish. However, the Government has abandoned these two issues and because of this has failed to provide convincing evidence of its determination to introduce the reforms necessary to create this culture of enterprise.</P>
    <P>One of the most stark issues is the tax system, which the Culliton report described as oppressive, unfair and likely to stifle enterprise.  The other key area in which Culliton has been ditched is the proliferation of Government Departments and agencies dealing with industry, rather than their integration and reduction as recommended by the Culliton report.  Senator Farrell appears to agree with this.  It is too difficult today for people to get involved in industry or to set up on their own in industry and they will not become involved until it is made easier for them.</P>
    <P>Regarding the recommendations of the Culliton report on taxation, I am unable to understand how the Minister can advise that the Government accepts the broad intent of these recommendations because the reality is that after this year's budget every worker, from those earning below the average industrial wage, is paying an extra 1 per cent levy in tax on their income.  This is on top of the 7.75 per cent already taken by PRSI, the health levy and the youth employment levy.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report concludes that in no other single area does the Government have at its disposal the tools to make as far reaching and effective a reform to support an enterprise economy as in taxation.  I believe that on the taxation agenda, the Goverment intellectually accepts the key recommendations of the tax reform philosophy contained in the Culliton report.  There are two such recommendations, that tax be collected on a sufficiently broad base and that the tax system be drastically simplified.  I cannot understand how the Government can assert that it accepts these recommendations and yet in this budget it introduces a fifth tax on work, <Col N="644" /> on everyone whose income exceeds £173 per week.  This figure is less than the average industrial wage.  It flies in the face of the Culliton report.</P>
    <P>The one commodity that appears to be taxed as a luxury in this country is work. This Government, which intellectually accepts the Culliton report, but proceeds to do the opposite of what it recommends, penalises everyone earning less than the average industrial wage through the new employment levy.  It is the single greatest measure in this year's Finance Bill of the contempt which this Government has in practice for the tax reform philosophy contained in the Culliton report.  It is not good enough for Ministers to say they accept the recommendations in Culliton and then do the opposite.</P>
    <P>For the first time in six years this budget has ensured that the tax position for workers at the average industrial wage has disimproved.  My colleague, Deputy Cox, when speaking on the budget in the Dáil, gave an example of a married man with four children currently earning £8,000 per year.  The tax and welfare system ensures that this man's disposable income, through a variety of means such as the family income supplement, the medical card, local authority rent allowance and so on would be greater than his gross earned income. The example also illustrates that if the same man was in a job with a gross income of £15,000 per year, which is £7,000 more than he was previously earning, he would be £200 worse off under our tax and welfare system.</P>
    <P>This example underlines the inadequacies in our taxation system.  A woman to whom I spoke recently got an increase of £30 per week from 1 May 1993.  As a result her weekly earnings went above the £173 mark and she now earned £185 per week gross.  This £30 a week gross was costing her employer, almost £34 a week with the 12.2 per cent PRSI rate.  Yet, all she was getting out of that rise was £13.50, with which she was not too pleased.  The employer was none too pleased either since it was costing him £34 to grant the increase of £13.50.  There <Col N="645" /> are many situations involving small enterprises employing three or four people, where so much is being paid back to the State because of the difference between what an employee takes home and what it costs the employer in wages, that an extra three or four people could be employed if those costs were less.  We must look at this seriously.  It is difficult for the ordinary PAYE workers to believe that the Government is in favour of encouraging people to work when some people would be almost as well off staying at home on unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>On the issue of agency integration, the reality is that Culliton is not being implemented.  Instead of the one-stop-shop agency for indigenous industry which Culliton recommended incorporating the IDA, Eolas, FÁS and An Bord Tráchtála, we will have an even greater multiplicity of agencies under this scheme.  When the network of county enterprise boards is added we will have reached a level of bureaucracy that even the former communist rulers of eastern Europe would envy.  I cannot understand why we make it more and more difficult for people to set up in business.  I agree with Senator Farrell that people who set up in business feel they will be haunted by so many State agencies that they would be better off leaving their moneys in the bank, or sending it abroad and gettting the benefit of a 15 per cent tax amnesty when they bring it back.  It is no good saying we accept something in principle and then in practice doing the direct opposite.</P>
    <P>The proposed bench-marking of prices and services from State agencies, many of which enjoy a monopoly, is welcome. It is a good idea to compare prices in the telecommunications and energy fields with similar services elsewhere in Europe with a view to making our services more price competitive.  However, this is another example of saying one thing and doing another because in this year's budget telephone charges have risen by 5 per cent.  We will be dealing with the big hike in telephone charges later today during Private Members' Business.  What <Col N="646" /> does the Government intend to do to encourage private enterprise?  The reality is that work is taxed which means that enterprise is also taxed.  The time for harding thinking and reform is now, if we want to end the unemployment crisis and reduce the number of people out of work. We have to make hard decisions now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Honan's remarks.  I find it hard to pay my taxes, and it hurts me to pay 48 per cent, like most Members of this House.  It is certainly not done with ease or pleasure. I support the motion and feel we must monitor the situation.  Everyone accepts that we have a crisis with large numbers of young unemployed people.  I do not believe that Culliton or anyone else, has a magic wand which will eliminate unemployment. Technology is being developed which eliminates jobs.  I was in America recently and visited a warehouse covering 40 acres, not a single person was working there.  Everything was done by robot and computer control using bar codes on products stored there for dispatch.  There was only one worker driving a fork-lift loading the containers at the door.  If I could have filmed the scene it would have been a frightening picture to show to people at home who are hoping to develop their technology and know-how.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody, including the trade unions, has a big responsibility in this regard. Irish Picture Mouldings had three factories in Donegal, Mount Charles and Glenties employing nearly 1,000 people but has now closed because of a dispute. There was a number of factories in the industrial estate in Gweedore.  GT Carpets employed nearly 1,200 people.  The famous Crolly Doll factory as well as numerous bakeries have now closed. There is only one bakery left in County Donegal and we have to buy bread baked in other counties.  We are destroying jobs.  We are all in this together, but nobody is saying that taxes are too high. One has to be realistic and ask who will provide the £30 million per week needed for social welfare payments.  We have serious problems and I know that the <Col N="647" /> Minister of State and Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas would dearly like to solve them.  Unfortunately, this is a major task and the situation must be monitored carefully.</P>
    <P>More jobs should be provided in agriculture as the numbers have decreased dramatically.  Ray MacSharry was right in wanting to change the incentives and supports for agriculture by providing more for the small producer.  He wanted to get away from a situation where 80 per cent of EC funding went to large factory farms and co-ops.  He wanted to give money to the producer but his offer of assistance was resisted vigorously by those who wanted to maintain the income for the 20 per cent who were receiving the lion's share.  That was a fundamental mistake, because it meant forcing traditional small farming families off the farm and into looking for jobs in hotels and offices away from their environment.</P>
    <P>We would also expand the fishing industry which has not yet reached its full potential.  We produce fewer than 1.5 onshore jobs per fishermen compared to an average of six onshore jobs per fisherman in the rest of Europe.  At the same time, it is not long since fish were dumped and destroyed with oil poured on them all over Europe, while our totally undeveloped fishing industry remains a potential development area for our young people.  We should look at areas of job potential such as agriculture, fish processing, storage and sales.  There is also a major potential for jobs in the tourism industry.  The Minister of State is aware of our hotel training college in Killybegs with 400 students.  I am pleased that we have a 100 per cent uptake from that college, which means that it must be a growth area.</P>
    <P>We must see where jobs are readily available and develop that sector rather than being negative.  Many negative people here would rather dispise and criticise.  Some people with jobs are paying very little tax and are complaining about this 1 per cent levy, but many young people are condemned to collect a small amount of money on the dole <Col N="648" /> every week.  I sympathise with them. Across the Border in Strabane and Castlederg, young single people get £32 per week on the dole; some of them are moving to Donegal to get £57 per week.</P>
    <P>Apart from natural gas, Ireland has no great wealth other than the resources of our young people.  We must encourage them to help them by providing them with jobs.  However, the areas where we can provide jobs are restricted.  The Irish clothing industry is competing with countries which use slave labour.  At one stage we had woollen mills including the Blarney, Convey and Foxford mills.  At present no woollen mill in Ireland is producing yarn.  I fail to see the reason for that.  We have millions of sheep and huge amounts of wool but there is not one job in the wool industry.  Has enough research been done?  What were the finding of such research?  This is a major task and should be the Government's top priority.</P>
    <P>I ignore those who sit back, complain and criticise.  Those people are going nowhere.  The average radio listener or newspaper reader has the IQ to assess matters.  As I said there is no magic wand to provide a solution via the Culliton report or any other method.  I welcome the input of everyone who has a positive contribution to make.  I am barely touching the problems but I would like more time for discussion and positive suggestions.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look for areas where there is potential for job creation, such as tourism.  More young people should be trained to become first class workers in the tourism industry.  Whether they are chefs, managers, housekeepers, etc., they should be as good as any workers in any country.  Jobs will only be found in Ireland when we train our young people and encourage them to be as good as anyone in Europe.  There is also potential for job creation in fishing and agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is upsetting to see people from Taiwan or Pakistan finding and providing jobs in Ireland.  In Donegal several foreign owned industries are doing well and providing jobs.  Our people must realise <Col N="649" /> tht no one will provide jobs for us; we must do it ourselves.  We should encourage each other and not be criticising continually.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  There are many proposals in the Culliton report presented by the Minister but I would like to know which proposals have been omitted.  The Government missed an opportunity to implement the report and go some way towards changing the existing system that has not worked.</P>
      <P>We have been told a person earning £8,000 per year is better off than someone earning £15,000 per year.  If that is the case, questions must be raised.  Why is there no adequate response to the problem? The proposals that have been presented will not solve it.</P>
      <P>The budget as enacted by the Finance Bill, 1992, was the most anti-business measure introduced since I become a Member of the Oireachtas.  It was anti-enterprise and opposed people who wished to do something for themselves. Not until long after that Finance Bill was passed did business people realise how severe its provisions were.</P>
      <P>In September 1992 we experienced the currency crisis which continued through the election campaign up until February of this year.  Was the best advice available to the Minister for Finance that we not devalue?  Was it said that if we devalued our interest rates would not come down? How many heads have rolled because of that decision not to devalue when the United Kingdom pulled out of the ERM? That was a fundamental mistake.  It cost the State about £300 million and it cost people living here hundreds of millions of pounds over five months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Repercussions from that <i>débâcle</i> still cause immense damage to many businesses. Today a major international company announced that it proposes to close its factory with a loss of 400 jobs.  I intend to raise that matter in this Houe tomorrow. At the time of the currency problem, the company was losing substantial amounts of money weekly.  As a result, it was unable to compete for orders it <Col N="650" /> could be supplying now.  If the Government had devauled in time, these problems would not have arisen.</P>
    <P>Since then there has been a budget. The proposals in that budget are far removed from those the Culliton report suggested if we are to make real progress. Since the budget a 1 per cent levy on employment has been imposed.  It has been called a &ldquo;temporary little arrangement&rdquo;, to use the words of a famous Member of the Oireachtas.  Why has the levy been linked with other taxes and not specifically identified on every person's pay slip?  It has been included with income tax and the other levies.  It would appear the levy is intended to be a long term measure.</P>
    <P>The budget provided for an increase in VAT on clothing and many jobs have been lost as a result.  Companies were close to being able to compete with the foreign companies who can provide goods much cheaper than we can.  Then the Government increased the VAT rates and as a result many jobs in the clothing industry are lost.</P>
    <P>Recently it was proposed to levy VAT on telephone charges and to increase the price of local calls.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications said that this proposal was recommended in the Culliton report, he has also said only 25 per cent of people will be affected.  First, Mr. Culliton has denied he made any proposals to reorganise telephone charges.  Second, to which 25 per cent of people is the Minister referring? Every indigenous industry seeking business and customers throughout Ireland and other parts of Europe will be asked to pay an extra £34 million.  This proposal is supposed to change the system in line with the Culliton report although Mr. Culliton denies it will make a difference.</P>
    <P>What is the position regarding the County Enterprise Partnership Boards which were initiated by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government? One was established on a pilot basis in Galway but we have not heard of the others since then.  Will there be an expansion of the county development teams to take on board the proposals of those <Col N="651" /> boards?  How long must we wait?  Many people with good projects are waiting to see if assistance will become available. Six months after the formation of the Government the boards have not yet been established.</P>
    <P>Proceeds from the sale of State assets could be used to develop jobs and industry. What a job we made of selling the State assets we recently put on the market.  The Labour Party objected to the sale of the State's remaining shares in Greencore to ADM, a company which is already in business in this State and would have injected badly needed finance from abroad into the company in return for a part ownership of it; they could not have become full owners. However, we prevented them from purchasing shares in Greencore.  We attempted then to sell the shares on the stock exchange market but handled the sale badly.  Yet the Labour Party, a Government Party, tells the media they are opposed to the sale of any State assets.</P>
    <P>Proceeds from the sale of State assets should be used for only two purposes, reducing the national debt or financing badly-needed investment in indigenous industries.  I object to such proceeds being used to finance current expenditure as happened with the proceeds from the sale of 15 per cent of Greencore shares last year and £30 million of Greencore shares this year.  This is the wrong policy to adopt.  As someone pointed out on the RTE radio programme, &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, the British Government sold the majority of its State assets and is now in a bad financial position with debts amounting to billions of pounds.  We should not squander such proceeds but use them to invest in job creation or reduce the national debt.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report and the Government's response to it are the wrong way to deal with the problems of ordinary people to which Members referred both today and the previous day.  The main problem is that too many people look to others to provide them with employment and too few people are prepared to create circumstances in which they can make <Col N="652" /> money for themselves rather than for someone else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I am glad to contribute to this important debate.  All of us in public life must take very seriously our responsibility to deal with the problem of over 300,000 unemployed people, the most important issue facing Ireland in the 1990s and beyond.  In the mid and late 1980s there was great concern about our economic situation which was bedevilled by rampant inflation and soaring interest rates together with the fear that the International Monetary Fund would impose stringent financial conditions on us. Thankfully, those worried are now behind us and our economy is stable.</P>
      <P>The Government has adopted measures, which I welcome, to resolve our outstanding employment problem. However a solution will not be found easily.  I am glad the Government's report clearly states that the resolution of this problem is not the responsibility of any one Minister or Department; all have equal responsibility in the matter.  Public representatives, State agencies, employers and business people also have a role to play in solving this problem.  The infrastructural development needed to assist job creation opportunities is the responsibility of everyone.</P>
      <P>The measures now being adopted will encourage development and employment creation.  Unless we have a climate conducive to investment that yields an adequate return we will not generate employment.  In the past it was believed that people who gained experience abroad could, on their return home, provide employment in Ireland.  That is no longer a reality.  There must be co-ordination between local, national, European and international job creation policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's decision to establish County Enterprise Partnership Boards is welcome because it provides a structure whereby the views, opinions and entrepreneurial spirit of local communities will be available to State agencies. I hope that when these boards are <Col N="653" /> established they will not be replicas of one another but that each will reflect the unique circumstances of its county.  For example, what would be the opportunities in the midlands <i>vis-a-vis</i> the opportunities in the south-western counties? The south-western counties lay a great emphasis on tourism which has been a traditional industry in the Cork-Kerry area while in the midlands, the River Shannon is a tourist attraction.</P>
    <P>The development of our peat resources has been a major opportunity to create employment over the years.  That should be reflected in the enterprise boards. Another opportunity for development is technology, which may be more important in one area than another.  Regional technical colleges should be involved with the enterprise boards with a view to providing expertise and their courses should be geared towards industry in the area.  There are many issues involved; only local involvement in enterprise boards can be successful, but not on the basis of each board being equal and of the same composition.</P>
    <P>As regards employment opportunities under the proposed new IDA structure, it is important that indigenous industry has a body to look after it and that foreign industry is dealt with by a separate section.  Indigenous industry has not received the necessary help in recent times.  In particular, I am saddened about the plight of Bord na Móna and the way it has been neglected over the last few years.  Granted, rationalisation was needed, but rationalisation cannot replace social concern and human cost. Bord na Móna was started by a few people many years ago and has provided opportunities for thousands of workers throughout the midlands, it held together the fabric of society in the midlands and provided opportunities and prosperity in those areas.  So much so that small towns replaced villages.</P>
    <P>Sadly, those opportunities are diminishing without, unfortunately, proper consideration being given to the alternatives. It is sad to see foreign companies, and some private companies, taking up the opportunities of Bord na <Col N="654" /> Móna might have developed had there been enough foresight to support and promote the semi-State sector.  If semi-State bodies are left to their own devices without proper Government involvement, then complications will arise and major hatchet work will be required at a critical stage to keep a company afloat. That is what happened Bord na Móna.  It was suddenly realised that Bord na Móna had become practically insolvent and the only solution was to put thousands of workers on the dole and close down enterprises throughout the midlands. Hopefully, new thinking will be applied and Bord an Móna will be restored as a company that can diversify if given the proper assistance and back up.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the approach to training and apprenticeship.  It is not enough to suggest that apprenticeships are available under certain circumstances. Those circumstances must be looked at as closely as the apprenticeships. A major problem with apprenticeships which has not been resolved in the recent proposals, is the question of sponsorship.  For a scheme to provide apprenticeships in the trades to be successful, our State bodies, for instance the ESB, the Army and local authorities, should be involved.  This would be ideal to avoid victimisation and provide proper controls and procedures.  I ask that the Minister of State take this on board and have it examined with a view to providing opportunities and sponsorship through State bodies and local authorities.  Perhaps local authorities would not be interested in this proposal, but I have no doubt that if some county managers were approached they could provide opportunities for sponsorship.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's response to the Culliton report and the Moriarty Task Force.  We are on the right track but we need to keep a close eye on what is happening.  We need the involvement of people outside the Civil Service.  Political involvement and the co-operative, cohesive involvement of all interested parties is required as unemployment is our major national problem.  We must keep our noses to the grindstone over the <Col N="655" /> next few years so that we can tackle this problem and create employment opportunities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief as I must attend a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges shortly.</P>
      <P>In discussions on employment and unemployment we have lost sight of our objectives over the last number of years. Each time we discuss job creation the figure of 300,000 unemployed is brought up.  I find the number of people at work far more disconcerting.  Time and again the growth in unemployment is illustrated. However, the real catastrophe is that despite the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the efforts of the 1980s before the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was introduced, we have failed.</P>
      <P>The most startling fact about our employment creation achievements is that in 1981 there were 1.2 million people employed.  Over the last ten years we have been told that the increase in unemployment was due to many factors, such as an increasing birth rate, more people coming on the labour market and job creation not keeping pace with the numbers coming on the labour market.  There are 25,000 people coming on the labour market each year and only 10,000 to 15,000 jobs are being created.  On those figures alone, unemployment would grow.  It has also been stated that we had huge levels of emigration during the late 1980s.  In the main, that was not the case and last year we had net immigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Returning to my basic point, there were 1.2 million people employed in 1981 and there are fewer than that employed today.  The last ten years have been a disaster and it is time that this was made clear.  We are so focused on the needs of the 300,000 unemployed that we have failed to note the fact that there are fewer people working today than ten years ago. Therefore, the questions of emigration or the numbers joining the labour market are only tangential.  We have failed to <Col N="656" /> make an impact.  There has been a slight improvement in the numbers employed over the last year but even if the figure were to increase from 1.2 million to 1.3 million, it would reduce the number unemployed by 33.3 per cent.  However, we failed to do that.  Each year we make decisions which are a disincentive to job creation.  A classic example is the 1 per cent employment levy introduced in this year's budget.  The Governments needs must be seen in the context of the Culliton report and the discussions on job creation over the last six or seven years.</P>
    <P>The tax system is not conducive to job creation and people coming into the workforce.  It is a disincentive to employers creating jobs and to employees taking up jobs.  The 1 per cent employment levy has exacerbated the situation, it is and will continue to be a disincentive to job creation.  The Government must remove this 1 per cent levy because it is at variance with the policy of different Governments and their programmes over the last five or six years.</P>
    <P>The number of people in employment is decreasing while the number of unemployed is increasing.  Some 50 per cent of unemployed people have no qualifications beyond primary level.  There is a need, and Senator Finneran mentioned this, for training apprenticeship schemes, etc.  However, we must look at those who in the future will create jobs.</P>
    <P>Our educational system focuses on the three &ldquo;r's&rdquo;, on a narrow band of experience and learning.  If the system continues to develop in this way we may have a generation who are good at the three &ldquo;r's&rdquo; and little else.  Those who provide employment will have creative ability, leadership skills and who have learned to take risks.  They will have had experience, at school and other levels, in putting forward proposals, using their judgment and accepting the accompanying responsibilities.  We must ensure that people who may not be good at central things but who may acquire leadership skills through sports, creativity in art and self-expression in drama are encouraged.</P>
    <P>Some 50 per cent of the unemployed have no qualifications beyond primary <Col N="657" /> level.  Therefore, there must be something wrong with the educational system. It is important to intervene at primary level to ensure that people leaving primary level education benefit from post primary education, proceed to third level or seek training and apprenticeships, etc. If people fail at primary level they will continue to fail.</P>
    <P>Unemployed people tend to come from families in which parents have had similar experience.  They have no trust in the system because it does not meet their needs.  We must ensure that the skills of people from disadvantaged backgrounds are harnessed and used efficiently.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that we do not produce a generation of clones, a generation of &ldquo;safe&rdquo; people.  The education system must produce a generation of risk takers, people who will have learned self-expression and acquired leadership and creative skills.  These people will create employment.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report over-emphasised the importance of training to the detriment of what education might bring to a new generation.  It has failed in this area.  It did not recognise the fact that 50 per cent of the unemployed do not have any qualifications beyond primary level. These people will neither gain nor create employment.  We need to change the educational system, that must be a priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The reaction to the Culliton report is puzzling.  The unanimous welcome it received from all political parties, industry, trade unions and different groups is difficult to accept in the context of the culture of business as we know it. Traditionally, business has been divided and ideas on business have been divisive.</P>
      <P>It seems that Culliton is the God of industry.  Everybody, from the Labour Party to Fianna Fáil, thinks it important to be onside, understanding and seen to implement the Culliton report, which has acquired extraordinary stature, unprecedented in the history of such reports. Why?  I do not fault the main principles of the Culliton report.  However, I question some of its details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason that Culliton has become <Col N="658" /> the be-all and end-all of industrial policy is because we were bankrupt of ideas and principles to tackle these vast problems. Most political parties were bankrupt of ideas as to how industrial policy should develop.  It was self-evident, not only to the Labour Party when it came to office, that industrial policy had not worked, that the State had too great a say in what was happening, that unemployment was allied to industrial policy and that taxation policy was proving a disincentive to work.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report recognised that the problems of industrial policy and the economy were deep and that there were no short term solutions.  That is something which politicians should recognise. We are coming around to that point of view in terms of employment, grants and State aid.  Mr. Culliton said, and it is better that he said this because most politicians will not, that unemployment is a long term problem and will not be resolved by &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; solutions.  He then espoused an important philosophy, shared by most Members of the Government and most people, a philosophy of self-reliance to which we all adhere.  The problem with the Culliton report then emerged.  Having established those principles and having said how they would affect industrial policy, the Government decided to publish its reaction to the Culliton report.</P>
    <P>The great disappointment of the Culliton report is the Government's response because the most notable phrase at the press conference, given by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Brennan, and the Minister at the Department of Employment and Enterprise, Deputy Quinn, was that the Minister &ldquo;intellectually accepted&rdquo; the Culliton report. That is the same as saying, &ldquo;I like what he says but I will not do as he says&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report pointed the way forward to remove restrictions to growth, to improve enterprise and remove restrictions and obstacles to unemployment. Having read the report the Government and the Minister said they thought he was right and that they &ldquo;intellectually accepted&rdquo; it but, in practice, very few of <Col N="659" /> the recommendations have been accepted.  They have implemented minor parts of it and have been highly aspirational in their determination to implement other parts while rejecting those they find politically impossible to implement.  That is the way of politics but it does not make it less disappointing.</P>
    <P>An example is the various interpretations of Culliton in the last few days and the principal example is in telecommunications. Culliton advocated more competition in telecommunications but was forced, because of misinterpretation, to write a letter to the Minister about the statement of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; about the telephone charges.  This is not a criticism of the Minister of State, but it is a classic example of how Culliton has been interpreted and picked at by those who want to prove they are on the side of the report.  He has such a status that no one is prepared to say he was wrong in certain aspects &mdash; which undoubtedly he was &mdash; and people are prepared to interpret what they are doing as part of his proposals and programme, when it is not.</P>
    <P>I wish to read a letter from Jim Culliton to the Minister of State at the Office of the Tánaiste, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald:</P>
    <P>Dear Minister of State, On John Bowman's programme &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last evening, when you were answering a question about the new Telecom tariff, you gave the clear impression that the Culliton group had recommended a rebalancing of charges or increased charges to the domestic customer.  Our group did no such thing and I would refer you to the attached photocopy of pages 46-47 of the report. In fact, we called for downward pressure on pricing and greater competition. What the Moriarty group recommended is a separate matter and indeed, this group was set up after we had submitted our report.</P>
    <P>That is very important because it points out the principal flaw between the recommendations <Col N="660" /> and the implementations of the Culliton report.  The Moriarty report, although a good report as far as it went, diluted and interpreted Culliton and only recommended certain parts of the report, and then the Government interpreted Moriarty.  At the end of the day, some of Culliton is being implemented by the Government, while other parts are being rejected, ignored or gathering dust on the shelves.  That is disappointing because Culliton stated that all the package, and the philosophy behind it should be taken. He said that you cannot pick and choose, that there are checks and balances in this package.  There is a serious philosophy behind the report.  It may not be an acceptable philosophy but at the moment, it is a fashionable one of self-reliance and of enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed to implement Culliton's recommendations in regard to broadening the tax base.  I salute the courage of the Ministers of the Labour Party for defending the tax amnesty in the Dáil against the wishes of their allies in the trade unions.  That was possibly not part of the Culliton report and although this measure will broaden the tax base, I do not think that is what he intended.  He called for a broadening of the tax base by means of increasing the standard rate of income tax and reviewing the possibility of a property tax.  He did not advocate the imposition of a 1 per cent income tax levy.  He recommended that semi-State bodies should have a clear mandate and access to capital. It is a pity that the Government has not tackled the difficulty, to which Culliton referred, the schizophrenia of semi-State bodies, of being partly a commercial body and partly tools of Government policy.  The Government must tackle this problem because the crisis there is getting worse every day.</P>

    <Title>Increases in Telephone Charges: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government decision to approve increases in telephone charges of up to 400 per cent in day-time local calls; regrets that the Government's decision failed totally to address the overall cost levels of Telecom Éireann or to encourage greater competition, as recommended in the Culliton report; calls for a retention of the present position regarding VAT on phone bills; and calls on the Government to withdraw the increase in local call charges.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his attendance.  Due to the importance of this issue for individuals, small businesses and the disabled, the Progressive Democrats has taken the opportunity in the Seanad this evening to follow up on its initiative in the Dáil last week where the party insisted that the House debate a motion condemning the totally unfair and excessive domestic telephone price increases announced by Telecom Éireann.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats motion before the Seanad this evening reiterates our opposition to the increases of up to 400 per cent in some local calls which will take effect from next September.  It condemns the Government's failure to introduce greater competition in the provision of telephone services within the country as recommended by the Culliton report.  It also urges the retention of the present VAT level on telephone bills rather than the proposed further, increase of 10 per cent next September and in April 1994.  Finally the motion urges the Government to withdraw the proposed increase in local call charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that if the Government fails to act in this matter, Telecom <Col N="662" /> Éireann will be forced to rethink its so-called rebalancing strategy, which amounts to nothing more than having domestic Irish telephone users subsidising international telephone calls at a hefty cost, by the intervention of the EC since it is plain that the transfer pricing proposals are a direct contravention of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>This deliberate policy of cross subsidisation, which involves greatly increased domestic charges where Telecom Éireann enjoys a monopoly in order to reduce international charges where the company is subject to effective competition, will be successfully challenged in the European Court of Justice.  That court has given a variety of judgments under Article 90 of the Treaty of Rome to the effect that State bodies which enjoy special exclusive rights under national law cannot use those powers to engage in differential pricing which are not commercially based and which have the effect of abusing a dominant position.</P>
    <P>That form of judgment is a classic definition of what Telecom Éireann proposes to do in relation to telephone charges from next September.  I am also aware that Telecom Éireann is already the subject of a formal complaint to the European Commission from the Esat company in Ireland which is alleging anticompetitive practices on the part of the semi-State company.</P>
    <P>I believe ordinary householders, the elderly and disabled persons will look ahead with trepidation to the likely impact on their telephone bills from next September and they will be equally incensed by the manner in which the Government and the Minister, who is here this evening, have sought to put the price increases across in a totally misleading, selective and unrepresentative way.  Most people simply do not accept the validity of Telecom Éireann's claim that over 70 per cent of local calls in this country are less than three minutes' duration.  This raises the question of the manner in which the Government and Telecom Éireann are prepared to proceed on a hand-in-glove basis.</P>
    <P>The Department and the Minister <Col N="663" /> seem satisfied to accept Telecom Éireann's analysis of the situation and the likely impact on its customers.  Surely it would have been fairer to the telephone using public for the Department to have engaged independent consultants to examine the impact of various price changes rather than relying on the obviously self-servicing approach by the company, an approach which understandably from their point of view, seeks to totally minimise and obliterate the negative impact on people's telephone bills and to hype the undoubted benefits which a reduction in our international telephone charges will bring to some business users, although those benefits are to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I stress that this will benefit some business users because our country is one where not only the domestic telephone user will be severely hit but thousands of small businesses, the very sector we are relying on to boost job creation in the years ahead, will also suffer severe increases in operating costs.  Auctioneering firms, travel agents in provincial towns, co-operative marts and farmers, almost all businesses outside the greater Dublin area that are not part of large multinational or manufacturing companies will suffer.  This is the area which it has been repeatedly said will bring jobs to the country through the promotion of indigenous industries and services.  These proposals are contrary to that rhetoric.</P>
    <P>Most smaller companies are reliant on the domestic market for their sales and business.  Undoubtedly, their telephone charges will increase massively from next September.  What about disabled people, or elderly people living alone or people who are confined to a wheelchair?  For people confined to wheelchairs the telephone is their lifeline.  Are they now being told &ldquo;do not make that call&rdquo;.  As time has passed, the full impact of the increased telephone charges is getting across to the public who have reacted with justifiable anger.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" /> I note the relative silence from the Labour Party on this issue and I have no doubt that this ill-judged and ill thought out price increase strategy approved by the Government for Telecom Éireann will prove to be a major embarrassment and impediment to both Government parties, and to the Labour Party in particular. One can imagine &mdash; and the Chair will readily appreciate this &mdash; the howls of outrage with which this decision would have been greeted by the Labour Party had it still been in Opposition.  Over the past few weeks we have seen that party indulge in a totally misleading and unfair strategy of seeking to suggest that the price increases will be reviewed.</P>
    <P>Various Labour Party spokespersons have said they want the prices reviewed. However, in the Dáil last week, all the Labour Party Deputies trooped through the division lobbies and approved price increases of up to 400 per cent for many domestic users.  That is the bottom line. The Irish public, both domestic consumers and business users of telephones, can and must judge the Labour Party by its actions and not by its fine flown sentiments.  I have no doubt, notwithstanding any crocodile tears which may be shed by the other side for the hapless consumer and for small businesses, that both Government parties will once again vote to approve these unacceptable price increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I welcome the Minister to the House and I am pleased to have an opportunity to discuss this motion.  I am delighted Mr. Culliton, the chairman of the Culliton commission, which was appointed by Deputy O'Malley to update Ireland's industrial policy, has unequivocally rejected this Government's claim that its outrageous telephone charge increase was in line with the strategy recommended by the commission in its landmark report on industrial policy 18 months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Mr. Culliton points out, the thrust of his recommendation was to urge a general downturn in telephone charges, and also to provide competition in the <Col N="665" /> domestic telephone services market. What the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and the Government are proposing is the very antithesis of the Culliton prescription and they can no longer use the report to justify their unfair decision.  This fig leaf of justification is no longer available to the Government.</P>
    <P>The weekend newspaper report that the British telecommunications company, Cable and Wireless, may be interested in taking a stake in Telecom Éireann is a possibility that should be examined carefully and not summarily thrown out in a purely ideological kneejerk response by the Labour Party.  The silliness of that party's response is summed up in the cartoon in today's <i>Irish Times,</i> which highlights the fact that the Labour Party in Government has stood idly by while the State's shares in Greencore and in Irish Life were being sold off. In an apparent rediscovery of the socialist style rhetoric which the Labour Party espoused in Opposition, its leader Deputy Spring has declared that: &ldquo;The sale of any stake whatsoever in Telecom must be ruled out&rdquo;.  Such rhetoric is nonsensical, both for the taxpaying public and for workers in Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>Everyone with a knowledge of telecommunications knows that that sector is evolving rapidly.  Advances in technology render yesterday's miracle processes redundant today and it is essential that Telecom Éireann stay at the forefront of technological advances.  The prospect of Cable and Wireless being willing to pay up to £1 billion for the purchase of a 25 per cent stake in Telecom Éireann would not only be a major boon to taxpayers and save approximately £100 million in interest repayments on our national debt, but would also make the future development of Telecom Éireann and the security of jobs there even more assured.</P>
    <P>The reality is that Telecom Éireann cannot hold back the tide of competition and with the implementation of EC competition laws, it will be faced with competition in the provision of telephone services here at home.  Therefore, it is in the company's own interest to be in a position to take on such competition.  In <Col N="666" /> stating this, I am not necessarily advocating the privatisation of all of Telecom Éireann's activities.  The attitude of the Progressive Democrats to privatisation is a pragmatic one &mdash; it is appropriate in some cases but not in others.  Our primary concern is not the nature of company ownership but rather the quality of service provided to the customer and the facilitation of competition in the delivery of such services as telecommunications.</P>
    <P>A private monopoly could be just as anti-consumer as Telecom Éireann proposes to be when its prices rise unacceptably next September and, therefore, there is no question of the Progressive Democrats favouring the privatisation of all of Telecom Éireann's activities.  Our primary concern is to see reasonable charges available to all telephone users. I believe this can be best achieved by facilitating competition in the provision and delivery of telephone and other telecommunications services to the Irish market.</P>
    <P>It is in that context and spirit that we believe the possible interest by Cable and Wireless in a 25 per cent stake in Telecom Éireann should be actively investigated. We do not want another ADM style debacle with the Labour Party scaring off potentially important and vital strategic investors in the Irish economy, whether in the sugar industry or the telecommunications sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House is selectively critical, highlighting only the price increases in a small proportion of day time calls, while the price reductions in the vast majority of calls are ignored. This selectiveness and lack of balance by the Opposition has dominated the debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>As I have explained on two occasions in the Dáil and in several public statements, day time local charges will not increase by anything like 400 per cent. Such increases will only apply to one out of every 25 local calls.  The price of 20 peak and 24 off-peak local calls out of every 25 calls is being reduced.  This uncomfortable fact is consistently ignored by those who wish to criticise a carefully balanced package which will bring commercial principles and fairness to bear on a tariff which is outmoded and unsuitable for the telecommunications market of today and tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about other supposed inadequacies of the telephone tariff rebalancing package.  It has been described as inadequate because it fails to address the inefficiencies of Telecom Éireann and the issue of competition, as recommended in the Culliton and Moriarty reports.  I will deal with these points later but I would refer Senators to the Culliton report and ask them to note that it has separate timetables for areas such as rebalancing tariffs, efficiency in Telecom Éireann and the introduction of competition.  The implementation of this rebalancing package is but one step towards completing the Government's obligations and has been achieved within the time frame set by the Culliton report. The Government look forward to fulfilling <Col N="668" /> all its obligations under those reports.</P>
    <P>With regard to the tariff rebalancing, the Moriarty Task Force specifically recommended the urgent introduction of rebalancing: &ldquo;which must not be made await the introduction of greater efficiency, rather it must happen first&rdquo;, which is what is happening.  The <i>status quo</i> could not have been maintained for much longer because of the serious loss of international business suffered by Telecom Éireann.  The primary reason for rebalancing bears repetition &mdash; further competition is inevitable and will come sooner rather than later.  The EC Commission envisages competition in voice telephony by 1998 and prior to this the opening up of the radio communications and satellite markets.  Ireland will be bound by the deadlines for liberalisation of these services which will be imposed in relevant EC legislative measures.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann must not only be prepared to face this competition but it must also be allowed to face it successfully. This is a point which the Progressive Democrats in particular, both here and in the Dáil, fail to address.  Telecom Éireann's tariffs must be cost based for all services if it is to continue supplying services to all parts of the State.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday last I advised the Dáil on certain misapprehensions which have led to this debate.  Over the years there was a universal policy of using some of the cost savings, which were achieved with the advancement of technology in relation to international telephone calls, for the subsidisation of local calls where the impact of technology has had less effect.  When liberalisation of the telephone market commenced in the United States over ten years ago this position was no longer tenable in any country, not least in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The opening up of the telecommunications industry created, among public network operators, artificially high prices for international traffic.  Market share was lost to competing international carriers who had no local service obligations. In such circumstances it is essential <Col N="669" /> for public network operators to reduce, and eventually cease, the subsidy on local telephone calls and to readjust tariffs to cost related levels.  This had occurred, to a certain extent, in other countries to the stage where Telecom's charges from Ireland were far higher than those of incoming calls from most other countries.  Not to adjust tariffs now would result in a further and continuing loss of international traffic for public network operators who operate uncompetitive tariffs to such an extent that there would not be sufficient profits from international traffic to subsidise local traffic. This is the situation emerging here.</P>
    <P>If Telecom Éireann loses its international revenues it cannot subsidise local traffic and we will have high local charges as well as high international charges.  That is what would happen if I chose to avoid the problem and did nothing.  There would be a loss of revenue and profits to Telecom Éireann and a loss of dividend to the State.  There would also be a general deterioration in the quality of service available in Ireland and compared to our competitor countries if we persisted with the <i>status quo.</i>  The ability of Telecom Éireann to continue to provide a service, both nationally and internationally, of which we can be justly proud would be jeopardised and the company's ability to provide advanced telecommunications services and networks, as well as secure well paid employment for the greatest possible number of our people would also be put at serious risk. I am not prepared to allow that to happen and that is why the Government took the necessary decision.</P>
    <P>The rebalancing measure approved by me is competitive and it is necessary if Telecom Éireann is to face further competition. It is not abuse of monopoly power but the opposite.  On the subject of the alleged abuse of its monopoly position by Telecom Éireann, I draw the attention of Senators to the fact that telephone charges have decreased, in real terms, by over 34 per cent since 1986.  In addition, the overall effect of the rebalancing package is a net loss of £15 million a year in Telecom's revenue.  If this is <Col N="670" /> abuse of a monopoly then let us have more of it.</P>
    <P>Rebalancing is in line with the requirements of the EC Commission that telephone tariffs throughout the Community be based on cost.  Rebalancing is a necessary measure to prepare Telecom Éireann for full competition on voice telephony in the not too distant future when the company will have to compete against service providers who are selective in the sectors of the market they are prepared to cover.  If Telecom Éireann is to compete successfully and continue to provide telephone service in even the remotest parts of our island it must be allowed to compete on a level playing field.  Telecom must, therefore, have cost based competitive tariffs.  That is not suggested by the Progressive Democrats in the motion. They want to encourage competition. However, when the Progressive Democrat leader was in Government he refused to give Telecom a commercially based tariff despite the fact that the prelude to competition is to give Telecom &mdash; in which the Irish taxpayer has invested £1,500 million &mdash; such a tariff to compete on an equal basis in the market place.</P>
    <P>Inefficiencies exist in Telecom Éireann and they are being tackled.  The first annual report of Telecom Éireann in 1985 identified that the company would require to shed 5,000 jobs &mdash; some 25 per cent of its workforce &mdash; in five years.  The company has done so and in a manner which has not only maintained services without interruption, but greatly increased the number of connections to the national telephone service; all but abolished the waiting list for telephone service and provided new and advanced services for both the business and residential customer.  The company has a further voluntary severance and early retirement plan on offer which I approved recently.</P>
    <P>The penetration of telephones in Ireland at 29 per 100 people is well below the EC average of 45.  Increases in telephone usage and associated revenue will contribute significantly to improving efficiency, reducing costs and ultimately to further reductions in tariffs.  My <Col N="671" /> Department will also continue its ongoing discussions with Telecom Éireann regarding other methods of increasing efficiency both in the company's core business and that of its subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the number of lines per head of staff in Telecom Éireann being substantially below the norm for other European countries.  It is below the norm and I am the first to admit that there is room for improvement. Once again, however, I must ask the Progressive Democrats in this House to compare like with like.  If we compare Ireland with, say, Belgium, we will find that Belgium has a population density almost seven times that of Ireland.  It is easy to see that in Belgium it is much cheaper, in both manpower and cost terms, to provide cabling for the population which is compressed into a relatively small area.  Terrain in Belgium is relatively level and the costs of providing underground cables, laying poles and so on is, therefore, much cheaper than in Ireland where the terrain varies from rugged and rocky to bogland.</P>
    <P>In Ireland the population outside the cities, towns and villages is very scattered. On the Continent the population is more likely to be centred in towns and villages and there is not the same degree of service to isolated houses as in Ireland. All these factors impinge on Telecom Éireann's perceived efficiency.  There is room for increased efficiency in Telecom Éireann.  We must, however, recognise that efficiency does not always mean matching the best results attainable in other countries all the time.  There are areas in which, because of circumstances outside our control, we will always be behind other countries.  Similarly, I feel confident that there are areas in which we can surpass the levels attainable in other countries.</P>
    <P>I am puzzled by the implication in the Progressive Democrats' motion that Telecom Éireann is not operating competitively in those areas which have been liberalised by EC Directive.  Since 1984, when Telecom Éireann was set up as a <Col N="672" /> commercial State body &mdash; and in advance of EC Directives &mdash; there has been progressive liberalisation starting with the terminal equipment market: that is equipment like telephones, answering machines and basically anything which is connected to the end of a telephone line. This market is now liberalised to the extent that a licence is no longer needed to supply, install or maintain terminal equipment.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the terms of the EC Directive on Liberalisation in the Markets for Telecommunications Services there has been increasing liberalisation of this segment of the market in line with the requirements placed upon my Department.  Licensed service providers may now sell-on capacity in leased lines for data transmission.  Effectively, apart from the network infrastructure, the only monopoly areas left to Telecom are voice telephony, telex, mobile radio telephone, paging and satellite based telecommunications services.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has proposed a range of measures which will apply full liberalisation and competition in a phased manner to telephone systems over an agreed period.  Their proposal is for a five year implementation period.  In addition I will give careful consideration to the recommendations of the Moriarty task force, subject to having due regard to maintaining an acceptable standard of public service obligations on all service providers.  Why should Telecom alone have a public service obligation?  Those who want to compete should do so on the same basis.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will agree that a wide open competitive system which might see a large part of the county denuded of an affordable telephone service would be in nobody's interest.  I also assure the advocates of competition that the local tariffs I have introduced for peak local calls look moderate in comparison with those that would have to prevail to make it worthwhile providing a local service in an open competitive situation.  We have to look no further than the situation emerging in a number <Col N="673" /> of European countries to see where the trend is leading.</P>
    <P>The package of tariffs approved by me are reasonable steps towards achieving cost based tariffs for all telecommunications services and for ending the distortions that exist in the present tariff.  The implementation of the package will allow our export industry, which is relatively labour intensive, to compete against its European and other international competitors.  It will especially allow our developing food processing sector to market its goods and our developing services sector, which is also highly labour intensive, to export its services and expand its workforce.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the package will encourage the setting up of international service sector employment &mdash; both Irish owned and foreign owned and, more importantly, provide a necessary incentive for those service industries already in Ireland to remain here.  There was no reference to that in the Senator's speech.</P>

      <P>I have carefully considered the impact on old age pensioners. They, even more than the average population, make proportionately more trunk and international calls than local calls and will benefit to a greater extent from reductions in these calls.  This may be a surprising finding to many people but it is a fact.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the average overall impact on the old age pensioners as a group will be neutral and that those who make mainly local calls will have increases limited to about 20p per week on average, based on the full statistical data available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Telecom Éireann has set aside £0.5 million to assist in reducing the telephone bills of charitable organisations who provide helpline assistance to the public. <Col N="674" /> They are at present surveying traffic patterns of the higher priority assistance lines and will shortly enter into discussions with the organisations concerned and other relevant parties to set up procedures for disbursing the assistance now being provided.  This will reduce any concerns by members of the public and the organisations providing assistance that the cost of calling might be an impediment to seeking and providing assistance.</P>
    <P>As in any rebalancing package there will be winners and losers.  The Government is satisfied that every possible step has been taken to ensure that the number of losers has been minimised and that, where possible, facilities have been made available to subscribers to minimise the ill effects through the promotion of off-peak usage.  Special measures were introduced to ease any problems in relation to helplines and for monitoring through the telephone users' advisory group of any undesirable results from the implementation of the package.  I commend the Government amendment to the House.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrat motion seeks to have it every way, for a party that places a high value on integrity, honesty and high standards.  There is no question of a 400 per cent increase in day time local calls.  I defy Senators in their reply to come up with any example to show me that on average, in any set of circumstances, any consumer's local call charges will increase by 400 per cent. Senators want VAT charges on telephone bills to be dropped.  Perhaps Senators could suggest where we could recoup the £35 million generated by these charges?  Are Senators suggesting that international calls should be charged at the present rate so that VAT may be removed?  The Progressive Democrats believe in fiscal rectitude.  How do they propose to balance the accounts in Telecom Éireann?</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats say they want to encourage greater competition. So do I.  If Senators want competition based on existing tariff structures, they are showing their ideological prejudice. They are suggesting that the Government <Col N="675" /> should allow private operators to compete with Telecom Éireann while keeping the semi-State company on a non-commercial basis, so that private operators can &ldquo;cherry pick&rdquo; in areas where they will make a profit and let Telecom Éireann serve the unprofitable areas of the country.  I want competition on a level playing pitch.  The prelude to any competition must be to give Telecom Éireann a commercial tariff within which to operate.  Then it can compete on the same basis as anyone who wants to come into the market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies had a long interview yesterday with Mr. McGoyern, the chief executive of Telecom Éireann.  What he told us was impressive, if disagreeable.  I left the meeting disagreeing with him but far better informed of the reasons he made that decision.  Although this whole episode has been badly handled, and although I disagree with the decision taken, the Minister has shown courage, which many Ministers would not, in the way he dealt with this situation.  There is no doubt that these measures are deeply unpopular, but at least on the Fianna Fáil side there has been no effort to duck the issue.</P>
      <P>When Mr. McGovern explained the reasons for these measures being taken, he did at least equip us with some new statistics and information, which the Minister touched on just now.  The population spread is wide and the geographical area is larger in Ireland than in other European countries.  There are special situations here which we must acknowledge. They do not justify the increases in telephone charges or the way they have been implemented, but the terrain and population distribution in Ireland means that we are not identical to any other country in Europe.  Every country must be treated differently.  We cannot make direct comparisons with other EC countries and simply say that these charges are wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties in the last few days are <Col N="676" /> symptomatic of a problem in Telecom Éireann and of problems in the semi-State industry.  There has been an outcry because Telecom Éireann has been run inefficiently, in a manner which is typical of semi-State bodies.  The difficulty which Mr. McGovern touched on, and which we should consider, is a broader one than the charges.  Mr. McGovern said that, in order to come to an agreement with the Department of Finance on many issues, he relied on his staff arguing with the Department, for hours and weeks and months.  They were unable to come to agreement on some issues.</P>
    <P>The problem with semi-State bodies, including Telecom Éireann, is that when a semi-State company wants to do certain things for commercial reasons it is stopped, because the Government has a different agenda.  All Governments have non-commercial agendas in certain circumstances. Telecom Éireann is on one hand a tool of Government policy, and on the other it must be run on a commercial basis.  Telecom Éireann has made a terrible mistake, despite all the statistics which have been thrown at us by the Minister and the chief executive of Telecom Éireann, because those who will suffer most as a result of these charges are among the most vulnerable in our society.  If that means that Telecom has sacrificed its public service role, let this be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there are people who will not be able to afford to pay these increased telephone charges.  They may be a minority, but does not mean they should be ignored, or treated differently from the large majority.  Statistics are continuously thrown at us which indicate that only a tiny proportion of calls will suffer from these increases.  It is about that tiny proportion we are arguing today.  That is precisely where the abuse of the monopoly occurs, it affects the small proportion of the population whose option is to disconnect their telephones or to pay the charges which have been imposed upon them.  There is no abuse of monopoly where Telecom Éireann is facing competition.  Telecom Éireann has reduced charges on international calls, <Col N="677" /> for competitive reasons.  The Government, and spokesmen for Telecom, say that the Culliton report required these changes.  This would have happened regardless of the Culliton report because Telecom would have been forced by competition to reduce charges.</P>
    <P>Telecom's problems are not recognised. They are not simply as a result of the charges which we have heard about in the last few weeks.  The problem is the cost base of the company and over staffing.  Why do people not say this aloud?  The problem was tacitly acknowledged by the Minister today, and acknowledged yesterday by the chief executive of Telecom Éireann.  Telecom's annual report talks about the intention to reduce staff further, saying that Telecom has a comparatively larger staff than similar type companies in other European countries.  The Minister touched on this matter when he mentioned that staff per telephone is much higher here than anywhere else in Europe, despite the interesting extenuating circumstances he mentioned.  That is something we have failed to tackle despite the Minister's assurances and those of the chief executive yesterday that it was intended to reduce staff numbers by 2,000 within five years.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is the political will to reduce staff, because in each of the last four or five years it has only been reduced by approximately 100 people &mdash; I stand open to correction by about ten. Staff has been reduced from about 13,600 to 13,100, that is, by less than 1 per cent per annum.  Every independent economist and analyst &mdash; those not confined by their positions in the public or political arena &mdash; will say quite straightforwardly that Telecom Éireann is overstaffed by about 4,000 people.</P>
    <P>The people who are paying the price of that overstaffing are those who are paying the increased charges.  The reality is that it is politically easier to charge more money per individual telephone call to vulnerable people than it is to produce redundancy packages.  It is time people were honest about that reality and said <Col N="678" /> straightforwardly that the staff problem must be faced.</P>
    <P>The chief executive was asked about Telecom Éireann's application for Structural Funds.  Apparently it has applied for £10 million of EC Structural Funds.  I suppose everybody is entitled to apply for Structural Funds, but this application tells one a great deal about the philosophy of the company.  It indicates that Telecom Éireann does not regard itself as a stand alone company which exists to produce a credible return for capital invested in it.  Its return on capital invested is only 12 per cent, which Telecom Éireann describes as a very modest return.</P>
    <P>The company is content to take charity from the EC; one may call it investment but it is charity when it does not require a return.  We cannot insist that Structural Funds are taxpayers' money and that we want a return on it.  It is a once off charity payment indicating that Telecom Éireann regards itself not only as a monopoly, but as one which is not obliged to return a profit but will take money from anywhere it can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I have been a member of Seanad Éireann for 11 years and I have always taken an interest in the operation of Telecom Éireann.  As a former employee of the old Department of Posts and Telegraphs, before becoming a Member here, I have much experience of telecommunications in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Before the present Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, became Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in the early 1980s, I remember delays of a year or even two in getting a telephone.  Today, Ireland has one of the most modern telecommunications services in the world.  This country's communications system was displayed by RTE in Millstreet as the Eurovision song contest on Saturday, 15 May last.  We are the envy of many countries throughout the world, in communications.</P>
      <P>If we leave aside the political debating engaged in by Senators who wish to become Deputies, we can take a level look at the question we have to address. As one who uses the international calls system and has a wealth of experience in trying to maintain the jobs and livelihoods of around a 100 people, I am well positioned to speak of the high cost borne by those involved in maufacturing and exporting.  I welcome the proposal to reduce the price of international calls by 40 per cent.  This will make Irish companies and international companies based here more competitive and will give an opportunity to employers, myself included, to create further jobs.</P>
      <P>We have to look at the future direction of the EC.  The Minister addressed that in his statement when he said that by 1998 competition from outside, as well as within the EC is envisaged here.  The Minister is correct in saying that Telecom Éireann will have to prepare itself for that eventuality.  As an Irish company we have to allow Telecom become competitive and, perhaps, gain some share of the outside market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was Fianna Fáil spokesman when <Col N="680" /> legislation on telecommunications was going through this House in 1984.  Telecom Éireann has made tremendous progress since then and is to be congratulated on the improvements which give Ireland one of the most modern communications systems in the world.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said he wants to protect old age pensioners and the underprivileged who use the telephone as a means of communication, particularly in rural Ireland.  I welcome this intention; our older generation have made a massive contribution to this country. For many who live alone &mdash; in the city or in the country &mdash; the telephone is the only means of communicating with their neighbours and relations with whom they may need to speak daily.  In this respect I welcome the relevant part of the Minister's contribution in this House today when he said:</P>
    <P>The impact on the old age pensioners has been very carefully considered by me.  Old age pensioners, even more so than average residents, make proportionately more trunk and international calls than local calls and will benefit to a greater extent from reductions in these calls.  This may be a surprising finding to many people but it is a fact.</P>
    <P>I must confess this was a surprise to me. However, when one considers the number of people in rural Ireland with children living abroad with whom they wish to keep in contact it is not too surprising. Such relatives are no further away than the end of the telephone, and that is a great mental comfort, if nothing else.  The Minister's modification of the proposed changes so that they will not create undue hardship for these people is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>It is easy for the Opposition to criticise these measures.  I too found it easy to be critical of the Government when I was sitting on the other side of the House.</P>

      <P>Simple arithmetic tells us <Col N="681" /> we will be in Government for a further four years.</P>
      <P>Great progress has been made since 1987, and this must be maintained.  As I said on the national airwaves, over recent years Ireland has had the highest growth rates in the western world.  As a country we are highly self-critical, however, if we considered how much progress we have made over the past 20 years we would be even more self-congratulatory.</P>
      <P>People in the communications business, particularly editors and those with responsibility for presenting programmes and news reports take a negative view of our achievements.  They should emulate the achievement of RTE in presenting the Eurovision Song Contest from Millstreet by encouraging people and highlighting the positive rather than the negative.  For example, there should be talk not only of unemployment but also of employment.</P>
      <P>I welcome the 40 per cent reduction in telephone charges for business calls and look forward to more progress of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I listened carefully to his contribution and he has a great deal of which to be proud.  I agree with Senator Cassidy when he speaks of pride in our telephone system.</P>
      <P>There are four facts concerning Telecom Éireann I want to consider in this debate.  The first concerns profit.  I believe that we do not recognise the need for profit and the requirement of profit. Peter Drucker wrote that profit is future cost.  We should not be concerned or shy about the fact that a company like Telecom Éireann makes a profit of approximately £90 million.  It needs the kind of investment and, in the past, the Government has not always recognised that profits at that level are required.  All Governments in recent years have been siphoning off this profit which is required by Telecom Éireann for investment in its future if it is to be viable in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second fact concerns Telecom Éireann's monopoly.  The EC has now <Col N="682" /> decided that it wants to end the monopoly enjoyed by each member state's national telecommunications network with all member states eventually having a choice of telecommunications suppliers.  I have no difficult with that nor do I have any difficulty with the idea that Telecom Éireann should fight commercially to defend its own territory as far as possible. If only one supplier emerges in Ireland but that supplier satisfies customers, that would be a satisfactory situation.  By way of example, in most other countries there are two or more suppliers of mobile phones who engage in intense competition with each other.  Telecom Éireann is our only supplier of such phones because its mobile service is priced so aggressively that it discourages other suppliers from entering the market. As a result, Ireland has the cheapest mobile phone services in Europe, cheapest in terms of calls and in the monthly connection payments.  I was not aware of that until I checked it out.  That is good for business and is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There are 45,000 subscribers to this mobile service, most of them businesses. This is to be welcomed.  There is nothing essentially wrong with having a single supplier as long as the threat of competition ensures the supplier satisfies the customer's requirements.  However, it is important to ensure that a single supplier does not abuse its position in those parts of its business where there is no threat of competition.  This is the issue under consideration here.  The increases Telecom Éireann is implementing are in the part of its business that is not open to competition.</P>
    <P>The third fact concerns Telecom Éireann's operating costs.  These costs are too high, especially when considered in the context of international comparisons. The Culliton report pointed out that Ireland spends twice as much of its GDP &mdash; approximately 2.7 per cent &mdash; on telecommunications as that spent by the other EC countries, yet Ireland has a much lower use of the telecommunications services.  Our pattern is low usage and high operating costs. These are two factors that are inextricably <Col N="683" /> linked, one playing off against the other.  That is no way to run a business.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report stressed the importance of reducing costs and reducing operating costs.  The report pointed out that Telecom Éireann's costs were unacceptable and must be addressed in a three year programme of cost reduction. Culliton did not talk about rebalancing, and that case has been made earlier by Senator Dardis.  This issue of reducing costs, emphasised in the Culliton report, has been evaded in this debate.  Telecom Éireann has offered to reduce some charges where it is exposed to international competition by increasing charges in the areas where it is sheltered from that competition.  That is not the agenda envisaged in the Culliton report; it is the very opposite.</P>
    <P>The fourth fact is concerned with Telecom Éireann's charges.  It is useful as a start to survey how these charges compare with telecommunications charges in other countries.  I undertook such a survey and concluded that the new charges to be implemented by Telecom Éireann are not excessive in absolute terms.  At present, Telecom Éireann's international charges are higher than elsewhere, as the Minister has stated, and the proposed changes would bring them into line.  At present, local charges are considerably cheaper than in most other countries and the proposed changes would bring them into line with the average of such charges elsewhere.  At present, Telecom Éireann's charges for installing a line and the monthly rental charge are high by international standards.</P>
    <P>Changes are not suggested in this regard and, therefore, installation and rental charges here would still be very high and out of line with other countries. That is one way of looking at it, but there is another way, and here I have to challenge the Minister.  We are talking about increasing some local charges by as much as 400 per cent.  While, admittedly, the Minister said there was no example <Col N="684" /> of customers paying 400 per cent more on average, it would seem that the issue is not so much the absolute amount of the new charges but the abruptness of their introduction and the way they are being handled.  In any business I know of it is not possible to introduce a 400 per cent increase without causing great pain for customers.</P>
    <P>What should be the approach of Telecom? I have four short principles to advance.  First, Telecom should be in the business of growing its market.  The more we use the network the better value we get out of it, and the more people who use Telecom's services, the more demand there is in the long term to sustain the healthy growth of that company.  Everything that Telecom does, including pricing, should be aimed at making it possible to increase the market.  It does not require a PhD.  to realise that the present exercise is not geared to growing the market for Telecom users, quite the reverse.</P>
    <P>Secondly, Telecom must make a massive attack on its operating costs.  The Government must insist, as Senator Ross said, that a definite cost reduction programme be started without delay, exactly as Culliton proposed.  If we fail to face up to the fact that Telecom's operating costs are too high we will stir up trouble for the company and taxpayers in the future.  Unless Telecom gets its costs right the company will run into big trouble sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, Telecom needs to get closer to its customers.  The way the increases have been announced shows all the insensitivity of which monopolies are accused. Business does not believe that this is in its interests.  Most businesses believe they will pay more for Telecom services under the new arrangement, and that this was something done in the guise of helping business.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, national policy should insist that Telecom Éireann is especially sensitive to customers' needs in the parts of its business sheltered from competition. It is our job as legislators to ensure that customers of a State monopoly are fully protected.  The price of allowing a monmercia <Col N="685" /> opoly to exist is eternal vigilance on our part.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind these four facts and seeking to apply these four principles, what should be done in this case?  It is very simple.  We should firmly link the question of Telecom's charges to the question of its operating costs, and insist that at least half the cost of this rebalancing is met from operating profits. Telecom should phase the increases, thus reducing the pain to allow people to adjust.  That is done by most companies when they have to adjust prices.  Equally, Telecom should phase the reductions, giving priority to overseas calls for the export market that are of most importance to Irish-owned companies.  In effect, this means starting the reductions with calls to Britain and the United States.</P>
    <P>I repeat the plea to provide free telephone services to all charges operating help lines.  I am delighted that the Minister has moved on this issue.  I understand that the average call from a client to the Samaritans and Childline lasts 45 minutes.  I hope the Government will rethink its approach, I think it can get everything it requires by making some of those changes.  I thank the Minister for coming here and giving us an opportunity to suggest changes that will be taken into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the Seanad.  I will speak in favour of the amendment to the motion.  The motion highlights two items in an overall package, one relating to local calls and the other to VAT.  However, one cannot take items in isolation from an overall package. The budget demands a balancing exercise, and the current Telecom Éireann rebalancing proposals are worthwhile for many reasons, which I will outline. Ireland is to become, effectively, a local telephone call area for four months of the year, 113 days in all, including weekends and public holidays.  So, if one is ringing from a peripheral area, as I do from west Cork, to another peripheral area like Donegal or Northern Ireland, the call will be a local call during that time.  In addition, the duration of local <Col N="686" /> calls is being reduced, and many calls last less than three minutes anyway where messages have to be passed on.  If people want to stay on the telephone longer, chatting with their neighbours or others, they should pay for that luxury.  I defend that decision.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that all international calls are being reduced by an average of 40 per cent.  Some £900 million will be invested in upgrading the service over the next five years, thus assisting job creation.  There will be reductions in the cost of most calls as an incentive to off-peak usage.  Short-distance trunk calls will cost 25 per cent less from 1 April 1994.  The reduction in the cost of international calls will mean a big promotion for industry.  We are trying to encourage industry to locate here, but if foreign industrialists find that telephone bills form a hefty part of their expenses, it will be a disincentive.  The lower costs, however, will amount to an incentive for industry.  They will also help to promote tourism because guest houses and hotel owners advertise abroad by telephone in many cases.  Old age pensioners were mentioned in the debate.  How many pensioners have sons, grandsons and granddaughters living abroad and wish to have frequent communication with them?  It is good for those people to have international calls reduced by such an amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we want a service like this it must be paid for.  There is no manna, it has to be paid for through a balancing exercise.  I welcome the 25 per cent reduction in trunk calls.  Government services, apart from those based in Dublin, are based in Cork city.  These include many industrial services as well as agricultural and social welfare services.  A call from west Cork to Cork city is a trunk call, therefore, the reduction is welcome.  Most calls will be reduced in cost, with the call unit going down from 11.17p to 9.5p.  In an innovative special tariff, not available in other countries, Telecom will offer countrywide calls at the rate of 9.5p per ten minute interval on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays.  This is a reduction of up to 94 per cent on current trunk calls.  A ten minute call from Clare Island, <Col N="687" /> Oilean Cléire, in Cork to Rathlin Island in Antrim, over 300 miles, will cost 9.5 pence instead of the present £1.56.  That is a considerable reduction.  There is no change in connecting and rental fees.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann employes 13,500 people.  Those jobs should be preserved and protected and indeed increased.  It shocked me to hear a Member in this House promoting redundancies.  Redundancy is a nice way of saying sacking.  We spoke earlier today about employment through enterprise.  People are doing everything they can to promote and encourage jobs and it is inappropriate for others to speak about redundancies.</P>
    <P>Privatisation has been mentioned as a solution.  One has only to see the concern expressed by the public in Britain about the privatisation of certain services to know it is not.  That process started in the Thatcher era and continued under Mr. Major.  Many people are apprehensive about the ultimate result.  Following a policy of privatisation without due consideration to the social needs of a country is a dangerous course.</P>
    <P>Taxpayers' money was spent and borrowings made in the 1980s to set up the excellent service Telecom Éireann now provides.  I remember when telephones were hand-operated and it was a major task to get through to exchanges to make a call.  It was a bad system.  Within a few years we had a fine service thanks to the workers and technicians in Telecom.  The proposal before us will guarantee the jobs of 13,500 employees and increase their number.</P>
    <P>As chairman of Cork County Council, I take this opportunity to compliment the work of Telecom Éireann in hosting the Eurovision Song Contest in Millstreet.  It proved that the company could compete and indeed be the best in the world. Tremendous credit is due to RTE, Telecom Éireann and everyone concerned for televising this fine show to 300 million people all over the world.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment because the proposals are balanced.  If one takes items such as the local calls and the VAT out of context one does not get a true <Col N="688" /> picture.  If VAT is not imposed, how will money be raised?  Should we reduce child benefit or the number of houses built to compensate?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am disappointed in the increased telephone charges as the poorer sections of the community will suffer most.  I disagree with the Minister on a number of issues, first in relation to old age pensioners.  The Minister stated that the impact on old age pensioners had been very carefully considered by him and that old age pensioners, even more than the rest of the population make proportionately more trunk and international calls than local calls and will benefit to a greater extent from reductions in these calls.</P>
      <P>How did the Minister amass this information? In my constituency, a person received a telephone bill for approximately £12,000.  When he sought to have it itemised he was told that was not possible. How can Telecom Éireann give the Minister the information that old age pensioners make proportionately more trunk and international calls?</P>
      <P>I was told the call out charge of Telecom Éireann has been increased to £30 and for each hour after that there is a charge of £128.  No company in Ireland charges as much for service calls, whether for washing machines, televisions or anything else.  Will the Minister confirm that the call-out charge is £30?  If so, when did it &mdash; and the charge of £128 for subsequent hours &mdash; come into force?  The latter is an exorbitant charge.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said that 29 in every 100 people in Ireland have telephones while the average in the EC is 45 in 100.  The Minister might have thought it appropriate to reduce the installation charges to bring us closer to the EC average.</P>
      <P>I concur with speakers who said the £500,000 given to the helplines was a small sum.  Senator Quinn said the average call to a helpline lasted 45 minutes. The Minister should re-examine that area because those helplines are important to a vulnerable segment of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> The Minister said he has to raise £34 million to £35 million at a time when Telecom Éireann makes a profit of £90 million.  To raise the sum mentioned, someone must suffer, it appears it will be the poor.  Over the last number of years, £300,000 has been spent on plush offices for the chairman and chief executive of Telecom Éireann.  That is to be expected when the company makes £90 million profit every year.  It seems now the poor have to pay.  I wish to share my time with Senator Cotter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Burke for sharing his time.  I welcome the Minister to the House, it is my first opportunity to do so.  I commiserate with him in his difficulties over the last week.  It has not been a happy time for him.  He may eventually decide to reverse his decision and reduce the burden as people are now becoming vocal in their opposition to these increases.  Public criticism of the Minister will probably be at its highest in the autumn when people, particularly the elderly and the poor who need telephones, will become aware of the full extent of the changes introduced by him. At that stage he may be forced to reverse this decision.  It is one of the most unpopular decisions ever made by any Government and outrage is being expressed throughout the community.</P>
      <P>Many small business people who provide employment now find that unless they greatly restrict their calls their telephone bills will be inordinately increased. Before setting up in business one must assess the cost of business overheads. Insurance, bank charges and telephone and ESB bills are much more expensive today than in the past.  Previously these costs were considered to be peripheral and minimal but a much greater proportion of turnover is now required to finance them.  The Minister now proposes to increase rather than reduce these costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increased telephone charges, together with the 1 per cent income levy and the <Col N="690" /> other taxes which have been introduced this year, have lowered morale.  The Government seems to be increasing the burden of taxation on everyone, including orphans and widows, to finance ever greater expenditure and I believe it will because of its present bad public image, find governing the country increasingly difficult.</P>
    <P>There have been no major public demonstrations against the new telephone charges.  There was a small protest last week outside the Houses of the Oireachtas by people in wheelchairs and others who were attempting to win public support for their plight.  It was sad to hear people in wheelchairs say that although they need telephones to maintain contact with the outside world and make their lives bearable, they will not now be able to afford them.  Elderly people in remote areas are entitled to free telephone rental but must pay for calls.  Many of them may now decide not to install telephones because they cannot afford to pay for calls.</P>
    <P>The Minister's party has never been reluctant to do U-turns.  I urge him to reverse this decision, reduce charges for local calls and inform Telecom Éireann that they must improve the efficiency of their operation rather than increase charges.  The Minister would have no difficulty in advancing cogent reasons for reversing these changes.  He would not lose face by taking this step although people might criticise him for making the decision in the first place.  He should do it before November because people will then receive telephone bills which they cannot afford and will take to the streets in protest.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him for announcing these changes.  Some may regard them as a retrograde step but if Telecom Éireann experienced serious financial difficulties in a few years time the Minister and the Government would be criticised for not taking remedial action although they saw problems. However, the Minister recognises the potential for such difficulties and is taking <Col N="691" /> firm action to prevent them.  Members on the other side of the House argue, on the one hand, that Telecom Éireann must be cost effective and efficient and, on the other, advocate the free provision of thinks like telephones and electricity. Such provision must be paid for by somebody.</P>

      <P>Business people who make international calls are subsidising the charges paid by those making local calls.  Senator Quinn spoke of the losses incurred by small businesses.  I live in a rural area and business people there are delighted with the new charges which will enable them to operate more efficiently by competing on equal terms with people from other parts of the country.  Charges for calls from Kerry to Dublin or to the Department of Social Welfare in Sligo are extremely high.</P>
      <P>Senator Calnan spoke of our old telecommunications network.  When I returned from the United States to Ireland in the early 1970s my mother was a postmistress. She frequently had to get up at four or five o'clock in the morning to put calls through on behalf of people who were ill.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, when he was the Minister responsible for the telephone network, introduced a new system which we were told was the best in the world and proved a big selling point for the IDA when attracting foreign investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Promotional authorities in other countries were jealous of the Irish telecommunications system.  One could dial a telephone number in the United States directly from Ireland whereas to dial a number in Ireland in the US required the assistance of an operator.  We were a step ahead of them and I compliment them for that.  Some people are being selective and are trying to mislead the public in relation to new phone charges.  What counts is not the change in a rate but the bill which the subscriber gets at the end of every two months.  Furthermore, these <Col N="692" /> changes will contribute to job creation by levelling the playing field, so to speak, and creating new opportunities to enable all phone customers to control their costs.</P>
    <P>In the main office of the Department of Social Welfare 50 per cent of the calls received are less than three minutes long, a further 25 per cent are less than six minutes and the remaining 25 per cent are more than six minutes.  Of the outward calls from the same office 75 per cent are less than three minutes long. That cannot be ignored.</P>

      <P>On the other hand his colleagues say that perhaps we should give everyone free telephones.  However, the bottom line is that there has to be a commercially based tariff, and that is how these new charges will work.  The playing field will have to be levelled.  For example, in County Kerry, the finance company Fexco is running an effective, international business from Killorglin, a rural town, thanks to a good telecommunications service.  That business will grow since their telephone bills will drop with these new charges.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>My mother had 16 children and 14 of those emigrated to the USA.  My mother is now a widow and living alone and spends more time on the phone to her family in the USA than she does to her family in Ireland.  If we want <Col N="693" /> to talk about needy, old age pensioners remember that most of their families are living in the UK or in the USA, and this provides an ideal opportunity for these people to speak to their loved ones.  They can do so on an economical basis by phoning at the weekends when they can stay on the phone for much longer than at peak times.</P>
      <P>The kernel of the issue and the point on which the Minister has to be complimented is the potential effect on job creation.  If we wish to create jobs and increase efficiency we must reduce the cost of international calls.  Business people will welcome these changes.</P>
      <P>Another point to mention concerns members of the public whose local calls last all day.  I have seen people remain in phone boxes for ten or fifteen minutes probably discussing what the woman next door has on her washing line while a queue forms outside the phone box.  If that 20 pence lasted only three minutes then people would get their business done in three minutes.</P>
      <P>The effect of these new charges is being exaggerated out of all proportion.  The Minister should be congratulated for grasping the nettle as it had to be done. When I listened to others quoting the Culliton report it reminded me of another report, the McKenzie report, concerning train services.  If we had followed the recommendations of that report there would now only be a skeleton train service from Dublin to Cork, Limerick and Athlone perhaps.  However, one of the Culliton report's proposals was for a radical realignment of telephone charges and that recommendation is being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the cost of a telephone connection I compliment Telecom Éireann that the cost of a connection is the same in urban and rural areas.  Even if it costs more to make a connection in a rural area the cost to the customer is the same.  This however is not the case with the ESB.  In my constituency which is rural, many people have had to pay £3,000 or £4,000 for an ESB connection, but when a telephone, which may be a vital part of their lives or business is <Col N="694" /> connected, they pay the same amount as in urban areas.  The playing field must be levelled and tariffs must be commercially based.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and although he spoke with great conviction he will not convince those at the receiving end of these increased charges.  It is true that in latter years Telecom Éireann has become more efficient and I wish to refer to one aspect of that.  In the past a lengthy application period was necessary for a telephone, but in recent times it is not even necessary to fill out an application form as one can apply by telephone and connection can take place the next day.  In recent times many people living alone or in isolated areas sought advice as to whether they should get a telephone and were advised that they should.  I advised many people to install a phone and they were delighted.  However, they are not so pleased now with this increase in charges.</P>
      <P>The Minister's announcement of these changes is another part of a budget which included a one per cent levy and an increase in VAT on clothing.  There is no doubt the Consumers Association of Ireland, ACRA and the National Association of Tenants' Organisations oppose the changes having appraised them for the impact they will have on the consumers who can ill afford an extra charge.</P>
      <P>In most cases people do not have discretion as to when to use the phone and the cost of a 15 minute call will increase by 400 per cent.  The day when the phone was considered a luxury is long gone; in the modern world it is a necessity.  Phone ownership and use has grown steadily as a result of Telecom Éireann's extensive advertising campaigns urging people to get phones and promoting greater use. In 1991 the total number of telephone consumers increased by seven per cent to 983,000.  I wonder whether that campaign was mounted in order to get people to subscribe with a view to imposing these increases which will make it impossible for some to pay.</P>

      <P>Senator Sherlock should be more positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being positive. People on fixed incomes who have to pay an additional amount will find it a burden.  The Minister must revise the unacceptable increase in local charges which will affect both the domestic consumer and small businesses.  I have discussed this matter with a representative of small businesses.  He believe these increases will add considerably to their costs and small businesses will be unable to afford them.</P>
      <P>The imposition of an additional 10 per cent VAT rate is severe and will wipe out potential savings.  The VAT charge will, I imagine, also apply to line and equipment rental.  The average telephone bill for a two month period is £60 to £70 and the VAT increase will cost an additional £42 per annum, irrespective of the number of calls made.  This will be an additional burden on people on a fixed income.  I accept that our charges for international calls are higher than in other countries and that this can create problems for companies trading on the international market but that cannot be rectified at the expense of the small businessman or consumer, and that is what the Minister is doing.</P>
      <P>The Minister should clarify reports that Cable and Wireless were attempting to buy a 25 per cent share in Telecom Éireann.  I have no objection to a joint venture between Telecom Éireann and private enterprise.  However, a venture such as this must create additional jobs as well as providing services.  Telecom Éireann has a high level of expertise and there is potential for expansion abroad. There should be no question of surrendering to any multinational company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the Fine Gael spokesperson that Telecom Éireann workers should be made the scapegoats for these new charges.  He made the point that because of overstaffing these charges had to be introduced.  The workers have made great sacrifices to turn Telecom Éireann around &mdash; an annual loss of £80 million has been transformed into an <Col N="696" /> annual profit of £80 million.  Furthermore, the waiting time for connections has improved immensely.</P>
    <P>We must encourage people to use the telephone but these increases will place an added burden on them.  The Minister must reverse this decision and produce a comprehensive telecommunications policy setting out his strategy in relation to EC liberalisation of telecommunications and its implications for Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister was available to explain to the House this important issue.  There are people in the House and in the country who are trying to mislead telephone users.  There is a lot of scaremongering.  I believe some Members of the Progressive Democrats might have played a more honourable role.  I am surprised, without being dogmatic, at the banner some Progressive Democrat Members are carrying on this issue.  Our people are highly educated and intelligent and they are not easily fooled.</P>
      <P>Most telephone users welcome the reduction in the cost of trunk calls which brings us in-line with the rest of Europe. In the past, people from the North would question how they could be expected to join the Republic when our standard of living was lower and we had a poor telephone service.  At that time there was some truth in that statement.  Coming from a peripheral and remote county, County Donegal, I take pride in the fact that we have an excellent telephone service. We have video conference facilities in Letterkenny regional technical college. There are no such facilities in Derry or Strabane, but two exist in Belfast, at the BBC and UTV.  We, in County Donegal, are proud that we can linkup with Europe, visually and technically. This can be done thanks to the input and help of Telecom Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are no longer a backward country. We are to the forefront in technology thanks to the efforts of those in charge of development at Telecom Éireann.  Those intent on misleading the public are small-minded and frivolous.  In my view, scaremongering <Col N="697" /> is the motive behind this motion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the attempt to level the playing pitch &mdash; a cliche that has been used before.  However, it is not yet level. County Donegal has five area codes &mdash; 072, 073, 074, 075 and 077.  I will welcome the day when we have all calls within Ireland at the local rate.  We must do this if we are to compete in Europe.</P>
    <P>I meet many people who return to County Donegal, especially Americans. They cannot believe the advances we have made in providing free electricity, free travel and free telephones for the elderly.  I am proud of these advances in the social welfare area.</P>
    <P>I commend the Labour Party for their support on this issue because people criticised them and said they would not support these measures.  Fianna Fáil is a party with a social conscience as good as any other party.  We understand grass roots politics and we have a concern for people living in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann has done an excellent job.  We can encourage American companies to come to Ireland in the knowledge that they will have a first class telephone service.  I compliment Telecom Éireann on the technical advances they have made and for the proposed reduction in charges.  One no longer needs to drive to Strabane or Derry to make a cheap telephone call.  Now one can make a cheap telephone call in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and Bord Telecom for providing my county with a first class telecommunications service, this attempt to lower the price of trunk calls is a step in the right direction.  I also wish to thank the Minister for coming to the House and explaining the situation, in view of the misinformation being spread about the issue to the general public.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Under my new proposals, cheaper telephone calls will be available at the weekends.  The Minister informed us that only 25 per cent of people will pay higher prices for their calls.  I have timed <Col N="698" /> how long it takes to make a local call to a State Department or county council. The average time to find the right person is one minute and it takes five minutes to conclude business.  It is not true that 75 per cent of calls take three minutes or less.</P>
      <P>If what the Minister says is correct, then 25 per cent of subscribers will pay the large increases of £14 and £21 million respectively.  Senator McGowan said earlier that these measures will help business. How many businesses work on a Saturday or Sunday?</P>

I assure the Senator that there are many scared people in the community, politicians are not scaremongering on their behalf.  People came to Leinster House &mdash; some in wheelchairs &mdash; to register their protest at these measures.  I also assure the Senators opposite that if this was targeted at stronger sections of the community, there would be a much greater number of protesters but the poorer and more vulnerable groups cannot organise themselves as effectively.  There was also a reference to certain individuals and parties in this House being more socially minded than others.  If those qualities were present in these parties, this measure would not be before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and many Senators constantly talked about making Bord Telecom competitive &mdash; that is not the issue here.  The issue is the means by which that competitiveness is achieved and at whose expense.  What this motion <Col N="699" /> attempts to say is that mainly homeowners, the elderly and the disabled will bear the burden, which is not fair.  The Minister also referred to the cost to the State of removing VAT on telephone bills.  The motion does not refer to this but calls for the retention of the present position.</P>

      <P>The consumer has been misled and the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, admitted as much in the Dáil last week.  She said that most Members of the Dáil agreed that the misleading and disingenous advertisements placed by Bord Telecom were offensive and unhelpful.  She also said it remains to be seen whether they are in breach of both domestic and European laws.  That is a serious admission by the Government. She also said that the Labour Party, as a whole, is committed to an ongoing and thorough review of the proposed charges so that the overall economic objectives are achieved in a fair and equitable fashion.  Will the Senators in the Labour Party state whether there will be an ongoing review or will this statement be forgotten like all the others?</P>

The Minister also said that there was no question of maintaining the <i>status quo</i> much longer.  I do not disagree with this or his remarks on competitiveness.  He refers to it throughout his speech and that is to be welcomed.  However, at whose expense is it to be achieved and is it necessary to do it this way?</P>

      <P>The final point I wish to make is in relation to people in wheelchairs.  If this measure goes through, and I sincerely hope it does not, I expect as a minimum that the welcome facilities which have been extended to organisations such as the Samaritans will be extended to the 4,000 people in wheelchairs.  A spokes-person for the Irish Wheelchair Association said that the implementation of the local charges will greatly increase the isolation of people in wheelchairs, force them into passive roles and cause hardship. I support that view and I appeal to the Minister in the event of these proposals going though that he will at least bear that observation in mind.  For that reason, and for the others which I have mentioned, I commend the motion to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I was contacted on 11 May 1993 by a group of 22 archaeologists and conservationists who were engaged in the excavation of this important early mediaeval site in Dublin.  The site is situated at the rear of Christchurch Place with an entrance from Ross Road at the rear of the Iveagh flats complex.  The site owners are Pearse Contracting and the site was previously owned by Dublin Corporation. In accordance with the planning conditions attached to the development the excavation and post-excavation work have been funded by the developers although they are not obliged to fund conservation for any archaeological remains uncovered in this work. To date Pearse Contracting appear to have behaved responsibly and sensitively and I welcome this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of the site is partially completed with Jurys Hotel located at the front of the site and the multi-storey car park fronting onto Werburgh Street. The proposed development on the Ross Road portion of the site is an apartment bloc with an access road to the rear of the car park.  This will require the back-filling of the site so that the tower and city wall will be covered.  The access road will cover part of the site and it is intended that the remains of the tower <Col N="705" /> wall would be enclosed in wire mesh and the roadway built above leaving the tower outlined in tarmac.  Thus it will be buried for the foreseeable future. Although this will not physically destroy the structures it will mean they will no longer be accessible to the public and future generations.</P>
    <P>I cannot over-emphasise the importance of this discovery.  What is involved is the uncovering of an impressive portion of the pre-Norman Hiberno-Norse town wall and a 13th century mural tower thought to be Geneval's tower.  The walls of this tower are five metres high and it is the first structure of its kind to be discovered.  The town wall is 16 metres long and five metres high.</P>
    <P>I visited the site and was heartened to see the city manager, Frank Feely, and the Lord Mayor, Alderman Gay Mitchell, making a detailed and sympathetic tour of the area.  I understand that members of Dublin City Council have also taken the opportunity to visit the site and Senator Doyle has taken a particular interest in the matter.  I have visited many archaeological sites throughout the world.  Many of them, although no doubt fascinating to the tutored eye of the expert, are to the uninitiated merely insignificant lumps and outlines in the ground.  This development is particularly exciting because of its immediate visual impact which brings the layman directly into contact with the reality of the built environment of our predecessors up to 1,000 years ago.</P>
    <P>We have a tragic history in this city of ignoring and destroying important elements of our cultural heritage.  One has only to look at the Wood Quay debacle, the destruction of Georgian Dublin or the devastation of the quays which was, regrettably, within the last few weeks, compounded by the demolition of Essex Quay by a body charged with preservation, the Temple Bar Property Company Ltd.  The folly of the destruction of Wood Quay &mdash; which was so seriously resented by the citizens of Dublin that 20,000 of them marched in the streets to oppose it &mdash; was forcibly brought home to me when I visited the <Col N="706" /> city of York some years ago to address a conference of conservation officers.  The Viking site at Wood Quay was the largest and most important site of its kind in Europe.  It was 19 times the size of the parallel site at York.  It is now lost forever while the much smaller site at York has become an international example of how such discoveries can be protected to the advantage of the cultural and financial wellbeing of the communities sensible enough to preserve and develop them appropriately.</P>
    <P>The discovery at Christchurch Place is an unusual second chance to pursue a positive policy and one which, I hope, will be exploited by the authorities.  I have no doubt that, despite what may appear to be an initially significant cost, such a development will unquestionably more than pay for itself.  It is important that the developers should not suffer any financial ill effect as a result of their sensitive approach.  The initial phase of the developers' plans was that the site should be backfilled any time after Friday 14 May at which time no further archaeological access could be permitted.  I am glad that this situation has now changed, and that Pearse Construction are in the process of commissioning a feasibility study on the possibility of preserving the site.</P>
    <P>A meeting of Dublin City Council was held on 18 May last.  This was a full council meeting which passed a motion proposing that a feasibility study should be carried out within six weeks.  Pearse Construction has agreed not to backfill the site during this period.  Full costing and all options will be explored by this study, which will be carried out by the developer's architects, Burke Kennedy Doyle. However, no independent study has been made available.  Councillors, however, were unanimous in their enthusiasm for the preservation of the site and its presentation to the public.  I welcome this positive approach, but in addition, the Office of Public Works should commission an independent feasibility study.</P>
    <P>The situation has revealed a number of difficulties which may well recur, not only in Dublin but throughout the country, <Col N="707" /> to which I am sure the Minister will direct his attention.  First, the planning authorities and the Office of Public Works lack a coherent policy with regard to medieval remains found in the city. Can this be allowed to continue?  A clear policy and legislation are required to prevent repetition of the situation.  There is also in this case a problem with regard to the legality of the situation since planning permission had already been granted.  The developers may naturally be unwilling either to sell the site or to change their plans.  Financial compensation or incentives are necessary if plans must be changed.  The position of the Office of Public Works is itself unclear, because of the difficulty of declaring the site a national monument, as that would only be possible if the Office of Public Works purchased the site.</P>
    <P>At the time of my last briefing from those directly concerned, the only Office of Public Works' suggestion which had emerged was that preservation would cost £1 million.  This naked assertion was not supported by any documentation in the form of professional plans or proper costing.  At that time at least, no independent architects had been given an opportunity to redraw and cost new plans incorporating the medieval remains.  I hope the Minister has some information suggesting that this situation will now be changed, and that a full independent survey will be conducted.  This is a case in which, as it is clear funding is necessary, it should be made available either through the national lottery or an EC environmental grant.  Moreover, as I indicated, appropriate compensation should be made available to the developer.</P>
    <P>There have been successful projects of a similar nature elsewhere, in Ireland and in Europe.  The Eyre Square shopping centre in Galway is a good example of the incorporation of archaeological remains. The surviving city wall of Galway, when incorporated into a shopping centre, acted as a selling point for shop units and a magnet for business investment.  The preservation and incorporation of the city wall ultimately involved a small cost <Col N="708" /> when expressed in terms of overall development expenditure.  The Dublin Castle restoration project has successfully incorporated archaeological remains as a small percentage of the overall cost of the project, and now constitute a significant tourist attraction.  In the British cities of York, Exeter, Bath and London, to mention but a few, archaeological remains are utilised as a tourist attraction.</P>
    <P>Many other European cities have experienced no difficulty in combining preservation with building development. While visiting friends in Jerusalem, I was taken to see the Roman city of Jerash.  I was very impressed with what I saw there and said so to the Jordanian guide.  He told me that while Jerash was not important to his people as part of their cultural heritage, it has been preserved because of the important role it plays in attracting tourism.  I wish I could have bottled the guide and poured him out as a libation at the feet of Dublin City Council.  I am glad that Dublin City Council has learned from the mistakes of the past, and that we have the opportunity to do something now.</P>
    <P>The Synod Hall in Christchurch has been transformed into a welcome and excellently designed reconstruction of the experiences of Dublin through the ages.  It would be ironic indeed if the reality, the actual remains of Dublin, right next door, were to be obliterated instead of being developed as a complementary part of a significant cultural tourism complex right in the heart of our capital city.</P>

This is my first occasion to address the House, and I wish to thank Senator Norris for affording me that opportunity.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris covered most of the points that I want to make in my response.  This site is in private ownership and is being developed to provide apartment-type residential accommodation to the rear of the new hotel. As it was known that the site was in an area of archaeological potential, the local authority attached conditions to the planning permission which required the prior archaeological investigation of the site. This was in accordance with the Guidelines on Urban Archaeology published by the National Monuments advisory council.  Essentially, the guidelines recommend that developers undertake archaeological investigation of such sites prior to any development works and to adopt non-destructive construction methods where any archaeological features are discovered or suspected.</P>
      <P>In this instance I am glad that an extensive archaeological excavation was funded by the developer which led to the uncovering of the remains of an earlymedieval tower and walling and a section of a pre-Norman wall.  The developer proposes to seal these remains to ensure their protection when backfilling the site. Whereas this procedure is in accordance with the guidelines on urban archaeology, it would be desirable if a way could be found to publicly display the find. However, the nature of the site would make this very difficult and costly.</P>
      <P>Given the importance of the discovery in the context of the historical evolution of Dublin, I was gratified by the initiative taken by Dublin City Council whereby the developer has agreed to suspend work pending a feasibility study on the possible public display of at least some of the remains.  The Office of Public Works will co-operate fully with the study and, I hope, an appropriate way forward will be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that some of the suggestions the Senator made will come to pass and that we will be able to preserve these archaeological remains.  I appreciate the sensitive way in which the developer has so <Col N="710" /> far treated this issue.  I hope that this sensitivity will continue and that the Office of Public Works, Dublin City Council and other interested bodies will be able to work together to find a satisfactory solution to this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his kind response.  We have a lot in common.  If this issue is handled properly the site could become an important income generator for the city, so that whatever investment is made, even if it initially appears to be large, would be repaid.  The experience of York is a clear example of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I am raising on the Adjournment is the need for a home school liaison officer between the travelling community and St. Anne's primary school in Rathkeale.  I have raised the unique problems of Rathkeale on numerous occasions in this House. Rathkeale is unique in that almost half of the population of the town are members of the travelling community and there is also a large number of transitent travellers who come to the town regularly.</P>
      <P>There are many social problems generated because of the presence of two quite different cultures in the town.  It is imporant that there is more communication between those cultures and more understanding between the two communities in Rathkeale.  The settled community works hard at this problem. It feels threatened at the moment by the growth of the travelling community in the town.</P>
      <P>At present, St. Anne's and the boys' primary schools do everything they can to encourage the travelling community to educate their children.  I am asking the Minister and the Department of Education to provide a home-school liaison teacher or officer to liaise between the school and the traveller families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 209 settled children attending St. Anne's school and there are 18 <Col N="711" /> traveller children on the ordinary role. However, there are on average 90 traveller children enrolled in special category classes in the school.  Although, the average is 90 this figure increases to over 100 between October and Easter and is far in excess of 100 around Christmas.  It declines after Easter because of the transient nature of the traveller lifestyle.  Next year there will be 35 traveller children full-time in the school and on average an extra 70 from October to Easter.</P>
    <P>The Minister should understand the special needs and problems in a school like this, the need for the school to encourage the traveller parents to continue with their children's education, and the importance of primary education to the travelling community.  This is the reason I am asking the Department to appoint a home-school liaison officer to the area.  When I mention this problem to people from outside my area, they think it is ridiculous that Senators have to make representations to the Minister to get such a service.  I also think it ridiculous but, nevertheless, I ask the Minister for help.</P>
    <P>The teachers are working hard liaising with traveller parents.  If there is to be hope for the future of the town &mdash; and we do not want to destroy the travellers' culture &mdash; I believe that the travellers need to understand the difficulties which arise because of the two cultures.  They should be more tolerant of the needs and culture of the settled community.</P>
    <P>Every parent has the right to choose the education they want their child to have, and this also applies to traveller parents.  However, they need a lot of counselling and help in the matter.  Discussions with teachers of pre-school classes, special classes and ordinary classes, should determine when a traveller child is ready for ordinary class work.  In other words, there should be counselling between the parents, the school and the child to determine when the traveller child should no longer be in the special category.</P>
    <P>Traveller children usually cope well when placed in ordinary classes, <Col N="712" /> especially in the junior classes but they begin to lose interest by the time they reach the senior classes.  There are various reasons for this and some of them are cultural.  One of the most important reasons is that the parents, who are often illiterate, cannot help their children with their homework.  There is an obvious need for counselling in such cases.</P>
    <P>If Rathkeale school had this service it would open up opportunities for full participation by the travelling community in ordinary classes or, at least, for integration in some subjects &mdash; for example, music, arts and crafts, physical education, reading, etc.  There could be full integration with ordinary classes in selected subjects.  Pupils from the senior special classes in the school who have achieved a good standard of reading might benefit from one or two years in the ordinary senior classes, even though they could be a bit older than the other pupils.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of its unique problems, there should be a better teacher-pupil ratio in the school.  There are 33 or 34 pupils per teacher and there are other deprived children in the school besides the travellers.  As in other schools in similar towns, some of these children can be even more deprived than the traveller children.  Rathkeale is unique and should be treated as such by the Department.  In order to effectively carry out the integration I have discussed and to improve the standard of education, the pupil-teacher ratio in the ordinary classes should be reduced to 25:1.  This would allow teachers to help deprived children from both the settled and the travelling communities to perform better.</P>
    <P>As I said, a school liaison officer is badly needed to work with parents and children of the settled and travelling communities. They would also work with the staff of the two local primary schools, St. Anne's and the boys' school.  Until now, St. Anne's has been the only school dealing with 50 to 100 traveller children at any one time, but the local boys' school will be in the same position from now on. The thrust of my request is to ask the Department to treat this request as a <Col N="713" /> matter of urgency in time for the new school year.</P>
    <P>On a final point, FÁS has refused to provide a training centre for travellers in Rathkeale where there are 700 or 800 travellers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Aylward.  He had to go to a vote.  May I suggest that the Senator talk to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform in particular, in relation to the point he made about FÁS.  I believe the Minister may be able to assist, because I am surprised by what the Senator has told the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education is aware of the particular circumstances of the school in question.  At present the school has four permanent special assistant teachers catering for traveller children in special classes.  In addition, I am aware that a number of traveller children are attending ordinary classes in the school.  In response to this latter group, a number of temporary teachers are also allocated to the school throughout the year to meet exceptional fluctuations in traveller enrolments at the school.  The Department adopts a flexible approach to the provision of these temporary teachers in recognition of the particular difficulties with which the school has to contend and which the Senator has outlined.</P>
      <P>I can advise the Senator that the Department's inspectorate together with the national education officer for travellers are currently reviewing the adequacy of the current educational provision for the school, with particular emphasis on the laudable efforts being made by the school in the area of integration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also point out that as part of the Government's commitment to focus on areas of special need in the education sector, a range of additional supports are being provided with effect from September 1993.  These supports will include the extension of disadvantaged area status to a significant number of schools <Col N="714" /> not previously included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Schools selected under this initiative will receive a concessionary teaching post as well as increased capitation grants.  It is also intended to target a limited number of extra posts specifically at the needs of traveller children.</P>
    <P>In addition, an extra 15 co-ordinators are being appointed to the home/ school/community liaison scheme, the scheme referred to by Senator Neville. However, to date, the scheme has been confined to selected schools which have already been designated as disadvantaged and the initial expansion now taking place will focus on schools so designated.</P>
    <P>However, I can assure the Senator that the needs of the school in question will be taken fully into account in the selection of recipient schools for the new post to which I have referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank the Minister for his response.  I note that there is an extension to the disadvantaged area scheme which is a prerequisite to obtaining a home/school/community liaison officer.</P>
      <P>Our objective for St. Anne's primary school, Rathkeale, County Limerick, must be to have it designated initially as a disadvantaged area to be eligible for the appointment of such an officer.  I, therefore, urge the Department and ask the Minister, under the special circumstances, to have the school so designated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Minister for Health to review the system of recruitment of student nurses as the present system is cumbersome, inefficient and expensive for the applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nursing profession is a vital link in our health system.  Selection and training <Col N="715" /> should receive the same attention as that for third level education institutions.  It is unfair, and expensive, for a young person who has decided to train as a general nurse to have to apply to the 17 nursing hospital schools and undertake 17 interviews in order to obtain a place.  As interviews regularly clash between hospital schools, applicants can be placed at a disadvantage as they then have to make decisions on the hospital schools to which they submit applications.</P>
    <P>The Minister and An Bord Altranais <Col N="716" /> must establish a central applications system where potential students can be assessed.  The system should incorporate asking applicants to indicate their choice of hospital schools in order of preference.</P>
    <P>It is important that the selection system identifies the presence of the unique attributes that are essential in a good nurse. Under no circumstances should a points system be introduced.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 27 May 1993.</P>
