      <P>I have notice from Senator Cregan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to outline the current position of the report submitted by the Cork Free Port Committee.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Cotter of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to make a statement on the requirement that a fire certificate be provided with a grant application for cattle housing in view of the huge cost of providing the certificate.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to give permission to Cablelink networks to show local advertisements which would enable them to provide a full service.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Enright of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity and urgency for the <Col N="510" /> building of a new 50 bed hospital unit at Edenderry, County Offaly, for geriatric patients.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to approve the Foynes Harbour Development Plan 1992 to 1999 and to submit it to the EC for structural and cohesion grant aid.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The failure of RTE to televise live the All-Ireland Club Hurling Championship Final on St. Patrick's Day, our national holiday, and the need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to request RTE to rectify the position.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senator Cregan, Senator Cotter, Senator Cosgrave, Senator Enright and Senator Neville as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Cregan's and Cotter's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Cosgrave, Enright and Neville may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret that I have had to rule the matter raised by Senator Rory Kiely as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I announce the Order of Business I wish to mention a couple of other matters.  I know that the House wants an opportunity to discuss <Col N="511" /> Aer Lingus and the Whips will meet after the Order of Business today to arrange a suitable time for a debate on the matter. This House had an extensive debate on Aer Lingus in late October and would obviously like to afford itself an opportunity to discuss current developments there.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Justice Bill which is being dealt with in the Dáil at present will be introduced to this House on 24 March.</P>
      <P>I want to thank Senators O'Sullivan and Magner, the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring and other colleagues for making it possible to take statements on Northern Ireland on 25 March and I will have further details of times etc., later.  I also wish to thank the Minister concerned for the fact that the Unfair Dismissals Amendment Bill is to be initiated in this House today, the first I hope, of many Bills to be initiated here. On the Order of Business today it is proposed to take Item 5 from 2.30 p.m. to 6 p.m. Second Stage and Item 11 from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor Quinn Mrs. Taylor Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House are seeking time today to debate the crisis in Aer Lingus because unprecedented action has been taken by the Government in appointing an executive chairman to the company.  We want to establish the position of the Minister and of the Government; whether they have handed over complete control to the executive chairman and what safeguards have been provided for the employees of Aer Lingus.  This vital national issue must be debated in this House today.  We are asking the Leader of the House to provide time, otherwise we will oppose the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the commitment given by the Leader of the House to a debate on Aer Lingus.  I would like to have that debate today and I see no reason why it could not be held at 8 p.m. this evening.  This House led a delegation to Aer Lingus last year, long before these problems arose and has sustained a long and continued interest in <Col N="512" /> the company.  Aer Lingus was the subject of a comprehensive debate in this House last year and I welcome the decision to hold another such debate.  I propose that it be held at 8 p.m. this evening, unless other circumstances prevent this.</P>
      <P>I would like to raise another matter with the Leader of the House which I am remiss for not having raised earlier.  I would like a time limit on Second Stage speeches of the Bill being taken today. As I said on the opening day of this House, in order to facilitate the effective and efficient conduct of Business there should be a time limit, however long or short, on Second Stage speeches.  I ask the Leader of the House to respond.  I suggest that speeches be limited to 25 minutes; that is long enough for anybody to speak on a Bill, and would allow speakers to organise their speeches.</P>
      <P>I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business: that the Aer Lingus debate be taken at 8 p.m. although I am prepared to withdraw it if the Leader of the House has compelling reasons it should be left until tomorrow; and that there should be a time limit of not more than 25 minutes on Second Stage speeches, with the agreement of the House, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot propose an amendment to the Order of Business. There is no item relating to Aer Lingus on the Order Paper.  You may oppose the Order of Business if you wish.  That is the correct procedure to follow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh the motion on the Order Paper and the proposal from the Leader is that we deal with the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill.  I am adding an addendum to that to say that no speaker should take longer than 25 minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Taylor-Quinn's call for a debate on the Aer Lingus issue.  It is unbelievable that one person should be given authority to deal with all of these issues&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I allowed the leader of your group some leeway, but I do not want speeches on the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House the position on a request made two weeks ago, last week and again today for a debate on the economy, given that closing down sales are taking place in every second shop in this city?  Does the Leader intend to allow a debate on the serious state of the economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to ask the Leader to bring forward the debate on Aer Lingus.  There are ways open to us under Standing Orders to advance this matter in an emergency.  However, if it is not possible to take this matter today, may I ask the Leader in the event of a time limit on contributions on Aer Lingus tomorrow, to make sufficient time available to enable everybody to have a say on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious, like Senator Taylor-Quinn and Senator Farrelly, that the discussion on Aer Lingus take place today.  I hope for at least a three hour debate on that matter because of its national importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Leader's indication <Col N="514" /> we are to have statements on Northern Ireland on 25 March, I ask &mdash; and there is an opportunity just now &mdash; that we table a motion rather than make statements. I urge the Leader to endeavour with all party Whips to arrange a motion because&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we have recently had a major speech by the Tánaiste on this issue.  The comments made by the Tánaiste could be incorporated into the motion I have in mind.  The Leader of the Opposition is also&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Whips to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I mention it is that the Leader of the House has said statements.  The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bruton, has called for a unified approach among the four party leaders.  We should have a motion on Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the information given by the Leader that we will have an opportunity on 25 March to make statements on Northern Ireland.  I would be satisfied with an opportunity to express our views which will range across the board.  It would be divisive and unhelpful to have a motion followed by a vote and a division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have ruled it is a matter for the Whips to get together on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two other important matters closely associated with the same subject.  I have requested in the past that this House discuss the important International Fund for Ireland which plays a major role in developing the Border region.  I ask the Leader to give this request a high degree <Col N="515" /> of priority.  The House should be aware of the valuable contribution made by the Fund and Senators may wish to make recommendations.</P>
      <P>Finally, another Border area authority, the Foyle Fisheries Commission make an annual report and I believe this House would be an appropriate forum at which to discuss the commission.  I ask the Leader to arrange an opportunity to discuss these two matters of great importance not only to the Border region but to the nation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second Senator O'Toole's proposal for a limit of 25 minutes on speakers on Second Stage of the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the other speakers who welcomed the opportunity to discuss the Aer Lingus situation. Given that we will be discussing Aer Lingus because of the urgency of that situation, today rather than tomorrow would be the appropriate time for the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest silence on this side be taken as suggesting that we are not gravely concerned, I also suggest an early, comprehensive debate on Aer Lingus.  It does neither House credit to note that an Oireachtas joint committee has been examining Aer Lingus for the past three years, among other State-sponsored bodies.  That Oireachtas joint committee, which I had the honour to chair and on which Members here served, was stymied in the performance of its task for want of a few shillings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a matter for the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for an early and comprehensive discussion of Aer Lingus.  We should learn now that it is time both Houses gave more time and consideration to the operation of our commercial State enterprises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in calling for a <Col N="516" /> debate on Aer Lingus and I also agree with Senator Rory Kiely's request to RTE to broadcast the club championship finals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have ruled on that matter, Senator Cassidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Leader to arrange a debate on the low standards of censorship being applied throughout Europe at present.  In the UK this matter has been highlighted.  I ask for this debate as a matter of urgency given the amount of television violence and pornography coming in directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a consensus in the House on the need for a debate on Aer Lingus.  The difficulty is when to have it and how long it should take.  The House has stated repeatedly that it wants Ministers to initiate Bills in this House.  When that arrangement has been made &mdash; and the Bill today impinges on every worker in the country &mdash; suddenly there is talk of curtailing the debate and even of rescheduling it.  Is the House serious about the initiation of legislation in the Seanad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>You are defending the indefensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interest of harmoney given that we share the Opposition's concern on the Aer Lingus issue, I suggest that Whips arrange a debate for this evening or tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the point that asking for time to be made available does not put the matter in order on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am appalled at the suggestion that there should be a curtailment of the Second Stage debate on the Order Paper today.  It does not augur well for approaches to Ministers that Bills <Col N="517" /> be initiated here if we follow that line of thinking.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Order Paper and requests to the Leader, I asked the Leader of the House two weeks ago for an opportunity to debate State-sponsored bodies and semi-State companies. On that occasion he did not reply.  I raise the matter again today because the time is opportune and I hope abroad and full debate was allowed on semi-state organisations even if we have a debate on Aer Lingus today or tomorrow.  This is an appropriate forum for such a debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader allow a debate on the implementation of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy?  I have good reason for asking this as it would appear that one component of that policy, the retirement package is totally neglected.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator McGowan's suggestion that when Northern Ireland is discussed it should be by way of statements rather than motions. The matter is sensitive and to deal with it by way of motion could be divisive, although I am not saying it would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader of the House to find out when the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies will be reactivated.  Over the last number of months a number of State-Sponsored Bodies have had problems and that committee was not in operation.  The sooner <Col N="518" /> it is reactivated the better.  The funding for that committee was abysmal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister when that committee is reactivated to ensure that sufficient funds are provided so that it can do its job?  It is one of the most important committees and it seems to me that money is available. The programme managers recently appointed by Ministers have more resources than&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a separate question I ask that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is requested to come to this House and discuss the activities of the United Nations in terms of peace-keeping throughout the world.  The relevance of the United Nations in peace-keeping and in the provision of funding for food for people in deprived countries should be actively debated.  We have to give the United Nations power because the United States&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not make a speech a Chathaoirligh.  I have a brief question for the Leader which I asked before and I ask again.  Would it be possible to have a debate on the important subject of the enlargement of the European Community so that we can at least tackle this issue before it happens and not after the fact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I make a brief point to <Col N="519" /> all Senators here.  It is vital that we stick to the Order of Business.  Aer Lingus is a very important issue and is very close to all our hearts but whether it is debated now or later is irrelevant.  We should stick to the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the desire of all sides of the House for a debate on Aer Lingus, we should take account of Senator Enright's point that we need considerable time for this &mdash; the Senator suggested three hours &mdash; and it may not be possible to provide that time today as we are initiating a Bill.  Therefore I suggest late this evening or preferably tomorrow would be more appropriate.  The Whips will make the decision.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that we are to discuss Northern Ireland in this House shortly.  I agree with the points made by other Members that we should seek not to be divisive on the issue.  If it is decided by the Whips that motions would not be appropriate, we should accept that decision and take statements.  Above all, we must not be diverse on the issue.</P>

      <P>I had no notice from anybody about Aer Lingus before I came into the House.  I try to anticipate what might come up.  I assure the House, for political reasons and because of the area I represent, that I would like an opportunity to discuss Aer Lingus.  In the normal way the Whips will meet after the Order of Business and I give a commitment that before the House adjourns this week, we will have had the type of debate we all want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One Senator made a comment about promises and so forth.  It may well be that this Senator is in this House for the lack of promises he made.  The new Senators may wish to afford themselves an opportunity <Col N="520" /> to read the debate that took place in this House.  It was an excellent debate on the situation that then pertained in Aer Lingus, and unfortunately it has got no better.  It was an all party debate.</P>

      <P>I ask that an opportunity is given to organise the debate in a structured way so that it is in the interest of this House.  We must ensure that the Minister is here and that everybody has a chance to speak.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of time limits on debates.  I suggest 30 minutes for the spokesperson and 20 minutes thereafter, and if that was agreeable it would be a structured way of allowing people an opportunity to speak in each debate each week.  This would ensure that we would not have the situation we have all suffered in both Houses, of sitting around wondering whether you can attend to some other business because we are unsure about what is going to happen. We should structure the debate and allow 30 minutes for the spokesperson and 20 minutes for each speaker thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that of all the contributors from the other side of the House, not one Seantor mentioned the fact that we are initiating a new Bill here today, one of many I hope.  Over many weeks and months I have been asked that we initiate legislation and I assure the House that today's Bill will be one of many new Bills to come into this House before the end of this session.  My understanding is that we will be sitting for three <Col N="521" /> days quite soon to accommodate all the legislation that has to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I will come back to Senator McGowan on his request for a debate on the International Fund for Ireland. The Whips will discuss Senator Cassidy's comments on the control of TV censorship. Senator Magner mentioned new legislation coming before the House and my thanks to him for his efforts in ensuring that we will have many new Bills in this House.  The Whips will deal with Senator Finneran's request on Common Agricultural Policy reform and I have no objection to a future debate on that on a Thursday.  I understand that before the month is out the composition and start dates of most of the committees mentioned will be announced.  I hope to have news on that within the month.  With regard to Senator Lydon's request for a debate on the enlargement of the EC, we have debated the EC on several occasions and there is no reason we will not get another opportunity to do so within the next few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome very much the opportunity to accede to the wishes of Senators that legislation be initiated in this House.  I have come to the Seanad frequently in recent years.  It has been said, quite rightly, that the Seanad wishes to be taken seriously and one of the ways in which it can be taken seriously is to have a legislation initiated here.  I pushed for this Bill to be initiated in the Seanad and not in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I realise that Aer Lingus is an important issue, carrying with it enormous repercussions and I welcome the fact that Senators are rigorous in their pursuit of that matter.  However, we must deal with this Bill this afternoon and I am glad to be here.</P>
      <P>The Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 was enacted by the Oireachtas in April, 1977. Prior to that time, employees had a minimal degree of protection against wrongful dismissal, principally under common law.  Considerations such as lengthy delays, the expense involved and the lack of industrial relations expertise in the civil courts, deterred many aggrieved employees from using these courts.</P>
      <P>The 1977 Act brought about a significant change in this situation.  The Act provided that thereafter dismissal would be regarded as unfair unless there were substantial grounds justifying such action.  It provided a system under which claims of unfair dismissal could be investigated impartially by a Rights Commissioner or by the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  It also provided for redress for unfair dismissal in the form of reinstatement, re-engagement or compensation for financial loss.</P>
      <P>The 1977 Act, therefore, protected the employee from arbitrary dismissal and it enhanced employment rights.  It also provided an avenue of redress which was designed to be speedy.  As such, the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, might be said to be one of the most significant pieces of labour law on the Statute Book. It is an important source of worker protection and provides a charter of rights for over 750,000 employees in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the type of protection provided by the Unfair Dismissals Act is illustrated by the number of cases referred under the Act to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for adjudication. In the period 1984-91, inclusive, a total of 7,751 direct claims of alleged unfair dismissal was dealt with by the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  Of these, the appeal was allowed in 1,734 cases and disallowed in 2,414 cases.  The balance was made up of cases which were either disposed of without a hearing or withdrawn during a hearing.  In cases where dismissal has been found to be unfair, and compensation has been decided upon as the remedy, the average amount of such compensation has risen from £1,864 in 1984 to £2,660 in 1991.  In 1991, the size of such awards ranged from less than <Col N="525" /> £100 to £15,000 in the light of the circumstances of individual cases.</P>
    <P>Thus, the 1977 Act was introduced to deal with a situation where instant dismissal without reason was common and could only be challenged by trade union action.  Employees in non-union or weakly-organised areas had little protection.</P>
    <P>Even those who are critical of the Act do not seriously dispute that such employees needed some legal safeguards against the actions of a minority of employers who would have resorted to instant and unjustified dismissals.  In view, however, of the length of time the Act has been on the Statute Book a review of its contents was considered necessary.</P>
    <P>Following on in a evolutionary way, a discussion document was published in November 1987.  This document outlined possible options which might be considered in three specific areas of our employment protection legislation namely, unfair dismissal, employment equality and payment of wages.  As Senators will be aware, a new Payment of Wages Act was enacted in 1991 whereby workers are paid through the banks.  The present Bill results from consultations and discussions with both sides of industry and other organisations interested in the operation of our unfair dismissals legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is in line with an undertaking in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i>&ldquo;to amend and improve the working of the unfair dismissals legislation&rdquo; and also fulfils a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, Section IX.  It is important to put that on the record.</P>
    <P>Quite obviously the two main constituents interested in this type of legislation are the workers and the owners management.  However, under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which was a social forum whereby various social partners found their voice it was quite clear that the commitments were seriously entered into with the expectation that they would be delivered on and upheld.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="526" /> In introducing this legislation I am conscious that the Programme for a Partnership Government commits this Administration to a review of labour legislation to ensure that it extends full protection against discrimination to a range of minority and disadvantaged groups.  Among the possible grounds for discrimination listed in the Programme for a Partnership Government for inclusion in the review are parental status, religion, age, handicap, race, colour, sexual orientation and national or ethnic origin, including membership of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>The review falls within the brief of my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  I have discussed with him relevant aspects of unfair dismissals legislation which already provides protection in a general way against dismissal on the grounds listed in the programme and designates some of them specifically &mdash; race, religion, colour, and now in this Bill, sexual orientation &mdash; as grounds for automatically unfair dismissal.  In this context, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform has indicated to me that, following review of equality aspects of labour law, he will be promoting proposals for legislation framed to ensure full equality of opportunity for all in the workplace.  If necessary, when that time comes and his legislation is ready, those proposals may incorporate suitable amendments of unfair dismissals legislation. However, that is for another day, and I know from speaking to the Minister and his staff that they are busy drafting the legislation.</P>
    <P>Before I come to deal specifically with the contents of the Bill which is the amendment to the 1977 Unfair Dismissals Act, I would like to say a few words about the positive aspects of that Act on our system of industrial relations and to refute suggestions that it has had a negative effect on employment creation.</P>
    <P>When the 1977 Act was being prepared it was considered that the right to secure a speedy impartial decision on a claim of unfair dismissal would help to reduce the incidence of industrial disputes related to dismissal.  The success of the Act in <Col N="527" /> achieving this can be seen from an examination of the relevant statistics.  Since 1976, the year preceding enactment of the legislation, disputes relating to dismissals have decreased both in numerical terms and when expressed as a percentage of the total number.  Statistics show that the reduction in the proportion of disputes arising from dismissal since the enactment of that Act is quite significant.</P>
    <P>In 1976, almost 20 per cent of all disputes arose from dismissals.  Since the introduction of the 1977 Act, the number has decreased to about 10 per cent a year and, in some years this statistic has been as low as 7 to 8 per cent.  This fact, taken in conjunction with the number of claims made under the Act, suggests that it has played a major role in reducing industrial relations tensions.  Indeed, this view is borne out by the conclusions of a study published in 1987 on &ldquo;The Impact of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 on Workplace Industrial Relations&rdquo;.  The study, by the very distinguished Tom Murphy of the Department of Industrial Relations in UCD, concludes, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The Unfair Dismissals Act may be regarded as very successful in the way in which it has contributed to an improved ability on the part of employers and trade unions to resolve dismissal issues through discussion.  It has not led to the marginalisation of the significance of collective bargaining for the regulation of the dismissal issue at the workplace.  The law has instead strengthened collective bargaining at workplace level by creating a closer harmony between employer and trade union views of what constitutes a fair dismissal.  What has evolved under the Act's implementation is a very detailed and comprehensive code of practice relating not to the dismissal decision alone but to the whole process of disciplinary control and administration. In industrial relations terms, therefore, the Act has been a major benefit.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in recent years there has been much emphasis in many countries <Col N="528" /> on the creation of an environment where businesses can operate with the minimum of constraints consistent with good business practice and hence create maximum employment opportunities. The expression &ldquo;labour market flexibility&rdquo; has become common currency and questions have been posed as to how responsible the various institutions, regulations and practices are to changing conditions. In Ireland, the debate has tended to focus on one single aspect, the extent to which worker protection legislation, and particularly the Unfair Dismissals Act, constitutes a disincentive to employers to hire workers.  Various commentators have advanced the argument that the Act hinders employment creation.  I would like to put some facts on the record with regard to that.</P>
    <P>A survey commissioned by the Department of Labour and carried out by the ERSI in 1986 suggested that the scale of these alleged effects is not significant. The study found that practically none of the firms surveyed saw the legislation as one of the main problems facing them, and only a small minority cited it as having caused them a problem in the previous year.</P>
    <P>Apart from the UCD study to which I have already referred, other surveys on the operation of the 1977 Act have demonstrated that there have been beneficial effects for management flowing from the legislation since it has contributed to improved personnel practices and to a more stable industrial relations climate. In many instances, the Act has provided an impetus for the reform of disciplinary and dismissal procedures and has helped to tighten up selection procedures.  This, in turn, has led to a better selected and more suitable workforce with obvious benefits to employers and a lower likelihood of industrial disputes because of dismissals.</P>
    <P>As a final point on this issue, I think it is worth noting that the implication in repeated criticisms of the Act, that it prevents employers from letting staff go in any circumstances, does not stand up to examination.  For example, if an employer takes on additional staff and <Col N="529" /> subsequently finds that because of a reduction in business they must let them go, they are not inhibited from doing so by the Act which recognises an employer's entitlement to terminate employment on grounds of redundancy, or indeed, on grounds arising from the capacity, competence or conduct of the employees concerned.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, is on the protection of employees from being unfairly dismissed from their jobs by setting down criteria by which dismissals are to be judged unfair and by providing an adjudication system and redress for an employee whose dismissal has been found to be unjustified.  That objective remains as valid today as it was in 1977.</P>
    <P>Before proceeding to the sections of the Bill, I should mention that the question of the optimum hours threshold for eligibility for protection under the 1977 Act, set at 18 hours per week in that Act, was a matter of major concern at the time of publication of the discussion document. However, the debate on that issue has, in practical terms, been overtaken by the enactment of the Worker Protection (Regular Part-time Employees) Act of 1991.  That Act extended the protection of the 1977 Act to regular part-time employees, i.e., defined as those who, subject to the one-year service requirement, have been in the continuous service of an employer for at least 13 weeks and are normally expected to work for that employer for not less than eight hours a week.</P>
    <P>Before I discuss the technicalities of the Bill I beg the indulgence of the House.  While the technicalities are the nuts and bolts of legislation, they sometimes appear very complicated when taken section by section.</P>
    <P>This Bill is about people, about workers' rights and the creation of a proper business environment.  Above all, we are saying in this Bill amending the 1977 Act that, in Churchill's words, &ldquo;To jaw-jaw is better than to war-war&rdquo;.  Disputes should be resolved through discussion, wherever possible.  Employee and employer relations can be fraught <Col N="530" /> and difficult occasionally but in essence, discussion is a peaceful way to resolve disputes.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the provisions in the Bill which provide for changes in the 1977 Act.  While no fundamental alteration to the broad trust and purpose of the 1977 Act is proposed, the Bill addresses a number of important issues of substance relating to the Act and effects a range of technical and administrative amendments.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is a standard interpretation section.  Section 2 makes technical amendments to the definitions of &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Tribunal&rdquo; in the principal Act &mdash; the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 &mdash; and clarifies that an award of reinstatement entitles an employee to benefit from any improvement in terms and conditions of employment which may occur between the date of dismissal and the date of reinstatement.</P>
    <P>Section 3 amends section 2 (2) of the principal Act by inserting a proviso to the exclusion in that subsection from coverage by the Act of certain fixed term or fixed purpose contracts of employment. The proviso will allow a rights commissioner (the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Circuit Court, as the case may be) to examine any second or subsequent fixed term or fixed purpose contract of employment and, to take a view as to whether the fixed nature of the contract was wholly or partly for, or connected with, the avoidance of liability under unfair dismissals legislation.  In such circumstances, a claim for unfair dismissal at the expiry of the contract may be heard in the normal way.</P>
    <P>The section also broadens the scope of the legislation to include temporary officers of health boards and deletes the obsolete reference to a committee on agriculture by amending section 2 (1) (j) of the principal Act.  Maybe the committee on agriculture will return.  I do not know.  For the moment it is deemed to be obsolete.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 provides for certain minor amendments to section 5 (1), (2) and (3) of the principal Act, the main purpose of which is to ensure consistency of approach in relation to lock-out and dismissal between the principal Act and paragraph 2 of the First Schedule to the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.</P>
      <P>Section 5 extends the scope of section 6 (2) of the principal Act to include sexual orientation in the list of reasons for dismissal which are deemed for the purposes of the legislation to be automatically unfair.  Section 5 also provides for a new section 6 (7) of the principal Act so as to reinforce the concept of procedural fairness by providing that a rights commissioner (the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Circuit Court, as the case may be), in deciding whether a dismissal is an unfair dismissal, may have regard to the reasonableness, or otherwise of the conduct of the employer and to compliance, or failure to comply, by the employer with dismissal procedures or codes of practice.</P>
      <P>Section 6 alters section 7 of the principal Act as follows: paragraph (a) amends section 7 (1) of the principal Act to provide for a new basic financial award for unfair dismissal in certain circumstances. The amendment will allow a rights commissioner (the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Circuit Court, as the case may be) to award compensation &mdash; of up to four weeks' pay &mdash; for unfair dismissal in cases where no financial loss has been incurred by the employee.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b) amends section 7 (2) of the principal Act by clarifying certain of the considerations that are required to be taken into account in calculating the amount of compensation payable to an employee who has been unfairly dismissed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (c) inserts a new subsection (2) (a) in section 7 of the principal Act to provide that, in calculating financial loss (for the purpose of compensation), payments to an employee under the social welfare and income tax codes <Col N="532" /> which arise from an unfair dismissal shall be disregarded.</P>
    <P>Section 7 alters section 8 of the principal Act as follows: paragraph (a) inserts a new subsection (1) (a) in section 8 of the principal Act which requires that, henceforth, a rights commissioner &mdash; the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Circuit Court, as the case may be &mdash; in awarding reinstatement, re-engagement or financial compensation in respect of an unfair dismissal must state why either of the other two forms of redress are not awarded; the paragraph amends section 8 (2) of the principal Act to allow flexibility to a rights commissioner &mdash; the Employment Appeals Tribunal or Circuit Court, as the case may be &mdash; to extend the time limit for hearing a claim for redress for unfair dismissal for up to 12 months in cases where exceptional circumstances have prevented the lodgment of the claim within the normal time limit of six months.  It also amends section 8 (3) of the principal Act to provide a time limit of 21 days for objections by a party to the hearing of a claim by a rights commissioner and amends section 8 (4) of the principal act to allow the Employment Appeals Tribunal to issue a determination confirming the recommendation of a rights commissioner in circumstances where the employer concerned has neither implemented the recommendation nor appealed the case.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) amends section 8 (5) of the principal Act so as to permit a party to make a claim directly to the Employment Appeals Tribunal without reference, in the first instance, to a rights commissioner as is required by the present wording of the section.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) amends section 8 (9) of the principal Act so as to increase the fine from £20, as set in 1967 under redundancy legislation, to £1,000 for failure to attend before the Employment Appeals Tribunal, refusal to give evidence or failure or refusal to produce documents.  It is necessary that the fine should be sufficiently high to act as a deterrent, not as a penal or punitive measure.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) amends section 9 (10) of <Col N="533" /> the principal Act in in order to prohibit explicitly the processing of a claim or dispute both under unfair dismissal legislation and by a rights commissioner or the Labour Court under industrial relations legislation.  The paragraph also inserts new subsections (11) and (12) into section 8 of the principal Act.  These subsections provide that in the case of a contract of employment tainted with illegality the employee shall, nonetheless, be entitled to redress for unfair dismissal.  In such cases the rights commissioner, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Circuit Court, as the case may be, shall notify the Revenue Commissioners or the Minister for Social Welfare, as appropriate, of the matter.</P>
    <P>Section 8 amends section 9 (2) of the principal Act by increasing from six weeks to seven weeks the time within which a copy of a notice of appeal must be given by the Employment Appeals Tribunal to the other party to the appeal. Administrative problems have been encountered by the tribunal under the existing provision in the case of appeals lodged at the last minute.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for some minor technical amendments to section 14 of the principal Act.</P>
    <P>Section 10 amends section 15 of the principal Act so as to allow flexibility to an employee in changing a claim as between redress in common law or under unfair dismissals legislation.  The amendment will allow a claimant flexibility as to which avenue of redress to pursue up until the point where a recommendation of a rights commissioner has issued in the case, or a hearing of the claim by the Employment Appeals Tribunal has commenced, on the one hand, or, a hearing in the courts under the common law has commenced.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with appeals from and enforcement of determinations of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  The section provides an avenue of appeal to the Circuit Court from a determination of the tribunal.  In cases where an employer fails to implement an order made by the Circuit Court the section allows the employee concerned, or the Minister on <Col N="534" /> behalf of the employee, to apply to the Circuit Court for an order directing the employer to implement the determination. In such circumstances, the Circuit Court is empowered to make an order against an employer which would include interest on the amount of any financial compensation.  In cases where an order for reinstatement or re-engagement is concerned, the Circuit Court may direct the employer to pay to the employee financial compensation, in respect of the period during which the employer failed to implement the order of re-instatement or re-engagement.  The section also provides that the Circuit Court may change the nature of an award from re-engagement or reinstatement to financial compensation.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with evidence in relation to the prosecution of a person for failure to attend before the Employment Appeals Tribunal, or refusal to give evidence or failure, or refusal to produce documents.  The section specifies that a document signed by the chairman or a vice-chairman of the tribunal, stating details of the alleged offence, shall be admitted by the court as evidence of the matters so stated without further proof.</P>
    <P>Section 13 extends the scope of the unfair dismissals legislation to include persons employed through employment agencies.  For the purposes of the legislation, the organisation where the person works is deemed to be the employer of the agency worker.</P>
    <P>There was a case taken in 1986 and under the previous legislation, the employee was found not to be the responsibility fo the agency.  Because of this we are changing the legislation so that the employer is the person responsible, not the agency.</P>
    <P>Section 14 replaces section 6 (7) of the principal Act.  In an effort to respond to difficulties identified in relation to the understanding and identification in the Act of this section, the provision has been redrafted.  As before, the purpose of the section remains to confirm the application of the protection of the legislation to employees dismissed for trade union activity who would not otherwise be <Col N="535" /> covered because of their failure to satisfy the minimum one year service requirement or because of certain exclusions relating to training, probation and apprenticeship.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides that, in cases where a business is transferred to another owner, the acceptance and retention of a redundancy payment on the part of an employee will break that employee's continuity of service.  Section 16 repeals section 10 of the principal Act, which is overtaken by the provisions of section 11 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 17 is a standard provision dealing with the Short Title, collective citation, construction, commencement and application of the Bill.  The Bill specifies 1 July 1993 as the date for coming into operation of the legislation.</P>
    <P>As I said this is a technical Bill and technical legislation can sometimes appear dry.  Therefore it is necessary to read this legislation carefully because it relates to particular sections of the original Bill.  Contrary to my practice of speaking off the cuff instead of reading from a brief, in this instance it is necessary to be precise because, the legislation, while not difficult is very technical.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise some points in relation to the general environment of legislation like this.  Since my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for Labour Affairs, I have become very interested in this area.  I dealt with industrial relations in the Department of Education and in my short time in the Department of Health.  Under the last Administration I was Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce with responsibility for Trade and Marketing and I listened to the concerns expressed by business people particularly those engaged in small businesses.  I saw the whole picture and could understand the concern expressed by both sides.</P>
    <P>In times of economic difficulty, and when there is a recession, fears may arise about this sort of legislation and I want to allay these fears.  I think we have achieved a good balance in the type of <Col N="536" /> labour legislation passed in the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>This Bill contains no fundamental changes to the broad intent of the original Act, its primary purpose being to address a number of issues that have arisen in connection with the operation of the Act in the past 16 years.  In anticipation of this legislation, I have met with representatives of ICTU and IBEC, even though the previous Minister had consulted them when he was preparing the Bill.  I thought it courteous to do this and we enjoyed the interchange.  There is some agreement on various points in the legislation.  Obviously, you cannot frame legislation which suits divergent views and needs, but I and my officials have sought to have produced a balanced Bill. There are necessary changes in this legislation which I will mention again.  I spoke at such length that I would not blame Members for forgetting them.  As regards agency workers, some people might be hired constantly on a contract basis.  That in itself is all right but when these workers are hired out to two, three or four employers they cannot have their grievances redressed under the employment legislation, especially as far as the second, third and fourth contracts are concerned.  In my ministerial positions I came across many such cases.</P>
    <P>Under this legislation sexual orientation cannot be used as an excuse for dismissal.  The Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, covered sexual orientation as well as race, colour, political activity, trade union membership, pregnancy and other issues already included in the 1977 Act. I am pleased to have included it in this Bill and I hope the House will welcome it.  This is a first step towards the enactment of the legislation which the Ministers, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and Deputy Taylor will be introducing at a later date.  Where a case is deemed to be proper for decision by a tribunal, even though the person concerned may not have suffered loss of employment, up to four weeks' payment may be made. These are just some of the measures being introduced and there are many others, some of a technical nature.  I want <Col N="537" /> to emphasise that we aim to have a balance between the rights of employees and the rights of management and owners.</P>
    <P>I would again like to emphasise that the Bill contains no fundamental changes to the broad intent of the original Act, its primary purpose being to address a number of issues that have arisen in connection with the operation of the Act in the past 16 years.  These changes, together with a range of amendments, will serve to update and improve the operation of this legislation.  We have in this House a distinguished member of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, Senator Neville, and I am glad to recognise that.</P>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Members for the close attention given to the Second Stage.  In this context, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Leader of the House for having this Bill initiated in the Seanad and I thank the Minister for her kind reference, which may have been prompted by Senator Hillery.</P>
      <P>It is important at this stage that a number of issues be addressed in relation to the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  While I welcome the technical and administrative amendments to that Act, the basic thrust of the 1977 Act is unchanged. Dismissal is a very traumatic and stressful event in a person's life.  The stress level has been compared to that experienced on the death of a spouse or close relative. It is important that the State encourages and monitors fairness and justice in the area of dismissal from employment. Employers, their representatives and the trade union movement are in full agreement with this principle.  There is no disagreement between any side of the industrial relations divide with regard to the principle of fairness in dismissing employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the obvious impact on living standards through loss of wages or salary, dismissal often results in temporary or long term unemployment.  A person's link with the workforce is broken.  Valuable skills and work experience are lost and the contribution of the individual worker to the organisation is <Col N="538" /> rendered valueless by the decision of the employer, for whatever reason, to dispense with a person's services.  A worker's social life is also affected when he ceases to be employed.  He does not have the same social opportunities with his friends during lunch breaks or at work.  All those social outlets are broken.</P>
    <P>The right to dismiss fairly is also important to an employer and he must be in a position to do so.  An employer has the right to manage his or her business in an efficient and effective way.  Unfortunately, this can sometimes mean dispensing with the services of an employee. A person's service may be dispensed with by way of redundancy as a result of changes in the work place or because of reorganisation or reallocation of work. The job, not the person becomes redundant. In some circumstances, an employer for the sake of efficiency and continued survival of the organisation, must dispense with employees, as the Minister said, and I quote: &ldquo;on grounds arising from the capacity, competence or conduct of the employees concerned&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is an unfortunate fact of life that employers on occasion must dispense with an employee's services.  However, it is important that they do so in a fair, reasonable and just fashion.  In my experience employers want to act fairly and to observe accepted fair procedures when dismissing an employee.  Often it is the small employer who is responsible for unfair dismissals, because he has not the expertise or knowledge to understand the implications of his actions.</P>
    <P>The Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 was introduced to increase job security and limit the right of employers to dismiss workers at will.  It is fair to say such an approach would be quite unusual today but was prevalent in times past.  Labour legislation, especially that enacted in 1973 and 1977, makes provision for rights to protect workers in employment.  As the Department of Labour discussion document states &ldquo;it lays down minimum standards to which all employers and employees will adhere&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 was limited because it failed to cover certain <Col N="539" /> sections of the workforce, especially those in part-time or temporary employment, or what is often referred to as flexible employment.  The 1977 Act applied to full-time employees.  Sadly, this is a diminishing section of the workforce. It is now estimated that less than 20 per cent of the working population come within the scope of the 1977 Act.</P>
    <P>Since 1977 there has been a phenomenal growth in the level of part-time, temporary and casual employees.  It is not acceptable that the terms of the legislation, the objective of which is to protect employees, now excludes the most vulnerable groups of workers, namely the categories to whom I referred.  At the same time, we must ensure that legislation does not damage our competitiveness with our EC partners.  Excess costs must not be introduced which will damage or make Irish goods less competitive in the EC or world markets. Labour legislation is not designed to do that and employers should not see it as such.  However, as the Minister says and I agree with her, employers do not see it this way.  Unemployment has placed a high premium on job security for all employees.  Nobody should suffer the injustice of unfair dismissal because in most situations there are no opportunities for other employment.  However, if it happens there should be adequate redress.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the work done by the Employment Appeals Tribunal since 1977.  My experience of the tribunal is that it strives to be fair to all sides in a dispute.  Traditionally, members of the tribunal come together to discuss each case fairly and objectively.  As a member of the tribunal for over four years, I have always been impressed by my colleagues' objectivity.  We are there to work as objectively and as fairly as possible, regardless of who nominated us and the low rate of minority submissions in cases is evidence of that.  There is a high rate of unanimous decisions by the three members of the sections of the tribunal in all determinations.  It is a credit to the nominating bodies of the employers and <Col N="540" /> the trade unions that the tribunal has worked so well and that its decisions have such a high acceptability rate with both sides.</P>
    <P>The tribunal, which is an independent body, seeks remedies for alleged breaches of an employee's statutory rights.  It was designed as an inexpensive approach to deal with such disputes and for several years after its introduction that was the case.  Industrial relations personnel from the FIE or other employer bodies brought claims on behalf of employers to the tribunal, while trade union officials did the same on behalf of the trade unions.  Nowadays, lawyers present most of the cases.  I do not think this is a healthy development because it involves unnecessary expense for the employer and especially the employee in presenting their case to the tribunal.  It costs £1,000 to bring a case to the courts. This is very expensive, particularly in the context of the tribunal which was set up as an inexpensive and informal type of investigation.  The tribunal has often been criticised for not taking a legalistic approach and in some ways this is true. It has a statutory function to adjudicate in disputes rather than seek to resolve them by conciliation or mediation. Inevitably a minimum of legalism is introduced as legalism aims at deciding disputes in accordance with the law laid down by the Houses of the Oireachtas and with procedures which are fair to both sides.  The suggestion has been made that chairpersons of the tribunal should not be legalistic.  I do not agree.  The presence of a legal person on the tribunal is often a great guide to others on the tribunal without a legal background and helps with the interpretation of the Acts. The present practice, which is often criticised, should continue.</P>
    <P>The Minister provided statistical information for 1984-91, but in 1991, the last year the Employment Appeals Tribunal published a report, 4,954 claims and appeals were referred to the tribunal. Some 987 of these, including 33 appeals from the Rights Commissioner, were appealed under the Unfair Dismissals <Col N="541" /> Act, 1977.  Of 872 direct claims 198 were allowed, 221 were dismissed, 168 were withdrawn during the hearing and 285 prior to the hearing.  Only a minority of cases were allowed which reflects the fact that in industry the majority of dismissals are fair.</P>
    <P>The tribunal in 1991 awarded compensation amounting to £329,838 in 124 cases.  The average award was £2,660 per case, a low value to place on a job or livelihood but this has been the tribunal's decision although the legislation allows compensation payments of up to 104 weeks pay.  It is significant that reinstatement was ordered in just 20 cases and re-engagement in 31 cases.  One would feel &mdash; I will quote later from an ILO Convention on this &mdash; that the preferred outcome would be the reinstatement or re-engagement of the employee.  In most cases reinstatement has been by agreement of both employer and employee concerned.</P>
    <P>The tribunal plays an important part in assisting the proper management of industrial relations in the State.  It is important that adequate funding is provided to ensure an efficient service and I ask the Minister to examine this area attentively.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill clarifies that an award of reinstatement entitles an employee to benefit from any improvement in terms and conditions of employment taking place between the date of dismissal and the date of reinstatement. This provision is welcome but not significant; in 1991 just 20 cases of reinstatement were ordered by the tribunal.  Since the enactment of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 compensation has been the primary remedy and the preferred option of employers and employees.  In most cases the previous relationship between employer and employee had deteriorated and it was not wise to order the reinstatement or re-engagement of the employee.</P>
    <P>I refer now to the ILO Convention on Termination of Employment which includes a reference to reinstatement as a preferred remedy.  Article 10 of that Convention states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="542" /> If the bodies referred to in Article 8 of this Convention find that termination is unjustified and if they are not empowered or do not find it practicable, in accordance with national law and practice, to declare the termination invalid and or order or propose the reinstatement of the worker, they shall be empowered to order payment of adequate compensation or such other relief as may be deemed appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is implicit in that statement from the ILO that the question of compensation should only arise if reinstatement proves impracticable.  In Ireland in most cases it has proved impracticable and both employers and employees at the tribunal have accepted that.  As a member of the tribunal I have never experienced a difference of opinion as to what the preferred outcome should be if a dismissal were found to be unfair.  The parties usually agree on redress under section 7 of the principal Act.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill introduces a system of payment of up to four weeks remuneration as compensation where the employee incurs no financial loss.  It is significant that in 1991 only five cases were recorded by the Employment Appeals Tribunal where dismissals were found to be unfair and as no financial loss was incurred no compensation was awarded.</P>
    <P>Section 6 also excludes social welfare payments and rebates of tax from the calculation of loss.  The employers' organisation, IBEC, makes the valid point that under new legislation a double payment to the employee will be financed largely by the employers.  A clawback provision should be inserted in the Bill under which the Department of Social Welfare can require repayment of social welfare payments already received.  This provision could require the employer to refund the Department of Social Welfare in respect of social welfare payments already paid to the employee by deducting that amount from the compensation paid to the employee.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill inserts a proviso to exclude in that subsection from the <Col N="543" /> principal Act certain fixed contracts and to allow a rights commissioner to examine second or subsequent fixed term contracts. This will help to stem the growing trend towards fixed term contract work, intended to avoid employer responsibilities imposed by labour legislation &mdash; we heard evidence of this practice at the Beef Tribunal.  I strongly welcome this inclusion.  I also welcome the inclusion of temporary officers of the health boards and the vocational education committees under this legislation which should be extended to all staff employed by these bodies.</P>
    <P>The provision on procedural fairness is unnecessary.  The Employment Appeals Tribunal has always concerned itself with the fairness of its procedures and this provision could reinforce a tendency on the part of the tribunal to be overly concerned with the procedural rather than the substantive issues of cases before it. The Bill's provision could make for more legalistic considerations of fairness solely on the grounds of procedure rather than the substantive reasons for the dismissal. Fair procedures are important but their absence does not always make a fair dismissal unfair.  I have come across cases where the dismissal was blatantly fair, in the case of violence or whatever, although the correct procedure was not adhered to.  The substantive nature of such cases, even though all procedures were not carried out, ensured the fairness of the dismissal.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 5 of the Bill, I welcome the inclusion of sexual orientation of an employee as unfair grounds for dismissal.  I strongly urge the Minister to include a clause deeming it unfair to dismiss an employee for giving sworn evidence to a Tribunal established by the State to investigate matters of public importance.  It is my view that the Employment Appeals Tribunal would, if a case were presented to them, deem such a dismissal unfair.  However, the Tánaiste has decided to hide behind the excuse that witnesses, if their names are given to the Beef Tribunal, may be dismissed. The Minister must use this <Col N="544" /> occasion to deal with that situation.  This will enable the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, to comply with the wishes of Oireachtas Éireann and give full and frank evidence to the tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fairly convoluted argument as presented by the Senator.  However, I recognise it very clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that under present circumstances any employer could or would dismiss an employee for giving evidence to such a tribunal.</P>
      <P>With regard to alternative remedies available to dismissed employees, the approach should be simplified.  It should be provided that where an employee has a right to claim under unfair dismissals legislation he or she should be barred from bringing a claim based on the dismissal to the Labour Court.  This would be more conducive to good industrial relations.  It would not bar employees who do not have statutory rights under unfair dismissals legislation from bringing such cases under the Industrial Relations Acts.  In other cases where there are alternative remedies, the employee should be required to decide on a particular remedy and having done so be barred from the alternatives.  For instance, an employee should be required to decide between an unfair dismissal claim and an action for wrongful dismissal. Similarly where equality issues are concerned, the employee should be required to decide between an unfair dismissal claim, a claim for discriminatory dismissal, or penalisation under employment equality legislation, and having chosen one route should be barred from taking other routes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation with regard to appeals should be examined.  At present, the tribunal's decision under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 can be appealed to the Circuit Court where the appeal is heard in a complete re-hearing at which both parties can give further evidence if they wish and all issues of fact are open again for discussion.  A further anomaly is that the decision of the Circuit Court can then <Col N="545" /> be appealed to the High Court and again the appeal takes the form of a complete re-hearing of all issues, both parties having complete freedom to call new evidence. The appeal is then determined by a full-time judge who will apply different rules of evidence to those prevailing in the tribunal which, not being a court, has always allowed strict rules of evidence to be relaxed.</P>
    <P>It is quite anomalous to provide for appeals by way of re-hearing from a tribunal which operates one set of rules of evidence to a court which operates another set of rules of evidence.  There should be a system where there is one appeal only of the decisions of the tribunal by way of a re-hearing.  It should be an appeals body similarly constituted, with representatives from the workplace, and applying the same rules and standards as the original tribunal.  A possibility would be for some type of division of the tribunal, presided over by a Circuit Court or High Court judge and sitting with representatives of the workplace similar to those who are at present on the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to an issue not mentioned in the Act which perhaps the Minister would consider.  Sometimes there is difficulty with the interaction between the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 and the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981.  The 1981 Act provides that a pregnant employee may as of right take maternity leave and the employer must keep her job open for her when she returns provided she has served the appropriate notice under section 9 of the Act.  It sometimes happens that an employee takes maternity leave without serving these notices and is thus not entitled to the protection of the Act.  If an employer dismisses such an employee for no other reason than that she took maternity leave, it is not clear whether this can be treated as an unfair dismissal under the 1977 Act.  One view is that the Maternity Protection of Employees Act was intended to provide a minimum of rights for employees taking maternity leave.  It should not, therefore, deprive employees of the right to claim under the <Col N="546" /> Unfair Dismissals Act if they are dismissed for no other reason than that of pregnancy, which is automatically covered under the Unfair Dismissals Act.</P>
    <P>The other view is that the Maternity Protection of Employees Act provides pregnant employees with a complete code of protection and they should not be allowed to use other statutes as a means of redress if they fail to comply with all the procedures under the Act. The question is, which of these views is correct.  It is a matter of policy and the Minister should use the opportunity to clear up the anomaly.</P>
    <P>There is a further anomaly in the law in that if an employer gives notice of dismissal and the employee waives his right to work out his period of notice, this nullifies the dismissal by converting it into a resignation by the employee and thereby leaves him no rights under the Unfair Dismissals Acts.  There should be provision that once an employer serves notice of dismissal, any legal rights thereby vested in the employee by virtue of the fact that he is being dismissed cannot be lost by any subsequent decision by the employee to terminate his employment during the period of serving notice and thereby waive his rights under the contract of employment.  We look forward to examining these matters on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker I welcome the fact that this Bill has been initiated in the Seanad as opposed to the other House and I thank the Minister for her support in that regard.  As a former Member of the House &mdash; and I served here with her at an earlier time &mdash; she has an appreciation of the importance of having legislation initiated in this House and I thank her for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, there were minimal opportunities for employees who were wrongfully dismissed to seek redress.  As the Minister pointed out in her speech, such redress was mainly through the common law which was a very expensive slow process. Since 1977, however, the Employment <Col N="547" /> Appeals Tribunal and the Rights Commissioner service provide a speedy and economic service and access to justice for cases of unfair dismissal which is the nub of the matter.  Furthermore, the services are available on an appropriate geographical basis and that is important.  It means that where there is a case of unfair dismissal there is normally a service available in the nearest town, if not in the town itself.</P>
    <P>I am of the view that the Unfair Dismissals Act has had a major impact on management policy and practice, and especially in larger organisations that have fully developed personnel departments. I mean by this that employers and employees now have a clearer understanding of where each stands and that is all to the good.  It is more open and more transparent.  There is a greater awareness of what is fair.  Written procedures, for example, in the case of discipline help.  It is not so much a question of the focus being on discipline or dismissal, but rather on the needs employees may have. I agree with Senator Neville that, regrettably, from time to time employees have to be dismissed.  Management must have a certain scope for discretion; that is taken as a given.  I have in mind cases where an employee may have gone off the rails and, because of this transparency in the arrangements, a certain amount of counselling may be appropriate.  A preventative approach or a verbal warning may be justified before the legal process is activated in full.</P>
    <P>The Act has contributed to the improvement of relationships at work between people.  As the Minister pointed out, we can talk about law, regulations, procedures, institutions and so on, but ultimately we are talking about human beings in the workplace and the interaction between them.  I am glad the Minister referred to the research done by my colleague in UCD, Tom Murphy.  We work in the same department and I was familiar with the particular piece of research he did.  He advocates a positive contribution to industrial relations rather than a preoccupation with dismissal <i>per <Col N="548" /> se</i>.  In other words, there are important advantages to building relationships in the workplace.  In that context one should mention the importance of relevant research and the contribution it can make to policy formulation and legislative deliberations.  This is a case in point, where university research actually informs policy making.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said the Bill is technical and does not lend itself easily to the normal Second Stage speech of principles and so on.  For all that, it is important legislation.  It honours commitments in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the Programme for a Partnership Government in relation to amendments to unfair dismissals legislation. This Bill is the first major range of amendments in the 16 year existence of the principal Act.  Any legislation will have its imperfections.  Clearly it is valid to monitor legislation and the imperfections and shortcomings of this legislation are no exception.  The Bill goes a long way to meet the shortcomings that have emerged over the last 16 years in the operation of the Act.</P>
    <P>In the time available, I will not go into every provision in detail.  The scope of the Bill is extended.  The question of the abuse of fixed term and specified purpose contracts is addressed.  I welcome the extension of categories covered: the Bill deals with the question of redress and in particular the amount of monetary compensation and the enforcement of awards and procedural issues.</P>
    <P>With the prevous speaker, I am glad temporary health board officers are included in this legislation.  Nurses, doctors and paramedical staff of health boards are temporary officers who did not have any cover in the event of dismissal. They were not covered by Civil Service procedures or the Unfair Dismissals Act; they had no recourse.  Hardship was caused in these cases and inequality was evident.  This issue is tackled in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, temporary agency workers are usually in one occupation or another for short periods.  The Minister <Col N="549" /> stated she would be concerned where this exceeds one year, as it sometimes does.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Or one contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Or one contract which may be even longer than a year. The hiring company, or the organisation, is the hirer.  I am not fond of that term, but it is used in American literature and practice.  The hirer, the person who pays the temporary agency employee, would now be liable in this case.  There may be scope for teasing that out on Committee Stage but I agree with the thrust of what the Minister has in mind.</P>
      <P>Fixed term and specified purpose contracts may suit employers and employees, depending on the circumstances.  In a university context, often a specified purpose contract may have to do with a particular piece of research.  For the research assistant that may mean a valuable development opportunity.  That person may want to move on after the completion of that project and their prospects could be enhanced by that process.  The Minister is saying it is fine if it suits both sides, but the Bill addresses where the fixed contract and its renewal is used to avoid the conditions of the legislation.</P>
      <P>I listened with great interest to what Senator Neville said from first hand experience.  In relation to fixed term and fixed contracts, people have used their discretion in totting up the periods of these contracts and giving the benefit. The Bill makes it a legal requirement to do this in future.  It is reinforced and that is good.</P>
      <P>With regard to the illegality of contracts, generally speaking employers play by the rules and deduct tax, pay it to the Revenue and do the same for PRSI, but where under-the-counter arrangements occur, that could be used by an employer to say this contract was illegal.  In so doing, the employer may attempt to escape the provisions of the Bill.  That is most unfair and since fairness is a common theme, I welcome the provision in the Bill whereby the reporting arrangement to the Revenue Commissioners would apply in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> I welcome the inclusion of sexual orientation as an additional category covered by unfair dismissal legislation.  It is both reasonable and valid.</P>
    <P>Reinstatement, re-engagement and compensation are the three main forms of award the tribunal can make.  Which, type of redress should apply has been a bone of contention in practice.  The tribunal has the obligation to ask the employer and the employee which redress is appropriate.  In general, employees would like their job back, unless there is a complete breakdown in the relationship.  The employer normally prefers compensation, monetary or otherwise.  That brings one to the question of how much money should be paid. I will address that in a moment.</P>
    <P>Where an employee desires to have the job back, the relationship can be badly broken down; there could be an alleged theft which may make a reinstatement inappropriate.  I welcome the sharper focus in the Bill on the rationale as to which form of award will be made.  That is a discipline for the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the very small compensation sums involved. It is true to say where compensation is the award, it is normally low.  This is not necessarily the fault of the tribunal.  It is due to the principal Act and its operation. A maximum compensation payment of two years gross will continue, but in practice to get the equivalent of two years gross pay is unusual.  The computation used is to deduct tax and social welfare contributions from gross pay; the net figure after that is very small.  I have no difficulty in agreeing with the Minister.</P>

    <Title>Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill, 1993: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point that while compensation is a very common form of award in cases of unfair dismissal, the actual sums awarded tend to be low and, therefore, I welcome the Bill's provision to exclude from the calculation deductions for income tax and social welfare or, as the Minister put it, to disregard these sums.  I do not think that is going to be very expensive for employers.  At present &mdash; and these figures I have extracted are reasonable examples &mdash; the average compensation awarded in 1989 was £3,232, in 1990 it was £3,600 and in 1991 £2,660, so we are not talking about big money.  Therefore, I welcome the new method of computing the basic award which disregards tax and social welfare.</P>
      <P>With regard to reinstatement and re-engagement the best I can derive from the figures for the three years for 1989 to 1991 is that 30 per cent of the awards were of the reinstatement/re-engagement category.  There is also an interesting provision in the case of an employee who has been dismissed but receives no financial award &mdash; let us say they get a job immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Sadly, not at all often.  Nonetheless it is important to address this possibility in the Bill because such unfairly dismissed employees receive no financial compensation even though their position may be vindicated. I welcome the provision for payment of up to four weeks pay in a case of this kind, where there is no actual financial loss.</P>
      <P>With regard to the emphasis on fair procedures I listened with interest to Senator Neville.  The theme of fairness runs right through Bunreacht na hÉireann.  Since fair procedures are a fundamental requirement, reinforcing that in the Bill is a good thing provided that the tribunal exercises objective judgment.  There is the risk, I concede, of becoming overly legalistic.  The law is not always suited to the realities of interpersonal relationships and should be used as sparingly as possible while at the same time recognising the importance of rights in law in unfair dismissals cases.</P>
      <P>Enforcement is, in practice, another bone of contention and the strengthening of the powers of the tribunal and of the Circuit Court in this regard is welcome, as is the simplification envisaged by the Act.</P>
      <P>I have spoken about the reinforcement of procedural matters already, but we may well debate that further on Committee Stage.  With regard to time limits for the submission of cases, the six month limit was unreasonably short.  It can take quite some time to sort out all the details for the commencement of proceedings and extending this time limit to one year brings it into line with redundancy and equality arrangements.  There may be good reason for delays and an additional six months is a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look forward to discussing the Bill in greater detail on Committee Stage &mdash; it is the type of Bill that lends itself to that.  The existing Act has worked well, in general.  The Minister referred to organisational flexibility and while flexibility is important, as legislators we need to hold centre stage to see both sides of the question and the Bill achieves that admirably. Many lessons have been learned during <Col N="553" /> the 16 years since the 1977 Act but its amendment is now necessary and I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's initiation of this legislation in the Seanad which is particularly suited to amending legislation.  The Bill will get a fair hearing on all Stages which it would not receive in the other House, which operates differently from this one.  A Bill amending existing legislation is always difficult to deal with and it is important that Senators are allowed to speak on Second Stage.  It is not my intention to use my full 30 minutes but I will allow other Senators to get involved.  I will confine detailed comment to Committee Stage on which I will move a number of amendments.</P>
      <P>The Minister can take a bow for her progressive move in including the sexual orientation of an employee as unfair ground for dismissal.  It is critical that that provision be enshrined in legislation.  I welcome the move as a small step on the road to social tolerance.  The Minister can take the kudos for it; we on the independent benches appreciate it.  We have been calling for its inclusion in legislation for a long time.  As general secretary of a teacher's union whose members are worried about this possibility, I am glad this provision will soon be law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traditionally I comment on the drafting of legislation and I always do some gender-cleansing.  I compliment the people who drafted this legislation.  It is written in non-sexist language which is very welcome.  Time and again I have had to change legislation.  However, on this occasion I have to say that even Homer nods because there is one section on which I know the draftspersons and the Minister will be pleased to accept an amendment.  On age 9, line 35, section 7 (4) (b) (II) reads &ldquo;that he objects to the claim being heard by a Rights Commissioner&rdquo;. I wish I had not found it, but it is there and I will be proposing that we replace it with &ldquo;the Party objects ...&rdquo; It is the exception that proves the rule.  The draftspersons have done an extraordinarily <Col N="554" /> good job in regard to non-sexist language in this legislation.  It is very important that sexist language be taken out of legislation.  This Bill is the best example that I have seen in my time in this House.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that the issue of travellers has been included in this legislation.  In the debate on the incitement to hatred legislation to which the Minister referred and which was also introduced in this House, or at least there was a long debate on Committee Stage on it, Members on these benches put forward a proposal.  Either Senator Norris or myself put forward a proposal that it would include travellers and sexual orientation.  At that time the Minister of the day refused to accept it.  It went to the other House, was accepted there and came back here.  We certainly followed this point through on many occasions.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on record, as a trade union official, that this meets many of the demands we have been seeking over the past 15 or 16 years.  It is progressive, positive and effective legislation.  I will be proposing amendments but I do not want that to take from the honest, first reaction to the legislation that it is progressive and balanced and will be welcomed in many places.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister that there is a problem that employers are not aware of legislation.  We know that ignorance is no excuse in the eyes of the law.  It is important that employers become aware of what they can and cannot do and what constitutes unfair dismissal.  There is a need for employer organisations to bring to the attention of their members what is possible under the law and what is not possible.  It is in everybody's best interest, trade unions and employers, that knowledge be freely available.  It is important that people know what the law is and realise they are subject to the law.  There is an extraordinary belief that the law does not apply to small employers in the same way as to large employers.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased with the section which addresses the question of continuing contracts of employment.  I have a vested interest in that subject <Col N="555" /> because a large group of members of my union are subject to one year contracts in the education service as temporary teachers.  I will be looking with great interest to see how I might extend the proposal in this legislation to that area to ensure at least a right to permanency, in certain situations, for such people.  It does not directly affect the Minister but she knows the convoluted way I approach even the most simple issue.</P>

      <P>This legislation will give confidence to workers.  There will be a levelling of the playing pitch, maintaining a balance.  I will keep stating that as I know there will be objections from other places over the next number of months. I ask the Minister to hold her nerve on this legislation in regard to the matters I mentioned.</P>
      <P>I regret the exclusion in the Bill of the Garda and the Army.  It has a damaging effect on the morale of any group of workers.  I represent a group of workers, and this also applies to the Garda and Army, who are excluded from access to the Labour Court under the terms of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.  I believe it was an accident of the time because when the legislation was going through the House in 1946 my union was involved in major demonstrations on the streets of Dublin.  There was a row about conciliation and arbitration and it was just simply a factor brought into the debate because of what was happening on the streets during that week.  I have regretted that ever since and, even though I was not around at the time, it is something which has worried me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe others should also worry about the status of employment of the Garda and the Army.  They are entitled to the same conditions of service, support services and access points as other groups.  That has been the tradition.  They were late into conciliation and arbitration process but they are a group of workers <Col N="556" /> who must have access.  Members will recall that in recent years a high-ranking member of the Garda took a case against the Government relating to unfair dismissal. It applies to people in different walks of life.</P>
    <P>I noted that in presenting the Bill the Minister did not make any attempt to explain why they were excluded.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments on the matter.  We can deal with the exclusions.  For example, if somebody is dismissed on the basis of a court-martial finding that could be considered an exclusion.  It is easy to deal with specific aspects like that.  There are decent, hardworking people in the Garda and the Army.  They are workers like all the rest of us, they are paid a wage or salary and they deserve the support of the law, particularly when it is so much part of their job to uphold the law.  They are also entitled to redress under the law if they think they have a sense of grievance.</P>
    <P>In the definition section there is a new definition of trade union.  I am always worried about new definitions particularly when they might refer to myself. It has now been restricted to Part II of the Trade Union Act, 1941 whereas in the previous legislation it referred to the Trade Union Act, 1941 and the Trade Union Act, 1971.  There might be a good reason for changing it and I would like to hear it.  It has been allowed to remain unchanged in other sections of the principal Act and I want to know why it has been changed in one place and not the other.  Section 14 (3) of the principal Act refers to &ldquo;a trade union or accepted body under the Trade Union Acts, 1941 and 1971&rdquo;.  There may be a good reason for this and perhaps the Minister will deal with the matter in her reply.</P>
    <P>When I read legislation I always worry about the tricks of those drafting legislation, the kind of saving clause thrown in, for example, &ldquo;as and when resources are made available&rdquo;.  In this Bill in section 2 (3) we read: &ldquo;In this Act the reference to any enactment shall unless the context otherwise requires...&rdquo;.  That is a very handy phrase to use but I want to know <Col N="557" /> the reason for it or else I will seek to have it removed.</P>
    <P>I am utterly confused about section 3 (a).  I spent a long time trying to get used to Bills when I came into this House, to working out the difference between Parts, sections, subsections, paragraphs and sub-paragraphs and I have a good grasp of it at this stage.  Can somebody tell me what Roman numerals I and II and A and B in section 3 (a) are called? They are not Parts, sections, subsections, paragraphs or sub-paragraphs.  I would like to know how to refer to them when discussing that section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill, deals with the situation where there is a lock-out.  It is important that this issue be dealt with, and it is dealt with very well in the section.  I hope it improves the situation. I am not clear about the &ldquo;and&rdquo; and the &ldquo;or&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the validity of your ruling.  Unfortunately, I know too much to disagree with you on the matter. I have made the point and I will be referring to it as I go along.</P>
      <P>Regarding section 5, the idea of covering three of four different options at the same time has been dealt with very effectively in the Bill.  I hope it works and that people understand the way it has been set out to work.  It is very complicated and it is very important.  Regarding section 6 it is impossible to describe what it is like to go through an unfair dismissals process with a worker who feels an extraordinary sense of grievance.  It is important to recognise that it concerns more than money.  It is about dignity and putting the record right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> I welcome the section which allows compensation even where there is no monetary loss to be compensated.  I presume that is the thinking behind that section as it will apply where a person gains immediate further employment or where there is no monetary loss because a person is drawing social welfare.  It is very important.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the statement in that same section where the conduct of the employee can be taken into consideration. If we are seeking fairness on all sides it is good that these things should be examined in order to achieve balance. As a trade union official I have no difficulty with that.  Either a case is right or it is wrong and it is not a case of pulling the wool over anybody's eyes.  It is important that everything is on the table for discussion.  It is also important for the reason I have outlined, that the statement should contain the basis for redress.  That will be welcomed by all sides and by anybody who has ever worked on an unfair dismissals case.  The fact that there will be a reason given is very welcome. However a person feels about the final outcome, they will now have a clear indication of the reasons for the decision, and that is very important.  I also like something that runs through the legislation and that is that the onus to do the paper work has been taken from the employee and passed to the Tribunal or the employer.  It is amazing how many cases have been technically out of order because the paperwork was not sent somewhere at the right time or time ran out.  I welcome the move to have this matter addressed.</P>
    <P>In terms of the amendments to section 8 of the principal Act, I have some difficulty with subsection (4).  In deference to the Cathaoirleach I will not go into detail on it but there should be power to seek implementation on foot of a statement from the tribunal.  A person goes through a process and there is subsequently a determination.  The determination is then sent to the employer to be implemented, whether it is reinstatement or a cheque, and the employer ignores it.  Very often this is the first <Col N="559" /> reaction because this is somebody who has been involved in an unfair dismissal anyway.  It seems daft that the whole rigmarole has to be set up again and a full resitting had to seek the implementation of the determination.  That surely should not be necessary.  It should be possible for that to be done on foot of a letter from the Tribunal, that the Tribunal would simply state that the determination needs to be implemented. I look forward to teasing that out and to hearing the Minister's response.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the words &ldquo;as respects&rdquo; in the last paragraph on page 9.  Perhaps it is legal terminology I am not aware of.  However, when I do not understand something I have the habit of pushing it to the limit.  It seems to have the meaning of &ldquo;in respect of&rdquo; but I look forward to finding out its meaning.</P>
    <P>The reference to the Income Tax Acts and the Social Welfare Acts will be welcomed by people on all sides.  I always felt that it was an irrelevance.  The requirement in the principal Act to seek employment, to make every attempt to seek employment and to gain compensation in one way or another is good and positive.  What is being done in this legislation to negate the effects of social welfare is very important.  I welcome the subsection which requires the Rights Commissioner or the tribunal to indicate to the Revenue Commissioners any practices they come across in the course of their investigations which are in contravention of the Revenue Commissioners' regulations, because this is the way the public service should operate. They should make the private sector do the tax collecting, and make it aware of the needs of the Revenue Commissioners. This way the State saves money.  This will put a lot of pressure on people to get their houses in order.</P>
    <P>There are a number of aspects of the principal Act to which I will return on Committee Stage.  In deference to the Cathaoirleach, it would be inappropriate for me to go into them at this stage.  I notice, for instance, in the new legislation that, in the case of a winding up or a <Col N="560" /> liquidation of a company outstanding amounts due to a person as compensation for an unfair dismissal or in other cases which might arise from this legislation are made priority payments.  I recall that under section 9 of the Companies Act the amounts due to the Revenue Commissioners have priority, they have first claim.  That legislation also outlines a priority list of the people who have first call on money.  If it were a public company where there were certain types of debenture capital, or shareholders or others were owed money, is there a conflict there?  In my reading of the Bill it seems there is and I would be happy to find there was no conflict.  It seems there is something there which needs to be examined and clarified.  The words used in the principal Act is that it would be in priority to all other debts and I am not sure that that is enforceable under the current legislation.</P>
    <P>I have gone through aspects of the legislation bit by bit and I accept the Cathaoirleach's ruling that, perhaps, I was examining it in too much detail; that will be for Committee Stage.  This is legislation which improves the conditions of workers and it allows fair and honest employers to have a level playing pitch against the cowboy operators.  It goes some way towards ensuring that there is a level playing pitch when it comes to the tax arrangements of companies and for the first time it brings sexual orientation under the umbrella of what constitutes an unfair dismissal under the 1977 Act. It also includes the position of travellers but does not include other issues.  The Minister's statement referred to parental status.  Could she tell us why she did not consider including that in the Bill because the issue has arisen occasionally?</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Bill makes life easier in the area of casual labour.  It will give hope to people in that area, whether it is the post office, teaching, RTE or the private sector.  It will give hope to people who have been put off permanent employment by the repeated use of contract employment to keep everybody on <Col N="561" /> their toes, in other words, threatening them with the loss of their jobs.</P>
    <P>This is a job well done and I compliment the Department, the Minister and those responsible for introducing it. I say these nice words so that we can have decent arguments on Committee Stage when I suggest changes.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister. The Bill is in line with the promise in the Programme for a Partnership Government and commitments given under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  It does not propose any major changes.</P>
      <P>The Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, brought about significant changes to protect workers covered under the Act.  Prior to that, non-union people had no protection. This Bill also gives protection to minority and disadvantaged groups.  The Government is committed to the review of labour legislation to give protection to a number of disadvantaged groups against discrimination on grounds of religion, handicap, race or sexual orientation.</P>
      <P>As a trade union official I concur with many of Senator O'Toole's remarks. When a worker is dismissed it has a terrible effect on his life, his livelihood and his family.  It is one of the most frustrating things that could happen to anybody. Loss of wages badly affects his living standard. It often results in temporary or long term unemployment.  The link with the work-place is broken and valuable skills and work experience are lost.  For that reason it is a depressing future for anybody to face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1982 it was estimated that one-fifth of the workforce did not come within the scope of the Act.  Since 1992, with the growth of part-time, temporary and casual employment, the figure is much higher so more protection for all workers is necessary and the Bill goes some way <Col N="562" /> to achieving that.  What is the reality, on a day to day basis, of the unfair dismissals legislation for industrial relations practitioners? The realities are avoiding unfair dismissals with compensation and re-employment.</P>
    <P>Some questions must be asked.  Are there certain circumstances in which claims arise?  Are unfair dismissals claims a serious industrial relations problem when considered in the light of the number of notified redundancies and the current disturbing operating climate for business?  Are persons claiming unfair dismissals successful in terms of getting their jobs back or in levels of compensation obtained?  The figures do not seem to bear out that they are successful in getting their jobs back.  Most cases end up with compensation.  What should the reaction of the industrial relations practitioner be, whether he or she is a trade union official or on the management side of the table?</P>
    <P>A review of the annual reports of the Employment Appeals Tribunal for the years 1988 to 1991 as well as a perusal of the records of the tribunal for 1992 provide an insight into the current daily reality of the system.  The record of the Employment Appeals Tribunal reveals that claims for unfair dismissals arise in about as many ways as there are employment relationships.  On average the tribunal deals with 900 unfair dismissals cases a year whereas Rights Commissioners hear about 120 such cases.</P>
    <P>Some may regard it as heretical even to ask the question, are unfair dismissals a serious industrial relations problem? On the broad scale of the problems facing Irish business in 1993 &mdash; unstable exchange rates, astronomical interest rates, over 300,000 people unemployed &mdash; the answer is no.  Set beside notified redundancies averaging 15,000 a year the answer is again no.  Unfair dismissal claims run at just over 1,000 a year on the basis of the combined Employment Appeals Tribunal Rights Commissioners figures.  Taking the Employment Appeals Tribunal awards over the period 1988 to 1991, the average yearly sum payable on foot of awards is £421,000.  That is not a <Col N="563" /> high sum set against the wages bill for Irish industry.  Allowing for the add on costs of legal fees, management time and out of court settlements, the annual cost is still relatively insignificant depending on the industry size.</P>
    <P>This, one will admit, is a contentious view.  It is put forward because in some instances the industrial relations practitioner will be operating in such an environment. It is far from being the whole answer.  While the numbers involved may be small and the sums of money insignificant, the problems for the individuals concerned may be traumatic.  As far as the organisation is concerned, if the contentious view was to prevail the result could be a disgruntled workforce, leading to consequent disruption.  The pre-1977 Act industrial dispute figures bear this out.</P>
    <P>The true answer is that it is a serious industrial relations problem, even if masked by the current problems facing Irish industry.  Judging the success-failure ratio against three criteria &mdash; success in having the claim allowed, success in getting the job back and success in obtaining financial compensation &mdash; employees who allege that they are unfairly dismissed can hardly feel encouraged to pursue claims.  Again a perusal of the tables shows the yearly details.  The figures for 1992 are not yet available but inquiries give no reason to believe they alter the picture.</P>
    <P>One in five claimants is successful in having a claim allowed and one in four is unsuccessful.  These stark conclusions are, perhaps, distorted as 60 per cent of all claims are withdrawn before or during hearing.  The outcome of these withdrawn cases can only be known to the parties but, if experience is any guide, many end up with the claimant receiving monetary compensation but not re-employment. Nevertheless, the success-failure ratio can only be judged in absolute terms.  A success ratio of 20 per cent can only be regarded as failure on the part of claimants.</P>
    <P>There is debate as to whether the objective of an unfair dismissal claim <Col N="564" /> should be re-employment or compensation. In the light of the compensation figures and considering the present state of the employment market, re-employment &mdash; and for this exercise the difference between re-engagement and reinstatement does not matter &mdash; would seem to be the correct objective. Over the years 1988 to 1991 out of 3,500 claimants only 202 got their jobs back, a mere 6 per cent of the total.</P>
    <P>The average compensation paid to claimants who are successful in having their claims allowed is not such as to encourage any but the most determined to pursue a claim.  Over the previous four years there have been only three awards in excess of £30,000 and only one exceeded £40,000.  The average award over the same four years was £3,149 and nothing in a review of the 1992 cases reveals a change in this trend.</P>
    <P>It will be said that the tribunal can only award a claimant compensation not exceding 104 weeks' remuneration.  It will also be said that the award is compensation for the actual financial loss suffered and not damages.  Taking the average wage for male workers at £270 per week and for females £160 per week, it is of interest to note from 1991 figures that only five claimants were awarded £10,000 and only one between £7,000 and £10,000.  In the same year 14 successful claimants received awards of between £401 and £500; 28 were awarded in the range of £1,001 to £2,000.  This may represent a fair assessment of the compensation to which the dismissed employeee was entitled.  For those who consider themselves unfairly dismissed and are involved in the hassle of pursuing a claim these figures provide food for thought.  According to the figures compensation seems to be the norm.</P>
    <P>This is a modest Bill that will benefit all sides.  It will create a balance between employers and employees.  The Minister said discussion is better than confrontation. That comment is appropriate and timely for those in industry and it is a pity it is not applied more often.  I do not agree that the provisions of the Bill hinder employment creation and the figures <Col N="565" /> available support my view.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I would like to express my delight that the Seanad has been given the opportunity to initiate this legislation. It is a worth-while Bill and I am glad to speak in the debate.  I express regret that there are not more Members present for the initiation of the Bill; I hope that will be rectified at the later Stages of the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill covers substantive and technical matters and it is in essence a review of the unfair dismissals legislation introduced in 1977.  It is important to point out that this amending Bill is necessary because of defects in the legislation which have come to light over the years.  This Bill fulfils a promise expressed in the Programme for a Partnership Government and what was agreed in section 9 of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  This legislation is close to my heart as a Labour Party Senator.  It is a valuable addition to the protection of employees.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains 17 sections, each of which are important in their own right.  I refer to section 5 which adds to existing legislation, that a dismissal is deemed automatically unfair if based on the race, colour or, for the first time, sexual orientation of the employee.  As far as I am aware this is the first time that phrase has been used in legislation and it augurs well for future legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an aspect of the Bill which, by virtue of its sexual connotations, has attracted media attention to the exclusion of other equally important issues in the legislation.  For example, section 13 extends the scope of the unfair dismissals legislation to cover those employed through employment agencies.  Prior to the Bill a worker who procured employment through an agency was deemed to be employed by that agency and had to look to the agency for compensation if unfairly dismissed by the organisation for whom he or she worked.  That did not make sense and it did not take into consideration that an individual would have worked for different employers through <Col N="566" /> the same agency.  The change in this section is welcome.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (2) (a) is also important.  This allows a claim for redress up to 12 months where exceptional circumstances have prevented the lodgment of a claim. Through my work as a solicitor I realise that many people are unaware of their rights in this regard.  They go through a traumatic period having been dismissed and it is often too late before they realise that they can initiate this move through the Rights Commissioners or the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  It is necessary that this six month period be extended to 12 months.  I welcome that provision in the legislation.</P>
    <P>While I believe there is a lot lacking in this legislation in relation to unfair dismissals, there are several matters to which I would like to refer, for example, the use of the contract of employment which protects the employee.  It clarifies matters for both employer and employee with regard to their respective duties and rights.  Yet, such contracts are not widely used.  People are often employed on the basis of a verbal agreement and when problems arise at a later stage there is no written documentation to back up one's position.  There should be more emphasis on the use of contracts of employment in written form so that matters are clarified and each party knows where they stand with regard to their rights.</P>
    <P>Another point which was referred to by Senator O'Toole is the lack of information and knowledge available to employees and employers regarding the rights and duties of both parties.  It would be helpful if the Department would consider putting together a booklet which would spell out the basic floor of rights which apply to both parties and some simple procedures as to where one goes when dismissed.  It would help in making people aware of what measures can be taken when the situation arises.  In the long run it would act as a precautionary measure and thus avoid having to take matters to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole when he recommended that the legislation needs <Col N="567" /> to cover the Defence Forces.  I understand they are, of necessity, in a special position but they are entitled to some protection in law.  I accept the legislation may need to be amended to deal with their case.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak on the rights of apprentices, something which has not been mentioned.  I worked as an apprentice solicitor for several years before qualifying and legislation is needed to deal with this area of work.  An apprentice is now protected with regard to trade union matters, but this legislation should also apply to them.  It is a matter that needs to be considered.</P>
    <P>The legislation does not cover a situation where notice is served on an employee.  If an employee accepts that notice he or she is deemed to have resigned his or her post when, in fact, they have been dismissed.  That matter must be dealt with.  There is an anomaly here the Bill could have covered and perhaps it can still be considered.</P>
    <P>Something which has not been mentioned so far is the right of a former employee to a reference.  As I know from experience, that poses a number of problems for some employees.  There should be legislation to cover that issue and give the ex-worker an entitlement to a reference following a hearing.  It is a requirement in this day and age and it is not provided for in this legislation.</P>
    <P>With reference to the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 businesses have evolved a procedure with regard to dismissal. In many cases they have adopted the procedure whereby the worker is given an initial caution and the right to a hearing. Several procedures have evolved over time to deal with what may be a dismissal and in many cases it has helped to avoid dismissals.  That is helpful and should be encouraged where possible.  It should be provided for in legislation.</P>
    <P>Every section of this Bill deserves attention because each has an important role to play.  Each section refers to areas of reform that were seen as necessary while operating the original unfair dismissals legislation.  Section 3, for <Col N="568" /> example, allows the Rights Commissioner to examine subsequent fixed term contracts and fixed purpose contracts. It prevents an employer avoiding the unfair dismissals legislation by using a fixed term contract which would be reintroduced at a later stage.  A Rights Commissioner can now decide if he or she sees a second fixed term contract coming through that it has been used to get round the unfair dismissals legislation. This is another important amendment to the legislation.</P>
    <P>In section 4 we see a lock-out can now be deemed to be a dismissal and legislation in relation to unfair dismissals automatically applies to that.  That should be the case in fairness and I welcome that change.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to section 5 and the matter of sexual orientation being considered for the first time as unfair grounds for dismissal.  This section reinforces the concept of procedural fairness by providing that the Rights Commissioner, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Circuit Court can have regard to the reasonableness of the employer's behaviour.  Senator O'Toole said that the matter did not take account of the conduct of the employee but that is automatically considered in the legislation itself.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is important and provides for a basic financial award for unfair dismissals in certain circumstances.  Compensation is normally only payable where one is deemed to have suffered a financial loss.  A person may be dismissed and, unusually, happens to find a new job on the next working day.  No financial loss is suffered yet she or he has been unfairly dismissed.  This legislation allows such a person to claim compensation for the first time and that is a necessary provision.</P>
    <P>Under section 6 (2) (c) referred to earlier by Senator Hillery, the system of calculating financial loss on payments to the employee will now disregard any payments made under the social welfare and income tax codes.  That is necessary because the system for calculating payments is complicated.  I have a major problem with the fact that compensation <Col N="569" /> payments are still not sufficient under the present regulations and do not deter an employer from deliberately dismissing an employee on the grounds that it is financially more rewarding for him or her to do so.  In section 7, we see that from now on the Rights Commissioner, in awarding reinstatement, re-engagement or financial compensation, which are the three remedies available for unfair dismissal, must state why the other two forms of redress were not awarded.  In many cases people may say the reason is understood, but it needs to be spelt out. This section places an onus on the tribunal to decide why an option such as reinstatement is not possible and, therefore, will help to detect where the blame lies.</P>
    <P>Under section 7 (2) (b) a person now has 12 months to initiate a claim for unfair dismissal.  This extension is valuable because it brings the situation into line with other legislation.  Six months was an extremely short period and in practice excluded many worthwhile claimants, who found themselves out of work but did not initiate, or have the knowledge to initiate, a claim.  There is also a time limit now for objections by a party to the hearing of a claim by a rights commissioner. Under the 1977 legislation one could object to a hearing, but the new time limit is worthwhile because it helps to speed up procedures towards a swift conclusion which benefits all parties concerned.</P>
    <P>The Employment Appeals Tribunal can under section 7 (4) issue a determination confirming the recommendation of a rights commissioner in circumstances where the employer concerned has not implemented the decision of the tribunal.  I query the point of going through the same procedure again?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate being given the opportunity to air my views on this important legislation.  Section 7 (11) prevents an employer using under the table payments to an employee as an excuse, or a way of avoiding the legislation, when that employee is subsequently unfairly dismissed.  I welcome that and the fact that it will be reported to the relevant bodies.  That will make employers more aware of the fact that they cannot avoid the scope of legislation in the way they have sought to do to date.</P>
      <P>Section 10 allows flexibility to an employee to change his or her claim as regards taking it through the Rights Commissioner, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or directly to the courts.  That is necessary because it could transpire at a later stage that a case may have been more suited to a particular hearing.  This amendment will allow a person decide whether their claim belongs before the Tribunal or should be dealt with under common law for wrongful dismissal, through the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 provides an avenue of appeal to the Circuit Court regarding the determination of the tribunal.  Where an <Col N="571" /> employer fails to implement an order of the Circuit Court or a determination of the tribunal which has not been appealed, the employee or the Minister can apply to the Circuit Court for an order directing the employer to implement that determination. That measure is necessary if we are to take this legislation seriously. There is no point in having this legislation if an employer can flout it deliberately and ignore orders made by the relevant court or tribunal.  That worth-while procedure must be followed up on and be seen to be acted upon, and not simply exist on paper.  The Minister must make sure that employers are not allowed to flout this law.</P>
    <P>I note that if an employer decided not to pay out compensation awarded, interest would be payable on the award as a deterrent.  The court can change an award from reinstatement or re-engagement to financial compensation where the original determination by the tribunal for reinstatement, for example, has not been implemented.  That is necessary because only at that stage will it become known whether re-employment or reinstatement is a real option.  In those circumstances the order should be changed to allow for a direct payment of financial compensation.  I would stress, however, that compensation payments are not sufficient and do not deter an employer from unfairly dismissing an employee who must have been employed for at least a year for the legislation to apply to him or her.</P>
    <P>There is a flaw in such legislation where only between 20 and 25 cases order reinstatement or re-engagement.  On that basis we must look more seriously at the levels of financial compensation payable. The increases in the legislation to date are not significant as the chances of a person, deemed by the court or the EAT to have been unfairly dismissed, of getting a new job are slight.  On that basis, the compensation is not sufficient and must be looked at seriously.</P>
    <P>Apart from that criticism, I welcome the legislation although there are several areas not covered in it.  I will welcome <Col N="572" /> discussion on it at a later stage.  This legislation is much needed and I am pleased it is being introduced in this House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill is being initiated in the Seanad and congratulate the Minister for agreeing to do so.  I am delighted to see her in a new role because I recall many useful discussions on legislation when she served as Minister in other Departments. Her commitment to the Seanad has always been one of facilitating Members.</P>
      <P>The Bill is very technical.  It is a Committee Stage Bill, and that was made clear by Senator O'Toole's contribution.  It is a Bill which will require detailed discussion at Committee Stage.  Therefore I will not be using all my time on Second Stage.  I have listened to Senators' contributions and there is nothing with which I fundamentally disagree and I do not want to engage in repetition.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the two previous speakers, both members of the Labour Party, it occurred to me that a little history in relation to this could be useful. The Unfair Dismissals Bill was also introduced by a Labour Minister, former Deputy Michael O'Leary, in late 1977. At that time, the Labour Party were in coalition with my party.  In so far as the Minister was generous in her praise of the effect and value of the 1977 legislation, I accept that praise on behalf my party's involvement in initiating it.</P>

      <P>I have one small technical point to raise.  The Bill is entitled &ldquo;An Act to amend and extend the Unfair Dismissal Acts of 1977 and 1991,...&rdquo; I have difficulty finding the 1991 Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1977 legislation is a milestone in labour relations.  The figures quoted by the Minister indicate the value of that legislation.  It created better relations between management and labour and established fair treatment for employees.  In so far as this legislation improves the 1977 Act, I welcome it.</P>
      <P>In legislation of this type, it is important that the position of employers is also considered.  We must recognise that it is crucial to maintain a balance. Senator Hillery said that the responsibility and duty of legislators was to hold centre stage and maintain the balance between different interests.  If I did detect &mdash; it might be mistakenly &mdash; an anti-employer voice in some contributions, I want to reject it.  I admit that some employers have caused problems but it is wrong to generalise.</P>
      <P>It is important that we are fair to all sides and we must recognise that, with 300,000 unemployed, no unnecessary barrier should be created that would affect employment creation.  I want to know what consultation the Minister has had with employers organisations and what their attitude is to this because they obviously have a position on it.  The Minister stated that she had consultations with IBEC; she might develop on the content of those consultations in her reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is always a risk that, if one takes a certain line or appears to be less than supportive, one is considered to be anti-worker. That is not my purpose.  My purpose in raising questions is to ensure there is balance in the legislation.  I am an employer admittedly on a small scale, and I have never dismissed an employee. I have one person employed since 1970 and another was in my employment for 23 <Col N="574" /> years and retired recently.  I have always believed in team spirit.  It is important that employees share in the success and achievement in any enterprise in which they are engaged.  Where that attitude exists difficulties rarely arise, and it is possible to achieve that attitude in any enterprise large or small.</P>
    <P>I am aware that employees have been badly treated and that there has been need for this legislation.  I do not dispute that.  However, I am also aware that some employers are unwilling to take on extra workers.  Among the reasons being advanced for this, rightly or wrongly, are the constraints imposed by labour legislation. The prevailing attitude for the past ten to 15 years has been that it is a progressive move to replace a worker by a machine.  That has been a fundamental mistake in our approach to employment. State policy has encouraged that kind of development by grant aiding the installation of machinery or equipment that displaces workers, while penalising labour-intensive industries through taxation policies that discourage employer and employee alike.  That policy is still being implemented today.</P>
    <P>I have made these general observations in the interest of balance.  Along with other Senators who spoke, I welcome section 5 of the Bill, which extends the scope of section 6 (2) (e) of the principal Act to include sexual orientation as an unfair reason for dismissal.  I will not repeat what has been said already, but I agree with the comments made and I congratulate the Minister for including that provision in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the inclusion of temporary health board officers within the legislation.  Other comments I have to make &mdash; and I am conscious that we are going to have a discussion on Committee State &mdash; relate to the possible negative effect of some sections.  I refer to them only in a general way to give the Minister advance notice of my concern and so that we may avoid prolonged discussion on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 6 extends the provision for payment of financial compensation, where a dismissed worker is replaced by another. <Col N="575" /> I understand this provision but I wish the Minister would comment on it in more detail.  I have difficulty understanding subsection (2) (a).  I am unclear about what it proposes.  Section 7, encompasses many matters.  There is provision under subsection (4) (a), permitting a tribunal to reach a conclusion without hearing the employer.  When a body, such as a tribunal, is adjudicating on a matter, it is in conflict with the principles of basic justice to deny one side the opportunity to present its case in full.  Therefore, I am concerned that the tribunal may reach a conclusion without hearing the argument on the employer's side.  Section 7 (11) and (12) are an attempt to deal with what is generally called the black economy.  If that is so, I would like the Minister to confirm it in her reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>My thoughts about what the provision might relate to have been confirmed.  I am concerned about section 13 and the position of employment agencies and employers arising from that. Responsibility is pinned on employers here, whether they are paying wages or not.  I noted that the Minister in her response to another Senator on this matter confirmed what I felt to be the position.  This provision is unsatisfactory and I hope to deal with it at greater length on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>We must be careful not to let unnecessary bureaucracy obstruct the creation of jobs.  That may not be the case here but it may arise in the context of section 13.</P>
      <P>The assessment of compensation, has been referred to by Senator O'Toole and Senator Gallagher.  I cannot reconcile myself with one part of their contribution. I am not disputing their interpretation but where no account is taken, for example, of social welfare payments received by an employee during the period for which compensation is being assessed there is an element of double payment in that situation.  A clawback provision is required in relation to such payments if my understanding of the section is correct.  Unless more thought is given to this aspect I visualise problems arising from the provisions of that section.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Bill that it is possible for employees to claim compensation under a number of headings &mdash; perhaps two or three.  They can initiate a claim under several headings and then elect to proceed under one heading only. In the meantime considerable costs may have been incurred by the employer in preparing a defence under two or three headings.  We should attempt to clear up this unsatisfactory matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My final question is in relation to illegal contracts.  That is my term, but the Minister knows what I am talking about.  In the provisions relating to illegal contracts it appears that balance is lacking since <Col N="577" /> greater shelter appears to be provided for the employee.  I suggest to the Minister that both parties should stand equal in relation to any transgressions with regard to the Revenue Commissioners. There is a certain lack of balance there.</P>
    <P>At one stage I said that a person who raised the questions I have raised would risk being accused of being anti-worker. I mentioned my own situation as an employer to show that was not my purpose. The purpose of this House and my reason for speaking is to ensure that we put balanced legislation through the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation with which I have no disagreement.  I have expressed my views solely for the purpose of improving the Bill.  I thank the Minister for initiating this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation and applaud the Minister for her initiative. It is enlightened legislation; indeed, many of our European partners do not have comparable legislation.</P>
      <P>Discrimination against minorities is vile; unfortunately it is part of living today.  In the context of the re-emergence of fascism in certain parts of central Europe and especially in Germany, the results from one of the Länders, the state of Hesse, in the past few days sent a shiver through those of us committed to democracy and parliamentary activity.  A party led by a former SS officer will now take its place in a parliamentary forum in a member state of the European Community. This officer, like his contemporaries, was responsible for locking up and executing many people on the grounds of religion, a well as the old, the infirm and the handicapped.  Those whom the Germans called the <i>Untermenschen</i>, the sub-humans; anyone who was not Germanic, who was the wrong colour or whose sexual orientation was considered abnormal, as well as people of certain national or ethnic origin, for example, gypsies, all suffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Irish context the people who are marginalised in our society are now acknowledged in this Bill.  I applaud the Minister for putting this legislation in an <Col N="578" /> historical context and in the context of what is happening in Europe today where we are sometimes disadvantaged because of our peripherality.  In other areas of life, particularly in the quality of life, we are sometimes better off than our European partners.  In enshrining these proposals in legislation we are making a statement as a people to our European neighbours and the world that we do not condone discriminatory measures against minorities.  For that reason alone I applaud the Minister for introducing this legislation.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased the Minister is introducing this legislation because it impinges to some degree on my professional activities as a broadcaster.  This area will now be covered under short term contracts and this is another aspect of the legislation. Although I have been broadcasting for approximately 15 years with RTE I have been on a short term contract all that time.  I am not and never have been a member of staff.  The contract has ranged from four to eight weeks, where it currently stands.  The fact that it is continuous means that when this legislation becomes law my position will be strengthened.  This legislation will also benefit people employed in RTE and the local media, school leavers and others who may be able to renew short term contracts for a further period.  They will come within the scope of this legislation.</P>

      <P>Yes, especially in this House.</P>
      <P>The definition of a part-time worker is something which also interests me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My contract states &mdash; and I am raising <Col N="579" /> this because it is relevant to the legislation &mdash; that I am employed for the duration of my broadcasting period on air.  It also says that I should make myself available for rehearsals and preparation time prior to going on air.  I am actually paid for being on air as well as the preparation time.  How does one define that work?  This applies also to many others in a similar position.  The hours are eight hours.  This is a definite improvement on the original 1977 Act, when it was 18 hours.</P>
    <P>This improvement &mdash; I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; caused a furious reaction among some employers at the time of its introduction. This would seem to suggest it was a step in the right direction.  In the context of the contract I have outlined to the Minister, I am curious to know if the eight hour rule will remain or if it will be further reduced. I only raise this question in the context of my own case.  Many of my colleagues are employed specifically for their time on air.  If I brought an unfair dismissal claim before the Employment Appeals Tribunal and argued that although I spend 30 to 45 minutes on air the actual time it takes in the overall context is over eight hours, would my employers reject this argument?  I know the law attempts to legislate for the majority and there will always be exceptions.</P>
    <P>I do not want to raise a political hare, but I notice that section 3 of the Bill makes provision to include temporary officers of health boards and deletes the obsolete reference to a committee of agriculture. Is this a political statement of intent?</P>

      <P>The abolition of the county committees of agriculture, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach and many of our colleagues in local authorities will know, has been a source of angst.  If this wording is now enshrined in the legislation it indicates that perhaps the county committees of agriculture have been consigned to the <Col N="580" /> dustbin of history.  As the Minister said, she is aware of the implications.</P>
      <P>Section 13 extends the scope of the unfair dismissals legislation to include persons employed through employment agencies.  At another time I was employed by an employment agency in London for four or five years.  I am an associate member of the Institute of Employment Agency Consultants and I am aware to some degree of the practice &mdash; especially in the nursing sector &mdash; where agencies employ people on what is called agency work.  I am pleased the legislation will now define that the organisation where the person works is deemed to be the employer of the agency worker. I know this caused some difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the increases in VAT announced in the budget which will adversely affect competitiveness and lead to further unemployment.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister who introduced the budget, the Minister for Finance, is not present to speak in this debate.  He had time yesterday to answer his critics; I thought he might had the courage to come here and listen to more of his critics in the Upper House.</P>
      <P>When the Minister delivered his Budget Statement on 24 February, I could not help but think of the shady used-cars dealers and their infamous three bridge guarantees.  At the lower end of the motor trade there is a well-known back street guarantee which is given to gullible customers when they purchase shoddy vehicles.  It is known as the three bridge guarantee.  The dealer undertakes to guarantee the car until the person is out of sight and after that it is up to the buyer to deal with any problems that may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> The Minister for Finance guaranteed us a budget designed to create and protect jobs.  We were told the mechanism was in place to protect employment, that the economy was like a fabulous engine finely tuned to create new employment and to eradicate the scourge of joblessness. To use the analogy of the car, before it reached the front gate of Leinster House there was a knock in the engine, the chassis was a little bent, the wheels began to come off and the Club of 22 were shouting on the front steps saying the budget would not protect jobs. A mere fortnight after its launch the budget is history and we have to pick up the pieces it has left in its wake.</P>
    <P>From 1 March 1993 there are three VAT rates which were announced in the budget, the zero rate, the 12.5 per cent rate and the 21 per cent rate.  I welcome the fact that the zero rate has remained. The 12.5 per cent and the 21 per cent rates are set to raise a total of £2.349 billion for the Government in 1993.  This amounts to 18 per cent of its total income of £12.941 billion, thereby taking a large percentage of potential spending out of the pockets of private citizens and into the quagmire of Government public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The logic underlining VAT rates, apart from the zero rate, has always been a mystery as far as the average consumer is concerned.  The system is riddled with imbalances and since 1 March 1993 we have a VAT regime which can fairly lay claim to being the worst in Europe.  I intend to point out a few of the anomalies.</P>
    <P>In 1991 the VAT rate on adult clothing and footwear stood at 12.5 per cent.  I am delighted to see Senator O'Kennedy here.  He was in the Government that imposed that rate and later increased it to 16 per cent.  The 1993 budget has brought the rate to 21 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This amounts to a 68 per cent increase in taxation since 1991.  This rate is now known as the luxury rate. <Col N="582" /> From 1 March there will be an extra £42 to pay on a suit of £200.  If a man wants to buy a pair of shoes at £30 he will pay £6.30 to the Government in extra VAT for the privilege of wearing the shoes.  Is a suit and a pair of shoes a luxury?  It is a pity the Minister is not here to tell us, because many hard pressed workers do not think they are a luxury.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1 March 1993 an extra £50 will be charged in VAT on a suit costing £200 and a pair of shoes costing £30, that is 20 per cent of the total cost.  That is economic madness.  It puts the 1982 budget into the ha'penny place. Certain persons in high places found it politically impossible to vote for the 1982 budget; however, they had no problem in supporting this savage measure in the 1993 budget.  How times have changed.</P>
      <P>The President of the Fashion and Footwear Federation, Mr. Louis Copeland, has stated that this VAT rise will be a disaster for the sector.  The chairman of Magee of Donegal Clothing Mr. Howard Temple, has warned that VAT increases will put hundreds of jobs in the industry at risk.  He has also warned it will lead to a return to cross-Border shopping and trade where the rate in Northern Ireland continues at 17.5 per cent.  The Minister and the Government took note of the price of beer over the Border but did not take note of the price of clothes.  As a result they went down one road to save jobs and down another to lose them.</P>
      <P>From 1 March, the Minister proposes to move the VAT rate from 10 to 12.5 per cent on a range of holiday and tourist activities.  These include letting of holiday accommodation, short term car hire, short term hire of boats, caravans, etc. and tour guide services.  From 1 September 1993, when apparently the season ends, he intends moving all these items to the 21 per cent rate, an increase of 110 per cent in the marginal rate of tax within the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who would want to be in the tourism business?  It means three different rates <Col N="583" /> of VAT in operation in the one year, three sets of brochures, three sets of charges &mdash; the litany goes on.  It can only mean the death knell of an industry with massive employment potential which will now not materialise.  The President of the Irish Hotels' Federation, Mr. Eamon McKeon, warned recently that the hotel industry has suffered financial devastation in the past six months.  Several hotels have closed down, others are fighting for survival and no new jobs will be created in 1993.  Instead of the budget helping those people in the tourism industry, it only created hardship for those involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to raise the VAT on Irish newspapers and periodicals from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.  All Irish print media exist in the private sector and must compete for scarce advertising with RTE radio and televison which is in the public sector and is funded directly by means of a licence which is compulsory for anyone who owns a TV set.  Recently the Government removed the advertising cap on RTE.  That gives it the equivalent of a second licence to fund its operation.</P>
    <P>The proposed VAT increases on newspapers and periodicals can only be a third blow to that sector, leading to ludicrous anomalies.  It is ridiculous that Irish newspapers are being sold in the sterling area with a lower retail price than in the Republic of Ireland.  It is even more ridiculous when the Punt is valued higher than the pound sterling.  I believe that the Government is playing fast and loose with the Irish newspaper industry.  It is prepared to let the country be flooded with cheap newspapers from the UK because such newspapers are not critical of Irish Government Ministers.  In fact, they hardly even mention them.</P>
    <P>The National Newspapers of Ireland &mdash; the NNI &mdash; supported by the National Union of Journalists, has calculated that the extra imposition will add a further £2 million to the national newspaper costs annually.  Because UK newspapers circulate freely in the Republic without the restrictions applied to Irish newspapers, it is inevitable that more jobs will be <Col N="584" /> lost in this area.  The President of the Provincial Newspapers of Ireland, Mr. John Kerry Keane, has stated that the industry has been dealt a mortal blow and some jobs are now at risk.</P>
    <P>The most narrow-minded and regressive measure in the budget is the proposal to increase the VAT rate on spectacles and contact lenses from 16 to 21 per cent. The Association of Optometrists, Ireland, has stated that it is a tax on the visually handicapped and a reversal of long term policy in a sensitive health area.  This measure is particularly ironic coming from the Labour Party which campaigned in the general election for a Minister for the Disabled with a seat at the Cabinet table.  Nowhere in the election manifestos of Labour or Fianna Fáil or the agreed Programme for a Partnership Government is any mention made of extra taxation on the visually handicapped.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us he would introduce a jobs budget.  It was nothing of the sort.  It was an anti-jobs, anti-employment, anti-business and anti-worker budget.  The Minister yesterday lectured the Dublin Chamber of Commerce about their criticism of the budget.  Lo and behold, the day he was there, 60 jobs were lost in the oldest store in Dublin, Clerys; 25 jobs were lost yesterday in a fashion company in Drogheda.  How many more will be lost as a result of the increased VAT in the budget?</P>
    <P>The VAT increases will take money out of people's pockets to fund wasteful Government expenditure, such as grandiose offices, the employment of advisers and cronies and further nepotism. Because there will be less money in people's pockets to spent on goods and services, economic growth will be curtailed in 1993.  VAT increases will fuel inflation which, in turn, will lead to demand for corresponding wage increases from those at work and consequent industrial unrest if such demands are not conceded.  VAT increases will lead to job losses because employers are in no position to absorb the additional costs being imposed, when you consider the extra cost on employers over the last four or five months because <Col N="585" /> of the way the currency crisis was handled.</P>
    <P>The budget that has been passed in the Lower House will occupy a unique place in the record books.  It is the first time a new Government had lost all public support by the time it had presented its first budget.  Senators mentioned the 1982 budget but many of those who supported it were re-elected.  The Government promised us change.</P>
    <P>I have only mentioned a few of the companies who have stated the proposals would lead to the loss of jobs.  I have no doubt my colleagues will have further evidence of the situation.  I recommend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to formally second the motion. While I welcome the Minister of State to the House, I am disappointed, as was my colleague, that the Minister, Deputy Ahern, is not here because it is important that he starts listening to people who will tell him the facts and give him the real information.  If it was good news I am sure some of the Ministers would be beating the door down to come into this House.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the further increase in VAT on many items is going to put more people on the dole queues. We only have to walk around this town and, within a couple of hundred yards of here we see the closing down sales, the number of shops to let and for sale, the empty windows, due to increased VAT rates in these recessionary times.  Today, the secretary of the Dublin City Centre Business Association said that over the past ten years 75 per cent of all jobs lost in the State has been in Dublin.  VAT has increased by 11 per cent and business rates are up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is this Government doing about it?  All we have had are increases on many items, particularly clothing, and the newspaper industry.  I will come back to <Col N="586" /> this matter shortly.  What has happened to this Government who said it was going to do so much to look after the unemployed and create further jobs?  All it is going to do is to close down more firms and agencies.  Sixty jobs have been lost in Clerys; Senator Farrelly mentioned job losses in a firm in County Louth and there have been job losses in Mayo.</P>
    <P>Why were these VAT increases introduced? Were they to fund the many programme managers and advisers?  Is this the job creation the Members opposite promised?  Was this looking after jobs for the boys and the girls &mdash; not to be sexist? I am concerned that mothers-in-law seem to have been discriminated against in relation to the programme manager advisers.</P>

      <P>I echo what has been said by the President of the Fashion and Footwear Federation, Mr. Louis Copeland.  This 5 per cent is the straw which will finally break the camel's back.  How many people can afford an extra £42 on a £200 suit?</P>
      <P>In relation to the increases on newspapers, RTE were recently given two extra advantages in a system where they already had an unfair advantage.  Those were the removal of capping and the increase in VAT on newspapers.  We depend on our national and local newspapers. Articles written about the Government suggest it thinks it can control RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to come back with changes before the Finance Bill is finally agreed.  I ask him to remind the Minister of the number of jobs lost at present in this city and throughout the country.  I hope the Minister realises the difficulties that many small operators will encounter and that many people will now <Col N="587" /> be claiming the dole because of this shortsighted action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion.  It was an unfortunate, bland budget and the increase in VAT has done a lot to make sure there will be no growth in the economy this year.  I studied economics and I was always told that economic growth depended on good consumer spending.  Therefore, it seems somewhat contradictory &mdash; but I suppose it is to be expected &mdash; to increase VAT on items such as clothes, newspapers and building materials.  The Minister has stated he expects economic growth in this year and then he increases VAT rates.  I do not know whether it is the Minister, Deputy Ahern's method of economics or if it is the Labour Party's influence in Government that has brought about these increases.</P>
      <P>There is a VAT reduction on cream crackers, wafers and other flour-based products, all very bland products&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the help I am receiving from my colleagues but I hope I will be allowed to say a few things. This shows the bland and unimaginative stance taken by this Government in the budget.  My colleague, Senator Cosgrave and I ask for these changes to be made to the Finance Bill.  I come from a small family-run business in the building industry. That industry is on its knees and there is no confidence in the market.  The VAT rates on building materials have been increased.  I come from a Border region where the VAT rates are much lower 20 miles away.  There is no way we can compete and there is no way that people will build houses because of the increase in VAT.  The knock-on effect will have implications for jobs in the building industry and is other sectors where job creation is nearly impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" /> If this budget was supposed to create jobs it certainly failed.  I would commend the budget if it maintained the jobs that are already there but because of the VAT increases it will not do that.  As my colleagues have pointed out, the number of job losses in the retail industry in the past couple of weeks has been enormous and this trend will continue because, as I said at the beginning there will be no consumer spending.  It is appalling that the Government has decided at this stage to discourage consumer spending.  There is no confidence; there is an incentive to put money in low tax rate DIRT accounts but there is no incentive to spend in the retail market.  We have heard reports of the payments to the programme managers. What is the attitude of the Government to that matter?  If they are being paid £40,000, I wish the Government would send £10,000 or £12,000 to Leitrim to keep the economy going there.</P>
    <P>VAT increases will not help this economy.  We need to increase consumer spending so that economic growth can take place but this will not happen while we have the VAT increases proposed in the budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Welcomes the overall thrust, in terms of employment, of the Financial Statement of 24 February by the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Budget Statement cannot be seen in isolation.  It is but part of the overall economic policy of Government.  An essential part of the whole budget programme is as in any other enterprise, the financial decisions reflected to the expenditure allocations of the Government, which of course, precede the Financial Statement, otherwise known as the budget.  The third leg of the tripod, which is yet to come is the Finance Bill which will reflect the Government's overall <Col N="589" /> priority in terms of the tax regime, tax incentives and tax allowances.</P>
    <P>To see the overall priority of Government all three must be looked at together, the expenditure allocations, the Budget Statement and the Finance Bill, which will be introduced some weeks down the line.  No element should be looked at in isolation and no element in a Budget Statement should be taken on its own and then criticised, much less rejected, on the basis that it is unpopular or unacceptable.  That is the attitude of the Opposition this evening.  They are selecting just one area of this overall programme, the VAT increases, and saying because of this the whole Government strategy for economic regeneration and for employment should be rejected.  I do not think the evidence will be sustained in that case.</P>
    <P>Everybody recognises that the one overriding priority, if not the exclusive priority, at this stage is the generation of sustained, secure employment, particularly in the indigenous sector.  Those who are engaged in providing employment and in generating economic activity must not only be acknowledged by us but must be encouraged to continue to the highest possible standards.  That is what this debate is about.  In the past, the reaction to budgets was more simplistic; it was always looked upon as a good or bad budget.  It was a good budget if things were soft and easy, if it gave us this or that and did not punish us too much.  It was a bad budget if it imposed too much tax on the old reliables or contained other elements that were seen as being too severe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Appalling would describe this budget adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither of these judgments would be appropriate at this point.  A good budget is one which, in conjunction with the other elements of overall policy, public expenditure and the Finance Bill, will impact positively at this critical stage on the overall economy and on investment and employment to secure the stability for young people particularly. <Col N="590" /> There has been a downturn in the world economy, but there are incipient signs of pick-up now in America and Germany and, even in the United Kingdom. We have to maximise for ourselves the benefit of any improvement in the international economy.</P>
      <P>The budget contains an overall thrust towards recognising and encouraging those who create employment and, by those standards, one must conclude that this budget is a good one.  It was not a budget to win claps, cheers and shouts of hurray the following morning, but on reflection we can see that it has given the right signals and is getting the right response.  The reduction in interest rates since the budget, although not entirely due to it, and the market's reaction have been very positive.  Even as we speak the indications are that the downward trend in interest rates will continue.</P>
      <P>The climate is right for banks and the building societies to play a more vigorous role in achieving a reduction in interest rates.  I am glad to see the National Irish Bank leading the pack &mdash; its chief executive is from my home county, Tipperary. The signals given by this bank and the confidence shown will I hope be followed over the next few weeks, by the other banks.</P>
      <P>Banks and financial institutions in Japan, for example, recognise the obligations of partnership.  If the climate created by Government there is positive and reassuring, Japanese banks, in a spirit of partnership, play a vigorous role in generating sustainable employment and economic activity.  It is time Irish financial institutions undertook a similar responsibility.  They make their profits from the country's economic activity and owe it to themselves &mdash; never mind their shareholders &mdash; and to the country to make a sustained contribution to economic activity here.  The most important contribution banks can make now is to pursue a policy whereby interest rates will be reduced as much as possible and the same applies to building societies. The Government is entitled to expect a response in kind now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The external factors are looking better <Col N="591" /> but we must maintain discipline to secure our objectives and to ensure that the pain, suffering and difficult decisions will not have been in vain.  I was part of the Government that took the right decisions in 1987 &mdash; perhaps they should have been taken four or five years previously &mdash; and we were determined to keep to our programme despite the criticisms then aimed at us.  We have now laid the basis for a discipline which will mean&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to the strategy.  Before one starts building one must ensure a secure foundation; one cannot build on shifting sands.  The foundation of the economy is secure. Irish inflation is the lowest in Europe, the climate for investment is buoyant and the reduction in interest rates is benign.</P>
      <P>I would say to my colleagues in the Labour Party who are sharing Government responsibility with us that none of us can claim that the initial period of new Government has been an unqualified success.  Perhaps, that comes from having to get to know and to accommodate each other.  Some criticisms of integrity made on both sides might have been better left unsaid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I do not intend to vote for this motion because I do not think it is right as Senator O'Kennedy has said to consider one measure of the budget in isolation.  The budget contains welcome reductions in VAT which will create jobs &mdash; I am referring to reductions for the garage, the hairdressing and the confectionery and bakery industries.  I agree, however that increases in VAT have employment implications and I would like to highlight their effect on the tourism industry where I started in business. If we are serious about jobs we must be serious about tourism.  Yet, we have just increased the value added tax on tourism by a quarter, from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.  This move has serious implications which we should identify and is hardly the act of a Government that understands the potential of tourism to create jobs. Over the last five years tourism has created more new jobs than any other industry and can create many more in the immediate future.  In the short term there is potential for 30,000 new jobs in tourism alone.  It would take an enormous number of IDA announcements of 100 jobs here and 50 jobs there to add up to anything like that.  Despite this great potential we still regard tourism as the Cinderella of job creation and that error has not been corrected in this budget. Tourism does not get the support it merits.  Instead, it seems to get kick after kick like this latest VAT increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to realise that tourism is extremely price-sensitive.  We are already a costly tourist destination.  It costs people a lot of money to come here and when they get here they find our prices are high.  This is critical in our two biggest markets, the British market and the <Col N="593" /> American market.  For British people our prices have already increased by 10 per cent since last year and now we have added a further VAT increase.  Of the American visitors, 60 per cent come to us via London.  Many Americans put off undertaking that extra leg of the journey because we are dearer than the UK and now we have added another disincentive.</P>
    <P>It is true the budget introduced welcome measures that will result in lessening the cost of car hire for visitors.  It beggars belief that we do that while, at the same time, creating a disincentive for visitors, the effects of which will far outweigh any benefits from the reduction in car hire.  It is almost, dare I suggest it, as if one hand did not know what the other hand was doing.</P>
    <P>I fully realise the need to reduce the number of VAT bands but the cost of doing it this way is extremely high, and makes no sense in the long term.  To create the maximum number of jobs in tourism, industry should be taxed at a special low rate.  May I suggest it be taxed at the same low rate we will be eventually forced under EC regulations, which we have already agreed, to put VAT on food?  If memory serves me correctly we are obliged to put VAT on food by 1996. It would make a lot more sense to begin phasing in that VAT on food at a very low rate now and gradually raise it, instead of having to introduce it in one fell swoop in two or three years time with a consequent shock to our cost of living.  If that had been done now we could have reduced tourism services to a rate that would make them more comprehensive and more competitive while remaining revenue neutral overall.  What has been done to VAT on tourism will prevent us from creating jobs in that sector and we should be in no doubt about that.</P>

      <P>The speech by Senator Quinn is one which Fine Gael, if they had sense, would have taken on board. Instead of a global motion on VAT they should have had a specific motion on tourism.  What strikes me as odd is that for a considerable length of time Fine Gael come in here with motion after <Col N="594" /> motion calling for increased spending.  I do not know whether they occupy the same planet as the rest of us but there are only a number of ways one can get money in this country.  One way is by direct taxation and the other is by indirect taxation.  The former spokesman on Finance for Fine Gael in the Dáil, Deputy Noonan, made absolutely clear that any increase in direct taxation would be a retrograde step and should not be taken. Direct tax increases were out as far as Fine Gael was concerned.  Now Fine Gael tells us that we should not raise money by indirect taxes, i.e. VAT.  By any reckoning that is a double standard.  Where will the funding for the 3,500 houses this Government will build come from? Maybe there is a secret pot of money that Senator Farrelly knows about; if so, he should tell the rest of us.  Where will the £8 million allocated to the handicapped in this budget come from?  Where will the money come from that Fine Gael are going to come into this House tomorrow and demand on behalf of Aer Lingus? You are going to sit there tomorrow, you are going to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept it is painful but perhaps a bit of pain at this early stage of the game is a good thing.  Senator Farrelly will sit there tomorrow with his party and will demand that the Government injects whatever equity is required to keep Aer Lingus in operation.  That could be an enormous sum but that will be the demand.  Of that there is no doubt. Where will the money come from?  How will the Government find this cash demanded by the Opposition?  Even in this day and age you cannot have your cake and eat it.  Neither can you have a well educated, highly intelligent electorate and feed them fable.  They will not believe it.</P>

      <P>I wish I was dealing with VAT.  I am dealing with a fable put forward by the Opposition party in the form of this motion.  If they are against direct taxation and against indirect taxation, will they kindly tell us, as quickly as possible, where in Heaven's name we can find the money?</P>
      <P>As Senator Quinn said earlier, of course VAT increases affect employment in some cases and business in other cases. There is not a sector in the country on which extra taxation can be imposed without having some detrimental effect. I have no doubt that if we had decided to ignore the clothing sector and put VAT on drink it would now be said that we were destroying the drink industry.  Perhaps the Opposition will tell us on what sector of the economy we should levy this VAT?  I have no doubt that tomorrow and in the coming weeks and months they will come in here demanding millions of pounds for various projects without indicating where the money will come from.  That is a dishonest stance.</P>
      <P>The work we spoke of, the 3,500 houses this Government is committed to build, the Tallaght Hospital which is due to start up this year and the increases in children's allowances, costs money and that money must be found from some source.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): Reflecting our employment needs, the need for competitiveness in the economy is the primary theme running through the Programme for a Partnership Government, and also the main focus of the budget, which is the first major step in the implementation of the programme.</P>
      <P>The budget was framed on the principle that the overriding national priority is jobs.  It was a pro-jobs, pro-business budget.  At its very core were measures to generate and sustain employment by improving the longer-term growth potential of the economy and by promoting local enterprise and wealth creation.  The second key element of our budget strategy was to send an unequivocal message to the markets that we will not relax our strict financial discipline, thereby creating the conditions for lower interest rates and stability in the exchange rate markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the publication of the book of Estimates on 17 February, interbank rates have fallen sharply.  The key one month rate has fallen from 15.25 to 11 per cent, a reduction of over four percentage points.  This reduction and a fall of almost two percentage points in official interest rates over the same period has allowed for reductions, in two stages, of up to two percentage points in retail interest and mortgage rates.  Only one of the four major banks has so far announced the second stage reduction and I urge other banks and the building societies to follow this lead as soon as possible.  There is no justification whatsoever in delaying the passing on of reduced interest rates to our already hard pressed mortgage holders by the financial institutions.  The economy needs lower interest rates and <Col N="597" /> any delay is damaging to our economic prospects.</P>
    <P>The jobs fund was heralded in our Programme for a Partnership Government. The budget provides £260 million for this fund in 1993, comprising £148 million of expenditure related to the Cohesion Fund, £25 million for the new county enterprise partnership boards and an addition of £87 million to the Exchequer funding of the remainder of the public capital programme.  In all, the year-on-year increase in capital spending will total almost £500 million &mdash; up by more than one quarter on last year's level.</P>
    <P>This entails a major expansion in investment in environmental infrastructure and in transport, including roads, rail, commercial ports and airports. These projects as well as giving many new jobs in the implementation phase, will also underpin the longer-term potential for growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>The county enterprise partnership boards, for which, as I have already mentioned, £25 million is provided, will have a mandate to support local initiative through assisting the start-up of small enterprises.  They will take over responsibility for the promotion and assistance of local development plans in consultation with community organisations, the social partners and the public sector at a local level.  The boards will also have responsibility for the promotion of tourism locally.  The purpose is to tap into the considerable potential for enterprise, wealth and employment creation that exists at local level throughout Ireland, but which cannot always be harnessed to the fullest extent under existing structures.</P>
    <P>In addition to State funds, the Government is making arrangements for contributions to the boards from financial institutions.  The Government is confident, on the basis of commitments to date and discussions to be completed, that more than £100 million will be made available in this way.</P>
    <P>The combination of the public capital programme, the Cohesion Fund expenditure and the additional expenditure for the county enterprise boards is by any <Col N="598" /> standards a very substantial investment stimulus to the economy and a considerable boost to employment.</P>
    <P>The pro-jobs bias in the budget does not end there.  On the taxation side also there are measures that are decidedly pro-business.  For instance, the business expansion scheme has been extended and improved, with the lifetime cap being lifted with immediate effect.  The urban renewal incentives to allow delayed projects to qualify have also been extended. The urban renewal incentives are also available in Temple Bar and the Custom House Docks area until 5 April 1996 and 24 January 1997, respectively.  Stamp duty has been adjusted to assist the building industry generally.</P>
    <P>As part of the adjustments to the VAT structure announced in the budget, the Government ensured that particular account was taken of our employment needs by reducing the rate applicable to certain labour intensive services, such as garage repairs, dry-cleaning and hairdressing. All such services are now on a reduced VAT rate, which is 8.5 per cent below the standard rate.  The rates applicable to flour, confectionery and non-chocolate biscuits were also substantially reduced in recognition of the employment intensive nature of the sectors concerned and of the exceptional rate differential which existed <i>vis-a-vis</i> Northern Ireland for the products involved.</P>
    <P>The tourism sector can also be expected to benefit from the initiative in relation to the short term car hire fleet which was announced, as well as from the standstill for the excises on petrol and drink.  The continued restraint shown in relation to the mainstream excises reflects the Government's awareness of the need to avoid trade diversion and associated job losses within the radically new environment of the EC Internal Market.  I intend to deal separately with those areas where VAT increases were imposed and which have been the focus of much selective criticism.</P>
    <P>The budget also contained measures aimed at improving the flow of equity finance to Irish business, such as the introduction of special investment <Col N="599" /> accounts and the extension of the BES. The Government is keenly aware of the importance of equity investment for all Irish companies, whether large or small. The special investment accounts will enable those who invest in Irish equities, either directly or indirectly, to avail of a very favourable tax rate of 10 per cent. To benefit from this low tax rate, the funds will be required to invest 40 per cent of their assets in Irish equities this year, rising to 55 per cent in 1996.  To ensure that the funds are not focused completely on larger companies, there is a further requirement that 6 per cent of assets are invested in smaller companies in year one, rising to 15 per cent in 1996. There is no requirement that the equities held have to be in quoted companies. Indeed, there is an extra incentive to invest in BES-type companies as the income and capital gains from these companies will be ignored for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out in the budget speech, the largest group of investors in Ireland are pension funds.  The total value of Irish pension funds' assets is now approaching £10 billion and their total annual net cash flow and investment income is of the order of £750 million.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that Irish pension funds have a national responsibility to take the needs of the Irish economy, particularly the need for more jobs, into account when making their investment decisions and that they should make a greater contribution to the development of employment in Ireland.  These funds should, therefore, invest as much as possible of their assets in Ireland and should reverse the trend of recent years, which has seen the Irish share of their total assets dropping from 79 per cent at the end of 1988 to 68 per cent at the end of 1991.  Given that employer contributions account for the bulk of the annual cash flow of funds, there should be an obvious self-interest on the part of the pension funds to help Irish business.  This will be to the long term mutual advantage of both Irish companies and employees.</P>
    <P>In order to assist this process of Irish investment, the Minister for Finance has <Col N="600" /> already set in train a process the aim of which is to set up a suitable mechanism for getting the pension funds to invest more in Irish job-creation projects, particularly in the manufacturing sector. It is his intention that this new initiative will come into operation within the next few months and thereby give an early boost to job creation in the areas selected.  In pursuance of this, the Minister for Finance will be meeting with the Irish Association of Pension Funds later this week for further discussions on the matter.</P>
    <P>Apart from the capital expenditure and the taxation incentives I have listed, there is a further and pervasive pro-enterprise thread running right through this year's budget, and, indeed through its predecessors in recent years, and it is this: the firm control of the public finances and the steady improvement in the national debt ratio.  This firm fiscal discipline is vital to investment, to long term growth, to enterprise and to employment consolidation and creation.  In addition to the establishment of a climate conducive to enterprise through the adoption of appropriate taxation and macro-economic policies, the Government is committed to giving a renewed impetus to the task of developing and promoting industrial growth in line with the recommendations of the Culliton report.  There have already been changes in the structure of government to give a sharper focus to industrial and marketing policies.  Other changes in the structure of the promotion agencies and further policy initiatives are outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government and will be implemented over a period of time.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, attempts have been made to denigrate aspects of the budget.  Two areas in particular of the taxation measures announced have been taken out of the context of the balanced overall package and selected as the focus for adverse comment.  These criticisms relate to the necessary increases in the VAT rate applicable to certain goods and services and to the implementation of the temporary income levy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> I will deal with each of these areas in turn.  First, however, I make the general point that some measures to increase revenue were inevitable if we are to maintain a prudent level of borrowing and if we are to remain on course for full participation in the Economic and Monetary Union.  Discipline was also crucial to securing the downward movement in interest rates that has begun to emerge in the last few weeks.  In that context, the Government looked mainly to taxes on spending and assets, so as not to impose any unnecessary burdens on the rewards for effort, enterprise and investment.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the various VAT increases announced in the budget was, of course, to raise revenue. However, the changes involved were also necessary to achieve compliance with Community law and have contributed to a considerable simplification and consolidation of the overall rating structure.</P>
    <P>Most severe criticism has been made about the effects of the abolition of the 10 per cent and 16 per cent rates.  Among the areas previously taxed at 10 per cent were hotel and holiday accommodation, newspapers, building services and short term car hire.  These are taxed at the 12.5 per cent rate from 1 March.  In the majority of these areas, measures were taken to soften the impact of the increase. For example, the increases in respect of accommodation and short term car hire will not affect contracts already entered into prior to 25 February last.</P>
    <P>In the case of building, measures are being taken to ensure that the local authority new house building programme and the voluntary housing programme are not adversely effected by the rate increase. To cushion the effect of the increase on the cost of new homes, the grant to first-time house buyers was increased from £2,000 to £3,000.  Finally, where house building contracts existed prior to the budget, the earlier 10 per cent VAT rate will continue to apply.  These measures demonstrate the Government's awareness, despite pressing budgetary demands, of the need to implement the <Col N="602" /> increases as sensitively as possible and with the minimum of disruption.</P>
    <P>Under EC law, only one VAT rate may now exist in excess of an agreed Community standard rate minimum level of 15 per cent: this meant that our transitional 16 per cent rate had to go. Budgetary circumstances dictated that the standard rate should remain at 21 per cent on this occasion and that certain categories such as adult clothing and footwear and telecommunications services, previously taxed at 16 per cent, should also be taxed at that rate.  While it would have been possible from a legal standpoint to temporarily shift these activities to the lower 12.5 per cent rate, as was done in certain cases of certain labour-intensive service industries mentioned earlier, it was simply not possible because of the very difficult budgetary situation. Furthermore, in all fairness, it would have to be pointed out that, in his 1992 Budget Statement the Minister for Finance clearly stated that the 16 per cent rate was a temporary one and that the activities in question were destined to be liable at the standard rate.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise that the increases concerned in some instances will add to difficult trading conditions but a significant contribution towards budgetary correction from the indirect tax area was unavoidable on this occasion.  Naturally, the sectors facing rate increases feel aggrieved: the Government, however, has to take a view of what is best for the economy as a whole in terms of promoting economic growth and the sustainable jobs which flow from it.  It is unreasonable for those who focus solely on the increases involved to do so without having regard to the wider employment-supportive nature of the budget or to say how they would have chosen to raise the additional revenue involved.  There are no longer any easy options in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Government did not lightly decide on the introduction of the income levy. The measure became unavoidable only at the end of a long and difficult budgetary exercise, in which both the expenditure and revenue aspects of the deficit <Col N="603" /> equation were subjected to rigorous scrutiny. In the end, it was not possible to identify a realistic alternative to the temporary levy.  I totally reject the argument that the levy represents a tax on employment to a greater degree than any of the other taxes, whether on income or expenditure, which are already applied throughout OECD countries in order to finance the range of State services which are essential to the maintenance of the social and economic fabric of modern society.</P>
    <P>In reality, the levy will impact on employment only if taxpayers seek to compensate themselves through higher charges and wages rather than accepting that they should make a limited contribution towards the exceptional employment and other costs incurred through the protracted slowdown in the international economy.  That would be an entirely illogical reaction and I am confident that, taking account of the universally accepted need to maintain our international competitiveness, the limited sacrifice involved will be accepted as such, particularly when viewed against the background of the substantial increases in real take-home incomes that have been secured under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that high interest rates damage confidence and investment, and disimprove employment.  The responsible and balanced nature of the budget this year has already been a major contributory factor in getting interest rates down.  It is only in such economic conditions that real sustainable jobs will be generated in our economy.  Unemployment and other problems can and will be tackled.  I look forward to the support of the Seanad in our endeavours to provide the framework in which such progress takes place.</P>
    <P>Members have put forward many interesting suggestions during this debate.  Senator Quinn put forward some radical and positive suggestions on tourism, as Senator Magner has acknowledged. <Col N="604" /> If there were more radical suggestions such as that from the other side of the House they would be more important and productive than criticising one area of VAT reductions first for the sake of criticising.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I did that last year in the other House and the Minister did not take them on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>People were expecting a pro-employment budget and they got the opposite.  Taxation is higher than ever. Business viability has received what will be the fatal body blow.  To compound the error of economic misinterpretation VAT has been increased without regard for the employment consequences.  That is why we are debating this motion.  One can only ask, does the Government care about the consequences of its actions? We must hope it does care.</P>
      <P>Any economic analysis must start with the obvious question: why are these increases imposed?  An increase in Exchequer revenue must have been the reason and the Minister has confirmed that in his speech.  Given the already penal levels of taxation, this reflects the Government's unwillingness to tackle the problem of public spending.  At a time of dire economic conditions, much of which has been caused by bad Government, tax increases on soft targets are deplorable. The Government's lack of judgment, its inability and lack of imagination to solve our fiscal problems is frightening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the proposed increases in VAT are applied the impact on the economy can take two forms.  First the VAT increases will be passed on to the consumer and we have seen that happen in the case of newspapers.  That sector is in a difficult trading situation due to the fact that newspapers from abroad have a zero-VAT rating.  Second, the price increases are being imposed at a time of weak consumer demand and this will result in manufacturers and retailers having to bear the cost.  Should the first course of action take place essential items such as footwear and clothing will be liable to an increase in VAT from 16 to 21 per cent <Col N="605" /> and this will increase the cost of living. In turn, this will put pressure on wages and social welfare payments.  In current economic conditions neither can be increased significantly; therefore, there will be a decline in real wages and living standards.</P>
    <P>Economic law predicts that if prices increase, the quantity sold will fall.  This, in turn, will reduce the demand for labour and cause more unemployment.  As many businesses are already operating below their break-even volume of activity, a volume decrease will cause a major surge of business failures and unemployment. Our ability to attract tourists to Ireland will be limited as Ireland gets priced out of the tourism market.  This point has been made by Senator Quinn and I agree with it.</P>
    <P>If the second option is adopted, competitive industries such as the clothing industry who operate on low margins, will not be able to pass on most of the increases because of the purchasing power of the major chain stores.  This will eliminate manufacturers' margins and, because of business failures, increase unemployment.  Businesses that have suffered already due to the Government's mismanagement of the currency will not be able to sustain a second blow and jobs will be lost.</P>
    <P>The Government has made no effort to reduce VAT rates in labour-intensive industries and that is an unforgiveable oversight.  At a time of economic difficulty the costs arising as a result of increased VAT will place unjust burden on honest businesses.  Such increases indicate an arrogant disregard for the true wealth generators in the economy, our domestic businesses.</P>
    <P>For example, employment in the clothing industry has dropped by 24 per cent over the last ten years.  The clothing industry is a labour intensive industry and it is usually city based.  In the last few days we have seen a number of closures in the city of Dublin.  If the Government's solution is to raise VAT on clothing that is like throwing the business to the wolves.  Traders can no longer absorb the increases.  They have no option but to <Col N="606" /> close because the industry cannot compete with products from south-east Asia. In the last 12 months the fashion industry, has seen VAT increases from 12.5 per cent VAT to 16 per cent and now 21 per cent.</P>
    <P>I read the speech made by the Minister for Finance in support of his budget to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce yesterday. He defended the 1 per cent levy. He stated and the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, reiterated tonight:</P>
    <P>In the final analysis the levy or any other tax option</P>
    <P>and I am sure the Minister for Finance meant VAT when he said &ldquo;tax-option&rdquo;</P>
    <P>will only impact on employment if taxpayers seek to compensate themselves to higher charges and wages rather than accepting that they should make a limited contribution towards the exceptional unemployment and other costs imposed by the protracted slow down in the international economy.</P>
    <P>I believe the Irish taxpayer was prepared to make that sacrifice and the Minister missed that opportunity.</P>
    <P>We have 300,000 people unemployed and any Minister for Finance should have framed a budget with a view to resolving the unemployment problem.  The Minister failed to do that.  He failed to challenge the people, a challenge they were prepared to accept.  The Minister failed to be radical.  If you are not radical you must become redundant and, I am sorry to say, after only a short term in office this Government has become redundant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to hear my colleague express this view.  If I was running a business and the chief executive and his staff were presenting their accounts or proposals for the first year I would have a more positive attitude than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish, down the centuries have always been a positive race.  Bearing in mind the worldwide recession I believe this country is operating its financial controls exceptionally well compared with ten years ago.  As other Senators said, <Col N="607" /> there were many demands on the Government in this budget.  In an attempt to tackle the problems and improve our lot, the books have been balanced in a fair and positive way.</P>
    <P>One positive growth area mentioned by Senator Quinn is the tourism industry. If I had anything negative to say about the budget it would be in relation to the 2.5 per cent VAT increase on tourism. The reason for this is that there are going to be two VAT bands.  Given the importance of this industry, such measures had to be taken.  The opportunity to create 30,000 jobs in the tourism industry has been mentioned.  The Government and politicians on all sides agree that the future of tourism in this country is second to none.  We cannot market the favourable climate of which Spain, Orlando or Miami can boast.  We must follow the example of the French.  They market Paris without mentioning the weather. We must emphasise our fabulous national resources, fishing, golfing, etc. There will be an increase in revenue as a result of this increase of 2.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Ireland and the UK are the only countries in the EC where there is no VAT on food or children's clothes.  This will change in 1996, but as a result of the recession and the difficulties facing us, the Government spared the consumer from having to pay VAT on food and children's clothes.</P>
    <P>The confectionery industry was concerned about the 21 per cent VAT imposed on it.  This has been reduced to 12.5 per cent and that has helped the industry greatly.  Clearly, the confectionery industry was feeling the pinch.</P>
    <P>I am sure hard pressed garage owners welcome the reduction in VAT as do those engaged in the hairdressing industry, which lobbied the Government.</P>
    <P>The opportunity for growth and job creation is limited when America, Australia, Canada and England, which account for 78 per cent of our export markets are experiencing difficulties. However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  I watched CNN's main evening news last Sunday.  It said that 360,000 <Col N="608" /> Americans returned to work last month and twice as many new houses were purchased in February of this year than the same month last year.  This may not be relevant to our discussion on VAT but it can be a marker for what may happen here within the next six to 12 months.</P>
    <P>We had a general election a few months ago and we now have a new Government.  Everybody has suffered as a result of decisions made over the last five or six years and we have all made sacrifices to strengthen the economy.  The destiny of our economy is in our own hands; it is no longer in the hands of our EC partners.  Growth in other countries, including Britain, will help our own economy. The Irish worker is welcome everywhere because he is committed and dedicated.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the media could play a more positive role in the future because the spoken word is the winning word.  Ninety per cent of what one reads or hears in the media is negative.  We all know that a kind word can go a long way and I call on the media to take a more positive approach and to give credit where credit is due.  The editors of television, radio and the national and provincial papers have a major responsibility to motivate people along the road to recovery.  The Government is doing its part.  Editors should not dwell on negative aspects but provide a lead that has not been forthcoming for sometime.  Thank you for allowing me to speak in support of the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Minister Hyland to the Chamber this afternoon.  I would like to share my time with Senator Sherlock.  The Minister, Deputy Brennan, said earlier that, reflecting our employment needs, the budget was framed on the principle that the overriding national priority is jobs.  It was a pro jobs, pro business budget.  The Minister for Finance on budget day made the same statement in the other House.  I fail to see however, that what has been said in the intervening period has anything to do with the creation of jobs.  Given the VAT increases and the income levy <Col N="609" /> imposed in this budget, I cannot see how anyone could think that it was a pro jobs budget.  Senator Magner asked whether Fine Gael wanted direct or indirect taxation. The budget contained increases in both; in indirect taxation through VAT increases and in direct taxation through the income levy.</P>
      <P>The Government is going to get extra funding from an increase in VAT from ten to 12.5 per cent on all goods and services with the exception of poured concrete and concrete blocks.  The rate on short term car hire will be further increased to 21 per cent on 1 September. I cannot understand how, by increasing VAT on short term car hire, Senator Cassidy can believe we are going to improve our tourism industry.  The current ten per cent VAT rate on concrete blocks is going to be increased to 21 per cent yet we have always talked about the importance of the building industry to Ireland, its effect on job creation and how, if one gets the building industry going, everything else will fall into place. Given the increased VAT on building products, how can we hope to increase employment in that sector?</P>
      <P>I welcome the reduction from 16 per cent to 12.5 per cent VAT on personal services, repair and maintenance services. However, the cost of that reduction to the Exchequer &mdash; £6.5 million &mdash; is small in relation to the anticipated yield of £40.4 million from the other two VAT increases mentioned.  Government is also talking about increasing the 16 per cent VAT rate on goods and services, such as telecommunications, adult clothing and footwear, LPG and certain professional services to 21 per cent from 1 March. The cost of telecommunications to Irish industry was mentioned in the Culliton report and the Minister has referred to the impact of service costs on our competitiveness. I do not see how the Minister's decisions in this budget can make us more competitive or create more jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome, with Senator Quinn the reduction of the 21 per cent rate on flour and confectionery to 12.5 per cent, but the cost of that reduction to the Exchequer is only £7 million.  The yields <Col N="610" /> from VAT increases far exceeds concessions. The total yield from increases in VAT will amount to £84 million while the cost to the Exchequer from VAT reductions will be £13 million, giving the Minister an extra £71 million over the year from VAT.</P>
    <P>The one per cent income levy now being introduced cannot hope to increase employment.  The Minister mentioned earlier the setting up of county enterprise partnership boards and the allocation of £25 million to these boards to support and I quote, &ldquo;local initiative through assisting the start up of small industries.&rdquo;  The Minister also said the boards would have responsibility for the promotion of tourism locally.  At the moment incomes are subject to a 48 per cent marginal rate of tax, a 7.75 per cent PRSI deduction and a one per cent levy.  We are talking therefore about a marginal rate of tax of almost 56.75 per cent.  How can anybody talk about setting up local initiatives or starting up small enterprises if it will cost an employer £2.54 to put one pound in a worker's pocket?  I cannot understand that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of the enterprise boards but we have to be consistent and enable them to create jobs.  The budget's extension of the business expansion scheme through the lifting of the lifetime cap and the extension of delayed urban renewal projects is to be welcomed. Anyone undertaking urban renewal however is going to do so with the idea of letting their premises to businesses which sell goods and/or employ people.  Therefore, if we increase the cost of employing people or the cost of goods to be sold, additional premises will not be taken up.  Nobody is going to set up a business without the expectation of a reasonable return.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it was not possible to fund the services we want to provide in this State without the introduction of a temporary levy.  We introduced a youth employment levy in 1982 and it is still with us.  I do not think anyone believes that this is a temporary levy.  The Minister, Deputy Brennan, said we have to increase taxes in order to finance the <Col N="611" /> range of State services which are essential to the maintenance of the social and economic fabric of modern society.  We are talking about a society where 21 people depend on every ten people in employment.  We are trying to reform tax law to make it attractive for employers to increase employment for employees to work, so as to reduce the numbers of people dependent on the State and finance the range of State services essential to maintaining this economy.</P>

      <P>The increase from 16 to 21 per cent in the VAT rate on clothing and footwear in the budget must be opposed on the grounds that people involved in retail and manufacturing businesses say their viability is directly threatened by the VAT increase and that that increase will undoubtedly lead to redundancies.  The budget was expected to create jobs, not redundancies.  The VAT increase will be passed on to low income earners and small farmers as well as to people on social welfare.  There are in excess of 20,000 employees in the retail clothing and footwear sector, working in more than 4,000 shops.  It is reasonable to assume that the VAT increase will result in a ten per cent rate of job losses or 2,000 redundancies.  We saw the first of those last evening with the announcement from Clerys.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance may have used figures provided by the Central Statistics Office for the month of October, 1992 which indicate an increase in clothing sales.  The fact is that there has been a decrease in sales in the past month.  In the 1982 budget it was proposed to increase VAT on clothes and footwear by 18 per cent and the Government was defeated on that issue.  Since then more and more people have become unemployed and consequently, marginalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An anomaly has arisen with the abolition of VAT at the point of entry affording an advantage to retailers who will source their business or products abroad now because they only pay tax when they sell.  However, the person who <Col N="612" /> buys the product at home has to pay when the invoice is written out.  Our crippling rates of direct and indirect taxation have bedevilled economic development here. I am not talking off the top of my head; I have had more recent representations on this issue than ever before.  May I just read one small paragraph from a letter sent to me by a person in a small business in my home town of Mallow?  I quote:</P>
    <P>I have a ladies clothes shop in Mallow, County Cork, and am most distraught about the impending VAT increase.  The retail business is suffering enough in the current economic recession with job losses, closures, etc, all over the country.  I do not want to go out of business and like many other independent retailers have worked very hard to build up my business from scratch.  I beg you, on my behalf, please do not let this go through.  Things are bad enough.  The increase in VAT will lead to increased retail prices, a decrease in sales in the present price conscious climate and a decrease in profit margins and ultimately job losses.</P>
    <P>That is what the retail business is saying. This VAT rate should not be imposed on the retail business.</P>

      <P>Everybody knows that the function of the Opposition is to oppose.  However, it is to oppose constructively and not just for the sake of it. There is a responsibility on us all to take the national finances into consideration and to make sacrifices.  I agree with some of the points raised by the Opposition Members about the effects of the VAT increases, we cannot spend what we do not have.  We cannot live beyond our means any longer; therefore, it will take some radical changes in the tax system to bring about any sort of equity in the financial scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some positive points in the budget.  First, there are the special investment accounts that are being set up to encourage Irish pension funds to invest their money in Ireland and to help businesses, particularly smaller enterprises. <Col N="613" /> Money was given to the county enterprise boards which is where, I think, our future lies.  We have to return to community-based development and encourage the local community to spend more within and give more to their community.  If we continue in this way, we will create more labour-intensive employment in areas such as hairdressing, garage repairs, dry cleaning and confectionery.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that this is not going to happen overnight.  It will take many changes, not only in the system itself but also in people's thinking.  Unfortunately, we tend not to give enough encouragement to entrepreneurs who employ many people in small industry and small businesses.  There are some Members on the Fine Gael benches who are providing considerable employment in Cork city in small businesses.  They are providing local employment and money is being spent locally.</P>
    <P>It is important to look at the incentives for the building industry especially the grant increase from £2,000 to £3,000. When the building industry is booming the economy as a whole is booming.  The more encouragement that is given to the building industry, the better for the economy.  Again, this is a labour-intensive industry.</P>
    <P>When making decisions we have to take account of our EC membership.  Our ultimate ideal should be European monetary integration and to be part of that integration we have to bring our taxes into line with the rest of Europe. This requires sacrifice from everybody initially but the rewards are there to reap in the future.  We have to decide that we are not going to make it easy for ourselves in this generation but by making sacrifices we can make it easier for future generations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I hoped when I returned to the House that I would not speak negatively. However, I am particularly worried by people who give the impression that the problems are going to be solved whereas a few months ago they were saying quite the opposite.  That <Col N="614" /> is not good enough.  I hope I am a realist. I am so interested in making sure that people go to work I would go to great lengths even for one job.  It is that serious.</P>
      <P>I really thought there was going to be radical change in the budget.  The Irish, as Senator Doyle has already said, were ready for change but that did not happen; indeed, it was quite the opposite.  Last September I was very annoyed at the way the possible devaluation of our currency was handled.  Look at the cost to us.  We were given the impression by the other side of the House that interest rates were coming down but they increased by 3 per cent.  The monthly cost of money to businesses in October, November and December was in the region of 40 per cent.  No business can carry that.  It was because of bad thinking and bad management in Government.  Britain was prepared to go outside the ERM; now they have interest rates of 5 and 6 per cent while our rates are treble that.  Any realist would have to ask where are we going.</P>
      <P>People on the other side of the House say things are all right.  I really do not understand it; I have never seen things so bad.  I am just not saying that because we are not in Government.  Irrespective of who was in Government, if I thought things were bad I would say they were bad.  There is no incentive for business. It is said that hairdressers are going to gain but if one asks anyone working in that area they will tell you there is nothing happening in the hairdressing business. Perhaps that is what we want; perhaps we do not want people to spend their money on getting their hair done.  We try to give the impression that everything is going to be fine but the money is not there for people to spend.  That is why I wanted radical changes in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impression was given that the so-called &ldquo;golden circle&rdquo; would be hammered in the budget.  Who are they?  The Minister mentioned people in pension funds.  The Government said it was worried that interest rates were not coming down faster but, at the same time, it gave incentives to people in pension funds which allowed them to make a lot of <Col N="615" /> money in the months of September to January.  What was the Government doing?  It was not the &ldquo;golden circle&rdquo; that was caught.  It was ordinary people and the Government is not prepared to face up to that.  That is what worries me.  Now the impression is given that there will be economic progress as a result of money from these pension funds.  People should be realistic about this matter.  I will come back here in 12 months and prove that nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker made a point about the VAT on shoes.  I have seven children and three of my daughters take a bigger shoe than my wife.  My wife pays no VAT on her shoes but we pay VAT on our daughters' shoes.  There is no sense in that.  When are we going to face facts and treat all people equally?  Senator Cassidy made a valid point.  It is obvious that in time we are probably going to see one level of VAT in operation, perhaps during the lifetime of this Government. Then, again, maybe not because the Government may go to the EC and say we cannot do it.  Is the Government saying there will be VAT on food?  If so, then face up to it, but do not play around with it.</P>
    <P>Senator Magner referred to an increase in the children's allowance.  The policy of the Labour Party, before entering Government, was to propose an increase in the children's allowance of £4 a month but it did not mention that it would recoup it in increases in VAT.  Magees are a great company in Donegal but the Government proposals will affect them drastically.  They will have to compete on unfavourable terms with imports from countries such as Taiwan, Korea and elsewhere.  Where is the incentive for a company to stay in Ireland?  Will we soon reach the stage where highly motivated Irish people will go elsewhere?  VAT is not charged on foreign newspapers and it could well reach the point that domestic newspapers might be forced to print elsewhere. That is a genuine cause for concern. Anyone who claims that there is a real incentive for business in the budget must be suffering from illusions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" /> Creating even one job is important to me.  Indeed, I supported the concept of the social employment scheme in 1985. Every possible incentive should be given to get people working, even if it is only on a part-time basis.  I would also like to give help to anyone who does not want to go out to work, and I do not apologise for saying that.  It is radical and socialist thinking, but why do I not hear it from the other side of the House?  I am annoyed that they are claiming in their speeches that they have given a motivation to people to engage in business. They are suffering from illusions.  The opposite is the case.  Everyone in this House knows there is no motivation. Approximately 52 per cent of our population is under 25 years of age and the Government is creating a welfare state for them.  There are no incentives for them.  I am not saying we should give too many incentives.  A previous speaker said that every £1 to an employee costs the employer another £1.50 when account is taken of tax at 48 per cent and PRSI at 7 per cent.  You would not hear of this anywhere else in the world.  The reason is because the Government is not prepared to tell the people that these are the facts.  Senator Magner asked where else could the money come from.  Four months ago, the money was coming from everywhere, particularly the &ldquo;golden circle&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment which welcomes the overall thrust, in terms of employment, of the Financial Statement of 24 February by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The motion before us is a small part of a 31 page document, the address by the Minister for Finance, on 24 February. Taking a small part of the budget in isolation and criticising it is not the best way to deal with it; a budget must be taken in its entirety.  I want to compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, who presented the case in favour of the budget very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a politician in my constituency for 30 years whose name was Michael Pat Murphy.  At meetings he <Col N="617" /> often heard complaints about high taxation levels, irrespective of who was in office.  He said that one should remember that when the Minister for Finance devises his budget, he has to decide where he is going to get tax from and to whom he is going to give money.  If VAT is taken in isolation we are not doing our job right.  If we were to remove the VAT as is proposed here, we might be able to build only 1,000 houses instead of 3,000.</P>
    <P>I come from West Cork, an area where there are about 160 people on the housing waiting list and they are at present living in very bad conditions.  There are old people, single parents, deserted wives and unmarried mothers looking for houses and the Government plan to build 3,000 this year.  These houses will not be built for nothing so we will have to get the money from direct or indirect taxation. We have no other choice.  If you remove or reduce VAT, are you going to take the money to be used for building houses?</P>
    <P>In the construction of houses, we will give employment to the smaller builder. I am parochial about this because I know the situation on the ground.  There are small builders in my area waiting to give employment, not only to themselves, but to one or two young men also.</P>
    <P>If we are going to have 3,000 houses built this year, as the Minister of State mentioned in his circular to the county councils, work will have to be started soon.  We do not want any delay; the 3,000 houses must be completed this year.  We are hoping for another 3,000 houses next year, so the level of construction work will continue.  However, someone has to pay for this.  We had a 3.5 per cent increase in social welfare payments and funds must be found for that.</P>
    <P>There were some reductions in VAT, but they were not mentioned.  The 16 per cent rate was reduced to 12.5 per cent and the 21.5 per cent rate was reduced to 12.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>A rather snide remark was made by a Fine Gael Member about programme managers.  We are now in a position to get money from the EC and we want <Col N="618" /> to use it properly.  In the Cork County Council, where I am chairman, members continuously say that there is money in the EC, but we do not know the right way of getting it.  If professional people are employed to do this work not only will we get the maximum amount from the EC but we can also get the best return for the money spent.</P>
    <P>We had no increase in the old reliables in the budget.  I refer particularly to the pint.  Many were expecting a 10p to 20p increase but it did not happen.  Putting up alcohol prices now would not be good for the drinking trade.  We would also reintroduce cross-Border trafficking in alcohol.</P>

      <P>There was no tax increase on alcoholic beverages because it was felt that they have been taxed sufficiently.  It would have been easy to add another 10p but it was not considered appropriate.  Tax on petrol was not increased for the same reason.  The budget was balanced and I welcome its overall thrust in relation to employment, the building trade and so on.  I fully support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I thank the Members for their contributions to this debate.  I am delighted to see that in a short political life some of the Opposition have been converted from poacher to gamekeepers.</P>
      <P>I quote from the Offical Report of the Dáil, 29-30 January 1992, Vol. 415, col. 42.  The Deputy Leader of the Labour Party when speaking on last year's budget in the other House said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially my message this year is that what was needed above all on the issue of unemployment was leadership and hope &mdash; leadership from the Government and hope for the unemployed. I have some good news for the unemployed who may be dismayed by the contents of this year's budget. Labour have given a lead in that we <Col N="619" /> have shown, as we did last year, that polices can be put in place which will offer work to the unemployed provided we have the political will to tackle the issue.</P>
    <P>That speaks for itself.  That statement was made last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Two weeks after the budget was passed 30 jobs in Drogheda and 60 jobs in Dublin were lost because of budget increases in VAT.  Senator Calnan mentioned that there had been no increases on the old reliables because of the Border situation.  Why was the effect of a 5 per cent VAT increase on clothing on Magees of Donegal not taken into consideration?  If we increased the 15 per cent rate to 17.5 per cent and reduced the 21 per cent rate to 17.5 per cent, making it the same as in Northern Ireland, it would help to reduce the hardship experienced by companies throughout the country.  It is not right to say on the one hand the old reliables were not increased if on the other hand we put the clothing industry in jeopardy.</P>
      <P>The budget reduced VAT on hairdressing and car repair.  Representatives of those trades lobbied outside Leinster House and demanded action to avoid the loss of hundreds of jobs.  A lesson may be learned from the Government's response on VAT: if one lobbies the Government before next year's budget there may be no increases and if one lobbies hard enough there may be reductions.  We are now asking employers, in addition to providing a service or manufacturing a product to lobby Ministers and TDs for reductions in VAT.  It is evident from this year's budget that lobbying achieves results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals to invest £25 million in county enterprise boards have been welcomed throughout the country and I cannot wait until those boards are established. Prior to the general election, however, £50 million was allocated for the boards.  Given the four or five <Col N="620" /> counties recently devastated by the loss of 15,000 to 30,000 jobs, how much money will be left for other counties such as mine with over 6,000 people unemployed in three major towns and others in the surrounding rural areas.  The county development teams should be expanded immediately.  This £25 million is only a drop in the ocean; £50 million might have had a more positive effect.</P>
    <P>There are many people who want to set up businesses but are hindered from day one.  We have heard the case of a politician's relation who started a business within the last seven months and had nine different calls from Inland Revenue officials and others.  People expected change in this budget.  It is not good enough for the Government to say that they have only been in office for nine weeks.  Sufficient time was spent putting packages together and those should have dealt with the realities of which as politicians, we are all aware.</P>
    <P>A building programme for 3,500 local authority houses has been mentioned.  I cannot believe the Government has not introduced a once-off reconstruction grant of approximately £4,000 which could be used for house extensions to accommodate single parents.  In my county there are 168 single parents.  I am not saying that every house should have an extension but the labour and materials used to construct extensions would generate jobs and VAT revenue.  Let nobody say that the increase in new house grants from £2,000 to £3,000 is a bonus. It will only cover the VAT increase.</P>
    <P>People expected the budget to contain radical measures to stimulate employment. It did not.  As I tabled this motion last week I wondered why there had been no radical change of approach.  Upon consideration, I realised that of 15 Cabinet members only one or two have been self-employed or have employed others.  The majority worked for the State or in service industries.  The bottom line is that in order to create employment the present system must be changed.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn said he would not vote for the motion as it was selective.  For ten minutes he complained about neglect of <Col N="621" /> the tourism industry.  Two years ago, as Fine Gael spokesperson on tourism and industry I pointed out what should be done to create employment in tourism, yet this major industry has been hit in every budget.</P>
    <P>Difficulties were encountered in the operation of the business expansion scheme.  However, it should have been possible to rectify these problems and close the loopholes, thereby allowing the scheme to continue.  The scheme has been reintroduced on a small scale this year.</P>
    <P>The budget has done nothing to lift the hearts of Irish people who want to work. Instead, we have increased VAT from 16 <Col N="622" /> per cent to 21 per cent instead of bringing the 21 per cent rate into line with the rate in the UK and Northern Ireland.  That mistake may be corrected in 12 months but in the interim, jobs will be lost as a result.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their contributions. I do not agree with Senators on the matter, but a few months ago many of them would have agreed with me. That is the way the cookie crumbles, and I am sure they will agree with us again because the proposals in the budget will not produce the goods.</P>

We can speak as two Corkmen; we went into the city council together in 1979; we come from the same parish, and my mother was born on the same street as him.  I wish him well.  I think he is going to do very well because he is a realist.  I hope he gets the opportunity to show his ability because he is a sincere person. The people of Cork have recognised that not alone in the last election, but in previous elections.</P>
      <P>In the Seanad between 1983 and 1987 as a member of the Government parties, I pushed strongly with other Members from Cork for an emphasis on our lower harbour.  As we all know it is a place that any person who comes to Ireland likes to visit.  It is a very beautiful place.  The facilities there provided by previous Governments over the years have cost in excess of £150 million.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the sad times we had in the early 1980s with the closing of many plants in Cork, one of which he worked in, Dunlops.  Other Senators worked in these plants.  We know what these losses meant to Cork at that time.</P>
      <P>A task force was set up by the Government in 1984 to look at facilities to see what could be done to improve the situation in Cork.  I pushed strongly for a freeport facility.  I am delighted to say that in 1986 a Bill was put through this House &mdash; it was one of those initiated in this House between 1983 and 1987 &mdash; and it was agreed in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The freeport was not a novel idea; free ports existed in Europe, particularly in Rotterdam but there was no freeport in Britain when I pushed for this facility in 1983.  Since 1984 Liverpool has been a freeport, with a turnover to date of over <Col N="624" /> £1 billion.  It was established on 600 acres and in 1993 another 800 acres was made a free zone.  It has 80,000 square metres of covered accommodation with another 17,500 being built at the moment.  That is the idea I had for Cork freeport.</P>
    <P>Sadly, the 1983-87 Government was not prepared to give all the tax facilities needed to get this going.  The task force report said we should be prepared to give incentives.  The excuse given by relevant Ministers of all Governments was that an EC regulation would not allow it.  I fought hard and we got VAT at point of entry eliminated; that was a help, at no extra cost to the State.</P>
    <P>Look at the Dublin region and the International Financial Services Centre built in 1987.  I was told by the Taoiseach of the day and by Members of the Government that under no circumstances would the 10 per cent corporation tax be extended to the services area.  I assumed that because of an EC regulation it could not be done.  Yet, as early as January 1987 the commitment was given to Dublin for the Financial Services Centre.  Just as the 10 per cent corporation tax operates in Shannon because of its airport, Cork could be covered by the 10 per cent corporation tax because of the importance of the shipping industry there.  There will be no cost to the State.  Why should Cork not benefit from this?</P>
    <P>As a representative of Cork I emphasise that the facilities are there, and many people now use this port.  In the summer of this year the biggest ever ferry in Europe will be using the port of Cork. The benefits of this would be even greater if we had a freeport where people could get the facilities available in Liverpool and Rotherdam.  Why was that argument not made?  A recommendation was made in 1979 to the relevant Minister asking that the 10 per cent corporation tax be given for all services in the free zone area.  Some 1,080 acres were zoned.  All of Cork might as well have been included because it does not mean anything.  In theory it sounds well but in practice it does not work.  Why has the 10 per cent corporation tax not been given in this case?  The IDA say that it would have <Col N="625" /> enormous benefits for the region and I emphasise the region.</P>
    <P>I am the person who encouraged the concept of a freeport status for Cork. Legislation was passed to provide for this but unfortunately, it was not followed through.  That was despicable, particularly when I was told by the relevant Minister that under no circumstances could a 10 per cent corporation tax be granted anywhere on the island of Ireland.  Yet, three months later it was granted in the Dublin region.  I do not wish to knock other places.  I like to see things moving in any part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that 75,000 tonne ships can now berth in the port of Cork.  It is a trans-shipment area for mainland Europe.  This facility has greatly increased traffic from the American coast, from Europe and from the rest of the world for trans-shipment to the mainland of Europe.  Giving us the freeport facility would not cost the Government any money but it would give people the incentive to exploit opportunities. For example, 25 million gallons of water are available every 24 hours in Cork harbour for trans-shipment, but is the opportunity there for the people to come in and set up the necessary structures? Is the opportunity there for trans-shipment of cars from Ireland to places in Europe?  Many cars have been shipped through the Cork area in the past 12 months because of an ongoing dispute in the Dublin region.  We have proved we can handle the traffic.  The opportunities are there for people with the initiative, particularly in the services area.  I emphasise the services area because whether we like it or not our main industries are service industries.  We do not have a solid manufacturing base at this time.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to granting the free zone area of Cork a 10 per cent corporation tax rate.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I think you for your kind remarks and your warm welcome to me on my visit to the Seanad.  I also thank Senator Cregan for his kind remarks.  We <Col N="626" /> both come from the same parish and have the interests of Cork foremost in our minds.</P>
      <P>The appointments of a manager and of a Freeport Advisory Committee were announced early in 1989.  Following its establishment the committee commissioned from the IDA a study to develop a marketing strategy to maximise the development of the freeport and from a UK media consultant a study to identify the investments needed to establish the freeport in the US, European and Far East markets.</P>
      <P>The IDA study concluded that a vibrant and attractive freeport regime could be a key marketing focus in helping to attract enterprises and investment to Ringaskiddy but that this could only happen if there was an attractive financial package available to industry locating in the freeport.  It also concluded that unless an attractive incentive package could be put in place the freeport concept, as applied to Ringaskiddy, would fail to realise the potential to attract development to Ireland and to Cork.</P>
      <P>The media study concluded that significant investment in media coverage was required if the freeport was to be successfully promoted and establised in the marketplace.  However, such investment would not be productive unless and until the incentive package was sufficiently attractive.</P>
      <P>In light of these studies, the Freeport Advisory Committee recommended that: (a) warehousing, servicing and trans-shipment activities at Ringaskiddy should qualify for 10 per cent corporation profits tax as is available at Shannon; (b) adequate resources should be made available for the marketing and development of the freeport by the committee or the IDA or both; and (c) Ringaskiddy should be a designated area under the Underdeveloped Areas Act to allow for higher levels of grant assistance and qualification for rates remission for some activities locating within the freeport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the extension of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax the Minister for Finance was unable to accede to this due to the general policy <Col N="627" /> of non-extension of VAT zero-rating.  He also stated that any analogy with Shannon was not sustainable as Shannon has existed as an integrated entity since the 1940s and has had special tax treatment since 1958.</P>
    <P>The second recommendation was that adequate resources be made available for the marketing and development of the freeport either through the freeport manager or the IDA or both.  The marketing and development of the freeport and Cork Harbour Commissioners in general is the responsibility of the IDA and Cork Harbour Commissioners.  The commissioners market the portal facilities for the normal trade and traffic activities of the ferry and deep water terminals and the IDA have primary responsibility for the attraction of port-related industries. The freeport, as well as conferring specific tax advantages on qualifying companies within the area, also has many marketable attractions, for example, State infrastructural services, including water, effluent and drainage systems, natural gas, electricity, roads, airport and telecommunications, skilled labour and social and recreational amenities.</P>
    <P>The third recommendation does not fall within my area of responsibility but I understand that the Freeport Advisory Committee have been in contact with the relevant Minister on this issue.</P>
    <P>In August 1989 the freeport area was extended by 131 acres to include lands occupied by the existing industries of Angus Fine Chemicals Limited, Mech Con. Limited, since liquidated, Moog Limited, Pfizer Chemical Corporation and Pfizer Sales Company Limited.  One new company has set up business in the freeport, i.e. Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), the American owned agri-chemical conglomerate which took over the Citric Acid Division of Pfizer; another, Sandoz Ringaskiddy Limited is due to commence operations there by the end of this year.  In addition a Taiwanese consortium has bought a 50 acre site from the IDA, they have an option on a further 150 acres and have plans to construct a <Col N="628" /> multi-million pound industrial park in the Ringaskiddy Freeport area.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, attracting industry to locate in the Ringaskiddy Freeport and Cork Harbour in general is the responsibility of the IDA, the Freeport Advisory Committee and Cork Harbour Commissioners.  I have full confidence in the efforts of the agencies concerned.</P>
    <P>The developments in Cork Harbour are not solely dependent on the Freeport concept but with the advent of the Single Market the advantages of Freeports are much reduced.  I am glad to be able to say that Cork Harbour was a major beneficiary of the first Operational Programme on Peripherality, 1989-1993. This week I announced that Cork Harbour would be a major beneficiary of Cohesion Funds in 1993 (£1.85 million). The Government is committed to the development of our key commercial seaports, and I am committed on a national and regional basis to the development of Cork Harbour.</P>
    <P>The advent of the low river crossing will make the lower harbour at Ringaskiddy a more attractive site for development.  I am committed to the development of Ringaskiddy and at present negotiations are taking place with another important industry which may locate there.  I thank the Senator for his comments &mdash; he can be assured of my support at all times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his considerations.  I know he is committed to Ringaskiddy.  I am delighted to hear that discussions are taking place with another industry which may locate in the Ringaskiddy area.  However, the impression that the freeport concept is now losing its advantage is not true.  If the 10 per cent corporation tax is not the responsibility of the Minister's Department I ask him to make the argument to the Minister for Finance, for the retention of that tax.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  He is an old and valued colleague and friend and will do a terrific job in his Department.  Senator Cregan deserves credit for having pushed the idea of a freeport in Cork for many years. I accepted a nomination to the freeport by the then Fianna Fáil Government as a Labour Party member as did former Deputy Coveney of Fine Gael.  I am still committed to the idea of a freeport and I hope, with the assistance of the Minister, to help create the sort of activity that Senator Cregan has described so eloquently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister with whom I had some good times in the other House.  I hope to rejoin him there in the not too distant future.  I congratulate the Minister on his reappointment; I know he will fulfill his role with great distinction.  The Minister will remember that one of the first functions he had to attend as Minister in the previous Government was in Cavan-Monaghan where he launched the Leader programme.  The Minister had, as usual, a prepared script with him, but he dispensed with it in favour of a heart warming speech which was well received by everybody there.  He showed a deep knowledge of the objectives of the Leader programme and his stature increased enormously after that incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My motion concerns the building regulations adopted by the Department in 1992.  I compliment the Department on <Col N="630" /> the regulations applying to dwellings for humans which provide an important modicum of protection &mdash; and may help to avert accidents.</P>
    <P>I disagree, however, with the requirement for a fire certificate when making a grant application for cattle housing, not because cattle should not be protected from fire but because of the nature of the housing in question.</P>
    <P>In order to get a fire certificate for cattle housing one has to make a separate application, exactly like an application for planning permission, costing either £1.75 per square metre or £100 &mdash; whichever sum is the greater.  That is a large amount of money given that cattle houses are between 500 and 700 square metres in area; the cost of a certificate for a reasonably sized cattle house could be in excess of £1,000, a remarkable amount of money for an unnecessary certificate. The Minister will agree that the materials used in the construction of cattle housing, namely, mass concrete, steel and iron, are relatively fire proof compared with the materials and furniture found in houses, hotels and guesthouses.</P>
    <P>I wish to point out that before determining a planning application the planning authority requires its fire officer to make a report.  In the case of a grant application for cattle housing the fire officer having sent specifications to the applicant should write a fire certificate on demand and free of charge.  Alternatively, the requirement that a fire certificate be supplied when applying for a grant for cattle housing should be dispensed with entirely.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister will respond in a constructive and realistic manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senator Cotter for his kind comments regarding my reappointment.  I am glad also to respond to the question he has tabled out of concern for farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grant aid is available from my Department under the farm improvement programme and the scheme for the control of farmyard pollution for capital investment <Col N="631" /> in farm structures.  The objective of these schemes is to assist farmers to develop the structure of their farms in order to improve farm efficiency and reduce production costs, improve living and working conditions on the farm, provide improved animal welfare and farm hygiene conditions and to protect and improve the environment through the control of farmyard pollution.</P>
    <P>My Department, through its farm development service, must ensure that all grant-aided structures are built to acceptably high standards.  In this regard we have prepared some 30 detailed specifications for all types of farm structures. These are provided free to all applicants. While responsibility for the soundness of the construction lies with the applicant every project is surveyed by my Department's staff to ensure that the relevant specifications have been complied with.</P>
    <P>My Department must ensure that all approved buildings have complied with all the relevant laws and mandatory codes.  Again the onus for ensuring compliance with these is a matter for the applicant.  Therefore, in relation to the planning Acts my Department does not grant-aid those farm buildings that come within the ambit of these Acts without ensuring that permission has been obtained.</P>
    <P>In general, only the larger farm complexes are affected by planning controls. Even for these cases specially low rates of charges are applied.  For example, each separate building has a maximum fee of only £40 for a planning application, and the maximum possible fee per development is £150.</P>
    <P>With regard to safety legislation and codes &mdash; electrical standards for example &mdash;we must also ensure that the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland rules have been followed before grant-aid is paid. On the matter of fire certificates, these are required under new building regulations introduced in 1992.  Detached farm buildings with a floor area not exceeding 300 square metres are exempted from the requirements of the building regulations.  The requirement to <Col N="632" /> provide a fire safety certificate therefore applies to farm buildings in excess of 300 square metres whether new or by extension.</P>
    <P>For the reasons already outlined, my Department requires a fire certificate as evidence of compliance with these regulations in respect of buildings which come within the remit of the Building Control Act.  With regard to charges for this certificate, when the building regulations were first introduced in the summer of 1992, the standard charge of £1.75 per square metre applied to agricultural buildings and non-agricultural buildings alike.  However, following consultations between my Department and the Department of the Environment, the charges were reduced for agricultural buildings to exactly the level charged for planning permission i.e. £40 per building with a maximum possible charge of £150 per development.</P>
    <P>In direct response to Senator Cotter's question I can inform the House that I have this evening discussed the matter with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh.  We agree that there are certain livestock buildings which, because of their structure, do not constitute a fire hazard and should be excluded from the fire certificate requirement. I have asked the Minister for the Environment to have his Department officials urgently investigate the possibility of such exclusion.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Cotter for tabling the question because I know that it is a matter of great concern to farmers who are involved in the provision of livestock buildings on their farms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>May I briefly reply to the Minister to say that this response is no more than I expected from him and my introductory remarks about him were appropriate.  I know that farmers will be happy with this sensible solution.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 11 March 1993.</P>
