      <P>We wish also to express our thanks to the Leas-Chathaoirleach, your most able assistant, and to all those who serve as Chairpersons for ensuring that the House is run in the way that it should be.  I wish all Senators a very peaceful and happy Christmas.</P>
      <P>I am sure Members wish me to mention, in particular, the staff of the Seanad, those who keep this House in order.  On behalf of all Members, I extend our best wishes to the ushers, the transcribers, the press and the media and wish them a happy and peaceful Christmas and a prosperous New Year.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 1.  I suggest that we allow ten minutes to each spokesperson and five minutes thereafter.  A Senator on the Government side will conclude within seven minutes of 12.10.  All Stages of No. 2 shall be taken together without debate and shall be decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to recommendations, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance.  We will then deal with all Stages of No. 3, with the contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed 20 minutes and all Senators thereafter will be allowed 15 minutes.</P>

    <Title>Joint Declaration on Peace in Northern Ireland: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann endorses and supports the Joint Declaration on Peace issued by the Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, and Prime Minister John Major.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach to the House in this Christmas week and we are honoured to have him here for this important debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity before the Christmas recess to speak on the Joint Declaration for Peace.</P>
      <P>I am honoured to be in the Seanad, whose Members, I know, are deeply committed to the achievement of peace.</P>
      <P>Senators have in their midst Senator Gordon Wilson, who lost his daughter in one of the most harrowing incidents of the entire Troubles, the massacre at Enniskillen in 1987.  The dignity he showed, then and subsequently, gave a tremendous example to everyone, as did his advocacy of peace.  His presence in this House is an acknowledgement and a symbol of the overwhelming desire throughout this island for peace without preconditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1901" /> In any debates or discussions we may have on the establishment of peace, let us never forget the innocent victims on all sides, and also the continuing sorrow of their families and friends, which will mark them for the rest of their lives.  But we should also be determined to ensure that there will be no more victims to mourn over.</P>
    <P>Let us ask that while this Joint Declaration is being carefully considered there be no more loss of life, or injury, or destruction.  Experience has shown over and over again that any act of violence is capable of causing major tragedy, and of setting off a chain reaction.  There was a near miss only three days ago in Derry and more recently in Belfast.  Few things are more poignant than needless loss of life, when peace is within our grasp.</P>
    <P>The central idea behind the Peace Declaration is that the problems of Northern Ireland, however deep and intractable, however difficult to reconcile, have to be resolved exclusively by political and democratic means.  The continuation of the Union, or the establishment of a sovereign united Ireland, in either case by agreement and consent, are matters to be determined democratically in the future by round table negotiation.  The democratic path is open equally to either future.  The Joint Delcaration is a charter for peace and democracy in the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The violence which has left such deep scars on all sides can have no place in settling divisions between Irish people. This Declaration puts beyond all doubt that overcoming these divisions is now the only meaningful Nationalist agenda, since it is the task of winning consent all round, and not now the removal of any external impediment, which is necessary to realise the goals cherished by Nationalists.</P>
    <P>Just as the political problems can only be solved over time, so also the many detailed security questions that will arise in the aftermath of a permanent cessation of violence cannot be settled at this stage. They will require detailed consideration and discussion, which can only take place, once violence has ceased.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1902" /> Peace is a very simple but also a very powerful idea whose time has come. There are no strings attached.  Peace, as I conceive it, was defined by Shakespeare thus:</P>
    <P>A peace is of the nature of a conquest;</P>
    <P>For then both parties nobly are subdued,</P>
    <P>And neither party loser.</P>
    <P>The Joint Declaration provides from everyone's point of view a noble means of establishing the first step towards lasting peace with justice in Ireland.  It is a statement of principles, not a basis for negotiation. The next stage of negotiations can only come after peace has first been established.</P>
    <P>We have to turn our backs on the zero-sum mentality, whereby Unionists can only gain when Nationalists lose, or <i>vice versa</i>.  Nationalists should judge the Joint Declaration on its merits, and not on how Unionists react to it.  Similarly, Unionists should judge it objectively, and not by the effect that it has on Nationalists. What we want to do is to create a future, where both communities gain, in place of the continuing violence, where they both continue to lose.</P>
    <P>What I principally want to address today are hesitations about peace, from whatever side they come.  The Joint Declaration recognises the legitimate aims of Irish nationalism, and shows how they can be achieved by dialogue and through the democratic process.  There is no need for violence, as the Declaration makes clear.  If that principle were accepted by everyone on the Nationalist side, there would be no excuse for violence in the other community.</P>
    <P>It is claimed that the right of self-determination of the people of the island of Ireland, acknowledged by the British Government for the first time in this Declaration, is contradicted by the requirement of concurrent North-South consent. There is no such contradiction.  I ask people to look at any country that has been partitioned this century, such as Germany, China, Korea, Yemen or Cyprus.  They have been or could be peacefully reunited only by the two parts <Col N="1903" /> each deciding to come together.  The exercise of self-determination, as envisaged in the Declaration, is therefore absolutely in keeping with international practice.  It is also in keeping with the Joint Hume-Adams statement of 21 April 1993, when they said: &ldquo;The exercise of self-determination is a matter for agreement between the people of Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government would like to emphasise this.  The Joint Declaration makes it very clear that its objective is to heal the divisions among the people of Ireland.  It also makes clear that it is for the people of Ireland, North and South, to achieve such agreement without any outside impediment.  The British Government has also declared that it will encourage, enable and facilitate such agreement, and that it will endorse whatever agreement emerges and take the necessary steps to implement it.</P>
    <P>It is self-evident that such an agreement should offer no threat to any section of the people, and would have to have the allegiance and agreement of the people in both parts of Ireland.  It follows from that, as both Governments have made clear, that it must have the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  This respect for the consent of the people of Northern Ireland is freely given and totally in keeping with the principle of the exercise of self-determination by the divided people of this island.</P>
    <P>The Joint Declaration does not explicitly refer to either Articles 2 or 3 or to the Government of Ireland Act, 1920. In reality, both are present in the Declaration.</P>
    <P>As John Hume has said, this is the most comprehensive Declaration made by a British Government in 70 years.  It reflects the positive spirit of much of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, in holding open the future achievement of a united Ireland by agreement, and by its positive encouragement of agreement between the people of Ireland, North and South.  It envisages the creation of institutions and structures, which would enable them to work together in all areas of common interest, but, unlike the <Col N="1904" /> Government of Ireland Act, 1920, the Joint Declaration envisages the possibility of not just a united Ireland but a sovereign united Ireland being achieved by agreement and consent.  If that were to come about, it would involve, of course, the repeal of Article 75 of the Government of Ireland Act.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 7 of the Joint Declaration, I speak, in the context of developing new relationships of trust, &ldquo;of the time having come to consider how best the hopes and identities of all can be expressed in more balanced ways, which no longer engender division&rdquo;.  I go on to confirm that &ldquo;in the event of an overall settlement, the Irish Government will, as part of a balanced constitutional accommodation, put forward and support proposals for change in the Irish Constitution which would fully reflect the principle of consent in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Without qualifying that commitment, I think it would be fair to say that I detect some division of opinion among Unionists of the value for them of pursuing this argument further, which has been aptly described as a &ldquo;green herring&rdquo;. The point can be validly made that the articles have existed for over 50 years largely without notice.  Certainly, the Provisional IRA never sought justification for their campaign in a Constitution, which they do not fully recognise to this day.</P>
    <P>It is consistently overlooked that according to the Supreme Court the principle of consent enshrined in the Anglo-Irish Agreement is eminently compatible with Articles 2, 3 and 29 of the Constitution. Northern Unionists may not fully appreciate that judicial interpretation, over the years, has enlarged and enriched the Constitution, as it has also done in the United States.</P>
    <P>In virtue of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Irish Government is already bound by international law to act in accordance with the principle of consent. We are now also bound by solemn political commitments repeated many times in the course of this Declaration to pursue unity, only in a manner consistent with the principle of consent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1905" /> Consent is the bedrock of democracy. There was never at any stage, and this was well known to all, any possibility that the Irish Government, let alone the British Government, would be prepared to depart from or override the terms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The consent clause is not defined in terms of a veto for one community, but in terms of the wishes of a majority or a greater number of the people.  That is and remains the formal position.  But in the course of the Declaration I also recognise the reality, drawn from the lessons of history and especially of Northern Ireland, that stability and wellbeing will not be found under any political system which is refused allegiance or rejected on grounds of identity by a significant minority of those governed by it.  I go on to say that, for that reason, it would be wrong to attempt to impose a united Ireland, in the absence of the freely given consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>A major concern is that the requirement of consent so defined, which applies to constitutional change, but not to other forms of political progress, could lead to total political immobility.  I believe these fears are groundless.  The Declaration very clearly commits both Governments to promote co-operation at all levels between North and South.  It also commits the British Government to achieve agreement among all people who inhabit the island, and &ldquo;to encourage, facilitate and enable the achievement of such agreement over a period.&rdquo;  They accept that such agreement may, as of right, take the form of agreed structures for the island as a whole, including a united Ireland, and they reaffirm as a binding obligation to introduce the necessary legislation to give effect to this, or equally to any measure of agreement or future relationships in Ireland which the people living in Ireland may themselves freely so determine without external impediment. They also express the support of the people of Britain for agreement between the people of Ireland on how they may live together in harmony and in partnership with respect for their diverse traditions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1906" /> As Peter Temple-Morris, the British Co-Chairman of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body has so aptly put it, the language of the Declaration quite clearly makes both Governments persuaders for agreement between the people of Ireland.  But as I said in my Árd-Fheis speech, &ldquo;people have democratic rights, and we cannot predetermine for them, without their consent, the political structures under which they will be governed.&rdquo; Nor can we impose an artificial time limit within which majority consent must be achieved.  The dynamic for progress must reside in the full use of the democratic political process, in the underlying changes in Irish society, North and South, and in our external environment.</P>
    <P>The Joint Declaration is in my view fully consistent with both the spirit and the substance of public statements of John Hume and Gerry Adams, but is of course much more broadly based, reflecting wide consultations which the Irish Government undertook with all sections of the community in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of the Joint Declaration as a basis for a permanent cessation of violence is only the first stage in the Peace Process.  We will then be free to give our undivided attention to the long overdue task of reshaping our relationships on the island through structures which match the current possibilities for progress, some of which have been obscured or stifled by the continued violence.  In this next stage the Government would establish, in consultation with other parties, a forum for peace and reconciliation, to make recommendations on ways in which agreement and trust between both traditions of Ireland can be guaranteed and established.  It would enable the democratic parties involved to consider how the momentum for peace could best be harnessed and consolidated.</P>
    <P>The work done in the three-stranded talks process last year has, I believe, the potential for significant further development in conditions of peace.  The talks have already been through the preliminary stage of enabling each tradition <Col N="1907" /> to define for the other the positions which must be reconciled in a lasting settlement. Through those talks all sides have already accepted the need &ldquo;to achieve a new beginning for relationships&rdquo; between the two communities in Northern Ireland, between North and South and between the two islands.  It would, I think, be widely accepted that the North-South relationship or, more accurately, that between unionism and nationalism on this island, lies at the heart of the search for lasting agreement.</P>
    <P>With the Declaration as our starting point, and the momentum of peace to carry us forward, we could return to the table for inclusive and far-reaching negotiations and with greatly enhanced prospects of success.  We could hope to create new structures and arrangements to reflect both the recognition of Nationalist rights enshrined in the Declaration and the principle of consent, which guarantees Unionists, in turn, that the future they are invited to share will always be based on unforced and ungrudging respect from the nationalist tradition for their rights, identity and ethos.</P>
    <P>These structures could channel and give expression to the dynamic of new relationships already inherent in the changing circumstances in Northern Ireland and between North and South. They could be the vehicle for new developments in North-South co-operation, particularly in the economic field, where there is so much unrealised potential. They could reflect also the new realities which flow from the development of European Union, which is changing fundamentally the nature and context both of North-South and British-Irish relationships.  It is progressively dissolving barriers on this island to the point that the checkpoints created for security purposes are now almost the only tangible reminder of a border the traveller meets on a journey between North and South.  I believe peace is the key which unlocks this potential for positive change in a way that will benefit everyone living on this island and advance very significantly <Col N="1908" /> the prospects of a lasting political settlement.</P>
    <P>Next month, the Irish Government is due to consider in depth whether to renew section 31 of the Broadcasting Act. Irrespective of present events, it had always been intended that that decision would be considered on its merits and in the light of the prevailing security situation at the time.</P>
    <P>The most important priority for all parties will be to consolidate the peace process and to build public confidence in a lasting peace.  Everyone has a responsibility in this.  The solution of many difficult security issues will need to take place in an atmosphere of confidence-building on all sides.  The Irish Government will play an important role in this, both in our jurisdiction, and in the context of the Anglo-Irish Conference. Our approach will be enlightened and pragmatic.  We will advocate and support whatever measures can most quickly contribute to healing divisions and putting the legacy of the past 25 years behind us for ever as quickly as possible.  In this area, as in every other area, a balanced approach will be essential.  The qualities of justice and prudence as well as the spirit of reconciliation and mutual forgiveness between communities must all be present.</P>
    <P>I welcome the positive response the Declaration has received from so many quarters North and South and from so many political leaders and friends of Ireland around the world.  John Hume has played a particularly crucial role in the development of this peace initiative over the past five years.  But James Molyneaux and John Alderdice have also played a vital and constuctive role in making this initiative possible together with many church and community leaders. There are few, if any precedents, for the degree of cross-community political support that this initiative has received.  An opinion poll here showed that 97 per cent of the public favoured peace on foot of the Joint Declaration. The initiative has also received worldwide backing from the European Union, <Col N="1909" /> from the US President and many other Governments from India to Australia. Everyone wants to see this conflict come to an end.</P>
    <P>The elements necessary for a decision are all there, but it may take time to form a view that will command a consensus. Space should be allowed, provided that people are not being killed.</P>
    <P>There are dangers and no advantages to be gained from unduly extended or prolonged deliberation.  The principles are clear.  Negotiations will follow peace. None of us can ensure that the course of events will allow the present opportunity to be held open indefinitely.  Opportunity comes to pass, and not to pause.  The people of this country are impatient to move ahead to a much more positive stage, where real constructive work can begin on reconciling the two traditions.</P>
    <P>The Joint Declaration is a charter for peace.  I hope that it will soon be accepted by all on that basis, so that the real process of building a just and lasting peace can begin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me welcome the Taoiseach to the House.  This is an important debate at a very important time in the history of the country.  By any measure the Downing Street Declaration is a major achievement.  In particular it is a tribute to the two Prime Ministers and to the hard work and persistence of all those involved.  It is a wise document because it is not a threatening document, or it should not be so.  For the Unionists, the Declaration does not breach the Republic of Ireland Act, 1949 which guarantees the continuance of the Union. Nor does it breach the Anglo Irish Agreement which ensured that no change would take place without the consent of a majority.  In the Declaration each of these aspects is recognised and neither is threatened.  The Official Unionist Party has recognised this fact.  Unfortunately, Dr. Paisley still seems to have his own agenda.  From a Nationalist point of view the agreement gives Sinn Fein a chance to come in from the cold, a chance to have its aspirations accepted as a legitimate <Col N="1910" /> political objective and a chance to win its point by persuasion and by politics.</P>
      <P>However, nobody should exaggerate the importance or significance of where we now are.  We are really only beginning the hard and difficult work.  There was euphoria last week which was based on hope and relief as much as anything else, but behind the euphoria of last week there must be the realisation that we are merely at the beginning of a process; we probably have not even yet entered the framework through which real progress can be made.  It is a very delicate balance. A great deal can go wrong.  There are many who will do what they can to ensure that things do go wrong.  This process has some very powerful enemies.  One had only to listen to the television news yesterday evening to see this.  We saw Dr. Paisley thundering about treason and poison; we saw the same old hatred, the same destructive fury about to be unleashed again.  Yesterday too we heard Mr. Adams making demands which neither Government could or should accept.  I am happy to say that neither Government did accept the demands made by Mr. Adams last evening.  Sinn Féin is not a sovereign Government; it is not yet a normal political party.  It has the opportunity to become a normal political party but there is still a long way to go on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also last evening on the television news we saw evidence that the prize of peace is infinitely worth striving for.  We saw the bereaved widows and the orphans of some of those who were murdered in the North.  Their meeting with our President yesterday was moving beyond words.  We saw Cathy Mahon whose father was gunned down for no other reason than that he was a Catholic. We saw the young Lavery child whose father was shot while the child was on his knee, again for no reason.  We saw the mother of that child and heard of her heartbreak.  We heard her saying how quickly and easily people forget the victims of this conflict once the funerals are over.  On television last night we saw the tears and the sheer waste and all the people in the North have had to endure these past 25 years.  That is why I rejoice <Col N="1911" /> that both Governments have made peace their first and overriding priority.</P>
    <P>This morning the Taoiseach stressed the constitutional and political developments which are possible within the process but we must never forget that the enormous difficulties are as much psychological as they are political or constitutional. We, the politicians of the Republic, are not trusted by large numbers of people and the politicians of Northern Ireland.  It may be unfair but it is a fact and it is a powerful barrier to speedier progress.  The reality is that for all political parties here consent is at the core of their Northern policy.  The reality is that a very large majority of people here do not much care what sort of political system operates in Northern Ireland so long as it is acceptable to both communities there.  That is the truth.</P>
    <P>Peace is our priority and we can live with any political system which has the acceptance of the majority of the two communities in Northern Ireland.  But how do we persuade the people of Northern Ireland of our bona fides in this matter?  There is no easy way.  There are all the ordinary ways of talk, of dialogue, of taking care about what we say, that there is no triumphalism, no &ldquo;closing time&rdquo; Republicanism, no talk which can threaten or inflame the situation in Northern Ireland and also, perhaps, a little less complacency among ourselves about the need to make changes, the speed of change and the need to give a lead in making change.</P>
    <P>There is one inescapable fact about the present process, that any lasting settlement must be underwritten and made effective by the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland.  That is why nothing we do should be allowed to undermine the leaders of the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland in any way.  The process will stand or fall in Northern Ireland, not here and not in London.  If it cannot work in Northern Ireland then it will not work. If it is to work in Northern Ireland the constitutional parties must be given every support to help it do so.  In particular we <Col N="1912" /> must encourage the Constitutional parties to get back to their negotiations.</P>
    <P>A great deal of progress was made in the Strands I, II and III talks which ended last year.  A great deal of progress has been made since then in the discussions with the Northern Minister, Michael Ancram, far greater perhaps than is realised, and it is time that that progress and that work was exploited and built upon not least because if the process fails the burden will be ever greater on the shoulders of the constitutional parties. If the paramilitaries do not avail of the opportunity, if the peace process should fail &mdash; there is nothing inevitable about its success &mdash; then we must be certain that the constitutional parties have not been weakened in the entire process.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous responsibility on the business and the professional classes in Northern Ireland to actively support the peace process and the constitutional parties.  For too long the middle classes in Northern Ireland have opted out in comfort, taken the benefits and put very little back into their communities.  Now is their real test.  The politicians are trying to achieve peace.  The Church leaders are leading selflessly and nobly in their efforts to achieve peace.  The community groups are also working hard to bring about peace, understanding and reconciliation. Now it is up to the business and professional classes in Northern Ireland to throw their weight and support fully behind the peace process.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the debate has to be truncated, but I realise many people want to contribute.  I want to make two brief points.  No Government has ever got such co-operation from the Opposition in regard to this issue.  There have been no hand trips or ambushes.  The support and co-operation has been straightforward because we all recognise the importance of the peace process for the country and for our future.  However, that support is also symbolic.  It is important that the world should see that within our Parliament and our people there is unity of purpose on this issue.  The Taoiseach must also be generous in regard to this issue.  There must be consultation and <Col N="1913" /> involvement, not least to prevent misunderstandings which could so easily sour into differences which, in turn, could become irreconcilable.  Having regard to the histories of the Opposition parties, their experience in the process in the past, their views and relationships with parties in Northern Ireland, they have a contribution to make.  A wise Taoiseach would recognise this point and make use of it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned the proposed forum.  However, he did not elaborate to any great extent other than what he said in regard to it in the other House. The notion of the forum is still vague.  I sound a warning note about the proposed forum.  If it is merely a Nationalist forum, it will not be worth having.  It could be counterproductive and increase the differences between the two communities. If the Taoiseach is considering the New Ireland Forum as a model for the proposed forum, I urge him to think again.  I was a member of the New Ireland Forum and that was an enriching experience. However, the New Ireland Forum was slow moving, cumbersome and open to being hijacked as, indeed, it was at the end of its days.  It may not be the best model to follow.  We cannot afford delay in respect of lengthy talks going nowhere. Direct negotiations may be more effective.</P>
    <P>I have had an opportunity to speak on the subject in a superficial way.  We commend what the Taoiseach is doing and are happy to lend our support to this motion.  We remind him and the House that the euphoria should not blind us to the fact that we are at a beginning and no further, but we wish the Taoiseach well in the peace process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for accommodating me by allowing me to speak early in the debate as I have to go up North very shortly to accept an invitation which I cannot refuse.  I apologise for my absence to those Members who will be speaking later in the debate. I do not have any fancy words, I speak simply and from my heart.  Since I came here the Taoiseach has given me all types <Col N="1914" /> of support and backup, but he has not given me the services of a speech writer. I shall talk to him about this after Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with keen interest to the Taoiseach and I thank him for his kind personal words to me.  I thank the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and their team for keeping their promise that the Government would keep Northern Ireland and peace there at the top of its agenda.  It has kept that promise.  I thank the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and their team also for producing, with the British Prime Minister, the Secretary of State and their team the Joint Declaration of the two sovereign Governments. I fully support it and will encourage it.  It seems to be fair and openhanded and, above all, honest.  It does not claim to be the ultimate solution. One does not solve in seven pages of typescript on one day a 300 years old problem.  However, it provides a framework, a new beginning, for achieving peace.  There is something for everyone in the Declaration.  No one can win all or lose all.  I feel no less British and no less Irish because of it.  It provides an opportunity to communicate in a situation where there is so much to gain and so much to lose.  Nevertheless, its reception in Northern Ireland has not been as euphoric as in the Republic.  I understand the apprehension of folk in Northern Ireland.  They have lived and died under the bomb and the bullet for 25 years.  They say to me, &ldquo;who can you trust?  Who does not want peace&rdquo;?  For example, I trust the four Church leaders, the Cardinal, the Archbishop, the Moderator and the President of the Methodist Church.  If they can commend it, so can I. I welcome and support Mr. Molyneaux's acceptance of the Declaration which shows enormous courage on his part. Above all, it is the moment of truth for Sinn Féin and the IRA.  Have they the courage to accept this offer?  Will they see it as their best chance to find another and a better way?  I hope and pray that will be the case.  I would not want to threaten them or my words to be seen as <Col N="1915" /> a threat.  However, the world will not easily forgive them if we have another dead policeman, a lady of 93 dies as a result of being put out of her home in the middle of the night, a dead child, or a 20 year old student nurse or a town centre wrecked.  To the men of violence I appeal from the bottom of my heart, for God's sake, for Ireland's sake, for the sake of the Marie Wilsons of this world, their own dead, on the grounds of common humanity and a little of God's love in their hearts to lay down their arms now. It is the season of peace and goodwill. We have been singing and will sing carols, including one by Charles Wesley, and I make no apology for quoting him.  The two lines of his carol that leap out of the page at me and have done during the past week are as follows, &ldquo;Peace on earth and mercy mild God and sinners reconciled.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a humbling experience, particularly considering the simple dignity of those words.  On this historic occasion it is important to pay tribute to the statemanship demonstrated by the Taoiseach.  We are all extremely proud of the delicate and sensitive way in which he has handled the negotiations, in which he has been ably supported by the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to take up one of the points made by Senator Gordon Wilson, that is involvement of the Churches, which is important.  I speak as a member of the reformed Church in the South of Ireland and I frequently visit the North.  One thing I make it my business to do when speaking to meetings of my constituents in the graduate university of Dublin and to business people and professional groups is to make the point that people who are not of the majority tradition in this part of the country have an easy and <Col N="1916" /> pleasant life.  As a member of the Church of Ireland it is possible to play a full, active and positive role in the politics and in the social, cultural and intellectual life of this country.  There is little for my co-religionists in the North to be afraid of. Groups such as the Church of Ireland which are organised on a 32 county basis, although they have a preponderance in the North, have a significant presence, as the largest non-Catholic Church, in the South.  It is important that they, as an all Ireland institution, make their position very clear to fellow members of the Church of Ireland in the North.  They should indicate that there is nothing sinister or threatening in the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I say this particularly because some voices of the non-Catholic tradition have been strident in this regard, particularly the Reverend Ian Paisley who bears great responsibility for the events that have taken place in the last 25 years.  I remember when there were practical and pragmatic people in the North, people such as Terence O'Neill and Brian Faulkner, but each time such strand emerged in northern unionism it was nipped in the bud by the Reverend Ian Paisley and violence escalated as a result.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to the question of Articles 2 and 3, which was addressed by the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach indicated, for example, that while the Joint Declaration does not explicitly refer to Articles 2 and 3, they are included by implication.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>It is consistently overlooked that according to the Supreme Court the principle of consent enshrined in the Anglo-Irish Agreement is eminently compatible with Articles 2, 3 and 29 of the Constitution.  Northern Unionists may not fully appreciate that judicial interpretation, over the years, has enlarged and enriched the Constitution, as it has also done in the United States.</P>
    <P>That is very true, but from a Unionist point of view some of those enlargements and interpretations have been significantly worrying, particularly the <Col N="1917" /> decision in the McGimpsey case and other cases which appeared to place Articles 2 and 3 in a far more aggressive position than they had been previously understood to hold, that is, that Articles 2 and 3 constitute a constitutional imperative and that in certain circumstances a political justification may be entered for crimes of terrorism.</P>
    <P>These are deeply worrying matters to the Unionist community in the North.  It is time we considered this aspect.  It is moral, correct and appropriate that we do so, not just because we are looking up at the North, although we have to take that into account.  This Government certainly could sell a change in Articles 2 and 3.  It would be foolish to suggest that we can abandon our own people in the North or increase their sense of insecurity, but surely we could do what a number of us have been suggesting for many years, that is, amend Articles 2 and 3 by inserting a form of words along the lines that in any attempt to realise this aspiration the use of violence shall be prohibited.</P>

      <P>It was 11 o'clock on the Wednesday of 12 July when the phone rang in my home; it was my cousin, Leo, ringing to tell me that my brother-in-law had been shot dead and asking me to go to my sister, as I did half an hour later, to tell her that her husband and the father of her seven children had been killed by a gunman's bullet in Portadown just one hour earlier.  Her first words were &ldquo;Two year old John will never know his daddy&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very touched by the words of the Taoiseach when he said that few things are more poignant than the needless loss of life.  I speak as one of many families in this country, with the bitter experience of needless death.  I wish to make a plea today for a period of silence.  We should realise that to move forward from where we are now will involve discussion with Sinn Féin, directly or indirectly, and with the paramilitaries on both sides.  It is vital <Col N="1918" /> that this part of the process does not take place in public, as has been the case in the past week.</P>
    <P>It was right that the Downing Street Declaration take place in public so that everybody would know where both Governments stood and what point they had reached.  We have all been rather naive, as I have been, to expect that all that was needed was a matching public statement from Sinn Féin and the IRA and that peace would be delivered within days.  Since it is now very clear that that will not happen we should realise that what is needed is to put the veil back into its place.  It would be totally unproductive to engage in a public debate with the IRA and their proxies.  That is not the way to make progress but is the way to go backwards.</P>
    <P>When people communicate through the media they are speaking to their own constituents, not to the other side.  Public debate on an issue like this leads to a hardening of positions rather than a movement in those positions.  In addition, what public negotiation has to offer the IRA is a massive gain in credibility. We have gone quite far enough in that direction already.  We should not go further until there are some visible and tangible concessions from their side of the fence.  What we, the ordinary people of Ireland, should do now is lower our expectations.  We should stop holding our breath and try to get on with the rest of our lives for a little longer.  If we demand instant results and if we demand that the process continues in the full light of day we will be disappointed in the end.  We may see our hopes for an end to the violence evaporate because we pushed too hard and sought to move too fast. There is a time for talking in public and a time for taking action behind the scenes. This is not a time for megaphone diplomacy; it is a time for sadness.</P>

      <P>Any words that follow the statements made here this morning by the Taoiseach and Senator Gordon Wilson would be absolutely superfluous. We have heard two powerful statements from men of peace, and the Taoiseach has to be acknowledged as a man of peace.  I have spoken to some friends in the past number of days, one of whom said that a quantum leap has been made towards the achievement of peace on this island.  That comment was made by a member of the Protestant community who feels there is a place on this island for him and for everyone else regardless of which denomination they belong to. The Joint Peace Declaration is a charter for peace.  It will not solve all the problems associated with violence on this island, it is not the beginning of the end of violence but it is the beginning of a process towards the achievement of peace.</P>
      <P>We have been touched this morning by the personal experiences of Members on both sides of the House.  Most Members have been affected to some extent by the violence in the North of Ireland.  A friend of mine, an exceptional person, was killed at the top of a hill on the road into Newry.  The people travelling in that car, who were in a euphoric mood after an England-Ireland rugby match in Dublin, heard the noise of bullets and after the driver had pulled into his driveway his wife said to him that she thought she had been shot.  Having said that, she died.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people on this island demand peace.  Politicians cannot achieve peace. It is only the people who use guns who <Col N="1920" /> can bring about peace &mdash; if they lay down their guns we will have peace.  If there is such a thing as people power on this island then it should take over and tell these men of violence that they are no longer needed or wanted, if they ever were.  The peace process which has been started by the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Hurd and all those involved in the process have to be admired for the chance they are giving to this generation and future generations in Northern Ireland to live in a peaceful society, a necessity for all people.  The people of the North can now aspire to getting on with their lives in a peaceful society.  These aspirations should not be hampered by the men or women of violence. We should remember when we talk about violent people they can be of both sexes.</P>
    <P>In the past Irish politicians have been looked upon by people in the North of both persuasions as the godfathers of violent men.  I think it has now been proven that we in the South do not wish to rule over the people of the North but rather we want to live with them on this island in a peaceful manner.  The British and Irish Governments have gone a long way in negotiating the Joint Peace Declaration, which embodies the central ideal in the resolution of all the problems in regard to the North.  This declaration of principle is very important.</P>
    <P>Anything said after the remarks of the Taoiseach and Senator Gordon Wilson is superfluous.  I hope that peace will ensue from the excellent beginning which has been made in this Joint Peace Declaration. I ask everyone on this island over the next days and weeks to pray to whatever God they believe in for peace to ensue as a result of this declaration.</P>
    <P>I thank the Leader of the House for ensuring that this debate took place.  I also thank the Taoiseach for coming into the House to make this statement in what should be a quiet and peaceful week for him.  Over past weeks he has enhanced the office of Taoiseach and I wish him well in his endeavours in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is the first time in 12 years that I have seen such extraordinary unanimity not only in this House but also in the Dáil and among all democrats on this island on any issue.  It is very encouraging that there has not been in this House, nor, I gather, in the Dáil, a single dissenting voice on this Declaration.  That is something on which we will have to build.  It is also something about which we should be aware because it is probably unique.</P>
      <P>We should sound a word of warning about what has been happening since the Joint Peace Declaration.  To echo Senator Quinn's words, it would be better for the progress of peace if there was a period of relative silence by all the politicians on this island.  I accept that it is too much to expect them to be completely silent on an issue of such magnitude, but it is dangerous to have seen what amounts to public negotiations between the Provisional IRA and the Irish and British Governments during the last week.  We have seen what amounts to a shopping list from Mr. Adams expressed in the media.  We have got into the very thorny realm of an amnesty and the very difficult realm of section 31.  We have even started talking about the handing over of arms by the Provisional IRA.  It will do nothing for the peace process if Mr. Adams makes demands and the Taoiseach or Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs responds to them in the media.  This simply lifts Mr. Adams to a status which he does not yet merit.  As Senator Manning so rightly said, we have to remember that Sinn Féin is not a normal political party yet and that while this tremendous enthusiasm for and euphoria about peace exists people are still being killed on the streets of Derry and Belfast.  It was Dr. Joe Hendron who courageously and correctly last night pointed out the total hypocrisy of the IRA in carrying on what it calls a peace process while it is still killing British soldiers, civilians or anyone who gets in their way.  We must not fall into the trap at this very sensitive and delicate time of elevating the IRA to a status which it does not deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make one or two points <Col N="1922" /> about the Unionist community.  I completely agree with all those people who have said so emphatically that Mr. Molyneaux has shown great courage.  I do not think people in this part of Ireland appreciate the enormous difficulties which Unionist politicians have with a document of this sort.  A great number of Unionist politicians see this document, even in its mildest form, as deeply threatening. The courage which has been shown by them in not denouncing it, which would have been the easy way out for them, but rather holding the line as far as they can has to be recognised by us and we must not upset it.  We must never allow what happened in Dublin Castle in November 1992, where Unionists' fears and proposals were treated in a totally dismissive and wrong fashion, to happen again.  We must be aware that a proposal for what is termed a forum for peace and reconciliation is unlikely to be helpful if it is a pan-nationalist forum, as were the forums in 1984 and 1985.  The unionists must be included in such a forum and we must be sensitive to their fears.  Every move we make must be appreciative of the deep distrust which they hold for the Republic.</P>
    <P>We should acknowledge that there has been a sea change of opinion in the South in acknowledging the fears of the Unionists in Northern Ireland.  In recent years people in the South have begun to appreciate that Unionists are not monsters. This view has been ably and generously reflected in the Joint Peace Declaration.</P>

      <P>This document is a framework for peace, an enabling document which is not threatening and is all embracing.  It embraces the principle of consent.  The British Government declares that it has no strategic interest in Northern Ireland and the Irish Government declares that it is willing to <Col N="1923" /> put the principle of consent and Articles 2 and 3 &mdash; although they are not specified in the document &mdash; to the people of Ireland in an overall settlement context. These two principles contained in the document remove the fear felt by many people living in Northern Ireland for a very long time.  In that way it is an enabling document and it offers an opportunity for peace in a way that did not exist previously.  The document has been drawn up as a result of a huge amount of work that was done beforehand. If those weeks of discussions had not taken place this document could not have been the framework for peace that it is.  We must acknowledge the work that was done in the weeks leading up to the Joint Declaration as well as the work that now must be done in the weeks following it.</P>
      <P>The document offers an opportunity for peace, particularly to those who have been involved in violence.  What we must do as democratically elected politicians is reach out to the people of violence and ask them to grasp the opportunity for peace.  It is their opportunity for peace as well as ours.  We must ask them to listen to people who have direct experience of violence in their lives.  We must ask the terrorists to think about the thousands of people who have died in Northern Ireland and what it means to a family to lose a loved member of that family.  They must think of their own humanity and not in terms which do not allow them to see the humanity of the people on the other side.  That is the opportunity for peace that must be grasped by those people who would not have sought peace before in the way that those of us who have not been so directly involved have sought it.  We must reach out to those who have to join the democratic process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must acknowledge also that this Joint Declaration has been supported on all sides.  It has been supported by the Opposition parties here as well as in Britain.  We have been dwelling a lot on what is happening here but we must also acknowledge the courage of the British Government and the British Opposition <Col N="1924" /> for their part in this Joint Declaration. We must acknowledge also the support of leaders of political parties in Northern Ireland such as Jim Molyneaux, John Hume and John Alderdice.</P>
    <P>The work ahead will not be easy.  It is a week since the Joint Declaration was signed and we now must be patient, tolerant and, above all, we must trust one another in the crucial weeks ahead.  It will not be easy, it will be demanding and it will involve much detail and a great deal of trust.  This work must be carried out in an atmosphere where there will be no attempt to be the winner.  We must work in a spirit of no winners and no losers and, above all in a spirit of trust and co-operation.  The onus is on all of us to reach out in that way, to feel our own humanity and to feel the humanity of the people who have not always agreed with us and to work for peace in that framework.</P>

      <P>There are many people who wish to contribute to this debate so I will not delay the House.  I had the privilege of being present at the onset of talks between Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party and it was obvious from that very first meeting that Northern Ireland would occupy a priority position in the event of the formation of a Government and that they were determined to tackle the problem of violence on the island.</P>
      <P>I would praise the courage of Unionists such as James Molyneaux but I would praise also the courage of two rural Deputies, one who is Taoiseach and the other who is Tánaiste.  It is not easy coming from rural Longford or rural Kerry to carry the particular torch they have carried before the Declaration and since.  I applaud their courage for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer also to Senator Quinn's contribution.  As always, it contained real gems of wisdom.  Silence is golden in this case.  The Arab-Israeli conflict was not settled on the West Bank but in Norway. I have every reason to believe that the ANC-South African Government negotiations were as much part of the New York scene as they were of Johannesburg <Col N="1925" /> or elsewhere.  It is vital also that the question of surrendering arms and the question of prisoners should not be the subject of public debate at this time.  That is only building obstacles, not removing them. These are matters for another day.</P>
    <P>I wish to applaud not just the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil but also the Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael and the Independents all of whom, by their example, in this House, have set the tone for what hopefully will be the road to peace in this island.</P>

      <P>In the Taoiseach's presentation today he outlined again his views of the future.  He talked about new structures, using old structures and he mentioned one structure in particular, the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. That must be extended to involve the people outside the political process also. The forum should represent all shades of opinion on all sides of each community. We must hear the voices of the people on the street.  I believe the next step should be to tie in the Government's hopes and aspirations with the people on the ground.  My concern is that the people of the Falls and the Shankill are not aware of what is happening at State level.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Government have done excellent work but it is now time to bring in the ordinary people also.</P>

      <P>I echo what many other Senators have said about the fact that great progress has been made and great courage shown by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste during the past year.  The priority given to Northern Ireland by the Government was essential.  The remarks of Senator Magner, Senator Quinn and Senator Ross regarding the negotiations not taking place in the media are very important.  We cannot praise too highly the courage of all those involved but <Col N="1926" /> particularly the Northern Unionists who have supported the Declaration.  These include James Molyneaux, John Alderdice, Chris McGimpsey and indeed members of the SDLP who have not been mentioned such as Joe Hendron who shares a constituency with Gerry Adams and who has played such a courageous role in that area for a number of years.</P>
      <P>An important point which was raised by Senator Manning is the fact that middle class and professional people have been able to comfortably opt out of the problems in Northern Ireland.  They now must come forward and play their part.</P>
      <P>In regard to the forum, I do not see why it must be fixed in Dublin.  This forum, which is really spiritual at the moment, will hopefully become a physical entity.  Let us hope that the Unionists can be persuaded to take part in it.  If it should take place in our ecclesiastical capital, Armagh, I would hope that the Government would support that decision.</P>
      <P>As a doctor I am naturally proud of the tradition of medicine in this whole island.  I never want to experience again what I experienced 20 years ago when I attended a Surgical Research Society meeting in London.  Two young surgical registrars from the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast presented a paper on 82 cases of reconstruction of the knee joint following knee capping.  I wonder how many more knee caps were reconstructed in the past 20 years.  I want to see progress in a different field of medicine and in other areas also.</P>

      <P>As I watched the press conference in London it became apparent to me that there was a certain rapport between the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach.  It seemed clear to me also that they were intelligent men who were sincere, determined and, above all, courageous. The displayed great courage because they were asking us to do something which would be difficult at any time in life &mdash; but particularly in political life &mdash; not to change what we believed, but to change in our openness to each other, <Col N="1927" /> to take a look at the other person's point of view.  Great credit must redound on both these men.</P>
      <P>Credit is also due to the Tánaiste for his work.  I know perhaps a little more than some Members of the negotiations and their wide range.  Many unsung heroes have also contributed in their own way.  I should like to give particular credit to John Hume and Gerry Adams who also displayed a particular kind of courage. Anybody who knows the North of Ireland will know that they were not worried about losing a seat; they were perhaps worried about losing their lives.</P>
      <P>Above all credit is due to the Taoiseach because, without his tenacity and perseverance, we might not have had this Joint Declaration before Christmas.</P>
      <P>I will not engage in an analysis of the Joint Declaration.  It asks us to reflect, which is what we should do.  Anybody who will have heard me speak here before will realise that I come from a gaelic, nationalist background or perspective. There is enough in this document to give me hope that we can have peace on this island through peaceful means.</P>
      <P>There has been a general movement worldwide toward peace in recent times. For example, in the Holy Land, the <i>terra sante</i>, it was obvious to the Palestinians that they could not get back all they had lost and, to the Israelis, that they could not keep them in camps forever.  Therefore, they compromised.  Members know as well as I do that there may not be peace there today or even next year, but it will come eventually, a great beginning has been made and the world has asked that we give it a chance.  Similarly, in the case of South Africa, who would have thought a few years ago that Mr. Mandela and President De Klerk would have received the Nobel Peace Prize?  People had been oppressed for centuries in South Africa, again a great beginning has been struck there and the world has asked that we give it a chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly in our land, which has been troubled not merely for 25 or 70 years but for 800 years, the Prime Minister of <Col N="1928" /> a country that oppressed us for so long has met the Taoiseach and a very significant beginning has been made.  I do not believe that peace will come today or tomorrow &mdash; although I hope it does &mdash; it may not come for a year, but this beginning deserves a chance.  I appeal to all Christians, particularly in Northern Ireland, because I know of no Jews, Hindus or Buddhists involved in the fight, to lay down their arms.  I have met Christians from each extreme who pray on Sunday and shoot on Monday.  As Senator Wilson said, at this time of peace no better birthday present could one offer Christ, no better Christmas present could one offer one's neighbour than the gift of peace.</P>
    <P>I ask all Members to support this Joint Declaration so that at least a start can be made.  An expression is used by a certain section of the population &mdash; tiocfaidh ár lá &mdash; all Members know what that means. I hope, when that day comes, that it will have been through peaceful means. I support this Joint Declaration, it is a good document; I think everybody else should do likewise.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats welcome the Joint Declaration.  We regard it as balanced and even-handed between the two communities in Northern Ireland in terms of their political rights, identities and aspirations.  The Joint Declaration marks acceptance of the principle set out in Article 1 of the Anglo Irish Agreement, that the status of Northern Ireland can be changed only by agreement and never by violence.</P>
      <P>Members of this House have had an opportunity to reflect on the contents of the Joint Declaration for the past week. That interval has been beneficial and the initial reaction that the declaration is fair and balanced has been reinforced during that interval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1929" /> The response of the vast majority of constitutional politicians in the Republic, in Northern Ireland and in Britain has been encouraging.  However, one central element in the peace process remains unresolved.  The declaration protects the rights and aspirations of both traditions on this island but its success is dependent on a permanent cessation of violence. When we condemned the massacre on the Shankill Road, the killings in Greysteel and other killings, I made the point that the peace process should begin with a cessation of violence, rather than a cessation of violence being the result of the peace process.</P>
    <P>Then, and in the intervening week, the message from Seanad Éireann has been consistent.  We have said to the men and women of violence on both sides that they must put away their bombs, guns and bullets.  This message has been repeated and we shall continue to repeat it for as long as necessary.  The Joint Declaration opens the door to those who have resorted to political terror and murder to take up the challenge of the democratic peaceful process on the basis of a renunciation of violence.  The focus now rests firmly where it belongs.  It is now up to the so called republican movement to decide whether it wishes to continue with fruitless loss of life.  The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister have the support of both Houses of the Oireachtas in refusing to participate in direct talks with Sinn Féin until the violence has ended.</P>
    <P>The Joint Declaration is clear and explicit.  It has been clarified by the Taoiseach this morning to any degree necessary. Stalling tactics of the nature we have witnessed on the part of Sinn Féin should be seen for what they are and there should not be any question of considering an amnesty for people convicted of murder.  Coercion can never lead to consent.  The challenge now to Sinn Féin and people of violence is whether they are prepared to work for, rather than to kill for, their objective.  It takes courage to be a constitutional politician in Northern Ireland.  It has taken even greater courage on the parts of Messrs. Molyneaux <Col N="1930" /> and Alderdice and the other constitutional politicians in Northern Ireland who have responded in the manner they have to the Joint Declaration.  That courage must be recognised and supported by both Governments.  The solidarity of political parties in the Republic is an important element in giving that support.</P>
    <P>We are still some way from gaining the ultimate prize of peace but the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, with the support of both Houses of the Oireachtas and the British Parliament, have taken a huge stride towards achieving that objective. It is our wish to proceed to a peaceful, stable future, one which will allow the people of this island to realise their true potential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Democratic Left, it is generally recognised that the Downing Street Joint Declaration possibly offers a unique opportunity to secure peace and promote political progress in Northern Ireland.  Indeed, it probably offers the best prospect of peace we have had for more than 20 years.  If this opportunity is spurned by the paramilitary groups, the prospects for the people of Northern Ireland will be bleak indeed.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the British Prime Minister and their entire backup teams are fully entitled to the praise they received for a remarkable achievement. It was always possible to come up with a declaration acceptable to either the Nationalists or the Unionists but the challenge confronting those involved in the talks was to devise a declaration broadly acceptable, not merely in Northern Ireland but in the Republic and Britain.  It would appear they have achieved that objective and that there are grounds for some cautious optimism.  The Joint Declaration has been generally welcomed by the media, trade unions, business organisations and, most importantly, the people on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Gerry Adams should note the findings of the opinion poll published on Saturday last, showing that 97 per cent of people in the Republic of Ireland want the IRA to respond to the Joint Declaration <Col N="1931" /> by declaring an immediate end to violence.  It is now clearer than ever that the Provisional IRA have no mandate for a single further act of violence. Indeed to call a temporary ceasefire and then resume the killing after Christmas would be to thumb their noses, once again, at the will of the people.  If they continue to ignore public opinion Mr. Adams may find that their little electoral support will be whittled away, when they will face demands from an increasingly angry public for stronger security measures to be taken against them.</P>
    <P>Time is precious and the unique climate over the past week will not last indefinitely.  Therefore, it is vital that the momentum for peace be maintained.  We have always believed that the two Governments cannot impose a political settlement on the people of Northern Ireland.  Both Governments have done a good job in devising a framework on which political progress can be built and they should take all possible steps to encourage the rapid reopening of talks between the political parties in the North of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I too welcome the opportunity afforded Members of this House to support and endorse the Joint Declaration on peace issued by the Taoiseach and British Prime Minister, Mr. Major. It represents an historic opportunity for peace.  As my colleague, Senator Dardis said, its contents are fair and balanced. At the core of that balance is the recognition that there can be no change in the current status of Northern Ireland as long as that is the democratic wish of the greater number of people there.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the British Government have made it clear that if and when a majority of the people in Northern Ireland wish to leave the Union and agree to some form of unity they will fully facilitate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Wednesday when the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister were giving their press conference many other Members of this House and I watched <Col N="1932" /> it on television in Buswell's Hotel at a meeting organised by our colleague, Senator Feargal Quinn, on behalf of the Glencree Reconciliation Centre.  The guest speaker at that meeting was Mr. Chris McGimpsey of the Official Unionist Party.  During his address he told us he was only 16 years of age when the troubles started in the North.  He now has sons who are older than he was at that time.  He believes that his generation and the next deserve better than the life they have had over those years.  He certainly did not want to look forward to a future where his grandchildren would be living in the same type of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The difficulty for us in the Republic is that for many years we did not understand the way the ordinary people had to live their lives in the North, as Senator Gordon Wilson said, under the fear of the bomb and the bullet.  This is changing and I welcome that change.  Senator Lanigan referred to the men of violence and qualified it saying he also included the women and that violence was not a gender issue.  I look to the women, as many people have now done, to lead the peace.  Deputy Austin Currie on the television programme &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; on Monday night last made that very point.  Also our President, Mary Robinson, made that point yesterday when the wives and mothers of victims of both communities in Northern Ireland, as well as mothers and wives of prisoners in Northern Ireland, visited her.  I agree with Senator O'Sullivan when she said that the men of violence must look to humanity on the other side of the fence. The families are the real victims in Northern Ireland.  It is fine for us in the South to condemn the atrocities but we can get on with the rest of our lives.  These people have to live with their loss this Christmas and every Christmas, as Mary Robinson said yesterday.  They are yearning for peace.  I ask the men of violence and the paramilitaries on both sides to listen to people like Senator Gordon Wilson, whom I regard as extraordinary.  Their courage, forgiveness and generosity are an example to us all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1933" /> I should like to pay tribute to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the British Prime Minister, both their teams, and to their predecessors who have brought the process so far.  I also pay tribute to the responsible response so far of the Official Unionist leader, James Molyneaux, and those who are under severe pressure from Dr. Paisley and the DUP.  I also pay tribute to Mr. John Hume, Mr. John Alderdice and all democratic politicians in the North.  I hope the men of violence will listen and read this Declaration and that the peace which everybody yearns for will be realised through this new beginning.</P>

      <P>At the outset I should say that my comments will be brief.  I wish to endorse the viewpoints expressed by all Members in the House.  The Joint Declaration represents a quest for peace and it is the blueprint for the future process of peace.  At this juncture I should like to congratulate the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the British Prime Minister. I should like to quote John F. Kennedy:</P>
      <P>We stand today on the edge of a new frontier but the new frontier of which I speak is not a set of promises, it is a set of challenges.  It sums up not what I intend to offer people but what I intend to ask of them.</P>
      <P>That is very relevant today because we are all being asked to make a sacrifice, to make a compromise and to accommodate a differing viewpoint.  In my opinion the essence of the true definition of a Republican is tolerance, understanding and acceptance of the other person's creed, class and the right to free speech, expression and thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the honour of being with the Taoiseach in Cork last Friday.  One of the guests at the dinner spoke of the Taoiseach as being the person of the century because he has brought this process so far and has given hope to so many people.  Of course, there are obstacles in the way of peace but it is up to each one of us to endeavour in whatever way possible to ensure that those obstacles can be removed.  I should like to encourage <Col N="1934" /> everybody to strive for and to encourage others to search for this peace.</P>

      <P>In his contribution this morning the Taoiseach said that the Joint Declaration was a charter for peace and democracy in the island of Ireland. He also claimed that for the first time the British Government has acknowledged the particular situation of the Nationalists. That is very important.  Equally, it can be said that for the first time since the foundation of this State Fianna Fáil in Government has accepted the position which obtained in 1921.  Both communities in Northern Ireland can take support and confidence from the Joint Declaration.  The British Government gives a very definite message to the Nationalist community.  Equally for the Unionist community there is a very definite statement of the recognition by the Irish Government of their particular position in Northern Ireland.  It was a unique step forward for Fianna Fáil.  That is a very definite change in their position in relation to Northern Ireland and it should not be underestimated.  The message should go out very clearly to both communities that both Governments are sincere and genuine in what they are presenting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning Senator Quinn referred to the importance of silence.  Now is the time for the two communities in Northern Ireland to reflect on the sincerity of the Declaration.  It is equally important that communication begins between the two communities.  We must recognise that a fundamental problem is that there is no communication, trust or understanding between many of the people in Northern Ireland.  If the problem is to be resolved and if peace is to result, communication is the central factor.  Nothing should be done by anybody to undermine or hinder communication. Peace is important to both paramilitary forces, to the IRA and the <Col N="1935" /> UVF.  It is important that a clear message goes out from here and from everywhere that what the people of Ireland want is peace.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the peace declaration.  It is nothing new that the Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, and the British Prime Minister in their Joint Declaration are on the side of peace.  It is not new for any political party in any democratic system anywhere in the world to be on the side of peace.  That is what democracy is about.  We have to move forward in a cautious manner because there is a great desire for peace.  During the past 25 years the people of Northern of Ireland have suffered the most horrendous era of violence. People on all sides of the religious divide are pleading to the people of violence to stop, think and move forward. As a democrat and as a person of peace we have to move forward and continue the fight for peace.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. Everyone wants peace.  The debate today is proof positive of that.  There is a unique unity of purpose and support for the Joint Declaration in the House.  It is important that all of us, at whatever level we live and act out our roles, make the very most of this opportunity.</P>
      <P>I wish to focus on one main issue which has been highlighted by a number of speakers.  The main theme of the Taoiseach's speech is that the Joint Declaration is a first step, a statement of principles, not a basis for negotiations <i>per se</i>.  He said it is a starting point to get peace off the ground and then and only then to return to the negotiation table for detailed discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Joint Declaration is indeed a formula for peace.  As I read it, the simple message is peace first and negotiations afterwards.  During the past 20 years there have been praiseworthy attempts, particularly Sunningdale and the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which involved an enormous amount of work and commitment <Col N="1936" /> but which were conducted in the context of violence and unfortunately did not bring peace.  What is different about the strategy in relation to the Joint Declaration is that that approach is being reversed in the sense that peace and not negotiations is being put first.  In that context I want to put on record my congratulations to the Taoiseach, and to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and their team and indeed to pay tribute to the generous response from the British side led by their Prime Minister, John Major.  This Joint Declaration is the first critical step for a lasting peace in the North. A number of speakers so far in the debate have referred to the risk inherent in having public debate and negotiation in advance of peace.  There is a real risk but the Government, and, in particular, the Taoiseach, is adamant that peace must come first.  If there is public debate and negotiations in advance of peace we will not get the peace we all want.  Both Governments, and they have made this clear in the past 24 hours, want peace first and then and only then, to move on to reconciliation by agreement.  In due course this will require consent, freely given by all in this island including, in particular, the people in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The calls for dialogue, for direct negotiations, for the release of prisoners and for the repeal of section 31 are all relevant but separate issues.  These issues will require long discussions but they can be discussed only after there has been a cessation of violence and the guns have been quiet.  If first we go the route of negotiations, the momentum to which the Taoiseach referred could be lost and extremely valuable time could be spent down blind alleys.</P>
    <P>The Joint Declaration is concerned with peace in the context of principles accepted by both Governments and guarantees to all people to pursue their rights by democratic means at a later stage.  If negotiations take place in advance of a cessation of violence, propositions put forward by one side will displease the other and may cause conflict.</P>
    <P>The debate has been exemplary in its unanimity and moderation.  I join with <Col N="1937" /> Members in their references to Senator Feargal Quinn's contribution and to his call for reflection.  That is precisely what we need to do.  At all costs we need to avoid jumping too far ahead because it may damage the process.</P>
    <P>We should remember there are brave and courageous people on the unionist side who could be isolated by loose talk and idle speculation on what might be achieved in negotiations.  There are brave and courageous people also on the nationalist side who are genuinely interested in peace but theirs too is a delicate task in convincing all who follow them to accept peace before negotiations. It is of key importance to stop the killings before focusing on peace.  If we take our eye of that focus we may well lose the unique opportunity that the Joint Declaration affords for peace.  There was never a better opportunity for peace in the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat the sequence: peace first and detailed negotiations later.  Repeatedly, the Taoiseach has said that the only prerequisite for getting around the table is peace.  When peace has been achieved, everything else will come up for discussion. Democracy will then come into play and we will see the traditional adjudication of competing interests and reconciling differences.  To date there has never been a breakthrough similar to the Joint Declaration which has achieved a remarkably rare breadth of consensus.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and their team.  We all hope that the Joint Declaration is the first crucial step on the long road to healing historic divisions in Northern Ireland and divisions between the peoples of Britain and Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide a new system of appeal for persons who claim to be the victim of a miscarriage of justice.  Some cases can be looked at by a committee of inquiry to see if the grant of a Presidential pardon ought to be recommended; others can be examined, where appropriate, by the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
      <P>Let me say at the outset that in fact very few cases of miscarriages of justice have arisen in our jurisdiction.  Indeed, because of other steps which have already been taken or are in the process of being taken, I think it is unlikely that we will have to deal with many such cases in the future.  I will return to this aspect later. While I hope and expect, therefore, that the substantive provisions of this Bill will rarely have to be invoked in the future, it is clearly right that our law should provide for them.</P>
      <P>This is not to say, of course, that our system is at present devoid of a means by which miscarriages of justice can be remedied; there has always been the power provided by the Constitution under which the President, acting on the advice of the Government, can grant a pardon, and pardons have been granted in rare cases that have arisen.  Similarly, while there is no statutory right to compensation in those cases, that has not prevented the Government of the day from awarding compensation in appropriate cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it has been widely felt for some time that there should be some specific mechanism in our system of criminal law to enable allegations of miscarriage of justice to be examined.  In recognition of this, a committee to inquire into certain aspects of criminal <Col N="1939" /> procedure was established under the chairmanship of Judge Frank Martin.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Judge Martin and the members of the committee for their work.  That the committee was able to consider all the submissions made to it, complete its deliberations and submit its report very quickly is a credit to the dedication and commitment of its members.  They deserve the sincere thanks of this House.</P>
    <P>Arising out of their terms of reference, the committee made three main recommendations. First, they recommended that allegations of miscarriage of justice should be examined by a statutory inquiry body.  This is implemented by this Bill but with a variation involving the Court of Criminal Appeal which I will explain shortly.  Second, they recommended that there should be a statutory entitlement to compensation where a miscarriage of justice is shown to have occurred.  This is fully implemented by the Bill.  Third, they recommended that the questioning of suspects take place before an audio-visual recording device. The legislation for this is already contained in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, and so is not in this Bill.  I would like, however, to briefly explain the position on this matter before returning to the Bill before us today.</P>
    <P>The Government has fully accepted this recommendation.  Accordingly, the Minister for Justice has established a steering committee for the introduction of audio-visual recording of Garda questioning of suspects on a pilot basis in selected Garda stations, as recommended by the Martin committee.  The steering committee is chaired by Judge Esmond Symth.  I would stress that this committee is not concerned with whether to introduce recording devices into Garda stations &mdash; that, as I said, has been accepted by the Government &mdash; but rather to make recommendations to the Minister on the necessary features of a pilot scheme.  This is in accordance with the views expressed in the report of the Martin committee that recording of interviews be first introduced in selected <Col N="1940" /> Garda stations, so that by way of a pilot scheme the expertise gained thereby could be put to good use.  This is a significant development which will complement the legal changes proposed in the Bill before the House.  It will, I hope, lead to an enhancement of public confidence in the integrity of criminal investigations by providing a verifiable record of statements made in Garda custody. This should greatly assist our criminal courts in their difficult task of assessing evidence and should go a long way towards minimising actual or alleged miscarriages of justice occurring in the first place.</P>
    <P>To return to the Bill, the proposals fulfill a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to provide for a review of alleged cases of miscarriages of justice and to provide a statutory right to compensation for any actual miscarriage.</P>
    <P>While there is an undoubted need for certainty and finality in the decisions of the Criminal Courts, the paramount objective is that justice must always be done and be seen to be done.  An accused person, therefore, must have every opportunity to put forward his or her case and to challenge a decision or verdict which adversely affects him or her where there is good reason to suggest that the verdict may have been unjust.  The recognition of this led in 1924 to the establishment of the Court of Criminal Appeal which for the first time gave to a convicted person a right of appeal against the verdict of a jury.  It was provided that the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal would be final in every case, except where a point of law of exceptional public importance was involved, when an appeal could with leave be made to the Supreme Court.  One of the important proposals in the Bill is that the Court may re-examine a conviction or sentence where new evidence comes to light after a previous appeal has been dealt with. Under the present system, the Court of Criminal Appeal has no power to reopen an appeal already decided, even where clear evidence pointing to innocence <Col N="1941" /> comes to light.  Everybody will agree that that situation needs to be changed.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the circumstances where it becomes necessary to reopen cases would be exceptional, but we must face that possibility and provide for it.  It is possible, for example, to envisage an important witness coming forward after the hearing of an appeal who was for some genuine reason unavailable for the appeal or the original trial.  Another possibility might be where a new development in forensic science enables evidence which led to the conviction and its affirmation in the Court of Criminal Appeal to be seen in quite a different light.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed that there will be filtering of applications to the Court of Criminal Appeal as happens, for example, in the neighbouring jurisdiction where the Home Secretary decides whether or not a case should be referred back to the Court of Appeal.  It is not porposed to place any restrictions or obstacles in the way of such applications. Any convicted person who, after an ordinary appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, stands convicted of an offence and is able to adduce fresh evidence will be able to apply direct to that court for a re-examination of the conviction or sentence, as appropriate.  This open access will not prove unwieldly, but in any event the court is being given the power of summary disposal of frivolous or vexatious applications.</P>
    <P>The Martin committee was of the view that in those rare cases in which matters came to light casting substantial doubt on the correctness of a conviction, further recourse to the court system would be likely to prove inappropriate.  That is the one significant recommendation of the Martin committee with which I cannot fully agree.  I accept the view of the Martin committee that there may be cases which, perhaps because of the nature of the fresh evidence, or the need for an essentially inquisitorial examination, would not be appropriate for determination by the courts.  That is why the Bill provides for statutory committees of inquiry as recommended by the Martin committee.  It is, however, going too far <Col N="1942" /> to propose that every case, even ones which could be heard by a court, should go before a committee of inquiry.  The Martin committee instanced several types of hypothetical cases which would not be suitable for referral to a court. Broadly speaking I agree with them, and the committee to inquire into alleged miscarriages of justice provided in section 8 would be able to deal with those types of cases.  However, I could not accept because it is desirable to have a committee of cases that cannot be referred to the court, that the committee should also deal with the types of cases for which the courts have been established.</P>
    <P>We should not abandon the principle of court appeals.  They are a central feature of our criminal justice system and the new entitlement in this Bill to an additional appeal fit in easily into the present system.  The full powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal, improved by this Bill, will be available in such cases. The court will, for the first time, be able to direct the Garda Commissioner to make inquiries.  Not only will an appellant be able to get a conviction quashed on foot of new evidence, but the court will have the flexibility to substitute a lesser conviction or to reduce the sentence.</P>
    <P>The Court of Criminal Appeal will, of course, be bound by rules of evidence in hearing any appeal under this Bill.  This has been felt by some to constitute a reason for following the Martin committee recommendations and for abandoning the Court of Criminal Appeal.  It is a mistake to look upon the rules of evidence in this way, as if they were arbitrary and capricious restrictions on the discovery of the truth.  The rules of evidence have been developed by centuries of judicial experience in order to ensure a fair trial for accused persons.  This should be borne in mind by these who, on behalf of convicted persons, advocate committees of inquiry on the grounds that the rules of evidence will not apply to them.  Such committees will be free to accept evidence from any party, whether or not such evidence would be admissible in court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1943" /> If I had to sum up the thinking behind this central provision of the Bill, I would say that not every alleged miscarriage of justice can be dealt with by the courts and not every alleged miscarriage of justice can be dealt with by means of a pardon.  The proposals in the Bill represent a balanced and reasonable approach by providing for the availability of both remedies.</P>
    <P>For the first time, and in line with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government, there will be a statutory right to compensation where a miscarriage of justice is found on the basis of newly discovered evidence to have occurred.  Of course, the State can pay and indeed has paid compensation in the past in these exceptionally rare cases, but the House will agree with me that it is better to express this entitlement as a statutory right.  It will also comply fully with the requirement for such a statutory right contained in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Ireland is a party, and will enable the Government to withdraw its reservation to article 14 which has up to now been necessary because of our system of <i>ex-gratia</i> compensation.</P>
    <P>I am also taking the opportunity presented by this Bill to consolidate and to a certain extent clarify the powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  These are at present contained in statutes of 1924 and 1928 and in Rules of Court and would benefit from a degree of codification.</P>
    <P>On the provisions of the Bill section 2 provides for a second or subsequent application to the Court of Criminal Appeal where it is alleged that a new or newly discovered fact shows that there has been a miscarriage of justice in relation to the conviction or that the sentence is excessive.  Heretofore, a person has had one chance to appeal based on the appeal provisions currently in existence and, if the appeal was lost, that was the end of the line.  No matter what facts he or she was able to produce later, even if they cast a genuine and substantial doubt on the conviction, a further referral to the courts was not possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1944" />&ldquo;New fact&rdquo; is defined so as to permit a convicted person to base an appeal under this Bill on evidence which he or she knew of all along, but failed to reveal, where there is a reasonable explanation for that failure.  I emphasise the need for a reasonable explanation, because this obviously could only occur in extraordinary circumstances.  The intention is to provide for situations, however remote the possibility, where an accused withholds exculpatory evidence out of, for example, fear or intimidation or out of a misguided desire to protect another person.</P>
    <P>Of relevance to more cases will be the definition of &ldquo;newly discovered fact&rdquo;. This is a broad definition and includes a fact known to the appellant at his or her trial or appeal, but the significance of which was not appreciated at the time. The intention is not to permit appellants to re-open arguments already put before the Court.  My concern is to ensure that our criminal appeal system has the flexibility to deal with the difficulties which can arise in appeals and the capacity to ensure that justice is done in every case. That is why, in addition, it is provided that there will be no limit to the number of subsequent applications which can be made to the Court of Criminal Appeal, provided each application is supported by a new or newly discovered fact.</P>
    <P>The scope of an application is not being restricted to an allegation of a miscarriage of justice in relation to the conviction. Under section 2 an application may also be made to review a sentence on the basis of a new or newly discovered fact, while not contesting the conviction itself.  For example, a person convicted of an offence may be able to produce to the court a new fact that would tend to show that his or her part in the crime for which he or she was convicted was not as major as seemed likely during the trial. A reduction in the sentence might be appropriate, but as the conviction itself is not in doubt, simply the severity of the sentence, the question of a miscarriage of justice does not arise.  This type of appeal could not be catered for by the <Col N="1945" /> Martin committee proposal which would limit the available remedy to a pardon.</P>
    <P>Section 3 consolidates the powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal currently contained in section 34 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, section 5 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1928, and in Order 86 of the Rules of the Superior Courts.  Those statutory provisions are being repealed by this Bill and the Rules of Court will need to be amended to take account of the new provisions.  Generally the section puts in simple modern terminology the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to appeals but it does not give the court some new powers.</P>
    <P>For example, in a significant departure from the existing powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal, power is being given to the court in section 3 (3) to direct the Garda Commissioner, where an appeal is based on new or additional evidence, to carry out inquiries to see if further evidence ought to be adduced.  The court's role will, of course, be to adjudicate on the evidence presented to it and not to carry out an inquiry itself.</P>
    <P>Section 4 re-enacts in a modern format, with some additions, the provisions of the Courts of Justice Act, 1928, concerning retrial.  Where the Court of Criminal appeal orders a retrial the person concerned can be reindicted, retried and, if found guilty, sentenced to the offence for which he was retried.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with summary determination of appeals.  It has always been recognised that there must be some simple, straightforward system for dealing with frivolous or vexatious appeals. The existing Rules of the superior courts enable suspected frivolous or vexatious appeals to be scheduled for hearing without the transcript of the trial having been obtained.  Section 5 is a development of this, and provides a statutory procedure for dealing with clearly unmeritorious appeals.  Special provision is, of course, made to protect the rights of appellants. The procedure for summary determination will be invoked only where the registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal believes that there is no substantial ground of appeal or, in the case of an <Col N="1946" /> application under the new procedure in section 2, that there is no <i>prima facie</i> evidence of a miscarriage of justice or an excessive sentence.  Of course the decision on the matter will be made by the court itself or by a judge of the court. In the latter case the appeallant will be able to appeal to the full court.</P>
    <P>Section 6 applies the relevant provisions of this Bill to courts-martial including the right to reapply to the Courts-Martial Appeals Court on the basis of new evidence.</P>
    <P>I come now to section 7.  As I have said already, while I believe that the courts system is the most appropriate forum in many cases for deciding whether there has been a miscarriage of justice, we have to cater for the rare case where referral back to the court might not be possible. Section 7 deals with that situation.  It provides a procedure whereby a convicted person who alleges that a new or newly discovered fact shows there has been a miscarriage of justice can petition the Minister for Justice with a view to the Government advising the President to grant a pardon under Article 13.6 of the Constitution.  There are two circumstances which come to mind in which the procedure might be availed of, first, where persons who might otherwise return to the Court of Criminal Appeal under the new procedures introduced in this Bill find that their fresh evidence is inadmissible in a court of law and, second, where persons have been convicted and sentenced in the District Court.  It would not be practical to enable such persons to return to the relevant court of appeal, the Circuit Court, as no record is kept of proceedings in the District Court and appeals are by way of a complete rehearing.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice will have several options on receipt of a petition for a Presidential pardon.  These are, after making the necessary inquiries first, inform the petitioner that the matters dealt with in the petition could be appropriately dealt with by means of an application to the Court of Criminal Appeal; a return to the Court of Criminal Appeal should be the first choice where this is <Col N="1947" /> possible; second, inform the petitioner that no case has been made that a miscarriage of justice has occurred; this would be the option where the petition is clearly frivolous; third, recommend to the Government that it should advise the President to grant a pardon in respect of the relevant offence; this option would be relevant where an examination by the Minister, or a suitably qualified person commissioned by the Minister, shows that a miscarriage of justice has occurred; or fourth, recommend to the Government that it should appoint a committee to inquire into the case.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the establishment by the Government of a committee to inquire into an allegation that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.  In considering a petition for a pardon under section 7 the Minister for Justice can, as I said, as one of her options, make her own inquiries or employ someone else such as a barrister or solicitor to make the inquiries necessary before arriving at a decision provided for in that section. However, the Minister also has the option of advising the Government to appoint a committee to examine a petition for the granting of a pardon by the President and to report whether, in its opinion, the President should be advised to grant the pardon.  Whether the President is so advised will remain, as it must under Article 13.6 of the Constitution, entirely a matter for the Government.</P>
    <P>I envisage that the appointment of a committee would be necessary only in particularly difficult cases and, therefore, rather than have a standing committee one will be appointed as necessary to inquire into an individual case.  This also gives flexibility in providing special expertise in a committee appropriate to a particular case.  The committee will be a tribunal within the meaning of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 and 1979, and will, therefore, have all the powers of a tribunal set up under those Acts.</P>
    <P>Any person who has been the victim of a miscarriage of justice will have suffered a grievous wrong.  Nothing can fully <Col N="1948" /> compensate a person who has spent years in prison through no fault of his or her own, for his or her loss of freedom, loss of family life, and the effects of the imprisonment on his or her career and life generally.  Those years have been lost years.  However, the State can at least make some restitution through the award of monetary compensation to any person who can show beyond reasonable doubt that a newly discovered fact shows that there has been a miscarriage of justice in relation to his conviction.  Section 9 gives a statutory right of compensation in those circumstances.  If the criteria are met compensation can be awarded either where the court of criminal appeal quashes a conviction or where a pardon has been received as a result of a petition under section 7.</P>
    <P>The amount of compensation will be determined in each case by the Minister for Justice.  There is provision for an appeal to the High Court where there is dissatisfaction with the amount awarded by the Minister.  This will enable an independent and impartial assessment to be made in cases of dispute.</P>
    <P>When the Martin committee was appointed, its terms of reference excluded it examining whether an uncorroborated inculpatory admission made by an accused to the Garda Síochána could be sufficient evidence to ground a conviction.  However, the Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to examine the feasibility of prohibiting criminal convictions on the basis of uncorroborated confession evidence. The conclusion reached in that examination is that convictions can, in appropriate cases, safely be based on the evidence of a confession but that it is right that an additional safeguard should be put in place.  Accordingly, section 10 provides that where a confession of the accused is the sole evidence, this fact will be specifically brought to the attention of the jurors who will be required by the judge to have due regard to it in determining their verdict.</P>
    <P>Society has every reason to be outraged when a miscarriage of justice results in an innocent person serving a <Col N="1949" /> prison sentence.  Were it to happen widely, public confidence in the criminal justice system would be seriously undermined, perhaps irreparably.  That is why a Bill such as this is so important in that it will allow any alleged miscarriage of justice to be dealt with.  However, that is not the full story.  I venture the view that very little demoralises public opinion more than to see clearly guilty persons getting off, maybe on a technicality.  We must be very careful not to put the type of obstacles in the way of the crime detecting and prosecuting agencies that could, through a series of well publicised cases, cause great public anger and a disrespect for the law generally, resulting possibly in persons exacting retribution by taking the law into their own hands.  I mention these thing by way of explaining the reasons for section 10.  The fact is that uncorroborated confessions can be good confessions and the possibility of their being used in evidence should not be excluded.</P>
    <P>Also, I should remind the House that while a person is in custody there are very stringent regulations &mdash; embodied in the Treatment of Persons in Custody Regulations 1987 &mdash; which must be complied with.  The member in charge of the station is given specific responsibility to see that these regulations are adhered to to ensure that the person in custody is not ill-treated and that a detailed record of the procedures followed is kept.  It is difficult to envisage oppressive treatment leading to false confessions in the face of these regulations.</P>
    <P>In addition, when the recording of statements in Garda stations comes on stream, and eventually becomes widespread, any lingering doubt there might be over Garda questioning &mdash; and there should be no such doubt in the light of the regulations I have mentioned &mdash; can be put to rest.  Section 10 takes the sensible approach to the question of uncorroborated confession evidence by providing for the judge to advise the jury to have due regard to the absence of corroboration.  No particular form of words has to be used by the judge &mdash; the judge can decide for himself or herself <Col N="1950" /> in the circumstances of each case.  The Martin committee made a tentative suggestion as to the form of wording but I am satisfied that, because of the infinite variety of cases that can come before the courts, the precise terms of the advice should be left to the judge.</P>
    <P>Finally, I will say a few words about section 11.  In 1982 in the case of the <i>People (DPP) v. O'Shea</i>, the Supreme Court gave a literal interpretation of the provision of Article 34.4.3 of the Constitution which says that all decisions of the High Court may be appealed to the Supreme Court.  This not only gave persons convicted in the Central Criminal Court a right of appeal direct to the Supreme Court, as an alternative to appealing to the Court of Criminal Appeal, but for the first time it gave the prosecution the right of appeal to the Supreme Court against convictions in the Central Criminal Court.  However, the terms of Article 34.4.3 provide that legislation may exclude decisions of the High Court from the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and that is what this section does in relation to the criminal jurisdiction of the High Court.  A saver is included to protect the prosecution's statutory right of appeal without prejudice to a verdict in favour of the accused and to enable an accused to continue to appeal straight to the Supreme Court against a decision of the Central Criminal Court on the Constitutional validity of any law.</P>
    <P>In effect, section 11 restores the right of appeal from the Central Criminal Court to what it was thought to be before the O'Shea case.  Persons convicted in the Central Criminal Court will continue to have a right of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, which is the court specially designed for that purpose, with the possibility of a subsequent reference to the Supreme Court on a point of law of exceptional public importance.  The prosecution will continue to have a right of appeal direct to the Supreme Court, without prejudice to the verdict in favour of the accused, on a point of law of exceptional public importance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1951" /> This Bill is an important development in our criminal justice system.  It faces up to the difficult issue of allegations of miscarriage of justice.  It gives our courts the powers to deal with such allegations. It provides an alternative mechanism for cases which could not return to the courts.  It provides for compensation where a miscarriage of justice actually occurs.  It puts in place a new safeguard in the consideration of uncorroborated confessions.  Last but not least, it consolidates and updates the main powers and the role of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  This Bill will enhance public confidence in the criminal justice system and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House is based on recommendations of the Committee to Inquire into Aspects of Criminal Procedure under Judge Frank Martin.  At this stage I would like to wish Judge Martin every enjoyment in his retirement after long and unselfish service to the State.</P>
      <P>The Bill fails, however, to provide for all the recommendations of the report. The terms of reference of the Martin committee were to examine whether there is need for a procedure whereby persons who have exhausted normal appeals procedures can have their cases further reviewed and, if so, to make recommendations as to what procedures should be provided and in what circumstances they should apply and, given that uncorroborated inculpatory admissions made by an accused person to the Garda Síochána can be sufficient evidence to ground a conviction, to examine whether additional safeguards are needed to ensure that such admissions are properly obtained and recorded and to make recommendations accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before the House addresses the first part of the terms of reference and the Minister has dealt with the second part.  I welcome his announcement in that area and look forward to the full implementation of the second part of the Martin report.  Again I would like to commend the Martin committee for the <Col N="1952" /> excellent work they have done in producing the report and I look forward to the Minister's reply on the full introduction of all the procedures outlined in that report, some of which he has dealt with.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give persons convicted of a crime the right to appeal in certain circumstances.  Under the Bill the right to seek to have the matter referred back to the Court of Criminal Appeal is confined to persons who have been convicted on indictment or who have pleaded guilty and the sentence is imposed by one of the higher courts.  The vast bulk of cases in which miscarriage might be alleged will come within the definition of all serious crime. It is also possible that a miscarriage of justice could take place in respect of summary trials in the District Court.  The District Court can impose a sentence of up to two years by way of consecutive sentences of one year each where a person has been found guilty of more than one offence.  A person so sentenced might have a legitimate reason to appeal. An alleged miscarriage of justice is an important matter which should be dealt with by a higher court.  While, in the ordinary way, appeals from the cases which are tried in the District Court do not come before the Court of Criminal Appeal, there is a case for this court having jurisdiction to deal with miscarriages of justice.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Bill where a pardon is petitioned a person must satisfy the court or the Minister or, indeed, the Government, that a newly discovered fact has come to light.  Section 2 of the Bill sets up a review by the Court of Criminal Appeal of alleged miscarriages of justice or excessive sentence.  In referring to this the Martin report recommends the establishment of a statutory inquiry body under the Tribunal of Inquiries Act, and recommends against reference of an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  In its report the Martin committee questions whether reference to the court system would necessarily prove effective in establishing the truth. The Martin committee gave reasons for <Col N="1953" /> considering this matter outside the court system and referred to rules of evidence in the Scottish Evidence Act where hearsay is not ruled out in every case.  Similar rules could apply to a body of inquiry which was not a court.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not adhered to the recommendations of the Martin report. The proposals in the Bill do not comply with the approach of the Martin committee. In the Bill before the House the Minister proposes a new avenue of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, even though a case may have already gone on a point of law to the Supreme Court before the new evidence or relevant fact was discovered.  I would like the Minister to explain why he opted for this model rather than forwarding the case to an inquiry which would deal with evidence which could not be considered by a court of law because of the rules of evidence.</P>
    <P>At page 14 the Martin report recommends provisions similar to those in the Scotland Act of 1989 with regard to evidence. This provides for an alternative to a court and suggests that evidence shall not be excluded solely on the grounds that it is hearsay.  This is a fundamental reason why a court should not be used as an inquiry body and a tribunal should be established as recommended by the committee.  The problem centres on the use of the word &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; and what is admissible in evidence before a court. Having taken evidence from a large number of people, including leading members of the Bar and legal profession, the committee of inquiry has said in regard to the appeal procedure that the courts are not the most appropriate body to deal with this matter.  The independent committee of inquiry states specifically in its report that hearsay evidence should not be ruled out in every case.  Yet under the Judge's Rules on court procedures the court cannot accept hearsay evidence. That is why the Martin committee recommended that a body of inquiry be used rather than the court.</P>
    <P>The Martin committee refers to the hearing of an appeal by the Court of Criminal Appeal where the court is considering <Col N="1954" /> an appeal based on new evidence. The court may direct the Garda Commissioner to make further inquiries. Although this is appropriate in most cases circumstances could arise where it is not appropriate.  For example, it could be that it is the conduct of the Garda and the prosecution of the offence that is in dispute.  Although I accept that the Garda Commissioner and the Garda should investigate such situations I believe the Attorney General should oversee inquiries of this kind.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the conduct of the trial and prosecution based on the decisions and judgment of the Director of Public Prosecutions could be the subject of an inquiry into the alleged miscarriage of justice and, therefore, it would be inappropriate for the Director of Public Prosecutions to be the law officer who would oversee the Garda Commissioner.  Under the Constitution, the Attorney General is responsible for prosecuting all cases in the name of the people and he would be the most appropriate person authorised by law to oversee such inquiries.  One of the principles of the investigations is that there would not be an apparent conflict of interest.  While I accept that the Garda Commissioner and the Director of Public Prosecutions and their staff carry out their duties in an honourable and fair fashion the most advisable approach is for them to stand aside in cases involving a conflict of interest.  Because the Attorney General is not involved in the criminal justice prosecution system, he or she is the most appropriate person to carry out examinations in the circumstances I outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill.  For too long there have been publicised cases of so-called miscarriages of justice where people have been incarcerated in prison on what was later found to be suspect evidence and procedures. It is welcome that the legislation provides a system whereby appeals may be taken to investigate new evidence and to inquire whether the sentence handed down was appropriate.  The main thrust of the Bill is to ensure that our justice <Col N="1955" /> system prevents miscarriages of justice and that adequate measures of redress are available for those who have suffered in this regard.  This legislation takes account of the recommendations of the report of the committee chaired by Judge Frank Martin.  I join the Minister in congratulating Judge Martin for the speedy manner in which he undertook the investigation and reported to the Government and I join Senator Neville in wishing him a happy retirement.</P>
      <P>This legislation is necessary because recent history has shown, not only in this State but in Britain, in cases such as the Guildford Four and Nicky Kelly, that we need to ensure our system of justice is watertight.  Miscarriages of justice not only diminish our justice system but also the broader democratic system.  That system depends on the faith in it of the citizens it governs and if that faith is diminished by miscarriages of justice the integrity of the system is damaged.  We cannot take the integrity of our justice system for granted.  We must be ever vigilant in monitoring its operation to ensure it fulfils its main objectives &mdash; the dispensation of justice in a fair manner. Justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done.  The Bill acknowledges and responds to the important need to protect the integrity of our justice system.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice must be thanked for her foresight in introducing this legislation.  The Bill provides for several measures to prevent miscarriages of justice. A person who alleges that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and who has exhausted the normal appeal procedure, can appeal against the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal have been extended.  Those measures are welcome. As the Minister stated, the powers under which the Court of Criminal Appeal operates at present date back to 1924 and 1928.  The reforms proposed in the legislation are in line with the measures proposed by the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice to reform our criminal and justice systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1956" /> The Martin report recommended that some cases, because of the introduction of fresh evidence or the need for an essentially inquisitorial examination, would not be appropriate for determination by the courts.  Accordingly, as recommended in that report, the Bill provides for statutory committees of inquiry. Having read the Official Report of the other House and having heard Senator Neville's contribution, I am aware there has been a suggestion that those procedures should be conducted by an independent tribunal and that the courts should not have the role envisaged in this legislation.  However, we have been greatly served by our judicial system since the founding of the State.  The Judiciary has on several occasions taken decisions which have been contrary to what may be termed as Government and national policy.  Those decisions highlight the independence of that system, something of which we should be proud and protect.  I appreciate that in certain instances the courts are not the most appropriate places to deal with other issues and, therefore, I welcome the section in the Bill which provides for an independent committee to be established to investigate evidence as it emerges.  I welcome that the committee may comprise one person or a group of people which, I hope, will allow for the speedy resolution of any disputes or differences that may emerge.  While committees which report to Government are important and their contributions are essential in the preparation of legislation or discussion on proposed legislation they do not make the final decision on any issue. The Minister for Justice has incorporated in this legislation the main recommendations of the Martin report and the perceived wisdom of the general public in respect of the power and the independence of our Judiciary.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides several measures to prevent miscarriages of justice.  During a period of time new evidence may emerge which may indicate that there has been a miscarriage of justice.  That is often the pattern.  Following a conviction, subsequent evidence may emerge indicating <Col N="1957" /> that the conviction may have been incorrect. That may be followed by a protracted public campaign to highlight the perceived miscarriage of justice. However, often the justice system lags far behind the strength of public opinion. For this reason I welcome the provision that allows a newly convicted person who alleges there has been a miscarriage of justice to petition a Minister for Justice in relation to the granting of a presidential pardon.  I hope this provision will allow for a speedy resolution of miscarriages of justice.  The power to grant a pardon does not include the power to quash a sentence, it merely provides for the release of a person from prison with a relatively, but not totally, clean record. There was discussion in the British Parliament some time ago on this matter.  It was stated at that time that the power of the Royal prerogative of pardon is limited to quashing the sentence but not the conviction.  My understanding is that the legislation will allow the Court of Criminal Appeal to quash a conviction which will clear the person.  This legislation covers the avenues for people who may fall between the different systems.</P>
    <P>Regarding compensation, in the case of personal injury a person cannot be adequately compensated for the injury he or she suffers and similarly, people cannot be adequately compensated for the years they have spent in prison after being wrongly convicted.  This Bill puts a statutory onus on the State to put in place a structure whereby people who suffer miscarriages of justice will have an effective compensatory system available to them.  A significant measure is that which allows the judge to advise the jury to have due regard to the lack of corroboration in any case where the sole evidence is a confession &mdash; I do not need to dwell on how such evidence was used in the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six cases.  This is not an undermining of the role of the Garda who have done an excellent job serving the people of Ireland in detecting crime and bringing criminals to justice.  However, circumstances arise where confessions are <Col N="1958" /> drawn from people which should not be allowed to stand up in court because of the way they were made.  The introduction of audio and audio visual recording of confessions in Garda stations will be a further enhancement to prevent the possibility of a confession being forced from a person.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for bringing in this reforming legislation which gives the courts more power to deal with miscarriages of justice.  I welcome the provision which enables the court to direct the Garda Commissioner to make inquiries. This is a very important provision because the resources and expertise in the investigation of evidence lies with the Garda Síochána and they should be fully used not only for the prosecution but also for the defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this legislation.  It has been talked about for a long time and was obviously necessary.  As a student of criminal law, some time ago I learned of the anomalies in the system, some of which are being addressed in this Bill. Following the passing of the interpretation legislation, I welcome the wording of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill covers many areas.  I particularly welcome the establishment of a committee to inquire into allegations of miscarriages of justice.  We are all aware of the cases of miscarriage of justice, mostly in England but also here.  As has been said, justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done.  This committee of inquiry will go some way towards ensuring that in certain circumstances a second chance is given. Very often evidence which is not forthcoming at the time of a trial may come to light later.  In these circumstances the accused will have a second chance of trial.  This committee will have a very important and effective role in the future. One need not fear that all cases will be automatically referred to the committee because the Bill makes provision for frivolous cases.</P>

    <P>The Bill provides that appeals arising from convictions by courts martial may <Col N="1959" /> be brought to the Minister for Defence. I am sure that provision will be welcomed by the Defence Forces and security forces as it will go some way towards assisting people who have been wronged.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 9 which provides a statutory right to compensation in the case of a miscarriage of justice.  There is no point sending a person on his merry way after quashing a conviction without paying compensation.  The State has a duty to compensate in these cases and that is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill removes the anomaly in the existing law in regard to the constitutional right of appeal from the Central Criminal Court direct to the Supreme Court.  This right exists alongside the normal statutory rights of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Under the Bill a person convicted in the Circuit Criminal Court, Special Criminal Court or Central Criminal Court may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The system will, therefore, apply equally to all, regardless of which court the case was first heard. These cases may also be referred from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court.  It is important to note that the prosecution has the right to refer to the Supreme Court a verdict in favour of the accused person without prejudice to that verdict.  This is an important point because in cases where the Garda or the DPP believe the verdict was incorrect and they have further evidence to that effect, they have the right to bring the case to the Supreme Court.  While this provision already exists, I welcome the fact that it is clearly expressed in the Bill. It leaves one in no doubt that there must be balance in law and that justice must be done.  The Bill clarifies many areas of criminal procedure.  I recently raised with the Minister reform in this area and many of these matters are dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said, I particularly welcome the establishment of the new committee.  It will be enabled to hear evidence not normally permissible under court procedure, thereby getting to the truth of the matter. In the Guildford Four case, Giuseppi Conlon who left Belfast to visit his son in <Col N="1960" /> Britain, was arrested and convicted there and sadly died in prison, an innocent man.  I hope changes in our law will ensure that such cases do not occur here. We have to be very clear about this because what is involved is a person's good name and their right of freedom, and that should not be easily taken from them.  It is important that we get this matter right and this Bill goes a long way towards that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision which gives power to a judge to advise a jury in cases where there is no corroborative evidence and where there may have been simply a statement by the accused.  There are cases where people who are naive or suffering from a physical or psychological illness, or perhaps who are simply looking for attention, admit to something they did not do.  Their circumstances should be made known by the judge to the jury so that they too are aware that the only evidence against the accused is the statement he made.  That is a simple but important provision which will protect the innocent accused.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Justice on her vast programme of legislative reform in the criminal area.  I have not always agreed with the measures she has introduced but on this occasion I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would first like to thank all the Senators who contributed to what has been a positive and constructive debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that some Senators have expressed concern that the recommendation of the Martin committee on the question of a statutory inquiry body is not being implemented to the letter. However, I would ask those Senators to give the arguments I advanced at the start of this debate, and which I will summarise now, a fair hearing.  It would be the easiest thing in the world for me to automatically implement in full this recommendation of the Martin committee. It is always easier, and nearly always more popular, for a Minister to accept in full every recommendation in <Col N="1961" /> every report.  If this Bill contains a slight variation on the Martin committee recommendations it is for a very good reason.  The fact is that the Government, and this House, has a responsibility to examine any proposal put to it to see if it is acceptable and, if it is, whether it can be improved.  Would those who exclusively favour the Martin committee approach always accept in full every recommendation of every report?  Surely not.</P>
    <P>I want to summarise my thinking on this matter.  I accept that committees of inquiry have a role to play in examining alleged miscarriages of justice.  I am providing for them in the Bill and I think their potential contribution to the investigation of certain types of allegations is a valuable one.  They will have all the powers recommended by the Martin committee.  However, a committee of inquiry can never be a panacea.  It is an appropriate mechanism for appropriate cases, but it is not the complete answer to the problem of alleged miscarriages of justice.</P>
    <P>Some Senators' faith in the hearing of appeals by courts may have been shaken by tragic errors in other jurisdictions but that is not a reason for abandoning the system of court appeals.  What would we do then if a committee of inquiry was to pronounce itself satisfied as to the guilt of an appellant only for clear proof of innocence to emerge afterwards?  Every system, no matter how good, is liable to some human error in its operation.  It may also be that committees of inquiry are seen as attractive because of their power to accept any evidence, even if it would not be admissible in court.  As I said earlier, rules of evidence are there primarily to assist defendants.  The reality is that they often have a more restrictive effect on the prosecution than on the defence.</P>
    <P>The Court of Criminal Appeal is a fair, impartial and objective forum for the hearing of appeals.  It is, of course, bound by the rules of evidence but, as I say, that is no bad thing for appellants.  Any appeal to the court under this Bill will be on the basis of a new or newly appreciated fact, <Col N="1962" /> so that the court will be taking a decision on evidence which was not before it at the previous appeal.  It is not a question, therefore, of asking the court simply to reverse a decision and, to put it bluntly, to admit a mistake.  If there is a mistake in any such case, it will be on someone else's part for not putting the evidence before the court the first time around.  It will be a case of acknowledging to the court that incomplete or misleading evidence was put before it in the original appeal.  I have absolute confidence in the court's ability and willingness to assess the new evidence impartially and fairly. If as a result it reverses its previous decision, it will not cause them a moment's embarrassment.</P>
    <P>The proposed new right of appeal to the court will fit in smoothly with the existing right of appeal.  It is simply an extension of the present system and of course the court will have available its new extended powers provided for in section 3 of this Bill.  These include the power to direct the Garda Commissioner to carry out specific inquiries, clearly a power of potentially significant value in the examination of alleged new evidence. The commissioner has the resources and the capability to carry out the types of inquiries which the court might be likely to require, such as collecting new evidence or applying new forensic techniques to old evidence.  Any such investigation will be carried out under the specific direction of the court.  In addition, the court will also have available to it its full range of options in deciding an appeal.  It will not be confined to accepting or rejecting an appeal but will be able to substitute a lesser conviction or to reduce a sentence.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the Court of Criminal Appeal is specifically designed to hear criminal appeals and it deserves the full confidence of this House.  I think it would be unwise to place an unsustainable burden of expectation on the proposed committees of inquiry.  Thankfully, there is no need to force ourselves to choose between courts and committees of inquiry.  There must surely be some compromise possible between the two, <Col N="1963" /> and the Bill provides it.  The Bill recognises that not every alleged miscarriage of justice can be dealt with by the courts and not every alleged miscarriage of justice can be dealt with by means of a pardon.  I would ask the House to accept this balanced view.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville mentioned the reference in the Martin report to the Civil Evidence (Scotland) Act.  The report says that an inquiry body should have the power to hear hearsay evidence.  The committee, which can be established under this legislation, will be able to hear hearsay evidence and any other evidence normally deemed inadmissible in a court of law.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville also thought that persons convicted in the District Court should have a right of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The purpose of section 7 is to provide an alternative means whereby persons who allege that a new or newly discovered fact shows that a miscarriage of justice has occurred can seek redress.  This is relevant where recourse to the Court of Criminal Appeal is impossible or impractical.  Summary convictions, that is, convictions in the District Court, come into this category.  It would not be practical to enable persons convicted summarily to return to the relevant court of appeal, the Circuit Court, as no record is kept of proceedings in the District Court and appeals to the Circuit Court are by way of a complete rehearing. I am glad to confirm for Senator Crowley that the Court of Criminal Appeal will have the power to fully quash a conviction following an application to it under this legislation.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions which have been constructive so far, and I hope this continues.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;(1)  The Minister for Justice is hereby authorised to set up an independent body of inquiry to be known as the Tribunal to Review Alleged Miscarriages of Justice and which shall have power to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  enforce the attendance of witnesses, and their examination on oath, affirmation or otherwise;</P>
      <P>(b)  compel the production of documents;</P>
      <P>(c)  issue a commission or request to examine witnesses outside the jurisdiction;</P>
      <P>(d)  hold in contempt, similar to contempt of the High Court, a person who</P>
      <P>(i)  on being duly summoned as a witness, without just cause or excuse disobeys the summons, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  being in attendance as a witness refuses to testify when legally obliged to do so, or without just cause fails to produce documents, or</P>
      <P>(iii)  wilfully gives material evidence which he knows to be false or does not believe to be true, or</P>
      <P>(iv)  by act or omission obstructs or hinders the inquiry in the performance of its functions, or</P>
      <P>(v)  fails, neglects or refuses to comply with the provisions of an order made by the Committee, or</P>
      <P>(vi)  does or omits to do something which, if the Tribunal had been the High Court, would have constituted a contempt of that Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1965" /> (2)  The Tribunal shall be constituted and shall have the same powers as if it were a tribunal established under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 and 1979.</P>
    <P>(3)  A person&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  who has been convicted of an offence either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  on indictment, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  after signing a plea of guilty and being sent forward for sentence under section 13 (2) (b) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, and</P>
    <P>who, after appeal to the Court including an application for leave to appeal, and any subsequent re-trial, stands convicted of an offence to which this paragraph applies, and</P>
    <P>(b)  who alleges that a new or newly-discovered fact shows that there has been a miscarriage of justice in relation to the conviction or that the sentence imposed is excessive,</P>
    <P>may, if no further proceedings are pending in relation to the appeal, apply to the Tribunal for a recommendation that the Court should make an order quashing the conviction or reviewing the sentence.</P>
    <P>(4)  Subsection (3) shall not apply to a person who has entered a plea of guilty to an offence unless he also alleges that if the new or newly-discovered fact had been known to him at the time he entered the plea he would not have entered it.</P>
    <P>(5)  An application under subsection (3) shall be treated for all purposes as an appeal against the conviction or sentence.</P>
    <P>(6)  The reference in subsection (3) (b) to a newly-discovered fact is to a fact discovered by or coming to the notice of the convicted person after the relevant appeal proceedings have been finally determined or a fact the significance of which was not appreciated by the convicted person or his advisers <Col N="1966" /> during the trial or appeal proceedings or a fact the importance of which was known to a party to the proceedings who decided to bring it before the Court.</P>
    <P>(7)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  after an application by a convicted person under subsection (3) and any subsequent re-trial the person stands convicted of an offence, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the person alleges that a fact discovered by him or coming to his notice after the hearing of the application and any subsequent re-trial or a fact the significance of which was not appreciated by him or his advisers during the hearing of the application and any subsequent re-trial or a fact the importance of which was known to a party to the proceedings who declined to bring it before the Court shows that there has been a miscarriage of justice in relation to the conviction, or that the sentence was excessive,</P>
    <P>he may apply to the Tribunal for a recommendation that the Court should make an order quashing the conviction or reviewing the sentence and his application shall be treated as if it were an application under that subsection.</P>
    <P>(8)  A statement or admission made by a person before the Tribunal shall not be admissible as evidence against that person in any criminal proceedings other than those of the Court under subsection (3) or (7).</P>
    <P>(9)  Evidence taken by the Tribunal shall not be excluded by the Tribunal solely on the ground that it is hearsay.</P>
    <P>(10)  A recommendation and any report of the Tribunal under this section shall be admissible in the Court as evidence for the purposes of proceedings of the Court under subsection (3) or (7) to quash a conviction or to review a sentence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes that a tribunal of inquiry, known as a tribunal to review <Col N="1967" /> alleged miscarriages of justice, should be established to decide in all cases under the Bill.  While some might argue that a tribunal of inquiry should not have the power to overrule a decision of a court, I believe a very good case can be made for this under the legislation.  It will be possible for a tribunal or other independent body to quash a court decision if it is provided for in law and if such a tribunal is set up in a proper way.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes that the recommendations and report of a tribunal should be admissible in the court as evidence for the purposes of the proceedings of the court under section 3 and 7 to quash a conviction or review a sentence.  The Martin committee was very strong in its view that the matter should not be decided by the court, and I quote:</P>
    <P>We doubt, however, whether reference to the court system would necessarily prove effective in establishing the truth.</P>
    <P>The Martin committee gives two reasons for its view.  It believes that a court is not the proper body to which to appeal what may be a miscarriage of justice or to rehear cases.  A court has to operate under the rules of evidence, one of which is not to take hearsay evidence into account.  The Martin committee recommended that in such circumstances it should be possible to go outside the parameters of the normal rules of evidence and to take hearsay evidence into account.  It cites as an example the Civil Evidence (Scotland) Act, 1988, which allows hearsay evidence to be taken into account.  A court cannot hear such evidence but the Martin committee strongly recommended that a tribunal should do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice set up an independent committee under a judge to look at appeals procedures where new evidence which comes to light may clear somebody's name.  The judge and committee say the courts are not the places to hear such appeals because of the way they operate and, specifically, because <Col N="1968" /> the courts are not there to find out the truth but rather to find out if a case is proven.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is concerned about the type of restricted evidence admissible in court. It believes that the absence of a tribunal in all cases renders the Bill fundamentally flawed.  My amendment proposes the setting up of a tribunal which could be done in a number of ways.  The tribunal could comprise people nominated by a panel made up of the Chief Justice, the Ombudsman and the Director of Public Prosecutions or any other group which could be put together to form an independent tribunal.  The tribunal's objective should be to seek the truth, not whether a charge stands up.  It should be empowered to hear whatever evidence it feels necessary.  The Martin commission states: &ldquo;We doubt, however, whether reference to the courts system should necessarily prove effective in establishing the truth.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I wish to deal first with the Martin committee report, an excellent report for which we should all be grateful. The report formed the basis for a thorough examination in the Department of Justice of the issues involved during which we consulted widely with eminent legal opinion.  We came to the conclusion that the recommendations of the Martin committee were essentially sound and acceptable in principle but in one respect the Government decided on a different approach.</P>
      <P>There were three recommendations in the report of the Martin committee.  First, it recommended the setting up of a statutory inquiry body to examine cases of alleged miscarriages of justice.  The Government has accepted that recommendation but not that it should be a tribunal of first and only resort, as recommended by the committee, but rather that it should be a tribunal of alternative resort when recourse to the courts is either impractical or impossible.</P>
      <P>The second main recommendation in the report was to provide a statutory right to compensation to a person who has been wrongfully convicted.  That recommendation has been fully accepted.  The third recommendation was that statements made in Garda stations should be video recorded and that has also been accepted by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will explain again in detail the reasons for the main provisions of the Bill, of which section 2 is central, and why I consider them to be the most appropriate way of dealing with alleged miscarriages of justice.  The Court of Criminal Appeal, which was established in 1924, for the first time gave a convicted person a right of appeal against the verdict of a jury. Leave to appeal can be granted by the court where there appears to it to be a sufficient ground for appeal.  A decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal is final in every case except where a point of law of exceptional public importance is involved when an appeal can be made to the Supreme Court.  In other words, it <Col N="1970" /> has been accepted since 1924 that the most appropriate way of dealing with unsatisfactory court decisions is by way of an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  I consider that, in principle, going back to the Court of Criminal Appeal, where that is feasible, is still the most appropriate way of dealing with alleged miscarriages of justice but that the present provisions are inadequate in that they only allow for one referral back to the court.</P>
    <P>Much has been said of the reasons given by the Martin committee for recommending a statutory inquiry body and, so far as they go, they are justified. The report gave some hypothetical examples of cases which could not be dealt with in our courts structures and which would therefore justify the establishment of an inquiry body.  Having read the hypothetical examples given in the report, I can say that I fully agree that such cases, rare though they may be; would in all probability be unsuitable, indeed probably impossible, to refer back to the court and would be better dealt with by some alternative system.  That is why provision is made in section 7 for petitions for the grant of a pardon.  The Minister will have the power either to commission somebody such as a barrister or a solicitor to make inquiries and report to her on a case or, if it is clearly a complicated case, she can recommend to the Government that a committee be set up to make the necessary inquiries.  That committee will have all the powers recommended in the Martin committee report for the statutory inquiry body and it will not be inferior in any way.</P>
    <P>I am strongly of the view that what we are proposing in this Bill is the proper response to cases of alleged miscarriage of justice.  Where a person alleges that a new or newly discovered fact shows that a miscarriage of justice has occurred he or she will be able to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to have the case heard again.  The re-hearing is on the basis of the new or newly discovered fact and therefore there is no question of the court having to go behind a jury verdict.  The fact on which the court will be asked <Col N="1971" /> to adjudicate would not previously have been before the court.</P>
    <P>Allegations that the court would not overturn a jury verdict or would have some sort of vested interest in maintaining the <i>status quo</i> are well wide of the mark and are unworthy.  In any case, as I have just explained, they are irrelevant to the proposals in this Bill.  A person who goes back to the court and has their conviction overturned will, of course, be fully vindicated not only in that he will be seen to be innocent but in that he will literally have the conviction set aside.  He will also be eligible to receive compensation.</P>
    <P>Of course, there will be cases which will be unsuitable to go back to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  That has been used as an argument for not allowing anyone to go back to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  It is a false argument.  In cases where the new evidence is for any reason inadmissible in a court or it is clear to the Minister that the case is one of great complexity which would require major investigation and inquiry, or where it is a summary conviction which cannot be dealt with in the Court of Criminal Appeal, the alternative procedures provided for in this Bill will come into play.</P>
    <P>From what I have just said it is obvious that I cannot accept the amendment we are discussing.  The strength and passion of argument both here and in the Lower House ensured that the issues were again thoroughly examined following the matter being referred from the Lower House.  The arguments put forward in the Lower House in favour of an inquiry body as the only tribunal capable of examining alleged miscarriages of justice proved, on examination, not to make the case for such a one track approach. Indeed, they strengthen my belief that the approach adopted in the Bill is the correct one.</P>
    <P>I would now like to comment on Senator Neville's amendment.  It is an interesting amendment that clearly represents a genuine attempt at a compromise solution.  By diverging from the recommendations of the Martin committee <Col N="1972" /> report, Senator Neville is indicating that he is not hung up on those recommendations.  The amendment deserves a detailed response which I will now give.</P>
    <P>I have already explained in some detail why, when a miscarriage of justice is alleged, recourse to the courts where the conviction can be set aside should be the preferred option.  The Senator seems to agree with my contention that a person should not be deprived of the right to have a conviction set aside, where possible, when a miscarriage has occurred. The purpose of the amendment is to enable a convicted person who alleges that a miscarriage of justice has occurred to apply to a committee which in turn could recommend to the Court of Criminal Appeal that a conviction should be quashed or the sentence reviewed.  In fact, the amendment does not achieve its objective but I do not wish to become bogged down in the drafting difficulties I see in the amendment.</P>
    <P>Clearly, a recommendation by a committee of the type envisaged by this amendment could not be binding on the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The court could not be obliged automatically to accept and endorse such a recommendation. Any such provision would clearly infringe on the independence of the courts and would be unconstitutional. We must take it, therefore, that the amendment envisages that a recommendation will constitute mere advice to a court which may or may not be accepted.  In hearing an appeal against conviction or sentence, however, the court could not simply accept the recommendation but would have to form its own conclusion on the evidence supporting the recommendation.</P>
    <P>The discretion of the courts in evaluating evidence was upheld as being an integral part of the courts' exclusive competence to administer justice in the Supreme Court decision in the case of <i>Maher v. the Attorny General</i>, 1973 Irish Reports.  To the extent that the evidence considered by the committee would be admissible in court, it could in any event be heard in the ordinary way on appeal <Col N="1973" /> but some or all of the evidence, as the amendment clearly anticipates and provides for, could be inadmissible evidence such as hearsay.  The effect of the amendment, therefore, would be to introduce inadmissible evidence to the Court of Criminal Appeal through the back door. Any proposals to change the rules of evidence to allow hearsay or other evidence at present inadmissible to be heard in courts could only be considered after detailed consideration and public debate. The amendment would put the court in the impossible position of being unable to itself test or examine evidence in order to come to its own conclusion.  In effect the court would be asked to accept on trust, without question, evidence considered by the committee and to decide guilt or innocence, or the severity of punishment, on that basis.  I cannot see any court agreeing to set aside a conviction on such a basis.</P>
    <P>It is in recognition of the difficulties created by inadmissible evidence that the Bill proposes a comprehensive statutory scheme for the consideration of pardons in such cases, including where necessary the establishment of a committee to report its opinion on whether the Government ought to advise the President to grant a pardon.  That is the way to proceed.  While welcoming Senator Neville's recognition of the central role of the courts in deciding cases of alleged miscarriage of justice, I regret that I cannot accept his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Neville's amendment No. 1 is extremely important.  I listened with interest to what the Minister of State had to say.  The basis for or terms of reference of the tribunal to review alleged miscarriages of justice are very wide ranging.  It is to be comprised of many qualified people including the Chief Justice, the Ombudsman, the Director of Public Prosecutions and a panel to be nominated by the Minister which would include people of that calibre. It is most important that there be people of distinction who would serve on that tribunal, which should be totally independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1974" /> The Minister of State made the point that he considered that this tribunal, as outlined by Senator Neville and in the report of Judge Frank Martin, may well be found to be unconstitutional.  I could not agree with that view.  I would not think that the body who advanced this proposal would do so if they thought it could be construed to be unconstitutional. I contend that it would be quite constitutional and that all of their proceedings would be in order and be seen to be above board.</P>
    <P>Other Members have paid tribute to Judge Martin for the work undertaken in producing his report.  As somebody who has known him over many years I should like to wish him every happiness in retirement. I congratulate him on his achievements on the Bench and on having produced this report.</P>
    <P>The establishment of this independent tribunal is of immense importance in that we have been somewhat lacking in not having had such a review body in place. In the course of his remarks the Minister of State said it was unlikely that we would have to deal with many cases of miscarriage of justice in the future.  We cannot envisage whether or not we shall encounter such cases in the future.  That is why there is need to establish such a review body.  Bearing in mind the current trend in the drafting of legislation, such review body and procedures may well be necessary in the future in that the numbers of such cases may well increase rather than decrease.  That is why it is essential that we have such an independent tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    <P>The point I might make is that we have actually been dealing with high profile cases of miscarriages of justice.  There is a danger, in the manner in which legislation is being drafted, presented and passed, that there will be cases of miscarriage of justice for that very reason. Future cases may not be what could be described as high profile ones.  The Road Traffic Bill, 1993 is an illustration of what I have in mind.  For example, in the case of a dangerous driving incident, the uncorroborated opinion of a garda, could lead to a person being convicted of <Col N="1975" /> dangerous driving, in turn leading to a mandatory sentence.  The person involved may lose his or her driving licence and, thereby, their source of livelihood.  They have right of appeal to the Circuit Court, when it will be a case of one person's view against another.  At that point the relevant procedures will have been exhausted.</P>
    <P>We need to be very careful in drafting legislation, ensuring that all its provisions are sound constitutionally and legally. Whenever a person is deprived of their freedom, perhaps also of their livelihood in one form or another, it is incumbent on us legislators to ensure that the provisions are in place so that any person who feels that an injustice has been perpetrated has some procedure available to them to have such miscarriage of justice annulled.</P>
    <P>Over the years, there have been miscarriages of justice for one reason or another. We are lucky in having an excellent Garda Síochána force, an excellent judicial system and legal profession.  In spite of all of that, miscarriages of justice continue to happen and will occur in the future.  We must ensure that there are provisions to allow redress.</P>
    <P>The Bill's proposals are quite good and I congratulate the Minister of State, but there is need for some independent tribunal. As a State, we are encroaching very much on people's civil liberties and rights.  It is vital that we have in place the type of mechanism that will prevent such excesses occurring.  We are afforded such an opportunity today and should grasp it.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister will accept Senator Neville's amendment, albeit an excellent one that has widespread public support.  People consider it necessary that an independent tribunal be established. Had there been such an independent tribunal in Britain many years ago, all the miscarriages of justice that occurred there would never have happened, or at least would have been nipped in the bud much earlier.</P>
    <P>I will go along with the Minister in his proposals if he will take on board Senator Neville's amendment.</P>

      <P>I am quite confused by the language used by Members opposite. While I agree that there must be processes put in place to ensure that miscarriages of justice can be investigated and so on, what I cannot understand is their total commitment to a single independent tribunal to deal with all such cases.  The Bill, as drafted, affords the option to establish an independent tribunal of inquiry, in addition to the structures in place for the Court of Criminal Appeal to investigate such cases, and reappeal them, whenever new evidence comes to light.  That meets the requirements of Fine Gael Senators.</P>
      <P>I would never equate the Irish and British judicial systems, not merely because of the independence of our Judiciary but also because we have a written Constitution which guides every action taken by Government, by the Judiciary and the Legislature.  Therefore controls are already in place whereby if legislation infringes on people's rights it can be referred to the courts by the President, before it becomes an Act, or afterwards by a constitutional action taken by an individual to protect their rights.  I am at a loss to understand the necessity for a totally independent tribunal without any reference back to the court.  The dual system, as proposed in the Bill, is the optimum solution to the present problem.</P>

      <P>If somebody claims, having gone through the court procedure, that he or she is not guilty of the crime, as happened recently, it should not only be possible for him or her to have the case reheard on facts but to have an independent tribunal to seek out the truth without being confined to the traditional court procedures or rules of evidence. The tribunal should pursue the truth as recommended by the Martin committee.  It should be able to take a broader spectrum of evidence than is possible under the court system in all cases.  The tribunal, as proposed in this amendment, would review alleged miscarriages of justice, would have the right to enforce the attendance of witnesses, <Col N="1977" /> to compel the production of documents, to issue a commission or request to examine witnesses outside the jurisdiction, to hold in contempt, similar to contempt of the High Court, a person who fails to comply with the summons and various other matters; and to ensure there is no problem about a tribunal overruling a court &mdash; if such a problem should exist.</P>
      <P>The amendment states, as the Minister has recognised, that any report of a tribunal be taken in the court as evidence for the purpose of the proceedings of the court under subsections (3) or (7) to quash a conviction or review a sentence. Whereas the court would not have heard the hearsay evidence or any other evidence it should not hear, it could take as evidence the report of the tribunal.  It would be a tidier operation if the tribunal was empowered to overrule the courts but the basic principle of the amendment is to establish how miscarriages of justice should be dealt with.  While there could be a waiver as to whether a tribunal should overrule the courts we are saying it would not do so and that hearings of the tribunal would be submitted in evidence to the court in preparation for the final decision.  For a number of years there was much controversy in regard to having a review of the conviction of the Guildford Four, the Birmingham Six and other cases in the United Kingdom. During that time politicians in this country could stand up and criticise UK authorities for their failure to move on miscarriages of justice though we did not have in our own legislation procedures that would enable us take similar action. I now welcome those procedures.  The core recommendation of the Martin committee is that the rules of evidence be relaxed.  The thrust of the amendment we are proposing is to ensure that the strong views of Judge Martin and his committee are adhered to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with a few points that have been made in the course of the contributions.  Senator Enright alleged I said that the tribunal, as proposed by Senator Neville, may be unconstitutional.  I did not say that.  I said <Col N="1978" /> that if we are to take it that the tribunal's conclusions would be binding on the court then, clearly, that would be unconstitutional. I have no hesitation in saying that.  If the tribunal's finding were binding on the court, the court would then only be a rubber stamp and the courts will not and cannot be relegated to that position under Article 34 of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The alternative is that the proposed tribunal's recommendations would not be binding on the court.  In that situation the court will have to consider all the evidence itself, including evidence on how the tribunal came to that conclusion. Let us assume that all that evidence would be admissible in a court of law.  If that is the case why go to a tribunal?  To allow the tribunal to reach a conclusion and then ask the court to reach a conclusion on the same evidence is not sensible. Suppose part of the evidence is inadmissible, in a court of law, and you set up a tribunal &mdash; if the court has to make a decision on its own right as in the case of <i>Maher v. the Attorney General</i>&mdash; it must make its own decision and cannot accept anybody's recommendation, the court would be in a totally invidious position.  It will be asked to make a decision based on some evidence when a tribunal, which is reporting to it, has made a decision based on that evidence and other evidence which cannot be admitted into court because it is inadmissible.  That is the position.  We cannot have that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators said I thought it unlikely that there would be many such cases.  For two reasons, it is unlikely that there will be many cases of this sort in the future, first, because of the new safeguards we are putting in place to protect people in custody and, second, because of the audiovisual recording procedure which we are now going to introduce. The scope for miscarriages of justice will be considerably less.  The Martin committee recognised and, indeed, envisaged in some part of the report that the cases would be rare and exceptional.  Senator Enright said the new legislation would lead to more miscarriages of justice in <Col N="1979" /> the future and that, therefore, a tribunal would be needed.  Frankly, I cannot understand that.  I do not know what legislation he has in mind.  He did not say why or how new legislation would lead to more miscarriages of justice although he did mention the Road Traffic Act which provides for summary convictions.</P>
    <P>As I have already explained to the House, in the case of a summary conviction, it will be a matter for referral to the Minister for Justice who is empowered, if her inquiries establish a <i>prima facie</i> case, to set up a tribunal.  It would not be appropriate for such a case to go back to the court because it would not have been before the Court of Criminal Appeal in the first place.  We are providing that the only cases that can go back to the Court of Criminal Appeal are those which were before that court in the first place but where new evidence has emerged.  The court will be reviewing its decision rather than guessing, some years hence, into the future but examining its previous decision based on the new evidence.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the need for an independent tribunal.  History has proved that no institution in this country is more independent than the courts.  Section 8 deals with the tribunal which will be established by the Government.  The section clearly sets out the parameters stating that the chairman will have to be either a judge, a former judge or a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than ten years standing.  That is a tremendous advance on the system that has prevailed up to now because, first, there was no mechanism to go back to the courts and, second, if somebody wanted a pardon they petitioned the Minister for Justice of the day who carried out his or her own inquiries.  The Minister is being given the additional power now to set up a tribunal.  That is a considerable advance.</P>
    <P>It is not desirable to have a tribunal comprised of specific people who would be called upon whenever they were needed.  There are different types of cases involving miscarriages of justice, from <Col N="1980" /> murder and offences against the person to the most complicated fraud cases. Obviously different types of expertise will be needed in the different tribunals which will be set up from time to time.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville said that the conclusion of the Martin committee was that the body inquiring into alleged miscarriages of justice should be able to take a broader spectrum of evidence than a court.  If there is broader evidence which tends to show a miscarriage of justice and it is not admissible in court that would be a perfect reason for the setting up of a tribunal.  If the evidence is such that it can be considered the court is the proper body to hear it.  To suggest otherwise would be a vote of no confidence by this House in the courts of this country.  I would not countenance that for a moment.</P>
    <P>From my recollection of the Martin report, that particular conclusion is not supported by the reasoning which precedes it.  The Martin committee referred to cases where there might be hearsay evidence which would not be admissible in court or cases where witnesses do not want to change their evidence because they might be prosecuted by the DPP for perjury.  Because of these type of cases they say that nobody should ever have to go back to court but should go before a tribunal.  In the legislation we are providing the Minister for Justice with the power to set up a tribunal specifically for those cases.  I will deal with the perjury aspect in a moment.  In any other case where it is appropriate and where all evidence can be resubmitted and readmitted in court we are saying that they go back to the court.</P>
    <P>On the question of perjury, I want to make our position clear in case there are any doubts.  For instance, in some cases a person will want to change his evidence, such as in the Birmingham case and, naturally, the witness will be afraid to go back in because a person was sentenced to imprisonment on his evidence which was sworn falsely.  If, seven years later because of qualms of conscience, the witness agrees to go back to give evidence will the DPP agree not to prosecute him? <Col N="1981" /> We have no guarantee in that regard.  It is an example of a case where the person's legal advisers will look to the Minister for Justice to set up a tribunal because as a tribunal is defined in this Bill there can be no prosecution for perjury as a result of somebody changing his evidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (3) (a), line 20, to delete &ldquo;Commissioner of the Garda Síochána&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Attorney General&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason for proposing this amendment is that the conduct of the gardaí and the prosecution of the offence could be a point of dispute and it is possible that the Garda Commissioner of the day could have been an officer overseeing the original inquiry and been promoted in the meantime.  He, in fact, could have been responsible for the conduct of the original case and although the inquiries could be focused on the conduct of the gardaí it would still pass through the office of the Garda Commissioner.  For this reason, I believe the Attorney General should oversee the conduct of any inquiry.  This is the question not only of justice being done but seen to be done and ensuring that nobody faces difficulties.  The Garda Commissioner of the day would not find it difficult to work under the supervision of the Attorney General in these circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the Garda Síochána is involved someone other than the Garda Commissioner should have the right to oversee a request in a review case. Circumstances may occur which may involve evidence available to members of the Garda Síochána which would have been presented in court in the interests of the perception of what is fair and thorough <Col N="1982" /> by way of an examination, inquiry or interrogation.  In fairness to the commissioner the matter should not be the responsibility of the officeholder.  It is more appropriate that the Attorney General should hold such a position.  It is important that the public perceives a degree of independence and detachment in relation to the duties or investigations being conducted by the officeholder.  We are dealing with unusual circumstances where an alleged miscarriage of justice has occurred and there is a conflict of interests if the commissioner investigates his own force.  We are not casting any aspersions on the Garda Síochána, but I am convinced that the Garda Commissioner should be removed from direct involvement in the investigation of his own force and that the Attorney General should oversee the investigation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In replying to this amendment I will refer briefly to the purpose of the provision as it stands.  In section 3 (3) (a) the Court of Criminal Appeal is being given an important new power to order the Garda Commission to carry out inquiries to see if further evidence ought to be adduced.  The court's role will be to adjudicate on the evidence presented to it and not to carry out an inquiry itself. There may be cases where particular issues raised by the appellant on the prosecution cannot be resolved on the facts available and which the court may wish to have further investigated.  The purpose of this provision is to enable the court to so order the Garda Commissioner to make the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is at issue here is the duty of the Garda Commissioner to carry out specific inquiries ordered by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  It will be up to the court &mdash; I want to stress this point &mdash; to be satisfied that the investigations have been properly carried out by the Commissioner and that they adequately answer the queries raised.  The Commissioner has the technical and forensic resources necessary to carry out any inquiry which the court is likely to suggest.  He also has the necessary investigative expertise available to him.  He is clearly the most appropriate <Col N="1983" /> person, if not the only one, who could be asked to perform those functions.</P>
    <P>There may be a perception that when the court directs the Garda Commissioner to conduct an investigation, the purpose of the investigation will somehow be concerned with uncovering some wrongdoing or mishandling of a case by the gardaí.  This need not necessarily be the case and, in practice, might only very occasionally be the case.  However, as I said, because of the investigative role, expertise and resources of the gardaí, they would be the obvious and correct body to undertake such an investigation. In those circumstances it is better that they report direct to the court, rather than through an intermediary, whether or not the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The principle of the Garda investigating matters which concern their own operations, under independent supervision and in accordance with a statutory duty, is not new.  It is already contained in the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986, and is working well.  As I say, any investigations by the Commissioner would be under the supervision of, and according to the instructions of, the Court of Criminal Appeal and there is no reason to doubt the safety of such a procedure.</P>
    <P>It would be particularly inappropriate to appoint a person such as the Attorney General to carry out or oversee these investigations.  While the Director of Public Prosecutions has taken over the prosecutorial functions of the Attorney General, there remains the possibility, whether under specific legislation or under the Prosecutions of Offences Act, 1974, that certain prosecutorial functions could be allocated to the Attorney.  For example, individual statutes may, despite the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, allocate prosecutional functions to the Attorney General.  The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1978, has done so in relation to maritime fisheries offences. Under the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, the Government may, in the interests of national security, order that functions in relation to specified types <Col N="1984" /> of criminal matters shall return to the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I have the fullest confidence in the integrity and ability of the Garda Commissioner to carry out the orders of the court in a proper and efficient manner.  I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 8, between lines 46 and 47, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Tribunal established under section 2 may recommend that persons deliberately involved in the perpetration of a miscarriage of justice shall be liable to contribute to the payment of compensation and the costs of trials in relation to that miscarriage of justice.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes that either the tribunal or the court should have the power to recommend that persons deliberately involved in the perpetration of a miscarriage of justice shall be liable to contribute to the payment of compensation and the cost of the trial in relation to the miscarriage of justice. Exceptionally well off ruthless racketeers might become involved in framing a person.  Why should the taxpayer pay the compensation rightly due to the victim as <Col N="1986" /> a result of a miscarriage of justice brought about in this way and why should the taxpayer have to pay the cost of the retrial in these circumstances?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand the reason this amendment has been put down and I fully sympathise with its sentiment. Unfortunately, we cannot always provide in legislation for something which, on the face of it, might seem like a good idea, especially when the provision is aimed at a person perceived as having done something wrong.  However, no matter how much we might disapprove of someone's behaviour, the rule of law must always apply.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I will give my reasons despite my inclinations for not being able to accept the amendment.  The court has no jurisdiction to award costs against a person who is not a party to proceedings and it would be neither desirable nor feasible to give the court that function. In awarding compensation against a person in criminal proceedings, the court is essentially adjudicating between the two parties to the proceedings.  It could not make a compensation order against a person who is not a party to the proceedings, has not been convicted of, let alone charged with an offence, and may not even be involved as a witness in the case and would not have had an opportunity to defend himself or refute allegations made against him.  That is not the way to administer justice.</P>
      <P>In cases such as this it should be a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to justify the prosecution of a person for an offence related to causing a miscarriage of justice, such as perjury.  No doubt in the event of a conviction the question of compensation for the victim could be considered by the court under the terms of the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, which provided for compensation orders against convicted people, and no doubt, if might be possible to take any such compensation into account in determining any compensation to be paid by the State for the miscarriage of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1987" /> Another minor point about the wording of the amendment is that the person who was deliberately involved in the perpetration of the miscarriage could be the appellant.  For example, with the clarification of what is a new fact now part of the Bill, a person who deliberately withheld evidence at his trial and appeal because of intimidation could well appeal again to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Such a person, under the provisions of this amendment, could find himself liable to pay compensation and costs.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I understand and empathise with the sentiment expressed in this amendment but for sound legal reasons I cannot accept it.  Miscarriages of justice are very rare occurrences in this country and the circumstances whereby an amendment such as this would be relevant would be a rarity in a situation that seldom arises.  Therefore, even if the situation envisaged by the amendment could be catered for in the Bill, the legislation would not in practical terms be much the better for it.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Where at the summary trial of a person evidence is given of a confession made by that person and that evidence is not corroborated, the judge shall have due regard to the absence of corroboration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section provides that where an uncorroborated confession is used as evidence, the judge shall advise the jury to have due regard to the absence of corroboration.  However, in a summary trial the judge is not required to do so.  My amendment provides that in a summary trial where an uncorroborated confession <Col N="1988" /> is used as evidence the judge will have due regard to the absence of corroboration. The Minister might argue that the judge will have due regard but it should be stated in law that the judge must have due regard to the absence of corroborated evidence with regard to confessions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to apply the provisions of section 10, whereby a judge shall advise the jury to have due regard to the absence of corroboration, to a judge himself or herself sitting in the District Court.  It might be helpful to review the law generally on corroboration so that section 10 and the proposed amendment can be seen in their proper context.</P>
      <P>A small number of offences, for example, treason under the Treason Act, 1939, require corroboration as a matter of law.  In other words, the uncorroborated evidence of one witness is not sufficient for a conviction.</P>
      <P>The more usual application of the law on corroboration, however, is to certain types of evidence which by their nature require careful examination before they can support a conviction without corroboration. A judge must advise the jury of the reasons particular care is needed in assessing this type of evidence, but if the jury is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt it may convict without corroboration of the evidence.  The law in this area is under regular review.  There have, for example, been two significant changes since 1990.  The Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, abolished the requirement of a warning to the jury about the danger of convicting a person of a sexual offence on the uncorroborated evidence of a complainant. Any such warning, which up to then had been mandatory, is now at the discretion of the judge.  Similarly, the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, abolished the requirement of a warning by a judge to a jury of the danger of convicting a person on the uncorroborated evidence of a child.  Once again such a warning is now discretionary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1989" /> It is still the law, however, that a jury must be advised to take particular care before convicting a person on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, who may have much to gain by minimising his or her role in the offence and exaggerating the role of the accused.  A jury must also be advised to take particular care in convicting a person on uncorroborated visual identification evidence, as experience has shown that witnesses can make genuine and sincere mistakes.</P>
    <P>Section 10, therefore, adds to the list of types of evidence on which a judge must advise a jury to take particular care in assessing, but which may nevertheless support a conviction even if uncorroborated.</P>
    <P>It is, however, an entirely different matter to try to apply the requirement in section 10 to a District Judge so that he or she has to, as it were, self-administer a warning.  We have to look at the principle of District Judges being required by law to have regard to matter which a judge in a higher court must explain to a jury.  This principle extends far beyond corroboration of evidence.  A judge, for example, must advise a jury that the accused is innocent until proven guilty, that the onus of proving guilt is on the prosecution and that the burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt.  The judge must also advise the jury on the law which it must apply to the facts.  It would be absurd to suggest a legal requirement that District Judges must have regard to all these matters.  That is their job and an appeal against conviction would certainly succeed if they did not do it.</P>
    <P>Even if a requirement on District Judges was somehow limited to consideration of the need for special care before convicting on certain types of uncorroborated evidence, presumably the law on corroboration in general would need to be addressed and not simply the question of uncorroborated confession evidence covered by the proposed amendment to section 10.  It is not simply a matter of incompleteness, although that is important, but of the implications which might flow from it.  If <Col N="1990" /> there are several types of evidence which juries must be advised to assess with special care and the Oireachtas enacts a law which requires a District Judge to have regard to one, and only one, of these types of evidence, then the conclusion could be drawn that the other types of evidence need not receive the same attention from a District Justice.</P>
    <P>The law of evidence, including the law on corroboration, is immensely complex and any change must be considered in the minutest detail.  I am satisfied that section 10 is a logical and welcome extension of the law on the assessment by juries of certain types of uncorroborated evidence.  While I fully appreciate the intention of Senator Neville in proposing this amendment to section 10, it raises substantially wider issues which could not be taken on board in this Bill.  I might add that the absence of a jury can occur not only in the District Court but in the Special Criminal Court.  There is a lacuna in the amendment in that regard.  If I accepted it, I would have to amend it.</P>

      <P>No, I cannot write into legislation that judges, in the absence of a jury, must consider certain matters. Judges have to consider a miscellany of matters, all of which cannot be provided for in legislation.  To do so would be an infringement on the independence of the courts as set out in Article 34 of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their constructive contributions.  I regret I could not accept any of the amendments but, with one exception which for technical and legal reasons I could not accept, the amendments tabled today were a repetition of those tabled in the Lower House where we had a thorough debate on them.  While worthwhile arguments were put forward today, when some of the senior counsel in the Lower House were unable to convince me to accept amendments, the arguments put forward here were not sufficient to convince me. However, I do not hold the Fine Gael spokesperson here in any less regard than those Members of the Lower House.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate we had to take all Stages of this Bill today.  The principle in regard to legislation is that each Stage should be considered on the basis of the discussion on the previous Stage.  That principle was not applied <Col N="1992" /> today and the Bill is being rushed through the House.  I did not table any amendments on Report Stage because I felt it was pointless as they would not be accepted.  That decision was made before we came in here this morning.</P>

      <P>I reject that statement.  I was here to listen to the arguments and I hope I made a reasoned response to them If the Committee Stage amendments were resubmitted on Report Stage and further arguments were put forward I would have considered them.  If new amendments had been tabled on Report Stage I would have considered them also on their merits.</P>
