      <P>I have notice from Senator Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to increase the number of gardaí on the beat in Bray and Greystones, County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Item 2 from now until 1 p.m. &mdash; Second Stage and Item 4 between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. With the co-operation of the House I hope that Item will conclude within the hour and Item 5 will be taken between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m.  I asked for the change that was requested by the House yesterday but it was it was not possible to arrange it.  There is a commitment that at a very early date this House will have an opportunity of discussing the situation in Yugoslavia.</P>

      <P>There is no difficulty with the Order of Business today.  I appreciate the efforts made by the Leader to change today's business of the House at short notice.  If we could have that debate as soon as possible it would be appreciated.</P>
      <P>I ask that ample time be made available to debate Item 1 which deals with the establishment of a foreign affairs committee. I ask the Leader to note &mdash; and I have pointed it out before &mdash; that in the restructuring of committees this House is left out of three of the proposed new committees.  This problem needs to be addressed on an all-party basis, to ensure that this House has an adequate committee system through which it can make its contribution.</P>
      <P>I congratulate all those concerned with the Suicide Bill yesterday.  What happened reflects great credit on this House. I regret that the Government did not see fit to allow it to be taken as a Private Members' Bill.  I do not accept that this Bill was drafted without sufficient expertise and back-up.  Nonethless, it stands to the credit of the House that this important piece of reform will be initiated here with input from all sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill proposes to give the force of law to two international conventions which, as a member state of the European Communities, we are committed to ratify.  Both conventions deal with the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of them &mdash; the Accession Convention &mdash; provides for the accession of Spain and Portugal to the 1968 EC Convention <Col N="1767" /> and to the Protocol on its interpretation by the Court of Justice of the European Communities in Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>The other &mdash; called the Lugano Convention &mdash; was negotiated between EC member states and the member states of the European Free Trade Association and extended the area of reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments from the European Communities to all the six EFTA countries.</P>
    <P>The conventions will come into force on the first day of the third month after deposit of the instruments of ratification. From then on our civil judgments and other court orders will be enforceable on a reciprocal basis in Spain and Portugal and in the EFTA countries, namely, Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.</P>
    <P>I shall deal first with the background to the Accession Convention.  In 1968 a convention for the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments was negotiated by the six original member states of the European Community.  A Protocol was added in 1971 providing for the interpretation of the convention by the European Court of Justice.  When Denmark, Ireland and the UK joined the Community, and later on when Greece joined, the convention and Protocol were amended to cater for the particular concerns of those countries.  In 1988 we gave the force of law to the amended 1968 Convention and Protocol with the result that our judgments are now enforceable, on a reciprocal basis, in nine of the other EC member states.  Passage of the Bill will enable the area of reciprocal enforcement to be extended to the whole Twelve.</P>
    <P>So, as regards the Accession Convention, what the Bill does is to extend the application of the 1988 Act to Spain and Portugal.  This is achieved in the Bill by consequential amendments of that Act and these amendments, as Senators will see, are of a technical character.  The Bill also gives effect to a number of other amendments made by the Accession Convention to the EC Convention. These other amendments were made so <Col N="1768" /> that the EC Convention would correspond as closely as possible with the Lugano Convention concluded with the EFTA countries.  I shall come back to the various amendments later.</P>
    <P>I think it is worthwhile recalling some of the main principles underlying the EC Convention.  First, it applies only to judgments in civil and commercial matters. It extends to employment contracts, and also to maintenance orders.  It expressly excludes such matters as those affecting the status of legal capacity of natural persons and rights in property arising out of a matrimonial relationship. And of course it does not apply to fiscal or administrative matters, but clearly, the convention has a very wide scope.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it includes uniform and comprehensive rules on jurisdiction which apply in the country where the proceedings are instituted and serve to determine the court vested with jurisdiction. The importance of this is that, with a few exceptions, an enforcing court in another member state is obliged to accept the jurisdictional competence of the court which gave the judgment so that enforcement of a judgment given in one member state is, as nearly as possible, automatic in each of the other member states.</P>
    <P>The third principle is that the defendant must be sued in the member state where he or she ordinarily resides. Obviously it is more difficult, generally speaking, to defend oneself before a court of a foreign country than it would be before a court in another town in one's own country, but there are several exceptions to this principle to cover cases where the plaintiff is the weaker party to the proceedings or for other practical reasons.  For example, a married woman seeking maintenance against her husband living in another member state may initiate the proceedings in her local court. The same applies to consumers and holders of insurance policies.</P>
    <P>Finally, the convention limits the grounds for refusing to recognise and enforce judgments mainly to public policy and natural justice and it provides a unified and simplified enforcement procedure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1769" /> The 1968 Convention was a tremendous step forward at the time in facilitating the free circulation of judgments throughout the Community.  The more or less automatic recognition of judgments made possible their speedy enforcement. Here, for example, the foreign creditor has only to apply to the Master of the High Court <i>ex parte</i> to have the judgment enforced as if it were an order of the High Court.  However, a creditor, particularly a maintenance creditor, who is not in a position to avail himself or herself of even this simplified procedure is still at a disadvantage as compared with a person enforcing an order within the jurisdiction. I shall be addressing this matter in another measure which is now being prepared and which will further help in the enforcement abroad of maintenance orders.  This measure will enable Ireland to accede to the EC and UN Maintenance Conventions which improve procedures for recovery of maintenance within the European Communities and which provide a mechanism to assist in the recovery of maintenance payments for spouses resident in non-EC countries.</P>
    <P>I now turn to Part III of the Bill which is concerned with giving the force of law to the Lugano Convention.  In 1985 the member states of the European Free Trade Association expressed a wish to conclude with the member states of the European Communities a convention based on the principles of the EC Convention. The negotiations were completed relatively quickly.  They resulted in a convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, which was opened for signature in Lugano on 16 September 1988 at the close of a diplomatic conference held at the invitation of the Swiss Government.</P>
    <P>The Lugano Convention is also based on the fundamental principles of the EC Convention and most of its articles are identical with those of that convention. A number of improvements to the EC Convention were incorporated by the Lugano Convention.  It was therefore natural that these improvements should be taken into account in the preparatory <Col N="1770" /> negotiations, within the Communities, for the accession of Spain and Portugal to the EC Convention.</P>
    <P>The main amendments made to the EC Convention has been outlined in the appendix to the explanatory and financial memorandum circulated with the Bill. Several of the amendments are designed to improve the position of the weaker party to proceedings by enabling him or her to commence the proceedings in his or her own courts.  For example, the position of an employee is improved in several respects.  Under the 1968 EC Convention the employee could sue the employer either in the courts of the employer's domicile or those of the country where the contract of employment was to be performed.  Under the amended EC Convention and the Lugano Convention the employee has the option of suing in the country where he or she habitally works and, if the employee does not habitually work in any one country, in the country where the employee was engaged.  Actually, the amended EC Convention goes further.  It covers also the case where the business that engaged the employer has moved to another member state and gives the employee the option of suing there also.</P>
    <P>Another amendment designed to protect the employee is contained in a paragraph added to Article 17 of each convention.  That article allows parties to agree on the court of a contracting state that is to have jurisdiction to settle any disputes that have arisen or may arise. The Lugano Convention provides that, in the case of an individual contract of employment, such an agreement will not be valid unless it is entered into after a dispute has arisen.  The amendment to the EC Convention makes similar provision but also allows an employee to invoke a pre-dispute agreement.  Thus under the amending EC Convention the choice between the courts having jurisdiction is entirely at the discretion of the employee as plaintiff.  The chosen court can be that of the state where the employer is domiciled, or the court of the state where the contract of employment is to be performed, or the court of the <Col N="1771" /> state designated in an agreement covering jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Another improvement in the EC Convention I might mention relates to short term lettings of properties abroad.  Under Article 16.1 of the 1968 EC Convention proceedings relating to tenancies of such properties have to be taken in the country where the property is situated.  That would obviously be most inconvenient where, for example, an Irish resident needed to sue another Irish resident for rent due under a letting of a holiday home, say in Spain.  Under the amended EC Convention such an action can be instituted in our courts.  The amended provision will apply only where both parties are individuals &mdash; companies are excluded on the grounds that they are concerned with commercial actions &mdash; and where they are both domiciled in the same state.</P>
    <P>The corresponding provision in the Lugano Convention is somewhat less restrictive.  It provides that in the case of holiday lettings the plaintiff can apply to the courts of the state where the defendant is domiciled.  The only qualification is that the tenant is an individual and that neither party is domiciled in the country where the property is situated.</P>
    <P>This is the first of the Bills which I am committed to introduce under the Programme for a Partnership Government. Although it is a technical Bill, it has significant practical implications.  It will be of benefit to our business community in securing more or less automatic enforcement for Irish judgments in Spain, Portugal and all the EFTA countries. But it will also &mdash; and, as the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, I am particularly concerned with this aspect &mdash; ensure the enforcement in those countries of orders for the maintenance of spouses and dependants.  I trust it will be acceptable to the House as a noncontroversial measure which arises out of our obligations as a member state of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>I shall be happy to give any clarifications that Senators may seek and to consider any amendments they may wish <Col N="1772" /> to put forward either now or on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and the fact that this legislation is before the House today.  As the Minister said, this is a technical Bill which enables Ireland to ratify the Accession Convention of Spain and Portugal in 1989 and the Lugano Convention which governs the enforcement of judgments between the EC and EFTA member states.  The Bill gives the force of law to both these conventions.  It has relevance to people who have dealings with Spain and Portugal and the countries of the European Free Trade Association.  It is relevant to Irish companies doing business in these states, especially where they have legal difficulties and need to institute proceedings in any of those states to seek or enforce judgments granted by our courts.  It will confer basic rights on individuals who might, for example, suffer injury as a result of a road accident or other civil wrong in another State.  Another example would be the purchase of a consumer product in an EFTA country which could cause personal injury or be found faulty on return to this country.  Court proceedings might be necessary to seek compensation from a supplier in one of the EFTA states for any resulting personal injuries.  The Bill before the House has fulfilled a promise made in 1987, by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, to extend the writ of the then Bill to include the EFTA countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is oriented towards the High and Supreme Court.  Surely there are increased work load implications for these courts.  I ask the Minister to comment on that because the Bill states that there will be no need for increased staff. The basic principle of the Bill is that civil judgments in one member state should be recognised and enforced throughout EFTA states as well as EC states.  The Bill sets out the procedure to be followed in order to achieve this.  The Bill extends existing EC practice to Spain and Portugal and to the states of the European Free Trade Association.  It is hardly possible <Col N="1773" /> that this Bill will not give rise to an increased work load in the already busy courts.</P>
    <P>In my constituency in the mid-west area, the High Court is four years behind in the hearing of civil cases.  It is unjust that people should have to wait three or four years to have a case heard and it appears that the delay in the mid-west is getting worse.  I refer to the situation in the Limerick-Ennis area as an example of what is happening throughout the country.  While the legal profession get bad press out of this, insurance companies are virtually ignoring claims at present.  People who are under financial pressure waiting for accident claims to come to court are often unable to work because of injuries received.  They could be waiting three or four years to hear the outcome of a claim.  I ask the Minister to look at this problem.  In Limerick and Ennis, instead of two judges for six weeks there should be two judges for a period of six months to clear the backlog.  The present delay is giving the area of civil proceedings a bad name in the press and with the public.  The implications are that the insurance companies are abusing the situation.  A similar arrangement should be made countrywide to reduce the backlog of civil cases.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, this is a technical Bill which will not cause much public reaction.  Nevertheless, it is a very important Bill and I commend the Minister for introducing it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill.  This is complex and technical legislation ratifying two separate international conventions.  When the Bill comes into effect Irish judgments in civil and commercial matters will be enforceable throughout the EFTA countries. The Bill will also provide reciprocal enforcement of EFTA state judgments in this State by a simple and speedy arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general principle of the Bill is a good one and helps to internationalise justice.  It means that there are no boltholes through which the unscrupulous can escape.  The arrangements protect an <Col N="1774" /> injured party who has received a judgment from suffering the further injustice and injury of seeing the party against whom he or she has won the judgment go free in a neighbouring state because judgments are not enforceable there or because of the cost and complexity of attempting to win a further judgment or enforcement in another state.  The main thrust of the legislation and its founding principle are welcome.</P>
    <P>The specific provisions of the Bill are highly technical.  I note and welcome a number of specific parts of the Bill. Section 8 confers jurisdiction in these areas on the Circuit Court.  The same section also provides for clarification on issues of domicile.  As the Minister has said, a particularly welcome aspect of this Bill and of further changes the Minister has undertaken to introduce are the improvements that will be made on the issue of maintenance.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself touches on an important principle, that is, the internationalisation of law.  It elaborates on the idea of justice crossing borders without complex, special, individual, country by country arrangements.  It is interesting that the international community has evolved to a point where this can be done in particularly complex areas of commercial and civil law.  This counterpoints the failure of the international community to establish similar logical working arrangements in matters of criminal law.  The failure has produced complication and confusion in an area where there should be none.</P>
    <P>The most serious area, extradition, is fraught with difficulties not just in Ireland but in many other countries. It is interesting that Irish court judgments in complex commercial and civil matters can be dealt with without difficulty but the appropriate authorities in other States are less willing to accept the competence of these same courts in criminal areas, particularly those with a political context.  This is an indication of the immaturity of authorities elsewhere.  They are willing to accept the internationalisation of law in one regard but they are not willing to accept that principle in other areas.  They <Col N="1775" /> are also unwilling to trust the wisdom and impartiality of courts in this country or other countries in the same areas.  I do not wish to expand on this subject because I realise it is a more controversial area and is not directly relevant to the Bill. Nonetheless, the net effect is one of complication, dissatisfaction and confusion all round.</P>
    <P>The Minister's clear, precise contribution dealt with a complex piece of legislation in a concise manner.  He showed that the internationalisation of the legal process is beneficial to all.  It helps commercial operators and businesses in this country which have had difficulties with judgments, and it particularly helps spouses who have had difficulties with maintenance changes.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a further example of a trend of tackling those complex traditional legal features which tied law to individual countries and prevented justice crossing borders.  This legislation will be welcomed by all sides in the House.  I commend it to the House and I compliment the Minister on coming so speedily to us with this complex legislation.  I look forward to the other legislation and the changes which will flow from this. Finally, I welcome the Minister, congratulate him on his portfolio and wish him well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister to the House and compliment him on this fine legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a technical Bill.  Its intention is to enable Ireland to ratify two international conventions relating to the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.  The Bill is necessary by virtue of our membership of the EC and the European Free Trade Association.  First it adopts the Accession Convention of 1989 which provided for the accession of Spain and Portugal to the 1968 Brussels Convention on jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments.  When another country joined the EC it was necessary to provide for the accession of the EC Convention in each case.  In 1978 the convention <Col N="1776" /> was amended to allow for Ireland's membership and was given force in Ireland under the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) Act, 1988. Judgments handed down by the Irish courts are now reciprocally enforceable in nine other EC states and will shortly be applicable in Spain and Portugal when the Accession Convention relating to those two countries comes into force. Secondly, the Act enables Ireland to ratify the Lugano Convention.  This Convention provides for the enforcement of judgments between members of the EC and the EFTA member states.</P>
    <P>This legislation is a practical measure. The 1968 Convention was a major step in facilitating the free circulation and general applicability of judgments throughout European countries.  If one goes to the Irish courts as a creditor and gets judgment ordered against the debtor, should the debtor decide to abscond to a European country one need only apply to the courts in that country to have the judgment pursued and perhaps ultimately receive payment.  One does not have to go through the exhaustive procedure again in the new country.  This is a practical measure in the fields of trade and commerce and allows for a much easier flow of business.</P>
    <P>The main amendments to the EC Conventions are included in this Bill.  It improves the position of the weaker party in proceedings by enabling him or her to commence proceedings in his or her own jurisdiction instead of having to go through the exhaustive procedure in other European states.  The Minister should be complimented for introducing this legislation now.</P>
    <P>A worthwhile aspect of the Bill is that it assists the employee in many instances. The employee is given the option of suing in the country where he or she works or in another state where the company has moved its registered office.  The employee can initiate proceedings in whichever country suits him or her.</P>
    <P>The short term letting of properties abroad is an important matter in a time when many invest in such property. <Col N="1777" /> Under Article 16 (1) of the 1968 Convention, proceedings relating to tenancies of such properties had to be taken in the country where the property is situated. Under the amended EC Convention any action necessary can be initiated in our own courts, where both parties are individuals and both are domiciled in the same state.</P>
    <P>I will mention briefly the main features of the system of reciprocal enforcement. It applies only to civil and commercial matters, including maintenance orders. Going through the courts to obtain maintenance is difficult at the best of times and it does not help to know that either spouse can abscond and that one may have to start again especially when financial circumstances may not allow for that.  Therefore its particular applicability to maintenance orders is welcome.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that a defendant must generally be sued in the country where he or she is domiciled.  There are exceptions, for example, an insurance policy holder may sue in the country where he or she is domiciled, as can a consumer who is a party to a contract for the sale of goods or supply of services.  Matters relating to tort, i.e., the civil actions referred to earlier, can be litigated in the place where the damage occurred. Matters relating to contract can now be litigated in the place where the contract was to be performed as opposed to where the contract was made initially.  That is a practical provision for people in trade.</P>
    <P>While the Bill may seem technical I believe it is simple.  It allows for the ratification of these two conventions and I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on the legislation he is introducing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is only now being debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, in a recent High Court judgment, a defendant sought to have the plantiff's proceedings dismissed on the grounds that they had no connection with the Irish jurisdiction.  The judge ruled it is not open to a defendant from a contracting state to admit liability so as to deprive a <Col N="1778" /> plantiff of the right to pursue a claim in a court in which jurisdiction has been established.  The 1968 Brussels Convention was referred to in this case.</P>
    <P>This Bill marks a further step in the process initiated when we joined the European Community in January 1973. During the past 20 years we have been integrated into this community of 340 million people which is governed by representatives of the 12 member states.  It is in our national interest to maintain full membership of this democratic club and to participate in decision making for the socio-economic benefit of Ireland and the development of Europe.  Ireland's commitment to the European Community is based on <i>realpolitik</i> and on an assessment of our practical, economic and social interests.  Community membership provides us with the means to influence decisions on political, economic and social issues which, inevitably, will have a profound effect on us.</P>
    <P>For many years there has been co-operation between member states in the areas of justice and home affairs on an inter-governmental basis outside the framework of the Treaty of Rome.  In 1976 Justice and Interior Ministers of the member states set up an informal organisation known as the Trevi Group as a forum for the exchange of information on matters of common interest.  It has brought international co-operation in the fight against serious crime to the level it has reached today.  Expanding from its early concentration on the fight against international terrorism it is involved in the fight against drug trafficking and other serious crime, police training and the use of equipment and forensic methods.  Through that forum, judicial co-operation between the member states has been advanced, particularly in the area of civil law, child abduction, child custody and on simplified procedures for recovery of maintenance payments.</P>
    <P>Since 1 January this year we have free access to the largest and strongest consumer market in the world.  Within the European Union Treaty there is a section dealing with citizenship.  It gives all citizens of member states citizenship of the <Col N="1779" /> EC with the right to move freely throughout the EC and the right to diplomatic protection from all member states. However free access has attendant risks for consumers and this Bill will reduce those risks.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill is not connected with the Maastricht Treaty or the Single Market, it indicates our commitment to the European Community and the trend towards unity that exists between communities. Successive Irish Governments have favoured the progressive evolution of the European Economic Community to European Union and the Irish people, in referenda in 1972, 1987 and 1992, overwhelmingly endorsed Ireland's accession to the Community.  Membership of the European Community has brought substantial benefits to this country.  Since our accession in 1973 all Governments have ensured that membership has yielded substantial political, economic and social benefits while the Community has been influenced by Ireland to include the intrinsic values and aspirations of Irish people in its social and foreign policies.</P>
    <P>The Co-ordinator's Group for the Free Movement of Persons was established by the European Council at a Heads of Government meeting in Rhodes in December 1988.  The Council was aware that the free movement of persons, especially in territory without internal frontiers, is linked to inter-governmental co-operation to combat terrorism, serious crime and illegal trafficking of all kinds.  It is with understanding that I address the section of the Bill dealing with the enforcement of maintenance orders in all European locations.</P>
    <P>The Bill encompasses two international conventions: the first provides for the accession of Spain and Portugal into the European Community and the second enables us to ratify the 1988 Lugano Convention.  Both conventions have their origin in the 1968 Brussels Convention on the Recognition of Enforcement of Civil and Commercial Judgments.  The Lugano Convention allows, in the case of short term tenancies, an exception to the rule in Article <Col N="1780" /> 16.1 of the EC Convention that proceedings relating to tenancies of immovable property must be heard in the courts of the state where the property is situated. The new provision would allow, for example, an Irishman to take an action against a fellow Irishman where the dispute relates to a short term tenancy of property, maybe a holiday home, situated in another country, such as Spain. The tenant, however, must be a named person and not a company.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be of benefit to many people who, previously, have had difficulty getting court judgments enforced outside this country.  With the continuing freedom of trade and movement between countries it is no longer sufficient that Irish judgments should be limited in terms of enforcement.  The Lugano Convention provides for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments between the European Community and European countries which are members of the European Free Trade Association. As we will be in a position to ratify the 1989 Accession Convention, court orders and judgments including maintenance orders which are enforceable in Spain and Portugal, will be enforceable here and, by the same token, Irish judgments will be enforceable in Spain and Portugal.</P>
    <P>With regard to the enforcement of maintenance orders, this provision is helpful in cases where spouses have left the country for another European location and discontinued maintenance payments to their spouses and their children. The ease of travel between European countries in recent years has meant that such occurrences are now quite common and it is, therefore, timely that a provision such as that outlined in this Bill should be introduced.  It will also alleviate the financial burden for the State caused by spouses absconding.</P>
    <P>The Lugano Convention is almost a mirror image of the European Community Judgments Convention.  The EFTA countries, who are not members of the European Community &mdash; Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland &mdash; will have the same arrangement with Ireland regarding <Col N="1781" /> reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments as already exists between Ireland and the European Community. That is a welcome development to alleviate the problem of enforcing maintenance orders in respect of those people who have fled to another European country.</P>
    <P>The Bill is another step on the road to harmonisation of arrangements between European countries.  It is appropriate that in so far as the enforcement of maintenance orders is concerned, justice will not only be done but will be seen to be done in Ireland, the European Community and the EFTA countries.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also reduce the conflict of laws in the international sphere.  I was heartened to see, in the interpretation section of the Bill, that Irish courts can now refer to judgments in similar cases in other countries when making their decisions.  The interpretation clauses are also binding on the European Court of Justice and should allow precedents established at European level to apply to local Circuit Court decisions.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House and thank the Minister for introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the introduction of this Bill.  It is a necessary and welcome development that the Accession Convention is extended to Spain and Portugal.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill improves the implementation of legislation throughout the EC.  However, I have some queries about this legislation. The Bill expressly excludes matters affecting the status or legal capacity of natural persons and property rights arising out of a matrimonial relationship. Why is this excluded?  Although it is gratifying to see that a married woman seeking a maintenance order against her husband living in another state may initiate proceedings in her local court why is that facility not extended to the broader jurisdiction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am contributing to this debate in order to focus on the fact that this meritorious convention does not apply to certain other countries to which it should <Col N="1782" /> apply.  I would like to bring to the Minister's attention the fact that outside the Geneva Convention, we have few arrangements with for example, New Zealand.  While I realise that my contribution is not dealing specifically with this Bill, I want to take the opportunity to bring to the Minister's attention an unsatisfactory situation which exists in regard to New Zealand, Australia and the United States.</P>
    <P>At present, because of the absence &mdash; as far as I am aware &mdash; of any convention or agreement with New Zealand, an Irish person cannot enforce a judgment obtained here in that country.  For example, I had a case in my constituency recently of an Irishman who was married to a New Zealander.  Despite the fact that court orders were issued in this country, the wife was unable to leave this jurisdiction and return to New Zealand and her husband has no rights now with regard to his two children.  He cannot claim access to them or bring them back to this country.  There is no convention &mdash; there was not up to a number of months ago &mdash; which would allow him to make a claim on his children.  I believe this to be a serious situation and although I am only aware of that one case, I wonder are there other cases, for example, in the United States, Australia, etc.?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which I understand is largely a technical measure and I ask the Minister to focus on the need for a proper convention to be enacted with New Zealand, so the example I have given does not arise in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank all who contributed to the debate, for their constructive and helpful interventions. Senator Neville complained that the Bill was not very exciting.  I am sorry about that.  Perhaps on the next occasion we will try to spice it up.  This is a technical measure, but it has important and will have increasing application as time passes.  Senators will be aware of the increasing interplay between Ireland and EC and EFTA countries over recent <Col N="1783" /> years as a result of the association between the two trading blocs.  There are many cases of spouses being separated, one living here and one in another European country.  People work or holiday in Europe and may have accidents there. Many thousands of Irish people holiday in Spain every year.  Many accidents occur and the question of redress will be facilitated by the passage of this Bill, following on the accession of Spain to the EC.</P>
      <P>Senator Neville referred to the question of delays in the courts.  He is concerned that the passage of the Bill might increase the workload of the courts, particularly in his own region and, thereby, exacerbate that problem. Undoubtedly, some of the courts are heavily overburdened and there are long lists, which is regrettable.  It is not a matter which comes under my Department; it is a matter for the Department of Justice to organise the courts and their staffing.  I would not expect, however, that any increase in staffing will be required as a result of the passage of this Bill.</P>
      <P>From 1988 to mid-1992 about 75 requests for enforcement of judgments were made to Irish courts.  The procedure for enforcing a foreign judgment in an Irish court is a simple, short procedure and would take little court time.  As I said, it is done on an <i>ex parte</i> basis.  The application would be little more than a formality, would take some minutes and would not require extensive paper work. The object of the exercise is to facilitate and simplify the procedures for enforcement of foreign judgments in Ireland and Irish judgments abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only case where perhaps some court time might be taken up is in the case of an appeal against the Master's order, which would be to a High Court judge.  The possibilities for appeal are very limited.  Once the foreign court judgment is in place, it speaks for itself and is automatically confirmed by the Master of the High Court, so the basis for an appeal would be very rare and <Col N="1784" /> would only arise in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche pointed out that the Bill will be valuable for protecting an injured party and I agree with him.  He deplored the fact that the concept behind the Bill could not be extended to criminal matters and that was a point taken up by Senator Crowley also in a very detailed and thoughtful contribution, for which I compliment him.  I agree broadly with their comments.  Again, I will draw those comments to the attention of the Minister for Justice who has responsibility for criminal matters and I am sure she and her Department are working on all possible measures to improve the cross-Border effectiveness of the criminal law.</P>
    <P>Senator Crowley rightly pointed out that the Bill is an indication of an increase in co-operation between EC countries on important business, commercial and personal matters and is one of the benefits we have obtained from the EC.  The mere fact that those benefits exist, highlights the shortcomings in our arrangements with other countries, as mentioned by Senator Fahey.  Before we became a member of the EC, our position with regard to EC and EFTA countries was as it is now in the case of New Zealand, Australia and the United States.  There was no mutual effective support for judgments between Ireland and another country.</P>
    <P>Senator Fahey's highlighting of the New Zealand case shows the progress we have made in achieving this reciprocity for judgments in the EC and EFTA countries. It is not true, as he said, that an Irish person would have no claim or rights in these situations.  They would have rights but the means of enforcing them would present almost insuperable difficulties. They could institute proceedings in New Zealand and conduct a case there, but the practicalities of carrying it through is another matter.</P>
    <P>For practical purposes, Senator Fahey is correct in concluding that they are deprived of their rights.  This highlights the need to try to conclude and negotiate similar conventions with other countries outside the EC and EFTA, to achieve <Col N="1785" /> mutual reciprocity in the enforcement of judgments.  I am not sure what the position is in the United States but I do not think there is a detailed convention in this area.  As Senators know, there is a great deal of movement of Irish people and spouses between this country and the US.  New Zealand might be an exception, but the United States would pose a major problem.  Enforcing maintenance orders in the US would present almost insuperable difficulties for the spouses resident here to secure redress.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville rightly implied that if business and commercial arrangements are to function with maximum efficiency, there has to be an assurance that legal remedies will not be bound by national frontiers.  This Bill could make a valuable contribution in fostering a climate which might help to increase our exports, especially to those countries not members of the EC.  Irish experience of the Brussels Convention suggests that it is not giving rise to any substantive problems or difficulties.  The familiarity which the courts and practitioners would have gained in operating its provisions should smooth the implementation of this measure.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions. I emphasise again the importance of this legislation in terms of its social impact in the maintenance area and the impact it may have on consumer and business relationships.  I am confident this Bill will make people more conscious that their legal rights have a genuine extra-territorial dimension so far as the EC and EFTA countries are concerned.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>
      <P>Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations, 1993,</P>
      <P>copies of which were laid in draft before Seanad Éireann on 28 April, 1993.</P>

      <P>Copies of the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations, 1993, were laid in draft form before the Seanad on 27 April 1993.  The proposed regulations are being made under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979, and their purpose is to reduce the financial contribution by the farming community towards the cost of the bovine TB and brucellosis eradication schemes by a sum of £2 million.  It is proposed that this sum will be saved on the estimated running costs of this year's programme.</P>
      <P>A scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis in cattle was first introduced in Ireland in 1954.  The scheme was successful by the mid-1970s in reducing the endemic levels of disease in the national herd to an animal incidence of approximately 0.5 per cent.  However, the real difficulty is that progress towards final eradication slowed at that level and persistent difficulties were encountered in achieving further sustained reductions in disease levels.  Clearing residual levels of any infectious disease is difficult but it is surprising that achieving further reductions in the level of TB has proved so difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1988 a new initiative, ERAD &mdash; the Eradication of Animal Disease Board &mdash; was established by the Government as a specialised agency to implement a vigorous four year bovine TB eradication programme.  The main conclusions to be drawn from the ERAD experience is that eradication is more difficult than had originally been envisaged; that high volume of testing <i>per se</i> is not the answer; <Col N="1787" /> and that special emphasis needs to be placed on related issues, such as the development of technological tools, including a computerised movement permit system and a blood based diagnostic test to supplement the existing skin test together with a possible vaccine for cattle and wildlife.  Consideration is currently being given to the type of arrangements appropriate for the next four years of the programme and a wide range of consultations have been held with farming and veterinary organisations.  In the meantime, however, it is necessary to continue the effort to systematically and progressively reduce the existing levels of the disease.</P>
    <P>When ERAD was established the Government undertook that, in addition to meeting the administrative costs of the scheme, which this year will come to about £18 million, it would maintain a financial commitment to the running costs of the schemes.  The current running costs are shared by the Exchequer and the farming community.  The farmers' contribution is provided through levies collected under the 1979 Bovine Disease Levies Act.  In 1992 farmers contributed £29 million by way of levy.  For 1993 the amount now proposed for collection will be approximately £27 million while the estimated running costs of the schemes for 1993 will be reduced from £43.5 million to £41.5 million.</P>
    <P>The background to the proposed new financial arrangements related to the establishment of the EC veterinary fund under which member states can seek funding for disease eradication measures in the context of reaching a common animal health status to facilitate animal movement in the Single Market.  Ireland has made an application to the Commission for EC funding for part recoupment of bovine TB reactor compensation and testing costs amounting to a potential draw down of some £20 million per year. While the application is technically acceptable to the Commission Services it has not yet been approved as the veterinary fund budget is fully taken up for 1993 and cannot, for the present, fund <Col N="1788" /> a number of member state programmes including Ireland's bovine TB programme. However, I am continuing to press that the money be made available at the earliest possible date.  The availability of EC funding is central to the provision of the amplified resources needed to push for a sustained reduction in the residual incidence of bovine TB.  Securing of that funding remains a priority and is being pursued at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>Draw down of this level of EC funding will, of course, allow for the possibility of a significant reduction in the financial burden of the eradication schemes on both the Exchequer and the farming community. However, pending the draw down of the EC funding it is necessary for trading and veterinary reasons to proceed with a full monitor of the national herd and this year's TB testing programme commenced this week.  It is intended that a full round of TB testing will be completed before the end of the year.  This will involve a test for every herd together with any necessary consequential testing arising from reactor disclosure.  In addition, the national herd will continue to be monitored for brucellosis though a combination of milk testing of the dairy herds and blood testing of the non-dairy and suckler enterprises.</P>
    <P>Following discussions with the farming organisations it has been possible to identify agreed savings of £2 million through an adjustment in reactor compensation and a slight reduction in the amount of testing originally planned for this year's programme.  These savings will allow for a reduction in the bovine disease levies of the order of 0.1p per gallon of milk processed and 60p per animal slaughtered or exported live.  It is proposed to pass back the full amount of the savings to the farming community.  The savings, while relatively modest, have been accepted by the farming organisations as a recognition of the significant cost to herd owners in the context of tightening enterprise margins.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the House will appreciate that given the overriding requirement to reduce the incidence of bovine TB, a thorough analysis of all the factors <Col N="1789" /> involved in disease transmission must be a key element of any eradication programme.</P>
    <P>On the overall question of research, the TB investigation unit has been in existence for four years and has carried out a variety of projects in relation to factors which militate against eradication. It has carried out a considerable amount of analytical work on statistical data.  A total of 19 projects were completed in 1992 and an extensive programme of work has been mapped out for 1993.  Valuable work is also being done by my Department's veterinary research laboratory especially on culturing <i>post-mortem</i> samples and on the evaluation of blood tests.  Work is continuing on the development of a blood test which has been identified as a major research priority not just in this country but in others having a bovine TB problem. My Department is participating in EC funded trials and we are also carrying out our own research projects and collaborating with research elsewhere in this area.  Although the project is as yet very much at the experimental stage and progress is slow, the objective is to get to a stage where the blood test would be reliable under practical field conditions and could augment and back-up the tuberculin test in certain situations.</P>
    <P>Work on the computerised movement permit system is progressing well and, when completed, will be of enormous benefit to the administration of the eradication programme.  The system will be extensive and complex and will form part of the current overall computerisation of my Department.  In the meantime herd owners should consider the benefit of keeping their own records of the movements of cattle into and out of their holdings. In any event, such record keeping will shortly be a requirement arising from the introduction of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>The experience of ERAD would indicate that the goal of eradication is more difficult than originally envisaged. However, I believe that with the full co-operation of all concerned it will be possible to break the back of this disease once and for all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome a debate, no matter how short, on this issue and this regulation affords us the opportunity for such debate.  Disease eradication has been an ongoing saga for many years in this country.  I have always argued, and continue to argue, that unless we secure the confidence, support and co-operation of farmers we will never eradicate these diseases.  It is as simple as that.  We have been criticised for not eradicating TB in particular and brucellosis to a lesser extent.</P>
      <P>I describe the present Government policy as one of containment rather than eradication.  More resources will have to be made available, no matter from where they come, if the incidence of TB in cattle is to be brought down to an acceptable level.  In the last four years the incidence of bovine TB has varied between 3 per cent and 4 per cent, but we have difficulty reducing it below these levels.  Different Ministers have made statements to the effect that we are making progress. However, 12 months later we seem to have the same level of disease.</P>
      <P>I speak as a practising farmer.  There is no one more afraid of disease in his herd than the farmer.  The vets are paid, the departmental officials are paid and the Minister is paid but if a farmer is unfortunate enough to detect disease in his herd he must inevitably lock up or depopulate the herd.  This has serious consequences for any farmer.  I have seen many farms where herds contracted the disease and depopulation began and the farmers never recovered financially from the losses they suffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of funding has always been difficult.  The Minister said that the contribution from farmers in the form of levies was £29 million last year and £27 million this year.  The levy has been reduced by .1p per gallon of milk, and by 60p per head of cattle slaughtered.  I cannot understand why the Department did not wait until we found out exactly what use will be made of the promised £80 million from the EC for the four years of the programme.  The Minister did not tell us when and in what form this money will be forthcoming.  Will it be in the form <Col N="1791" /> of a grant towards the overall costs of the scheme &mdash; £20 million a year over four years &mdash; or in some other form?  The Minister can take it from me that profit margins are so tight that farmers can no longer afford to fund this scheme.</P>
    <P>Compensation paid to farmers amounts to approximately £18 million. After farmers have contributed enough to cover the full cost of compensation paid, £11 million is available to cover the overall cost of the scheme.  That is a substantial contribution from the farming community.  The overall cost of the scheme is in the region of £41 million to £42 million, while the shortfall, caused by administrative costs, is £11 million or £12 million.  The Minister must accept that the farmers are making a significant contribution towards the eradication of these diseases.</P>
    <P>I have criticised the Department of Agriculture and Food on many occasions and I am going to criticise them again today.  I will ask the Minister some questions and I presume he will have a chance to reply.  These are questions farmers are asking public representatives, including myself and the Minister.  What form will the £80 million from the EC take?  Will the farmers be able to reduce their contribution to £20 million?  Is the Department prepared to carry the same share as the farmers?</P>
    <P>Many farmers have disease-free herds. They are very careful and spent a lot of money disinfecting their premises to make sure their herds do not contract TB. They said they did not mind contributing to these levies over a short period but they are being asked to contribute over a long period.  These levies have been in operation for four or five years.  Can the Minister guarantee today that over the next four or five years the incidence of bovine TB will have reached an acceptable level?  I am not talking about brucellosis. That is a different disease and more easily contained than TB.</P>
    <P>As far as the eradication of bovine TB is concerned, we have made little or no progress over 25 years.  I believe there is something wrong when it comes to <Col N="1792" /> identifying the source of the disease.  I welcome the Ministers' statement, and I quote:</P>
    <P>On the overall question of research the TB investigation unit has been in existence for four years and has carried out a variety of projects in relation to factors which militate against eradication.</P>
    <P>I am asking him a simple question.  If I have disease in my herd can that unit identify the source of that disease?  The answer is no.  Despite all the technology, laboratories and staff, we do not seem to be able to identify the source of the disease.</P>
    <P>Let it be clearly understood that there are pockets in every county where the disease exists.  County Wexford is the same as anywhere else.  I know areas where the disease exists and a farmer is very careful when purchasing cattle from those areas.</P>
    <P>The farmers want to hear how this unit is working.  If there is a breakout of disease in my herd, will the Department carry out the research on my farm and tell me the source of the disease?  We do not seem to be able to do that and I am not sure if that can be done in other countries either.  In Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia 15 years ago, they almost depopulated every herd that had the disease but they cleared it.  Although I do not have documentation to back it, I believe they had a research unit which could identify the source of the disease. Although there are awful problems in those two countries unrelated to disease, I have been told the herds are disease free although I cannot confirm this.  Will the Minister deal with the questions in relation to the research unit?  What type of programme is it undertaking and will research be carried out on farms?  Laboratory research is not enough, the programme must take place where the disease is, on the farms.</P>
    <P>I understand that instances of brucellosis here may have doubled over a 12 month period but I am not sure whether that is true.  When I telephoned the Department of Agriculture this morning <Col N="1793" /> no one could supply me with the information. In 1991 approximately 150 herds contracted brucellosis while in 1992 the figure was 300 herds, a very worrying trend.  Having dealt with TB and brucellosis on my own farm I accept that it is easier to contain brucellosis even though it is a contagious disease and does great damage to a herd.  If there can be that type of increase in the space of 12 months then something is seriously wrong.  I understand that the milk round test identifies brucellosis in herds.  Every dairy farmer has a milk round test at least twice a month, and some of them have the test four times a month.  Therefore, the detection of brucellosis in herds seems to be easy as far as the Department is concerned because it is being notified of the situation by the creameries.  What is the position in regard to brucellosis? Was there an increase of 100 per cent over 12 months?</P>
    <P>The Minister did not spell out future policy and I would be interested in finding out what is happening in regard to the research unit.  We have heard arguments about the source of the disease and how it is carried from one farm to another. Am I correct in saying that there is testing of deer, goats and badgers?  There are many deer herds across the country and they are expanding rapidly.  Heretofore they have not been tested but they are carriers of TB.  Will the Minister state whether all deers will be tested under the 1993 test rounds?  It should be done and the same should apply to goats.  Since the national goat herd is small, the Department should include all herds of goats in the 1993 test rounds.</P>
    <P>We have had a long running argument with the Department and wildlife officials about badgers.  I have always believed, and no one will convince me otherwise, that the badger is a source of TB infection. It would take me half an hour to go through figures proving that when badgers were plentiful in areas TB broke out. Inevitably, in most of those areas, designated by the Department as blackspots, there were some badgers.  I know badgers are a protected species but the Minister will have to test and identify those carrying <Col N="1794" /> TB.  We cannot allow this situation to continue.  While the Minister says there is a 1 per cent reduction, that cannot be assessed until the end of testing this year because we will not know until then where we stand in regard to TB.</P>
    <P>The question of disinfecting also arises. Unfortunately, nearly every beast in the country will be transported about five times before slaughter and these are acceptable figures.  The disinfecting of lorries does not seem to be a priority with the Department.  The disinfecting of premises is a priority but farmers are no longer allowed to disinfect their own premises when they have an infected herd.  I disagree with that.  The vast majority of farmers will do everything in their power to keep their herds free of disease because they know the cost to their families and farms.  The Minister stated that farmers must use the milk relief service to disinfect but this will place further expense on farmers.  A locked up herd is a very serious matter and costs the farmer a lot of money even though compensation has improved. Substantial fees are being charged for disinfection work by the milk relief service.</P>
    <P>The movement of saleable cattle, not cows, from infected areas is spreading the disease.  The Minister says every beast will have to be identified but identification alone is not enough.  How do you guarantee that lorries in which cattle have been transported are properly disinfected? It is no good just using a spray can.  There are high-powered hoses that can do the job in five minutes and they should be used to disinfect cattle lorries. In the UK, cattle are transported on average one and a half times per year, and only once on the Continent.</P>
    <P>The levy reduction in this area is so small that it will have no effect on profits. It amounts to knocking £2 million off £29 million.  I appeal to the research unit, which has operated in the Department for four years, to visit the blackspots and identify the source of the disease.  If we are ever to stop it this must be done.</P>
    <P>I served in the Department of Agriculture and Food for a short period in <Col N="1795" /> 1981 and I said to their inspectors at the time that they must try to identify the source of the disease.  However, we do not seem to be able to do that.  Perhaps the Minister has information that I do not have and if so I would welcome it, so would the farmers.  We cannot go on forever with a disease rate of 3.5 per cent. The research unit should have acquired a lot of knowledge by now and a good basis on which to operate.  If disease breaks out in my herd I hope I will be able to ring the Department and that the research unit will come to my farm to identify the source of the disease.  I support the reduction in the levies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Bovine disease eradication has been continuing for a long time.  It was first introduced in 1954 and after all these years we have still not fully eradicated it.  The levies were introduced in 1979 and have been essential in funding the eradication of disease.  This year there has been a slight reduction in the levies. The last time such regulations came before the House was in 1990 when there was an increase.  ERAD was in operation at that time and some people were dissatisfied with it.  Members withdrew from ERAD because they did not think progress was being made.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech outlined the difficulty of eradicating bovine TB.  I listened attentively to Senator D'Arcy as he discussed its source.  My neighbours and I can often identify the source of a break out.  It may be because someone brought in an animal from an infected area or that farmers might not have been careful enough.  The source to which Senator D'Arcy referred is the original source.  It is difficult for the Department to find the source of this problem but I am sure that, eventually, they will be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the depopulation of herds.  If a herd is infected and needs to be depopulated, it should be done immediately.  This is not happening and the Department is not doing its job in this area.  Farmers are anxious to get adequate compensation.  I agree with <Col N="1796" /> Senator D'Arcy that the compensation received after a herd has been depopulated is inadequate to bring the herd back to its original standard.  I would like to see stricter and better discipline when depopulating herds.  I know of a herd infected with a disease &mdash; I will not mention its name &mdash; and there were ongoing discussions with the Department for 12 months before the herd was depopulated. That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that, following discussions with farming organisations, an agreed saving of £2 million has been identified through an investment in reactor compensation and a slight reduction in the amount of testing originally planned for this year's programme.  I would prefer to maintain the system of levies. Although I welcome the decrease in levies, I would not mind paying them as long as I would not have TB in my herd or on my premises.  When a herd becomes infected, there should be adequate compensation and despite any sacrifices that have to be made, people with infected herds must be adequately compensated. The compensation available to those with pedigree herds and to pedigree breeders who go to much expense to improve their herds is inadequate.  There should be an improvement and infected herds should be depopulated as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Every week the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> carries advertisements for Dutch imported and Friesian calving heifers. This activity presents a danger to disease eradication.  I do not know what regulations or conditions are imposed on such imports but the practice should be seriously examined.  Today, the farming supplement of <i>The Cork Examiner</i> carries an article, on mad cow disease which definitely came to this country through the importation of cattle.  Another one &mdash; Johnes disease &mdash; is mentioned in the article which states that it has been linked recently with the increase of imports of dairy breeding stock from the Continent.  We will definitely have to examine the importation of dairy breeding stock from the Continent.  There is enough breeding stock in this country to adequately meet replacement needs. <Col N="1797" /> Such importation was not allowed previously and should be again restricted.  It concerns me and many others, especially if an outbreak of disease occurs following the importation of cattle.  We are trying to eliminate disease, we should do our best to eliminate it and not damage or interfere with the eradication programme. The Minister stated that the EC funding for compensation is £20 million. I would like to see that money going towards adequately compensation for people with depopulated herds.  If that was done maybe disease would be eradicated within a few years.</P>
    <P>I telephoned the Department today to refresh my memory about the pre-movement regulations.  I remember speaking when this regulation was introduced in the House, at that time ERAD changed the 120 day test to a 60 day test and under the rules of the 50 day test, cattle could only be moved twice.  I understand that was changed and I telephoned the Department today but there was no one there to tell me whether one could move cattle as often as one liked after the 60 day test or if it is restricted to a certain number of movements.  I am engaged in farming and when I take out cattle, I try to sell them immediately, one or two movements are sufficient.  I wonder if it is still restricted to one or two movements.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the agricultural shows which are the show piece of agricultural products, especially dairy and show cattle.  The shows organised in Limerick are great occasions when urban and rural people mix.  They are wonderful events and the people organising them should get all available help.  The 60 day movement regulation is not helping the shows.  In the case of one or two day shows, in which the majority of cattle arrive in the morning and home that evening the 60 day movement could be extended to 90 days.  Delegations from shows and committees would like to see that changed and an exception made for show cattle.  The shows start in May and finish in September, some people are restricted from showing cattle, especially good prize cattle, and something should be done in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1798" /> The draft regulations are before us and the reduction in levies is welcome.  I see the regulation as a step towards the eradication of bovine disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last two occasions when a similar order came before the House I made my views clear.  We have spent £1.1 billion on the TB eradication scheme since its inception in 1954.  It has been a disaster and we are still looking at an incidence of the disease in 3 to 5 per cent of the national herd even at a time when the herd has been reduced.</P>
      <P>Everybody blames everybody else.  I have seen the reception a vet gets from the owner when he brings news of a reactor in the herd.  I have seen vets losing business because farmers &ldquo;shoot the messenger&rdquo; when they are told of a reactor in the herd and they may decide to take their business elsewhere.</P>
      <P>City people say the vets have a vested interest in maintaining the scheme because it means a lot of money for them. The farmers have a vested interest in ensuring they do not lose their herds because the compensation is not adequate.  Vets tell me they have a problem at every stage.  One veterinary surgeon told me he had to fill in 13 different forms on diagnosing a reactor in a herd. I do not know how true that is but he said trying to do that in the back of a car in a muddy farm yard is not easy.  He also complained that the level of follow up was neither quick nor comprehensive enough.  I acknowledge that this is a case of dúirt bean liom agus dúirt bean léi but vets feel they are on the receiving end of public odium and the farming communities think likewise.</P>
      <P>There is a constant row about how to get results in this scheme.  I do not envy any Minister taking responsibility for such an area, and trying to get a satisfactory result.  The vets are the professionals who are involved at every point in the scheme and they argue with the Departments.  As the professionals, they should be asked for their views on how bovine TB can be eradicated.  Let us try their proposals for a time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1799" /> The present system will never eradicate TB.  At the moment cattle are tested once a year.  Movement from farm to farm, from one herd to another, sale and resale, means often an animal can have moved up to nine times before being diagnosed as a reactor.  This means the animals movements may have to be traced over a period of years.  One checks all the herds the animal came from, and all the farms and, in the meantime, other animals have left those contaminated herds.  The area affected keeps getting wider.</P>
    <P>Everybody is looking for someone to blame, whether it be the vets, the farmers, or the badgers.  There is always someone to blame but nobody to take responsibility.  Meanwhile, a huge amount of money is being spent.  I am not an expert in this area, but in my view a two stage approach must be taken.  The first part is a test every time an animal is moved.  That would create chaos at the beginning but there must be a period when we stop the movement of animals until we are sure they are clear.  We can then proceed from that position.</P>
    <P>Other European countries have managed to eradicate TB.  We have failed because the movement of cattle has meant we cannot identify contaminated animals early enough.  The only way to ensure that does not happen is to test. Annual tests with animals moving in the meantime will never resolve the problem or get the results the taxpayers, the farmers and the vets want.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we now have an extraordinary opportunity to become the clean food centre of Europe, and I know the Minister shares that objective.  It is one of the few advantages of being an island community.  However, problems will arise from that over the next 18 months. There are European directives on the free movement of animals between member states of the European Community. I do not envy the Minister trying to deal with that.  It is not clear how we can stop diseases like rabies coming into our country.  Nonetheless, I believe that we can be a clean food area.  This week <Col N="1800" /> I was talking to two vets and they told me they would not advise people to eat red meat because of surplus contaminants.</P>
    <P>However, I am straying from the issue which is TB eradication.  Something radical needs to be done in this area.  We must stop movement until we are certain the animal is clear.  This has to be done over a period of time.  We will then have the disease under control and can look forward to a clear national herd.</P>
    <P>Nobody has a difference of opinion about what the objective is here, but everyone has a view about how it might be done.  I speak as somebody uneducated in this area, relaying stories I hear. I live in a farming community and I hear farmers, vets and taxpayers talking about the amount of money spent.  Everybody is supposed to be making a fortune from the scheme but neither vets nor farmers are, although money goes to both those groups.  We need radical action quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On 4 July 1990 when this issue was last debated in the Seanad, the then Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, said:</P>
      <P>In 1988 the Government embarked on a new initiative.  ERAD was established by the Government with the objective of planning and implementing a vigorous four year programme to accelerate the eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis</P>
      <P>The Minister said today the goal of eradication is more difficult than originally envisaged; he can say that again.  In 1990 it was hoped the process could be accelerated but that has not been the case. Senator O'Toole mentioned the figure of £1.1 billion spent over nearly 40 years and we have not got much closer to eradicating bovine TB.  I quote from a poem, &ldquo;The Brook&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>Men may come and men may go</P>
      <P>But I go on forever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was about a river but it seems to apply to bovine TB.  I sincerely hope it will not go on forever.  There were indications in the Minister's contribution that new <Col N="1801" /> radical measures are being considered &mdash; Senator O'Toole has suggested that is what we need &mdash; and that it is intended to at least look at such measures for the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely referred to the need for depopulation immediately infection is detected.  That is an important point and I support it.  Senator D'Arcy said the Department should concentrate on black spots and directly approach farmers. Farmers should have comprehensive advice if they have a particular problem. There are black spots in every county. County Limerick would not be considered a black spot because movement from that area tends to be outward rather than inward.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that there was the possibility of radical action in relation to the computerised movement permit system.  That relates to another point made by Senator O'Toole &mdash; that the movement of animals needs to be properly controlled.  I would like the Minister to elaborate on the computerised movement permit system, what does it entail, and would it go as far as the Senator wishes.  The question of movement is crucial. Animals being moved around the country is the biggest factor in spreading the disease.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to a suggestion that blood tests be taken.  I would also like him to elaborate that.  Mention was made of the proposal to vaccinate wildlife as well as farm animals.  Senator D'Arcy referred not just to badgers but to deer and goats.  That problem must be tackled.  Obviously blame is attributed according to whether you defend the wildlife or the farmers.  We need a balanced approach to the problem and more research.</P>
    <P>The national herd numbers about seven million and it is important, for the sake of the farmers, vets and taxpayers, that we achieve a proper level of spending on this programme and eradicate the disease. A sum of £18 million from the taxpayers and £27 million from the farmers is spent on the eradication progamme so this is not just an issue for farmers.  It is an issue for everybody.  The nation's <Col N="1802" /> wealth depends, to some extent, on upholding our reputation as a producer of healthy food.</P>
    <P>We welcome a reduction in expenditure for any section of the population and the farmers will welcome this, even if it is a relatively small reduction.  I would also welcome any radical initiative to solve this problem which we have had for about 40 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their knowledgeable and positive contributions during an excellent debate.  It is not possible to respond, in the time available, to all the points that were raised.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Sullivan discussed the role of badgers in the transmission of tuberculosis to cattle.  My advice from the senior veterinary people in the Department is that there is more scientific evidence to support the theory that badgers do play a role in transmitting the disease.  It is alleged at times, although not during today's debate, that my Department encourages the slaughter of badgers. That is not the case.  Our badger population is about 0.25 million which would be almost equal to the badger population in Sweden.  In a single year between 1,500 and 1,800 badgers are humanely removed, for <i>post-mortem</i> examination, from land where there has been an identifiable problem with tuberculosis reactors and the source of the disease has not been identified by some other means.  The Department also examines badger road casualties.  It is a serious matter that 15 per cent of the tested badgers carry tuberculosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important point is that the Department and the Minister are vigorously seeking extra funding from Europe for our eradication programme; a sum of £20 million annually over a three to four year period is being sought.  A number of Senators asked how this money would be disbursed.  Obviously, as the Senators pointed out, we must put further resources into research.  At present about £0.5 million is invested in research and, <Col N="1803" /> in view of our disease free status on international markets for beef and other agricultural products, it is extremely important that we vigorously pursue this research.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Senator D'Arcy's suggestion that the Department is carrying out a programme of containment. The Department is carrying out a programme of eradication.  Obviously a great deal more needs to be done and it can be done if more resources become available and that matter is being vigorously pursued by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Our national herd numbers about seven million and the number of tests that will be carried out in the current eradication programme is estimated at about 9.8 million.  It should be stressed that significant progress has been made since 1954 when the eradication process began.  In 1991, for example, there were 4.4 reactors per thousand animals tested and in 1992 that figure had decreased to 3.3 per thousand.  Everybody will welcome that progress.  Less than 3 per cent of herds had reactors.</P>
    <P>The issue of EC funding was raised by Senator Kiely.  We anticipate that these funds will be used to ease the burden of the levy and to increase compensation for reactors.  In relation to the question of the movement of cattle inside the 60 day period, cattle can be moved as often as one likes during that time.  Agriculture shows are considered important meeting places for country and city people.  After recent discussions with the show committee representatives about the validity of attending shows within that time, my advice is that the 60 day rule is acceptable to that group.  However, I will discuss any specific problems in that area later if necessary.</P>
    <P>It is often said that since this programme was introduced in 1954, it has not given a good return to the country. Between £0.5 billion and £1 billion has been spent on the programme since then and the return is seen in our food exports of livestock and livestock products which are worth £2 billion to this country every year.  I was heartened to hear Senators <Col N="1804" /> talk about our reputation in foreign markets for quality food products.  CBF was successful in establishing that quality and, at present, it is similarly promoting other meat products.</P>
    <P>I would not agree with the impression that may have been given by Senator O'Toole that there is something wrong with our red meat.  We have an excellent product.  We are the centre for quality food products in Europe and we do not have serious diseases such as foot and mouth disease which has recently been detected in Italy and the officials of my Department are going to great lengths to ensure it stays out of this country.  We do not have a serious disease problem, a point I believe should be stressed.  Essentially, we have a residual problem with TB.  Being frank, we have not eradicated the problem of tuberculosis among humans.  From time to time that flares up again.</P>
    <P>I once again thank Senators for what I believe has been a very worthwhile debate.  I did not get an opportunity to refer to all the points made but I would be happy to respond to any Senators who want more specific information.</P>

      <P>I am glad to be back in this Chamber for the second day in succession.  I trust we will not be making a habit of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a cause of particular satisfaction to have the opportunity of making a personal <Col N="1805" /> statement on the work of the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The International Fund for Ireland is a unique, all-Ireland organisation established jointly by the Irish and British Governments as a result of the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985.  Article 10 (a) of the agreement states:</P>
    <P>The two Governments shall co-operate to promote the economic and social development of those areas of both parts of Ireland which have suffered most severely from the consequences of the instability of recent years, and shall consider the possibility of securing international support for this work.</P>
    <P>We are all keenly aware of how Northern Ireland has suffered from the Troubles of the past two decades.  We are aware, too, that particular areas have suffered more than others in terms of deprivation, destruction, violence and communal strife.  The Irish and British Governments were convinced that the establishment of an independent fund on a cross-Border and cross-community basis would make a significant contribution to the economic and social regeneration of those areas.  Such a fund would also be an important expression of international support for the common commitment of the two Governments to peace, stability, dialogue and reconciliation in Ireland.  It would also symbolise their common opposition to the exploitation of instability for political ends.</P>
    <P>Under the agreement establishing the International Fund for Ireland, the two Governments recognised that serious under-employment and multiple deprivation created an environment in which instability could flourish.  They saw that instability and conflict in turn created conditions which were inimical to social and economic progress.  They also recognised the damage caused to both parts of Ireland by that instability.</P>
    <P>They, therefore, agreed in September 1986 to establish the International Fund for Ireland to contribute to the work envisaged in Article 10 (a) of the Anglo-Irish <Col N="1806" /> Agreement.  The fund has two objectives: to promote economic and social advantage and to encourage contact, dialogue and reconciliation between Nationalists and Unionists throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>The fund is financed by international contributions.  On the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in November 1985, former US President, Ronald Reagan stated:</P>
    <P>The United States strongly supports this initiative and I will be working closely with Congress in a bipartisan effort to find tangible ways for the United States to lend practical support to this important agreement.</P>
    <P>The result of this commitment has been a United States contribution totalling to date $210 million, including a contribution of $20 million for 1993, making the United States the fund's largest and most significant donor to date.</P>
    <P>Other donors have also been very generous.  The European Community has made contributions since 1989 totalling £60 million and has committed a further £12 million for next year.  Canada has also committed CAN$10 million and New Zealand has contributed NZ$600,000 to date.  I would like to take this opportunity to express the gratitude of the Government, and my own personal gratitude, to the donors for their remarkable generosity.</P>
    <P>The agreement setting up the International Fund states that, in pursuance of its objectives, the fund shall stimulate private investment and enterprise, supplement public programmes and encourage voluntary effort, including self-help schemes.  In the voluntary sphere, special emphasis is placed on supporting economic and social projects sponsored by men and women of good will throughout Ireland who are engaged in the task of communal reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The agreement stipulates that the need to maximise the economic and social benefits of the fund in Ireland shall be an overriding consideration in making disbursements from its resources and these disbursements shall be consistent with <Col N="1807" /> the economic and social policies and priorities of the respective Governments. The agreement also stipulates that, because of the special problems in Northern Ireland associated with the instability of recent years, approximately three-quarters of the resources of the fund shall be spent there.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered by an independent board which consists of a chairman and six other members, who are appointed jointly by the two Governments. The chairman of the board is Mr. William T. McCarter: each of the donors sends observers to attend and participate in all board meetings.  Subject to the terms of the agreement, the members of the board act independently and shall not receive instructions from Governments as to the exercise of their powers.  The board of the fund has a secretariat composed of officials seconded by both Governments.</P>
    <P>The accommodation and secretarial services necessary for the functioning of the fund, together with its general administrative and organisational expenses, are provided jointly by the two Governments. In sum, the International Fund is a genuinely all-Ireland organisation, operating on a cross-Border, cross-community basis.  The agreement also provides that the board be assisted by an advisory committee composed of senior representatives of the two Governments, particularly as regards applications for assistance made to the fund.</P>
    <P>The overriding priority of the fund is to assist the areas of greatest need in Northern Ireland.  These areas have been designated &ldquo;disadvantaged areas&rdquo; and are defined on the basis of objective criteria. In the North, the six Border counties have been designated as the areas which have suffered most severely from the consequences of the instability of recent years.  The fund has so far allocated in excess of 70 per cent of its resources to the most disadvantaged areas and works strenuously to offer its resources in a balanced way to both communities. Since September 1988 the fund has operated a special disadvantaged <Col N="1808" /> areas initiative designed specifically to focus resources on the most needy areas.</P>
    <P>In the South, the fund operates a Border towns and villages scheme to assist those towns and villages most severely affected by their proximity to the Border.  In addition, the fund has put in place a team of locally based development consultants, North and South, who assist local communities to identify and develop suitable projects from disadvantaged areas for consideration by the board.  This has proved a very efficient and effective way of ensuring what the resources and benefits of the fund are made available to the direct benefit of the entire community in the most disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>In the six years since it was founded, the fund has assisted 2,800 projects, of which over 500 were assisted in 1992. These projects have acted as a catalyst, often bringing new economic and commercial activity to areas where there had previously been none.  The much needed jobs provided have brought new hope to those parts of Ireland which have suffered most severely from the communal strife of the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>The fund lays special stress on cross-community and cross-Border projects which make sense at grassroots level.  By creating jobs and helping people to work together in this way, the International Fund is making a major impact on the economic and social landscape and can make a lasting contribution to the historic process of reconciliation on the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that the fund is rigorous in ensuring that it does not discriminate in its disbursement decisions in terms of the political or religious affiliation of applicants.  All recipients of fund support are made aware of the fund's principles of equality of opportunity and non-discrimination.  Each offer of assistance from the fund stipulates that &ldquo;acceptance of a grant or loan under this scheme will be deemed to signify the applicant's acceptance of the principle of equality of opportunity and non-discrimination in employment without regard to religious affiliation and the <Col N="1809" /> applicant will be expected to use the money in accordance with this principle&rdquo;. Should this condition not be met, the fund &ldquo;will require the immediate repayment of the grant or loan in full&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the establishment of the International Fund by the two Governments represented an innovative response to the deep seated and long term problem involved.  It marked a fresh stage in the evolution of the relationship between the two Governments, as we co-operated in establishing the fund under our joint sponsorship and in seeking contributions from our friends overseas who wished to support our joint initiative.</P>
    <P>The fund has the unique authority to distribute moneys in both jurisdictions, North and South.  The fund's emphasis on cross-Border co-operation has also led Government Departments and agencies, North and South, to work closely together for the first time within formal structures for the benefit of the entire island.  In addition, the fund's emphasis on cross-Border involvement has led to both communities in Northern Ireland being encouraged and facilitated in developing their own initiatives and responses to the problems which face them; often on a co-operative North-South basis.  In so doing, communities which have been divided by political and religious barriers are recognising that they share the same problems and can benefit from working together to find solutions.</P>
    <P>The Fund's current operations are organised into a number of broad programmes, delivered jointed by Government Departments and public agencies, North and South, acting as agents of the fund.  It may be helpful to refer briefly in turn to each of these.</P>
    <P>The disadvantaged areas initiative provides a central focus and structure for all International Fund activities by enabling the fund's resources to be targeted on areas of most disadvantage.  As already stated, in excess of 70 per cent of all fund commitments to date have been devoted to these areas.  In the North, the focus of the initative has been the introduction of a number of innovative community-based <Col N="1810" /> regeneration schemes, which seek to act as a catalyst to encourage economic regeneration in areas of particular disadvantage. These initiatives are complemented by a special Border towns and villages scheme in the South.</P>
    <P>The business enterprise programme aims to create the conditions within which local business initiative can be harnessed to develop enterprise, self-employment and job opportunities, in conjunction with Government industrial promotion agencies and local community groups, and provides revolving loan funds and support for workspace accommodation.</P>
    <P>The urban development programme promotes the rehabilitation, revitalisation and development of towns in the North outside Belfast and Derry, and of selected towns in the Border counties in the South, which have suffered from the troubles of the past two decades.</P>
    <P>The tourism programme aims to stimulate increased economic prosperity by encouraging private sector investment in the provision of new tourist amenities, improved marketing and the upgrading of accommodation, with the purpose of increasing the number of tourists visiting both parts of Ireland.  The fund also assists the marketing of Ireland on an all-island basis as a holiday destination. Fund activities under this programme recognise that tourism development plays a central role in promoting economic activity and creating sustainable jobs in both parts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The wider horizons programme encourages contact and reconciliation between nationalists and unionists throughout Ireland by helping young people to travel overseas to obtain further training and work experience not available at home, and by helping managers and young entrepreneurs from both parts of Ireland to participate in development programmes with an international dimension.  The projects are selected to give a mix of participants drawn from North and South and representing the two communities in the North.</P>
    <P>The science and technology programme aims to nurture innovation and <Col N="1811" /> technological change, with a special emphasis on transfer of technology, cross-Border technological partnerships and on support for local technologically based economic development.</P>
    <P>The rural development programme enabled the fund to give greater emphasis to the regeneration of the most disadvantaged rural areas, North and South, by assisting viable community driven projects with a capacity for real economic and social improvement on the ground.</P>
    <P>The entire work programme of the fund has the underlying objective of helping to bring about reconciliation by means of economic and social regeneration. In addition, and to give further emphasis to this objective, the community relations programme supports initiatives and projects, which will improve relations between the communities in the North and also between North and South.</P>
    <P>The agreement also provides that the fund should establish two investment companies, one in each part of Ireland. The function of the companies is to furnish venture capital for the private sector. The board of the fund also acts as the boards of these investment companies.</P>
    <P>The fund also supports a number of flagship projects which will provide particular economic benefit to the areas in which they are located and are also of immense symbolic importance.  The fund has to date assisted three such projects: the £30 million restoration of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal, to which the fund has contributed some £6 million. This project, which is scheduled to be completed in the summer of this year, is the largest single project approved by the fund so far.  It will link the Erne and Shannon waterways and so create one of the largest inland waterway systems in Europe, bringing economic life and activity to the counties of Cavan, Leitrim and Fermanagh and to the towns and villages along the canal; the construction of a visitors' centre and archaeological park at Navan Fort/Eamhain Macha in Armagh &mdash; the capital of the ancient Kings of Ulster; and the economic regeneration <Col N="1812" /> of the towns of Strabane and Lifford. These towns and their hinterland have suffered considerably from their location on either side of the Border.  As part of this project, the Strabane/Lifford Development Commission has been established with the fund's help to promote cross-border economic co-operation and activity.</P>
    <P>In order to promote reconciliation on a practical basis, the fund lays special stress on cross-Community projects and cross-Border co-operation, including projects of an All-Ireland nature.  It has initiated and financed a significant number of cross-Border co-operation initiatives.  Among those are the Acumen cross-Border business development programme, which aims at stimulating economic development on both sides of the Border by fostering stronger ties between business and economic interests North and South, and a joint IBEC/CBI project to promote North-South job creation through the removal of obstacles to increased trade between North and South.</P>
    <P>In the field of marketing, substantial assistance has been given to Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board to co-operate internationally in promoting the whole of Ireland as a tourist destination.  Examples of other joint North-South initiatives supported by the fund are joint marketing of goods, such as wool and linen, and the Derry/ Galway/Boston Ventures, which have staged a trade mission and fair in Boston for the past four years.</P>
    <P>It is relatively easy to quantify the fund's achievements in economic terms, by reference to the number of projects assisted or jobs created.  While these are, of course, in themselves vitally important and impressive, they do not convey the equally important but less easily quantifiable human benefits of the fund's work &mdash; the extent to which people's lives have improved, their outlooks changed, their hearts raised by the prospect of jobs and by the chance to help themselves and their own neighbourhoods and communities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1813" /> One of the most interesting features of the 1992 annual report is the inclusion of a range of letters from groups with which the fund has been working, giving details of the difference which the fund has made in their lives.  The letters come mainly from community groups in areas such as Derry, Coalisland, Armagh, Fermanagh, Louth, South Armagh, Belfast and Donegal.  They make heartening reading. They show how communities which, only a few years ago, were economically and socially depressed and prey to the civil disorder which disadvantage and hopelessness breed, are finding new hope for the future and new pride in themselves. One letter states how, in one town which is experiencing these changes, incidents which would have caused riots several years ago no longer do so, as the young people value the improvements to their town and look to the future with pride. It is details like that which give meaning and context to the bare statistics set out in the report's appendices.  For every project listed there, people's lives have been changed &mdash; and for the better.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise the great importance the Government attaches to the financial support and encouragement provided by the donor countries.  Their generous contributions are a practical expression of their interest in, and concern for, the efforts of the two Governments in bringing about peace in Northern Ireland.  In particular, I would like to mention the support and commitment given by the United States to the work of the fund. During a recent visit there, the Taoiseach took the opportunity of expressing the appreciation of the Government and people for the contribution made by the United States to the fund since its establishment, and of the very generous and significant announcement by President Clinton himself that the Administration will propose an appropriation of $20 million for the fund in its 1994 budget.  In previous years such appropriations have been added to budgets proposed by the Administration through the powerful personal support of Speaker Foley and other friends of Ireland in Congress, <Col N="1814" /> whose support we greatly value and appreciate.</P>
    <P>As is now widely recognised, the fund's fulfilment of the task set out for it by the Irish and British Governments at the time of its establishment is significant; in the number and quality of the projects which have been approved, in the permanent jobs which have been created and in the cost effectiveness of that job creation. The emphasis which the fund has placed on community involvement, on promoting co-operation between a range of governmental and other organisations &mdash; often on a cross-Border basis &mdash; and on acting as a catalyst for private investment offers important lessons for other bodies and agencies seeking to stimulate enterprise development and co-operation throughout the island.  We must also take account of the fund's achievement in helping to restore the confidence and self-esteem of some of the most deprived areas of Northern Ireland, in focusing the great energies of local communities and giving them a renewed sense of pride and purpose.</P>
    <P>I will finish by congratulating and paying special tribute to the chairman and board members, past and present, of the International Fund for Ireland &mdash; as well as the donor countries' observers &mdash; for their dedication and commitment, and for the difference that their outstanding personal contribution is making to the lives of so many people, North and South.  In so many ways, they &mdash; and all those who are working with them &mdash; are a model for what we so earnestly seek in our persistent pursuit of peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Government, I assure the Seanad that we shall continue to give every support and encouragement to the important work of the International Fund and to build on its very impressive achievements to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs here today.  It is appropriate that he should be here in so far as he was directly involved at the time this fund was set up.  He spoke with great pride today about the fund's <Col N="1815" /> achievements.  I am also very happy that Mr. Hamill from the Dublin office and some of his colleagues are here today.</P>
      <P>The International Fund has been a powerful force in rebuilding communities in the Border counties and in Northern Ireland.  The ongoing war since 1969 has devastated the social and economic life of Northern Ireland and, to a lesser extent, of the Southern Border counties. Many in this House are familiar with the physical devastation that has been visited on many main streets in Northern towns, from Strabane and Derry in the west to Newry and Belfast in the east.  Boarded up business premises and fine buildings that have been reduced to rubble are commonplace sights in these towns.</P>
      <P>Many people have forgotten the bombings which took place in Dublin, Monaghan and Castleblayney in the early 1970s.  The human carnage that has resulted from the war is now almost an accepted part of life on the island.  We have occasional outbursts of horror and indignation, as happened after Warrington recently but generally speaking, funerals take place with regular monotony and are accompanied by condemnation which goes unheeded.</P>
      <P>The International Fund for Ireland has done wonderful work in restoring and improving the physical environment but it cannot reverse the 3,000 deaths.  It is clear today that the battle lines are now more visible and exist with greater clarity than has been the case at any time since 1969.  This is a sad reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Illegal opposing forces are highly organised and armed to the teeth.  They have the capacity to greatly expand their activities both in terms of scale and geography.  I wonder if this House is aware that on Thursday last, in broad daylight, a unit of an illegal army took control of the village of Culloville, outside Castleblayney in South Armagh.  A dozen men, armed with heavy artillery, maintained a check point for an hour and a half within range of the unmanned lookout towers in the area.  They were armed with M16s, M60s, AK47s and they had in their possession an RPG7 and a Barrat <Col N="1816" /> 0.5.  I understand they also had a lethal DHSK 12.7 in addition to many small arms.  It was a deadly array of weaponry that was put on display in broad daylight in that village.  I am reliably informed that there was no cross-Border involvement in this episode and I wonder how this illegal checkpoint went unnoticed for so long. They simply finished their business, packed up and went away.  That is what happened.</P>
    <P>It is clear that private armies have the ability to take over any of our towns whenever they choose, but worse than that they have displayed their ability to wreak carnage of huge proportions.  It is also clear that there is a hardening of attitudes in the North at this time. Senator Gordon Wilson and others will testify to that.</P>
    <P>Many people are asking when the war will spill over into the South again. Informed opinion suggests that that is imminent and many people are surprised that it has not happened already.  I hope the Minister for Justice and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, are carrying out a constant review of the situation. In these circumstances, is it wise to run down the size of the Garda?  Statistics bear out that the number of gardaí has dropped by about 1,000 since 1985 and I wonder if this is good policy.  It sends out all sorts of signals as to our attitude, our approach and our insights. Is it in the interest of national security?  I am concerned that there is a dangerous complacency at Government level towards the question of national security at this time.  I urge the Minister to review the situation in the light of falling Garda numbers and the amount of powerful armaments in the hands of paramilitaries. This is a backdrop to the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
    <P>As the Tánaiste said the Fund was set up in 1986 following the Anglo-Irish Agreement and it has done an enormous amount of work to promote economic and social advance in the Border counties, both South and North.  It has also had some success &mdash; although I judge it to be limited &mdash; in encouraging contact, dialogue and reconciliation between <Col N="1817" /> Nationalists and Unionists.  The administration of the fund has obviously changed since 1986 as the board and the people who operate it developed a greater understanding of the dynamics of community action, and particularly how that operates in the North given its problems. This fund, more than any other investment programme, I am aware of, has regenerated that spirit within communities in its area of competence.  In South Armagh, a neighbouring area, a group called ROSA has done outstanding work in community regeneration for more than two years.  This group is totally supported by the fund and it has had enormous success in both the social and economic fields.  Other communities are following their example.</P>
    <P>I mention in passing that the Government might at this stage examine how the fund is operated, how money is delivered to projects and the emphasis in the various programmes.  This would be timely as the Government is considering setting up the county enterprise partnership boards.  The emphasis they have is wrong and the experience the International Fund and those of us who work closely with it have gained would suggest that that is the case.</P>
    <P>Setting up another layer of Government and bureaucracy is the wrong thing to do at this stage.  My experience, and the experience of people working with the fund at local level, suggests that communities are now very definitely coming round to the idea that they must act for themselves and this is something of which the International Fund can be proud. Communities, through their activities with the International Fund have come to that conclusion.  For a number of years communities in my own county and right across the North have been trying to find ways of regenerating social and economic activities in their area.  That should be the basis for the programme the Government is now preparing on job creation.</P>
    <P>The Government should insist on a partnership between local authorities and local communities which is currently lacking.  The legislation governing the operation of local authorities gives scope <Col N="1818" /> for that partnership.  Local authorities can establish partnerships with local community groups on a statutory basis.  This is not happening as much as I would like. The Government should endeavour to foster this kind of activity as it offers the best prospect for development at local level.  It would substitute for the lack of proper local government in Ireland.  This arises from the lack of input by the public because the local authority structures do not satisfy any of the criteria that are fundamental to local government.</P>
    <P>People are showing that they have ideas and the ability to raise matching funds, or part matching funds in local areas.  They need support and encouragement from Government agencies &mdash; which does not seem to be forthcoming by the provision of professional help in the form of full-time workers.  However it is forthcoming from the International Fund because its community development programmes are based in the community. In view of the fact that community groups are responding, and in view of this the Government should reconsider its approach to the job creation.  It should abandon the establishment of the county enterprise board, go direct to communities and ask local authorities to become partners in that effort.</P>
    <P>Scanning through the 1991 annual report of the International Fund is an interesting exercise.  The Tánaiste has removed the 1992 report from the Library for his own deliberations.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste is a good friend and I have no intention of accusing him of theft; it would be inappropriate. However, I hope he does steal some of the ideas on these pages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1991 more than £4 million was expended on the community regenerating improvement programmes compared with just over £1 million in the <Col N="1819" /> previous year.  Obviously the International Fund has decided to allocate funds in a different way as it learned from its activities over the previous four years. Community regeneration and improvement across the North of Ireland has received enormous amounts of funding as anybody driving through the North of Ireland can see.  The signs there, noticeably in the towns.  The main streets are beginning to look better.  Many of the old buildings that were bombed and in a decrepit state are being replaced by fine facades.  The business people are responding by renovating their premises. The atmosphere in the North has changed as a result of the application of this fund.</P>
    <P>Appendix 4 which deals with the business enterprise fund, shows that the International Fund is providing venture capital at low interest rates.  One of the difficulties we encounter is that individuals and community groups have ideas but they cannot get the finance to implement them.  This is an ongoing problem that cannot be solved without venture capital at low interest rates.</P>
    <P>That is the position under the International Fund.  People are willing to borrow from that source through the county enterprise boards rather than the banks.  I have no experience of the North but the county enterprise boards in the South lend money at low interest rates. One of the deciding factors for people borrowing this money is the lower interest rates.</P>
    <P>Many people are wary of the banking system, particularly if they have not had any dealings with the bank and when they are unsure about the future as is the case for many people living in the Border areas.</P>
    <P>Funds are being disbursed, and people who up to now would not have been able to set up enterprises are succeeding because of the support from the business enterprise section of the International Fund.  Under the work space programme a person can avail of funding to acquire a business premises.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1820" /> Appendix 5 deals with investment in tourism.  The programme covers projects in the North and South.  I have been critical of this programme from time to time, particularly the tourism base in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  It is a weak base with the lowest revenue from tourism in the Republic.  I have suggested that the International Fund should have a special programme to develop tourism in Cavan-Monaghan.  Bord Fáilte operates the programme in the South.  The board decided that only registered tourist operators, whether they be hotels or guesthouses, can avail of money from the fund.  It is a substantial amount for the hotels and guesthouses in Monaghan and Cavan and they benefit significantly. However, people who have been working with me to develop projects, such as taking old buildings and renewing them while at the same time providing accommodation, could not get this support. They could not register until their accommodation reached the required standard and as they did not have the money to do this, they did not proceed.</P>
    <P>We need more accommodation and amenities in Counties Monaghan and Cavan and the fund did not respond to local difficulties in these counties.  I say that in the hope that Mr. Hamill and his colleagues will hear me and perhaps we can review and change the way the fund is operating.  There are difficulties in that if work is done for one area then every other area hankers after the same thing. However the local needs in Counties Monaghan and Cavan are not evident to those living in County Donegal or elsewhere. Huge investment has gone into County Donegal from the IFI and from other funds because it is a good area to invest in.  I am not satisfied that we in Counties Monaghan and Cavan are getting enough investment from any fund for developments in tourism etc. and I will continue to say that.</P>
    <P>However, the fund has done an enormous amount of good.  Anybody visiting the hotels of Counties Monaghan and Cavan now and who remembers their condition and facilities six years ago can appreciate the amount of work the fund <Col N="1821" /> has made possible.  I congratulate the people involved.  All hotels and many guesthouses now offer a better standard of accommodation.  They have broadened their spheres of activity enormously thanks to the International Fund for Ireland.  They could not have done so otherwise.  We have to congratulate all of those who carried out the investment and the International Fund for Ireland who supported it.</P>
    <P>There is evidence all over Counties Monaghan and Cavan of the success of the Amenities Development Scheme. Although I would like to see more achieved the International Fund for Ireland supported every suitable project put forward.  If there is a shortage of investment in that area &mdash; my own constituency &mdash; it is not the fault of International Fund for Ireland.  The problem is that there are not enough suitable projects being put forward for funding.</P>
    <P>The fund has done an enormous amount to assist farmers who want to chance the type of enterprise they are engaged in and to generate new income from new sources.  Deer farms and stud farms have been set up with assistance from the fund.  The fund was the catalyst for that kind of development.</P>
    <P>When one drives through the towns of Counties Monaghan and Cavan one can see that they look extremely well, particularly the main streets and squares, thanks to a joint programme operated between the International Fund for Ireland and the local authorities.  I have one problem in relation to this.  Some years ago a programme for urban development was announced with a fund of £3 million available to local entrepreneurs and business people.  However the funding never surfaced.  I would like to find out why from Mr. Hamill.  Perhaps development plans were not put forward or there was a change of mind.  When the fund was announced I received a press release which I may still have proving that the fund was actually announced. However no funding was drawn down.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention towns in the Border counties like Clones, Castleblayney and Monaghan and talk about <Col N="1822" /> Clones which has suffered enormously due to Border security measures and Border trading problems related to Government policy.  The Government in the South has never acknowledged the town's problems.  About two thirds of the Clones hinterland is in the North of Ireland and people find it difficult to get from that area to the town as most of the roads are closed.  The security operation which the British Government feels it must carry out is killing Clones.  I have talked about this matter <i>ad nauseum</i> in the other House and I want to continue talking about it here.  The security measures in operation should be changed or, if that cannot be done, resources must be committed in order to make up the loss to the town.</P>
    <P>The International Fund for Ireland is aware of what is happening in Clones and has examined the matter.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey who is from County Meath has attended Ulster GAA finals in Clones &mdash; epic occasions to which many people travel. On Ulster final day it is difficult to see anything but the football match but I am sure he would have seen the deterioration in the physical face of Clones over the years.  He should inform the Government that Clones is a special case.  Government has not responded to the special needs of that town.</P>
    <P>Community groups in Clones have been trying to put their town back together.  At this stage some moneys will begin to flow from the various funds into Clones as a number of projects are now ready.  Moneys from the International Fund for Ireland, Interreg Funding and structural funding will be available but may not be enough.  It will be impossible to get the business life of the town back into shape while the access roads remain closed.  I do not wish to discuss the philosophy behind that but while the security operation which is in place at present continues Clones will continue to die. The two Governments could easily decide to change that security operation. The roads could be opened to save the life of Clones town.  That would mean a commitment of extra funding by the <Col N="1823" /> British and Irish Governments in order to maintain the present level of security but by different means.  That must be done.</P>
    <P>It is time we recognised the effect of official policy on Clones and, to a lesser extent on Monaghan town and Castleblayney, which are just three or four miles from the Border.  It is time the Government fulfilled its duty.  On many occasions Ministers visited Clones, saw Border roads closed, became aware of the problems and promised to make further representations to the British Government and authorities about reopening some of the roads.  The people of Clones were delighted until they found these promises were hollow gestures and nothing happened.  I ask the Minister to inform the Tánaiste that we want action in Clones, not more hollow words and promises.  Promises are no longer sufficient. The roads must be reopened to save the life of the town of Clones.  The British and Irish Governments should give a commitment that additional funding will be provided to put in place security operations which will have the same effect as existing ones but which will use different methods.  The people of Clones deserve that.  Once it is recognised that a town is being killed, remedial action should be taken.  I want this House and those responsible for policy making to recognise this fact and to act upon it.</P>
    <P>The success of the Urban Development Programme is visible all over the place.  When one looks at Appendix 6 of the 1992 annual report of the International Fund for Ireland, it is incredible to see the number of projects that have been funded throughout Northern Ireland.  It is essential that this funding and investment is continued.  The Urban Development Programme in the South is on a smaller scale.  I hope the fund will be able to extend its operations beyond the local authority aspect to the private sector.  To refer again to the three towns I mentioned, particularly Castleblayney and Clones, the private sector there is hardly able to provide the paint at present to paint the front of a shop, never mind <Col N="1824" /> to take down the plastic signs and modernise and beautify the street scape.  I hope the programme that was announced a few years ago is still in place and that we can draw down funds from it.</P>
    <P>There is a programme for agriculture and fisheries.  The agricultural element of the programme in particular, has been very beneficial to the southern counties. In the North, there is a huge number of projects under that heading in Appendix 7.  There are also details in this appendix of science and technology and other innovative projects.  The Wider Horizons Programme which tries to give young people an overview of the way things operate in other parts of the world, is extensively funded and is doing much to help young people.</P>
    <P>I commend the board of the International Fund for Ireland and all the people who operate that fund down to local level.  Without them the attitudes of people in communities in the North of Ireland would be very different today. The physical environment would be much worse if the IFI did not exist.  I conclude in the hope that some of the things I have said today may change peoples' thinking and change State policy a little to further improve the life of communities on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste, who was with us for the earlier part of this debate and who is succeeded by the Government Chief Whip, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dempsey.  It is somewhat fortuitous that Deputy Dempsey has taken his place in the Chamber as I rise to speak as there are a number of issues which he and I have already discussed in the context of the IFI and development in the Border counties, which I hope to develop a little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little disappointed that Senator Cotter has stolen some of my thunder.  I intended to stand up and start banging the table about the dearth of money being spent in County Leitrim.  I had to quickly revise my contribution when I glanced through the most recent report to which Senator Cotter referred and perhaps has <Col N="1825" /> not had a chance to go through, which shows that not one pound has been spent in Clones under any heading, most of which are community oriented.  Upwards of £500,000 has been spent on development in County Leitrim.  Well over half of that has been on community oriented or community generated businesses. Maybe Senator Cotter could go back to Clones and act as a catalyst to encourage Mr. Hamill to whom he seems to have given a great number of lists.  I am afraid to talk to Mr. Hamill after all the lists Senator Cotter has given him.  I take Senator Cotter's point.  Both he and I and others from the Border counties would agree that the Southern perception of the fund's operation is that we are losing out in the economics sphere.</P>
    <P>However, it would be churlish not to welcome the significant contribution made by the IFI since its inception.  It would also be inaccurate not to state that controversy has also followed the fund's disbursement.  One thinks of the infamous Strabane bank episode.  However, the Tánaiste stated, the operation of the fund has been, in the main, even-handed between communities in the North and, thankfully, no such criteria are necessary in the south.  I am aware that the originators of the fund were anxious from the start to regenerate the Northern towns and villages ravaged by the economic war strategy of the IRA.</P>
    <P>Yet, despite the worthy nature of such aspirations, there is a perception, as I said earlier, that the fund has benefitted areas of Northern Ireland, which, prior to the commencement of the troubles and subsequent to them, operated at an economic advantage to their Southern neighbours.  This is particularly true, I would suggest, of Counties Leitrim and Cavan, parts of south Donegal and, interestingly enough, that corridor of north Monaghan of which Clones is part and to which Senator Cotter so passionately referred in his contribution.  This area of Monaghan has been, without question, devastated by partition, which cut it off from its natural hinterland by the closure of the railway link to Belfast and by the constant and continuing economic <Col N="1826" /> decline.  Indeed Clones, areas of Leitrim and others I have mentioned are but a microcosm of what has happened right across the entire frontier between North and South on the southern side.</P>
    <P>I know that the balance of funding in favour of the North has been operated on a ratio of roughly three to one.  This was the way in which the donor countries wished it to operate.  Consequently Southern administrators have had to operate under a handicap.  I believe the time has come to give serious consideration to re-orienting the funds to those communities south of the Border which have the idealism and creative energy to which Senator Cotter referred but which lack the venture capital, the actual money required to be able to put these qualities to advantage.  One area which has been a source of great angst and annoyance to me as a Southerner living in a Border county is the operation of the Urban Development Programme which is operated almost exclusively in the Northern communities on the basis that the North has been ravaged by the economic war carried out by the IRA. May I point out one example and put it in context?</P>
    <P>The town and district of Enniskillen would not only be one of the nearest neighbours to Leitrim but is one of its main trading competitors in the context of Cavan town, Sligo to the west and Longford to the south.  Enniskillen is a strong economic entity.  It has in the main on the economic side &mdash; I emphasise economic &mdash; escaped the bombing and annihilation visited on other towns and villages in the North.  I am fully conscious of the horrific murders carried out at the war monument there, and to which we bear evidence in this House with the membership of Senator Wilson.</P>
    <P>The town of Enniskillen received in excess of several hundred thousand pounds for urban renewal.  I believe that this widened the gap between Fermanagh and Leitrim as Fermanagh would be perceived in the economic lexicon of the United Kingdom as being in one of the <Col N="1827" /> most disadvantaged areas in the United Kingdom.  I have singled Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan out because they suffered most from 1922 onwards.</P>
    <P>When one compares the economic realities of life in the Fermanagh-South Armagh area with the Leitrim, Cavan-Monaghan area, it is very easy to see who is winning.  That is why there is a real need to reorient the fund even if it means going to the donor countries and suggesting to them that if there is to be an eventual economic parity between these two peripheral regions then the counties south of the Border need a greater share of aid.</P>
    <P>Under the urban renewal scheme £15.5 million is currently being offered by the IFI to 400 projects.  Additional private sector investment is expected to generate another £41 million which will result in a projected 3,000 new jobs.  The sum of £14 million goes to the most disadvantaged towns and villages.  I am speaking about villages such as Garrison and Beleek in Fermanagh and this will generate £38 million in private investment creating 2,600 jobs.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the difference between the aspirations contained in those figures and the reality to date, the IFI in its report states that 300 projects under the urban renewal scheme totalling £8 million of IFI money have so far generated £23 million of private sector investment, resulting in 1,900 jobs.  I am sure Senator Cotter and my friend and colleague, Senator Reynolds, know that if even a quarter of those jobs were created in County Leitrim or in parts of west Cavan the resulting economic uplift would be a real cause for celebration.  I do not begrudge this investment in the North, I am merely attempting to establish a case for the reorientation of IFI criteria as they have operated since the inception of the fund in 1986.</P>
    <P>I welcome many innovations in the fund especially those initiated in recent years.  I also welcome the disadvantaged areas initiative.  The chairman points out that through this disadvantaged area initiative the IFI has approved a <Col N="1828" /> further 13 community based development schemes covering many of the disadvantaged areas in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the southern Border counties IFI introduced a regeneration initiative to devote special fund assistance to the towns and villages most significantly affected by the instability of recent years and related factors.  I am bemused by the terminology used by the chairman in referring to the instability of recent years. Senator Cotter has given the background to what we are discussing here.  The economic decline of the Border counties is not a recent phenomenon.  It started with partition in 1922 and continued through the difficult economic period in the 1930s and 1940s.</P>
    <P>Senator Cotter is right &mdash; successive administrations in this country literally wrote off many of the Border counties. One has only to look at the hoary old chestnut &mdash; the roads system to realise this, that is if it is possible to take a road between the North and South.</P>
    <P>It is not posible to drive directly from County Leitrim to County Fermanagh because the roads are not open.  We are constantly told, despite the best efforts of the Tánaiste and his predecessors at the Anglo Irish Conference, that, due to &ldquo;security considerations&rdquo;, the people of those two counties must drive outside the county before they can travel between the North and South.  That certainly belies the pious and noble aspirations of the IFI and of its donors.  The Tánaiste referred to those aspirations as follows: &ldquo;That the objectives of the fund are to encourage contact, dialogue and reconciliation between Nationalists and Unionists throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>Those living in Counties Leitrim or Fermanagh will not see much cross-Border co-operation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Border towns and villages scheme.  It is one of the initiatives introduced by the IFI in the last couple of years.  The Taoiseach launched the first of these pilot schemes in Carlingford, County Louth, and a number of the Border counties are now benefiting from it.  In County Leitrim the Kiltyclogher community council received £97,250 last <Col N="1829" /> year and the North Leitrim Glens Development Company in Manorhamilton received £6,000.  Other counties, including Cavan, Donegal, Louth and Monaghan also benefited to some degree from the scheme and it should be expanded.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with Senator Cotter that villages along the Border, especially in Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan are dying through lack of economic regeneration. Despite the best efforts of politicians on all sides of the House we have been unable to persuade either the current or previous administrations to extend the urban renewal scheme to some of our larger towns.</P>
    <P>The IFI failed to respond positively to an idea which would have had positive, beneficial effects on some of our towns and villages.  I am not suggesting it for all our towns.  Senator Reynolds will agree that Carrick-on-Shannon should have been included in the urban renewal scheme, although I acknowledge and recognise that substantial sums of IFI funding have gone into urban enhancement in that area.  The Border towns and villages scheme is the way forward as far as the southern side of the Border &mdash; to which I refer exclusively &mdash; is concerned.</P>
    <P>The northern beneficiaries in another area is a source of some concern.  Some 70 per cent of the funds allocated to the CRISP scheme, which is for the regeneration of towns and villages in the North, goes to suitable areas north of the Border.  The special projects funding is confined to the Lifford/Strabane area in the South.  I welcome the recent opening of an office which has been co-funded and co-sponsored by the IFI and Lifford, Strabane and Coleraine local authorities. This was alluded to earlier &mdash; there is a role for local authorities along the Border to come together and to use their expertise to achieve more funding.</P>
    <P>I urge closer co-operation between southern and northern local authorities but this is not as simple as it seems, particularly in the run-up to local elections in the North where no self-respecting Unionist would be seen talking to any self-respecting Nationalist until after 19 <Col N="1830" /> May.  My impression, having been a member of Leitrim County Council since 1991, and having listened to my more experienced colleagues, is that while there seems to be a willingness on the part of the elected representatives on Fermanagh District Council to develop closer links with their southern counterparts, there is a suggestion that the permanent Government and the civil servants operating the local authority might not be as enthusiastic.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Tánaiste, as Joint Chairman of the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in meetings with his counterpart Mr. Mayhew, might bring up this question of closer co-operation between northern and southern local authorities.  A nudge in the right direction from the Northern Secretary to the local authorities under his control, especially in the Border counties, might open up a whole new area of development and co-operation which would benefit both sides of the Border. After all we are talking about people's lives and their material well-being.  This has nothing to do with ideology; in the South we sometimes stand back in amazement at how Northern politicians of a particular hue seem to inject ideology into every aspect of cross-Border co-operation. Perhaps it sounds good in an election manifesto but the reality is that even their people are suffering as a result of this lack of co-operation, perhaps their people should be told this more often.</P>
    <P>The Border towns and villages scheme should be extended.  While I welcome the injection of funding for Kiltyclogher, there are smaller villages and communities such as Rossinver and Kinlough coming up through the middle of the county into Drumkeerin, Dromahair and Drumshanbo, which are not included despite being within ten or 15 miles of the Border.  The scheme should be extended because if similar towns and communities were within ten or 15 miles of the Border on the northern side they would have no difficulty in receiving IFI funding.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey left the House because he has responsibility for the Office of Public Works.  I welcome his colleague <Col N="1831" /> the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, to the Chamber.</P>
    <P>Any Leitrim-based public representatives would be in dereliction of their duty if they did not welcome the £30 million which is currently being expended on the development of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  As the Tánaiste pointed out, £6 million of the £30 million has been contributed by the International Fund for Ireland.  We can bandy figures around the House but £30 million is monopoly money in any language.  It is the single biggest investment in the south Leitrim-west Cavan area since the foundation of the State.  The creative energy released as a result of this innovation can be seen in the small communities close to the canal.  In my own area on the Leitrim side, in places such as Keshcarrigan and Leitrim town itself, there is a whole new spirit of optimism.  Local community groups have come together and are spending a great deal of time and financial resources to identify tourism projects for development.  Old buildings which had been derelict, or in some cases closed down, have been bought, refurbished and reopened.  In the Keshcarrigan area I noticed recently that a planning application had been made for an extension to a public house which was taken over a short time ago by a couple moving into the area.  All these developments are welcome and are regenerating areas which were in serious economic decline and whose population was falling.</P>
    <P>It should be put on record that all this happened as a result of the innovation and the individual concept developed by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey.  He saw it not only as something that would help to regenerate that part of the country but as a flagship project that would cement the relationship between North and South.  It was to the credit of the British Administration that they too saw it in a similar light.  I hope at the official opening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal which, as the Tánaiste said, will be within the next 12 to 18 months, pride of place will be given to Mr. Haughey.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will be told that there is serious concern in my area of Drumshanbo and the catchment area served by the Lough Allen basin in regard to the parallel development of the Lough Allen Canal.  While the reopening of the canal is going ahead at full speed, and the Office of Public Works is to be thanked for its efficiency, people are concerned that the necessary ancillary facilities will not be developed.  These facilities include access roads, walkways, toilet facilities, marinas and the sort of onshore facilities that boating enthusiasts take for granted on more developed areas of the Shannon.  I am sure the Leas-Chathaoirleach will be familiar with these amenities as he comes from South Roscommon. People except these facilities to assist them in enjoying their holiday.  There is a real concern that lack of funding may inhibit the Lough Allen Canal from being developed to its full potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For Members who may not be familiar with the geography of the area, I am talking about a situation where Leitrim town will act as a junction and the first point on the Leitrim side of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal before you enter into the Shannon waterway.  Reaching Leitrim town the boating enthusiast has two choices, either turning left down the Shannon to Killaloe or turning right to the reopened Lough Allen Canal which leads to Lough Allen, the first lake on the Shannon, which is seven miles long and three miles wide.  Communities along the Lough Allen basin are already anticipating an increase in tourist numbers through cruiser traffic.  However, all the good work now in the preparatory stage will come to nought unless basic <Col N="1833" /> facilities are developed.  I am hopeful that the International Fund for Ireland will do for the Louth Allen Canal what it did for the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal, albeit on a small scale.  I have discussed this matter with the Ministry of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Dempsey.  The Office of Public Works, which is currently receiving its funding under the INTERREG initiative for the reopening of the Lough Allen Canal, and the Government should approach the IFI for funding for the development of the Lough Allen Canal.</P>
    <P>I compliment the operators of the IFI Fund.  It must be a difficult and perhaps a thankless job in some circumstances, to figure out exactly how a limited amount of money will be spent.  It is instructive that the letters of appreciation, referred to by the Tánaiste, which are included in the annual report, are almost exclusively from north of the Border.  There is only one letter from the South and, coincidentally, it comes from a community group in Carrick-on-Shannon who wrote to the IFI welcoming the development of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  All the other letters of commendation in the context of enterprise centres, job creation projects, community initiatives, small Border and small villages initiatives, come from the North.</P>
    <P>I hope that this initiative will continue. I am delighted that President Clinton has agreed to provide an extra £20 million and I hope other donor countries will follow his lead.  I also hope that local communities in Border counties will take matters into their own hands in the way some of the communities in the North and South have done.  A more broadly based application of the scheme is needed in the South.  I do not blame the IFI for not allocating more money to the southern Border counties.  There is a responsible role to be played by community groups.</P>
    <P>We all agree that Clones is a special case.  I am sure it has community groups, yet not one penny of IFI funding has appeared for Clones in this report, maybe it received it in previous years.  It is probable that there is a vacuum there which could be filled by community groups <Col N="1834" /> coming together.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the IFI could be used as a catalyst for closer co-operation between community groups in the North and the South.  There may be an obstacle to closer co-operation between local authorities but I do not believe there would be similar inhibitions between communities in the North and South.  We are always twinning with interesting and exotic towns and cities across Europe, yet very few of the Border counties have considered twinning with their counterparts in the North.  This might be a way forward and the noble aspirations of the IFI and its innovators when they talked about encouraging contact, dialogue and reconciliation between Nationalists and Unionists might be realised.  Perhaps the IFI board might go beyond funding as a response to local initiatives and act as a catalyst.</P>
    <P>Other bodies are working for North-South dialogue and co-operation but they are mainly bodies which rely on organisations like the IFI for funding.  The IFI has a substantive funding base and enormous credibility, even among the most extreme Unionists in the North who looked on it with the greatest suspicion and resentment when it started but who are now, I understand, in the main using the fund for what it was intended, without any ideological baggage.  Perhaps the IFI in the reorientation of the implementation of some aspects of its funding will also look at its ideological base.  It could see its role in the future as bringing together the communities which it helped to get off the ground and to regenerate. It could ask the communities, North and South, which it has funded, to exchange views.  People would get to know each other, which might ultimately lead to peace with justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot hope to emulate the sovereign command of local detail of previous speakers, so my remarks will be general and brief.  I brought an unformed mind to bear on the question of the role of the International Fund for Ireland when I began doing homework for my speech.  It acquired a somewhat unfortunate public image in its <Col N="1835" /> early years and I took particular pains, therefore, to inquire from the organisations in Cork and more widely with those who had contact with it, about their impressions.</P>
      <P>In the case of Cork the two main recipients of its support belong to very different areas.  The Micro-Electronics Research Centre, which is internationally renowned, is engaged in silicon wafer research with Queen's University, Belfast with a view to developing production in west Belfast.  The organisation does excellent work bringing families on both sides of the community in the North to Cork on a regular basis.  The people involved in those activities have a definite independence of mind although from time to time they have had strained relations with the IFI.  I am glad that they are unstinting in their praise of the contribution the fund is making, not least Mr. Hanlon's personal contribution.  It is nice to be able to give praise where praise is patently due.  I join Senators Cotter and Mooney in welcoming the role of the fund which is obviously doing good work now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one or two queries arising from the Tánaiste's contribution.  He said: &ldquo;The funds emphasis on cross-Border co-operation has also led Government Departments and agencies, North and South, to work closely together for the first time within formal structures for the benefit of the entire island.&rdquo;  My immediate reaction was that any scheme which succeeded in getting Departments, even in a single jurisdiction, to work co-operatively was making a significant contribution to the quality of our decision making.  I am glad that it does so because in many respects such pioneering activities can be emulated in other areas. Tánaiste said that the experience of the IFI offers important lessons for other bodies and agencies seeking to stimulate enterprise development and co-operation throughout Ireland.  Are mechanisms currently in place to enable the value of those lessons to be diffused among the other organisations and schemes which are engaged in potentially <Col N="1836" /> parallel work?  I do not mean work with specific reference to North-South relations.  The area orientation of the IFI is an important pioneering approach in the context of the work of our public agencies.  The last tranche of Structural Funds was expended far too much on a sectoral basis and far too little on an area basis.  I hope that will not be repeated this time but it is extremely difficult to devise and implement effective area schemes, conceptually and administratively.</P>
    <P>If the IFI is nearly as successful as its annual report suggests &mdash; and I do not think we expect any scheme to be as successful as the company's annual report suggests &mdash; then lessons can certainly be learned by those other organisations.  I hope concrete steps are being taken, not only to learn from the IFI &mdash; which has gone through its own learning process &mdash; but also to diffuse the lessons of that experience.  It is similar to technology transfer in the intellectual and planning rather than in the specific technology area and is much more difficult.  Technology transfer is a relatively simple operation compared with the transfer of ideas, techniques, institutions and institutional types.</P>
    <P>I hope we are looking on the IFI as a source of ideas and as a reservoir of thinking gleaned from hard experience of area programmes to vitalise the massively deprived areas within our own jurisdiction under other fund headings.  I hope that we will take those lessons on board.  Listening to the Tánaiste's speech and reading the annual report impresses on one that while deprivation in areas of the North is obviously greatly exacerbated by the sectarian conflict, there are areas in the South which, without sectarian conflict, have levels of deprivation rivalling all but the worst areas in the North.  We have been singularly unsuccessful in coping with that degree of deprivation and distress.  I ask the Tánaiste if the appropriate authorities here are explicitly drawing on the experience of the IFI for development over a much wider range of areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the views expressed by Senators Cotter and Mooney.  They said much of what I had intended to say.  They are familiar with how the funds are applied, because they also live in counties near the Border. Senator Mooney referred to the village of Kinlough, County Leitrim, not often mentioned in the hallowed Houses, but where I was born and raised.  All the children with whom I went to school have had to leave to get jobs.  That shows the real importance of the IFI in keeping Border villages like Kinlough alive.</P>
      <P>I live in Castleblayney, County Monaghan, very near troubled areas.  Hotels have been bombed in Belleek and Fermanagh. All along the Border we suffer many disadvantages and indeed people may not be fully aware of the need for such a fund which is crucial to the survival of the Border counties, not only in terms of economics and trade but in terms of the social development of the area.  It gives people an opportunity to remain in the villages in which they were born.</P>
      <P>Senator Lee discussed the application and organisation of the fund.  It is most comprehensive, it applies to all spheres of life on our island.  It has operated effectively, efficiently and fairly.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the fund are twofold, it is applied in the economic and social sphere and also promotes dialogue and reconciliation between North and South.</P>
      <P>The total funding up to 1991, the latest figures I have, is £164 million sterling. That money is desperately needed in those areas.  Senator Mooney referred earlier to the disparity in the division of money between North and South.  That is because the Six Counties are classified as severely disadvantaged.  I agree with that classification because those areas bore the brunt of the troubles in the North.  I share his hope that more money will be disbursed to community groups and projects south of the Border where it is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fund has been applied to 2,800 projects.  It has plenty of scope and is applied in many fields.  My introduction to the fund was in relation to a hotel in Castleblayney which applied successfully <Col N="1838" /> for funds.  The fund disburses money to projects which will create employment. It does not just help to provide a leisure centre for a hotel.  The fund stipulates that a beneficiary must employ a certain number of people and keep them for a ten year period.  It caters for the needs of an area in more ways than one.</P>
    <P>From a practical point of view, the standard of hotels along the Border has increased dramatically as a direct result of the application of funds to those projects. Areas like Castleblayney can now attract tourists and offer them all the facilities they deserve in an area which would not otherwise offer many attractions.</P>
    <P>The Fund has also been applied to the Wider Horizons programme.  That involves the National Rehabilitation Board in the Republic forging links with equivalent organisations in the North. Young people from Protestant and Catholic communities who suffer a physcial or mental handicap are brought together, perhaps for the first time, and given the opportunity to travel abroad and see matters from a common vantage point.  The work in that social sphere has been largely unrecognised.  The Fund is normally seen as being applied purely to business but it is of crucial importance to voluntary groups.  I spoke to a group last week that had returned from a visit to Denmark. They had shared many experiences which would not otherwise have been possible.</P>
    <P>The community regeneration and improvement special scheme has given money to the town of Keady.  That village was devastated by troubles but it has now been completely revitalised and revamped. It is developing its commerce and has new shop fronts.  Its community centre offers advice and other services. The village of Beleek also received money for that purpose as has Blacklion, County Cavan, in my constituency.</P>
    <P>Like other villages Blacklion has suffered not only from the troubles in the North but from the major problem of rural degeneration.  The money should be used not only to focus on the larger business towns in a Border area but to redevelop those towns and villages which <Col N="1839" /> are suffering as a result of the recession and the troubles in the North.  The fund should positively discriminate in that area and give more money to the small villages to enable them to create employment.</P>
    <P>The tourism accommodation scheme is very important in providing employment. It helps a labour intensive industry and introduces the required standards to attract people to what might not normally be considered tourist areas along the Border.  The Urban Development Programme was referred to earlier.  I will not dwell on it but it is worthwhile.</P>
    <P>In the area of agriculture, the Fund helped to foster the mushroom industry in Fermanagh in the North and in Monaghan in the South.  That has allowed small farmers to diversify their interests and to keep afloat.  That is another way to keep people in their community and I welcome the application of the Fund in that regard.</P>
    <P>The rural action project has helped farmers to develop alternative enterprises such as deer farming.  These enterprises are significant because they keep the population in areas which otherwise would become ghost towns unable to support their population.  I would hate that to happen.  Those areas suffer enough disadvantage due to their location.</P>
    <P>The fund has been applied in the areas of science and technology.  I know of an engineering works in Clontibret, County Monaghan, that has received direct funding from the IFI.  As a result the factory is in a better position to expand and purchase new machinery to maintain its competitiveness in tough industry.</P>
    <P>The improvement of community relations is the second objective of the fund.  Co-operation North has been funded directly by the IFI, as has the Wider Horizon Programme.  These programmes foster the integration of both communities which is not easily achieved in the North because of <i>apartheid</i> in housing and segregation in schools.  Such programmes break down the barriers and fears that exist between communities who are separated from each other.  I <Col N="1840" /> welcome the fund's application in those areas.</P>
    <P>The Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal is one of the highlights of the fund's achievements.  I do not agree with according Charles Haughey all the credit for the project; one would think that he had gone out with a spade and dug the canal himself.  However, it is a welcome development.  The spin-offs from such a project &mdash; it is not simply the installation of a canal &mdash; are remarkable.  One need only look at how the development of the Shannon has benefited surrounding areas to realise the potential benefit to Ballyconnell and Ballinamore, County Leitrim which will be in a position to take advantage of those benefits when the canal is opened next year.  The spin-off developments will be more than welcome.</P>
    <P>Senator Cotter echoed my point with regard to the closure of Border roads, a problem I raised previously in this House and at our party conference.  It has left Clones like a ghost town and I endorse what the Senator said in that regard.  The fund is available to all applicants and local community groups should be assisted when drawing up their applications. There are many well-meaning people in Clones, for example, who are aware of the problems in their area but do not know how to seek funding to help solve them.  Perhaps the fund could develop an information system that will make it easier for such people to apply for funding.  The fund should be made more accessible in that regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome other areas of investment by the fund.  Patrick Kavanagh's birthplace at Inniskeen, County Monaghan, for example, received £1.2 million which was used to set up a heritage centre with a restaurant, tea-shop and the usual ancillary installations for such a centre.  Inniskeen is a Border village that was badly hit by the effects of the Border security operation and by rural degeneration.  The heritage centre has enabled the village to attract people from all over the world who have an interest in the works of Patrick Kavanagh.  I welcome that development.  It is such projects which, at <Col N="1841" /> little cost comparatively speaking, have enabled small villages and communities to stay alive.  In that regard, I welcome the work of the International Fund for Ireland and wish it every success in the future.</P>

      <P>Senator Gallagher spoke about Kinlough and I know the area well although not as well as she does.

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;money should also be available to Kinlough.  I fully support the Senator on that issue.</P>
      <P>The International Fund for Ireland has been a worthwhile project.  It has been, essentially, a fund to help the economic development of Border regions.  When I was first involved in politics at a local level in 1985, my party in Leitrim County Council introduced a motion to congratulate the Government on the Anglo-Irish Agreement and, unfortunately, we were the only county in the country to vote against it.  It is peculiar now to hear my Fianna Fáil colleagues from Leitrim who voted against the Anglo-Irish Agreement, suggest that the International Fund for Ireland does not spent enough money although without the Anglo-Irish Agreement, there would be no International Fund for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What would the Border regions be like if the International Fund for Ireland did not exist?  Then they were economically devastated; now they would be on their knees or dead.  Senator Gallagher made the point that there is nobody of her age <Col N="1842" /> group living in Kinlough.  It is the same story in many of the towns in the Border regions including my home town.  Without the funding received from the International Fund for Ireland the towns in the region would have died from economic deprivation.  It is ironic that we are now seeking more money.</P>
    <P>The CRISP Programme which was initiated in Northern Ireland gives incentives to private and community enterprise aimed at developing small towns and villages. The small towns and villages scheme was introduced in the South in 1992 and I believe private enterprise can play a greater role in that scheme if it receives funding from the International Fund for Ireland.  There is much development taking place in those regions and if they received extra funding additional employment could be created.  For economic reasons a scheme similar to the successful CRISP Programme should be introduced in the South where I believe it could be successful.</P>
    <P>The flagship of the IFI programme must be the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  I raised the issue of the canal's name in the Seanad yesterday and the Tánaiste informed me that it will be called the Shannon-Erne Link.  That is unfortunate for the area of Ballinamore and Ballyconnell but I will not make a major issue of the name.  Economic development in the area from Leitrim village to the Ballyconnell Canal has been tremendous.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Mooney, was lauding the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, for his contribution to the development and restoration of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal and I have no doubt he made an excellent contribution. When I was a Member of the Lower House I publicly congratulated him on the initiative he had taken but, as Senator Gallagher said, one would think he brought a spade and bucket with him. His name is etched in the stone of the canal and it will be there for generations to come unless somebody tries to scrape it out, and I do not think anybody in Ballinamore would be that bad.</P>
    <P>On a serious note, the catalyst for the <Col N="1843" /> development of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal was the International Fund for Ireland.  It was a cross-Border project.  It was a flagship for the Fund and they kept pushing until both Governments participated.  We have to thank them for their initiative, without which the project would not have taken place. Senator Lee told us how the fund was established and how it overcame serious difficulties to establish developments in rural and urban areas throughout the Border regions.  If we, as a Government, could learn from that it would be of major benefit to the whole country.</P>
    <P>I thank the donors who have contributed so handsomely to the International Fund for Ireland.  If it has not been established, the Border regions would be in economic chaos.  I hope the International Fund for Ireland will last for a long time.  We all would like to get more money and the Government would like to have more money.  However, as long as the International Fund for Ireland stays in place it will do excellent work for the development of the Border regions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>One fault of the fund is that it is not fairly divided.  The North receives 75 per cent and the South receives 25 per cent. I think it should be divided on a 50:50 <Col N="1844" /> basis because the troubles in the North have played greater havoc with areas South of the Border than North of the Border.  North Sligo is a cul-de-sac because there is no bridge or roads to cross.  One has to go to Blacklion or Belleek.  That area is badly affected by the troubles in the North with the result that the environment and businesses there have deteriorated.</P>
    <P>Kiltyclogher was mentioned earlier. When I worked in Kiltyclogher many years ago, people went back and forth to the North and most people shopped in Kiltyclogher, Kinlough and other villages. There was cross-Border movement all the time, particularly on fair days, but that is a thing of the past.  The people in Sligo, particularly north Sligo, and in Leitrim are as badly hit by the Northern troubles as the people in Fermanagh, yet we only receive 25 per cent of the funding and the North receives 75 per cent.  The annual report of the International Fund contains pages and pages relating to the North.</P>

      <P>The point is that the fund is there now; everything else is history, but the division of it is not made fairly. It is not fair that the North should get 75 per cent and the South 25 per cent.  It should be 50:50 or at least 60:40.</P>
      <P>The other problem is that local authorities have to provide 50 per cent of the funding which as we know local authorities are not in a position to do.  I would like to know &mdash; and someone might be able to tell me when this debate ends &mdash; how is the local contribution funded by disrict councils in the North?  They have fewer ways of raising revenue than authorities in the South.  We have a full county in which to raise revenue while they are only district councils.  There must be something of which I do not know because county councils here are finding it difficult to provide 50 per cent of the funding for large projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said at a county council meeting recently that Sligo, Leitrim and Fermanagh should come together as a unit to work this fund more satisfactorily and effectively.  There is not cross-Border initiative in our area.  Fermanagh, Leitrim and Sligo is an ideal catchment area <Col N="1846" /> for promoting greater cross-Border co-operation, particularly in tourism.  There is no reason why we could not have a circuit for tourists from Sligo through Belleek, Fermanagh, Leitrim and back to Sligo again, as well as to Donegal and back again.  Tourists come as far as Belleek and go back again, there is no cross-Border tourist dimension there.</P>
    <P>It is important that the west complete that circuit, which could be achieved under the direction of a committee comprising Fermanagh District Council, Sligo County Council and Leitrim County Council.  I ask Leitrim County Council to discuss that at their council meeting.  I have already discussed the issue in Sligo and we are pursuing it with a view to improving the cross-Border tourist dimension.</P>
    <P>There is no question that much could be done, and has been done, for the environment but there are may environmental projects which are not currently receiving the funding they deserve from the International Fund.  We should conduct further research into finding out how we could establish more environmental projects, because tourism must be the main plank of our business in the northwest.</P>
    <P>Some industries are receiving money from the International Fund and some are not.  Because the 25 per cent provision has to be divided among approximately the same number of firms in the South as the 75 per cent provision has to be divided among the firms in the North we cannot get from the fund as much money for small industry as we would like.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.</P>
      <P>The problem I am raising today is not one of detection of crime in north Wicklow but of prevention.  When I raised this issue before, it was misinterpreted by some, including the Minister for Justice at the time as being a criticism of the Garda which it is not.  It was also misinterpreted as a criticism of Bray.  It is not.  What I will ask the Minister to do in his reply &mdash; if he can depart from his script &mdash; is to tell us how he intends to tackle this problem.  The Garda have a very good record for detecting crime in north Wicklow but they have an extremely poor record of preventing crime.  The problem in the Bray area is that the sort of crimes of which we speak are high profile and very violent, and they give the town a very bad name.  As a result Bray is regarded by many as a criminal's paradise and a cross between Dodge City and Chicago.  It appears that criminal activity is allowed to flourish in the town.  In recent weeks I have had representations from parents saying they cannot let their children out after 9 p.m. and from the elderly, who are terrified to walk the streets of the town they lived in for many decades.  They believe the criminal gangs have declared this open season for their activities.  This is obvious in take away restaurants at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may not be aware of it, but there was another attempted armed robbery in Castle Street in Bray two weeks ago which received national coverage in the press.  During the Bray festival last year there was also a high profile incident involving guns.  This is bad for the town and could be prevented if the Minister put more gardaí on the beat.  I hope that the Minister will not tell me there are 60 gardaí working in the Bray district.  I acknowledge that but we need gardaí on the streets, not sitting at desks analysising crimes already committed, <Col N="1848" /> even though they are doing a good job of that.</P>
    <P>The seafront in Bray invites this sort of criminal activity.  The shelters there attract under age drinkers at night.  These shelters should either be demolished or gardaí should permanently patrol the seafront.  Bray is a seaside town with enormous tourism potential.  Its present image is very bad for tourism and for the potential business investment the town is trying to attract.  Factories have been vandalised and shops have been robbed not only by indigenous criminal gangs but by criminals from other areas who regard Bray as soft pickings and a paradise for their activities.  The only solution is more gardaí.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, this activity has spread to Greystones, the fastest growing town in the greater Dublin area; two years ago, it was the fastest growing town in Europe. Greystones is suffering because it is neglected. There is no infrastructure in Greystones, the roads and footpaths are neglected, the sewerage system is grossly inadequate, the sea is polluted, the town has no proper transport facilities and, what is worse, there is also an inadequate number of gardaí to protect the population. The population of Greystones and of Bray, especially the older people need protecting by the visible presence of gardaí on the beat.  In Greystones, there has been a series of robberies and an upsurge in vandalism.  Some weeks ago, there was an atrocious incident of vandalism in a housing estate where a group of thugs, as yet undetected, damaged 30 to 40 cars.  A Garda presence in that estate would have prevented this.  We have daily reports of burglaries in both towns.  In the last year, the Greystones post office has been robbed several times, as have branches of the Allied Irish Bank and, the more topical, the Irish Permanent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It would not be appropriate because I know what is in your mind.</P>
      <P>South of Greystones, the village of Kilcoole, which is fast becoming a town, has only one community Garda; it has no permanent Garda presence.  Because of the image of these two towns, the need to attract tourists and business to the area and for the protection of the people who live there, I appeal to the Minister to provide more gardaí on the beat for Bray and Greystones so that they can help to prevent crime.  As I said, Bray's image is appalling.  Many people outside the district regard it as a criminal's paradise. The image of the town and the safety of the people of Greystones is suffering each week because of the neglect and because there are not enough gardaí patrolling the town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity here this evening to comment on the policing situation in Bray and Greystones and I appreciate the Senator's genuine concern in raising this issue.</P>
      <P>On the general question of increasing the number of gardaí on the beat, this is something which I am totally in favour of and there is a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to increase the number of gardaí on the streets through the acceleration of Garda recruitment and the employment of more civilians in the Garda Síochána.  I intend to act on that commitment as quickly as possible in relation to the overall number of gardaí in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the allocation of manpower and resources to individual areas.  They inform me there are 59 gardaí assigned to Bray and 26 to Greystones, which represents an increase of four and eight respectively since January 1991.  In addition, there are five civilian clerical staff attached to Bray station.  These civilians have released gardaí from administrative work to operational duties.  Bray <Col N="1850" /> station opens 24 hours a day and since April 1992, the opening hours of Greystones have been extended to 24 hours a day.</P>
    <P>There are also five community gardaí, three in Bray and two in Greystones. They patrol the areas in addition to the uniformed foot and mobile patrols.  The community gardaí liaise with the business community and local people through their involvement with youth activities and Neighbourhood Watch Schemes.</P>
    <P>Without being complacent, the level of reported crime in these areas fell in 1991 and the indications are that there will be no significant increase in the crime figures in 1992.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the staffing levels in Bray and Greystones meet the policing needs of these areas but they say that they can be augmented by members from outside the district if required.  They have assured me, however, that the position will be kept under review.  I note what Senator Ross has said about gardaí being visible and I will pass on his comments to the commissioner.</P>
    <P>I also mention in relation to public order/street offences that the Minister for Justice intends to introduce legislation which will give increased powers to the Garda Síochana to deal with groups congregating in particular areas and will make it an offence to use threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place.  This legislation is being prepared as a matter of priority in my Department at present and will be introduced shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and for taking the trouble to investigate this situation.  I appreciate what he said about the level of reported crime not having increased in 1992 in these two areas.  The problems are, first, that reported crime has not gone down and second, that the level of violent crime in the area is very worrying.  The number of incidents with guns and arms is the main concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1851" /> I ask the Minister to pass on &mdash; I know he cannot make any promises &mdash; the great concern of local people that there are disproportionate numbers of high profile violent criminals operating in the area. People feel they cannot live there safely. It is not just a matter of burglaries; I am talking about high profile armed robberies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I take Senator Ross's point.  There are a number of places in <Col N="1852" /> the country where there is concern about the increase in high profile violent crime. I am disappointed to hear that Bray and Greystones have joined that list.  I will pass on Senator Ross's comments in this regard to the commissioner and I will correspond with him when I receive a reply.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 5 May 1993.</P>
