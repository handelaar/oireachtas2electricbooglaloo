      <P>I have notice from Senator Sean Maloney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide free travel for children from rural areas travelling to St. Joseph's School for the Blind, Drumcondra, Dublin 9.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Denis Cregan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to outline the present position regarding Irish Steel, in view of recent public statements.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Michael Calnan of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" /> The need for the Minister for Finance to make moneys available to the Office of Public Works to alleviate flooding from the Bandon River in the Dunmanway area in County Cork.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Madeleine Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to outline the social and economic implications that will arise from the Government's decision to change the transatlantic status of Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Mary Henry of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to outline the reasons for <Col N="3" /> the delay in the ratification of Protocols 1 and 2 of the Geneva Convention.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Paddy Burke of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to upgrade to national primary status the routes from Swinford to Ballina, and Castlebar to Westport, County Mayo as a continuation of the N5.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to allocate more funding to Co-operation North.</P>

    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Sean Maloney, Denis Cregan, Michael Clanan, Madeleine Taylor-Quinn, Mary Henry, Paddy Burke, Shane Ross and Paddy McGowan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Maloney and Senator Cregan's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take item No. 1, the Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993, Committee and Final Stages, if we can make that progress, between now and 6 p.m., and from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m.  Item No. 29 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.  The Adjournment debate will take place at the conclusion of today's business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed by me at least.  Since we last met <Col N="4" /> we have had another week of murderous barbarity in Northern Ireland.  I would like, on behalf of my group, to extend our sympathy to the families of all those killed in Greysteel and to the family of the RUC officer who was shot at Newry and died yesterday.</P>
      <P>On the question of Northern Ireland, I would also like to express the goodwill of this side of the House to the Tánaiste in his discussions at the Anglo-Irish Conference today.  Obviously, we are not going to get a solution to the Northern problem today, but anything which can help to bring about a cessation of violence and the peaceful conditions which we all desire is to be welcomed.  It is important that the support of all parties in this House should be seen to be behind the Tánaiste in what he is trying to achieve.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House to make time available tomorrow for the beginning of a debate on Northern Ireland.  In the past when we have asked for these debates we have been told that things might be said which could cause problems, or that there was nothing to report.  It is wrong that the one topic the whole country is discussing and which concerns the entire country should not be on the agenda of this House.  I am asking for an open-ended debate tomorrow. We should have the Northern Ireland question on the Order Paper, on the agenda, every day so that people can discuss what is happening and make their contributions.  We saw here last week when the matter was discussed that there was a high level of responsibility and a deep sense of concern and commitment. This House should be afforded the opportunity of discussing the ongoing situation in Northern Ireland.  It is important that this, as one of the two sovereign Houses of Parliament, should have a central role and should not abdicate this role to the airwaves, the media and all the discussions around the country.  I would ask the Leader of the House, therefore, to begin an open-ended debate tomorrow on Northern Ireland so that we can resume at any stage as we strive to find the solution we all so dearly desire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though my inclination is to join with what Senator Manning has said about offering our condolences to the families of victims in the North, I hesitate to start a roundrobin in the Chamber.  Our view is conveyed by the House and everybody would want to be part of it.</P>
      <P>The call was made last week on both sides of the House to the Leader, from Senator McGowan on the Government side and from Senator Manning, myself and many others on this side, for a debate on Northern Ireland.  No one could be anything but supportive of a debate at this time.</P>
      <P>As people are congratulating the input made by various people, I want to go on the record &mdash; and I am not trying to enter any note of controversy on this &mdash; and say that I have watched a politician in the North for many years who has put his total reputation on the line on this.  From a personal point of view I would congratulate John Hume on the initiative he has taken which led to the development of various initiatives from both Governments. I wish them well.  I recognise, however, the contribution that has been made by him over the last 24 years and in particular over the last difficult number of months.  I am not making a judgment on what has resulted from his negotiations. He exercised a judgment with which people may agree or disagree, but at the end of the day we would all agree that he has put himself on the line to try to do the best he could.  I will not abuse my position by going any further, a Chathaoirligh.  I recognise I have gone beyond that point at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last number of weeks I have raised with the Leader the provision of a list of the legislation which it is proposed to initiate in this House.  Last week he gave me a guarantee that it would be available this week.  I recognise the good intentions of the Leader in this matter but I also recognise that unless there is constant pressure kept on Government Departments and Ministers we will not get an answer to this question.  In the interests of Members preparing for debates on legislation we must take <Col N="6" /> strong action on this side of the House and insist we have some indication &mdash; I am not talking about dates &mdash; of the list of legislation to be initiated in this House during this term.  It is now the beginning of November, we have been seeking this for the last four weeks and I ask that it be made available as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I remind the Leader there was a consensus in the House that the marine, its development and industry resulting from such development should be discussed. Due to pressures of time I do not expect such a discussion this week.  This was perhaps subsumed by another proposal that the National Development Plan be discussed in sections.  It would make sense if the plan was discussed over a period of weeks, certain sections being taken each week, to allow people make an input.  Each debate would be a new one, thus people would not be constrained from contributing to a number of aspects of the plan.  I ask the Leader to respond to these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senators Manning and O'Toole in expressing our sysmpathy. I share the view that we should not, week in and week out, make such denunciations.  Nevertheless, the events of the past week make it necessary to pass some comment.  Greysteel, Eglinton and Campsie are places I know well and I know the people in those areas.  I was very moved yesterday by the silent, dignified way in which they bore their grief and the responsible attitude of their civic leaders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I remarked last week, we need to do more than express our sympathy on a ritual basis.  The time has come to have a debate on the matter.  Senator Wilson has been calling for this for some time and I join with him and Senator Manning in this request.  There is a responsibility on us to examine every possibility to advance constitutional politics within Ireland and within these islands and to contribute in whatever way we can to ending the unceasing cycle of violence into which we seem to have descended. By responsible and restrained debate, as we have had in this House in the past, <Col N="7" /> there is a possibility of creating the circumstances for such an advancement. For this reason I recommend very strongly to the Leader that he make time available at the earliest possible opportunity for a debate on the overall situation in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I also support Senator O'Toole's call for a detailed breakdown of the legislation the Leader expects to bring before us during this session.  Also, I re-emphasise the point made that the Private Members' Time discussion last week on the marine was very limited in its scope and there was far more we could have discussed.  We need time to discuss that matter further.  I am flexible as to whether this should be in the context of a detailed debate on each section of the National Development Plan or a special debate on the marine but I believe we should return to this issue.</P>
    <P>May I inquire of the Leader whether it is the Government's intention to introduce tropical or subtropical plants into the House?  We seem to be preparing for those types of exotic plants to arrive in our midst.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again we have had a dreadful week in Northern Ireland.  I agree we should extend sympathy.  Sympathy is not enough, nevertheless it is right that it should be expressed.  We must talk seriously about Northern Ireland in this House.  I am very impressed by the Tánaiste's six-point statement of last week and I thank him for it.  I see it as a sea change in Government policy and as the most generous and open-handed offer, for want of a better word, the Irish Government has made in decades in relation to the problem that is Northern Ireland.  Within my limited sphere I will try to encourage all of the parties in Northern Ireland to listen to and act on the Tánaiste's six points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Manning and other Senators who have asked for a debate on Northern Ireland. Nobody can say enough about the appalling tragedies that have occured there <Col N="8" /> and the disgust felt by people throughout the island at recent events.</P>
      <P>At the weekend the Government made an announcement which fundamentally changes the cornerstone for economic development in the mid-west and west regions.  This was the renegotiation of the bilateral agreement with the United States of America.  In doing so it has removed the transatlantic status from Shannon Airport.  The matter is so serious and fundamental that I ask the Leader to arrange time for a debate on it this week.  It is seen in the mid-west and west as a very serious matter affecting future development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning's remarks deserve a very positive response from the Government side of the House. I agree with what he said in relation to a debate on Northern Ireland which should be held, if not tomorrow, at the earliest possible opportunity.  Senator O'Toole is correct in saying we should not have ritualistic denunciations.  A bottom line of everybody in this House is that we are against killing, regardless of who is doing the killing and the side of the divide from which they come and whether they wear uniforms of any hue.  Senator Wilson's view that a debate in this House has a positive effect on people in Northern Ireland should be taken aboard.  This is not the House for partisan statements on Northern Ireland.  There should be an immediate response to the remarks made by Senator Manning and others in relation to such a debate which, given the way this House views Northern Ireland and the chaos and havoc there, could do nothing but good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in conveying condolences to the families of the victims of violence in Northern Ireland.  It is hard to believe it is happening in Ireland.  Day after day we see the remains of innocent victims of the violence being carried to their resting places.  It is an appalling situation.  There appears to be a clearing of the air.  There is less ambiguity and ambivalence on all sides than there was previously.  This is welcome.  It is important <Col N="9" /> to have a debate on Northern Ireland so there will be no ambiguity and ambivalence and the attention can focus on policy regarding the future of Northern Ireland.  It is welcome that both Governments are taking this matter seriously with a view to establishing fora on which the various bodies will have representation. It is vitally important and urgent.  There has been much debate in the media which people are finding it difficult to follow.  I think it is as matter for Parliament to establish quite clearly its position on the issue of Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour group I would like to convey our sympathy to the relatives of those who died in Greysteel and in other incidents over the past week.  I take the point made by Senators O'Toole and Magner and others that we should not appear to be giving ritualistic votes of sympathy.  At the same time, Senator Wilson has made the point that genuine expressions of sympathy from all sides of the House have an effect and are received with understanding in the North.  I would like to join with the votes of sympathy and support the views expressed that we should have a debate as soon as possible on Northern Ireland.  We have always been restrained and responsible in debating Northern Ireland and there is a great deal of knowledge about the issue in this House.  I believe that what Senator Wilson has said is true, that the six points put forward by the Tánaiste give scope for real progress in the negotiations between the two Governments and with the various constitutional parties.  I support the view that we should hold a debate as soon as possible on Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the North of Ireland.  I am one of those who have consistently so called and I was not happy at the attempt to be fobbed off with the second part of the debate on the Opsahl Report.  That did not constitute a full debate as far as I was concerned.  It is important that we have <Col N="10" /> a full debate involving all the issues and all the Members of the House.</P>
      <P>I would like to add one thing to what has been said.  I have no difficulty in agreeing with what everybody else has said but reference has been made to a sea change which has taken place in the Government's thinking.  We should be clear that a sea change has also taken place in Republican thinking.  That is the most important and significant element in the process which has taken place over the last few weeks.  Unfortunately, that sea change in their thinking has not been matched by a sea change in their actions. However, it certainly appears to me to provide a moment of convergence between these disparate parties and with the initiative taken by the Tánaiste, perhaps we can move towards peace.  From everything I have heard over the last couple of days particularly, the people in both communities in the North have their minds focused on peace in a way which never happened before.  I would welcome an opportunity to contribute to this debate, as I think we all would.</P>
      <P>I also support what my colleague, Senator O'Toole, said, and I know the difficulties of the Leader of the House with regard to the legislative programme. Somebody mentioned the Christmas session. In a way it is rather like Christmas shopping &mdash; people leave it until the last minute.  We all know that it is not the Leader's fault, but it would be such a relief if we could avoid this awful rush at the last minute to get things through so that we can take the Christmas break.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, are there any plans on the Government side to have a debate on the increasing problem of drugs in the inner city of Dublin?  I presume it is a similar situation in other areas.  I anticipate the Leader's response.  I know that I have the right to put down a motion on this, but I feel that it would perhaps be taken in a broader context and have more weight if the Government put one down.  In anticipation of the Government's taking this issue as seriously as I think we all do, I will not at the moment put down a motion because I would prefer if one came from the Government.  It would make it easier <Col N="11" /> to take it earlier.  I would be grateful if the Leader could give an indication that this problem will be addressed by this House before Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGinnis Mrs. McGinnis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGinnis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if Senator Norris could read my mind but that is also the reason I wish to speak.  I support the call for a debate on Northern Ireland but there is a huge problem in our midst which is claiming as many, if not more, lives &mdash; the huge drug problem in Dublin. I requested earlier this year that the Leader would give time to a debate on this and I was assured that this would be done before the summer recess.  This did not happen.  I feel strongly that while this House remains silent on this issue and calls for debates on other issues &mdash; which I accept are important, such as marine policy, the Common Agricultural Policy and the country enterprise boards &mdash; we are losing touch with the reality of life outside this Chamber.  I ask the Leader urgently to arrange for a debate on the problem of drug abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would like to join with the votes of sympathy to all sides in Northern Ireland.  Everybody in this House would welcome a debate on Northern Ireland.  I would like to put a question to the Minister for the Environment, through the Leader of the House.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report was published recently and shows clearly where the national lottery funds have been disbursed.  The Minister for the Environment made an announcement that those national lottery funds would be disbursed through the local authorities.  Will the Leader ask the Minister when he intends to take the decision to disburse the national lottery funds through the local authorities?</P>
      <P>I would also like to ask him in relation to the Mayo West by-election and the Dublin by-election when he intends to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request for a debate on Northern Ireland.  Many people felt that because of the sensitivity of the situation heretofore we could not express fully our views on it but I think the situation has now changed with the recent developments, especially the developments last week in the Dáil.  I support the request for a debate on the drugs problem in Dublin.  The Women's Rights Committee yesterday visited Mountjoy Prison.  Eighty per cent of the women in that prison have severe drug problems and 80 per cent are from Dublin.  We would like a full debate on that.  I ask the Leader of the House to indicate if he will allow time next week for the Second Stage debate on the Refugee Protection (No. 2) Bill, which Fine Gael has put on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>As you are aware, a Chathaoirligh, there are many excellent and worthy charities which collect money for worthy purposes.  You will probably have seen the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General which states that there are approximately 6,000 charities collecting approximately £130 million. We should discuss the report in that it outlines that much of these moneys which are being collected are not being properly supervised and there is no monitoring of these bodies.  It is important that people who are donating money be satisfied that the charities to which they are donating are worthy and properly supervised.  For that reason, I would like two hours for a special debate as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>One can only be impressed by the condolences being expressed to all the people in the North on their losses.  If we are to have a discussion, it is important that the Seanad <Col N="13" /> show example by ensuring that we all have the same line of thinking.  It is important that we would all be seen to be positive.  We have an opportunity in the Seanad to show that we have one line of policy in the Upper House and in the country, otherwise we will have a debate which will end up saying nothing.  We have listened to Senator Wilson and others speaking.  The sad happenings over the past two weeks in the North deserve serious discussion by this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the expression of sympathy to those bereaved in the past two weeks in Northern Ireland and I also support the call for a debate in this House on Northern Ireland at the earliest possible date.  Tragic scenes are shown on the television each evening.  We must support the Government in its efforts to achieve peace.  A debate in this House would help the Government to achieve this outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the House and my own party I extend our sympathy to the families who have suffered over the weekend.  In regard to Northern Ireland, the Government has shown its willingness to allow a debate in this House. I am sure the Taoiseach and the Tanáiste would welcome an opportunity to come into the House to debate the speech made last week by the Tanáiste and, in particular, his six principles which we hope will lead to peace.  As soon as the Tanáiste returns, I hope I will be able to discuss a date for a debate on Northern Ireland and I will then report back to the House.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator O'Toole's question, I have asked about legislation and I hope to have a more detailed report in the near future. The Senator is aware that there are 38 Bills to be initiated.  It may be possible to take the Adoptive Leave Bill next week if the Minister is available. I hope to give the Senator a more detailed response shortly.  Many pieces of legislation are ready and they will come to this House in the near future.  I try to give all Senators an opportunity to prepare for the introduction of Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="14" /> I agreed to a debate on the marine last week.  A suggestion was made that the National Development Plan should be debated under different subheadings.  In the next couple of weeks operational programmes will be put together for each subhead.  At that stage it would be appropriate for the House to discuss the operational programme under subheads such as tourism, natural resources and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, has announced a bilateral agreement with the US.  The Whips will agree that when the issue of Aer Lingus has been dealt with, the House will have an opportunity to discuss the situation.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis stated that she has been asking for a debate on drug-related issues in Dublin city and throughout the country.  Senator Norris also made this point.  I have asked the Minister about this and I hope that the debate will be in Government time and that explanations will be given about the measures taken to combat the problem.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;the expression comprises in addition a dwelling in which a married couple ordinarily resided prior to the 25th of June, 1993, as their sole or principal residence and in which either spouse continued to reside on or after the 25th June, 1993 and includes any easements attached or annexed to such a dwelling and exercisable over any other land;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Bill stands, the definition of a matrimonial home is a home where a married couple were residing together on 25 June 1993.  Regardless of who has the legal title to the property, it will be deemed to be owned jointly.  It excludes from joint ownership thousands of wives already separated or deserted who are <Col N="16" /> residing in family homes owned by their husbands.  This is the case under the terms of the Bill because their husbands deserted them prior to 25th June 1993.  If the husband walked out of the home on 24 June 1993, the wife will not have joint ownership of the home.</P>
    <P>In 1992 15,000 women were in receipt of deserted wife's benefit or deserted wife's allowance.  If we assume that half the family homes were in joint ownership, 7,500 would be excluded under the provisions of this Bill.  In making this calculation, we are not including deserted wives who do not receive allowances. Allowances are means tested, therefore anyone who is not eligible under a means test is excluded from this statistics. Therefore, the number of deserted wives excluded from benefit under the Bill is higher than 7,500.  Wives whose husbands have moved out voluntarily because of extramarital relationships or wives whose husbands have left but continue to support them are not included because the husband left prior to 25 June.  It is impossible to calculate the number of women who are excluded because of the definition of matrimonial home, but it is fair to estimate that the number is approximately 15,000.</P>
    <P>My amendment will provide protection for deserted and separated wives for whom the courts have not made orders to resolve the consequences of their marriage breakdowns and where there is no written agreement in force between the husband and wife in regard to the ownership of the home.  In many cases the wife did not take legal steps in regard to ownership of the home because she knew the husband could not sell the house without her consent.  She continues to live in the home which is in her husband's name while he lives in another house which may be jointly owned by another person if he has entered into a second relationship. Under this Bill such a wife will not have automatic joint ownership of the original family home.</P>
    <P>The Bill condemns to uncertainty thousand of wives who do not understand the technicalities of this Bill.  The media have fairly promoted the Bill and praised the <Col N="17" /> joint ownership proposals.  People who were separated prior to 25 June believe that they will have joint ownership of their house and that this legislation assists them when in fact that is not the case.  It is only fair, just and constitutional that wives who were separated prior to 25 June and are living in the home should have the same rights as wives separated post 25 June.  I ask the Minister to accept our amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a fairly straightforward amendment.  The Minister may say that he is putting in a particular date, 25 June 1993 and he may feel it would be unwise to make it retrospective. However, I question whether it is necessary to have such a date in the Bill.  I think it can be retrospective in this instance. Retrospective legislation can be difficult and cause problems but I do not think that would be the case.</P>
      <P>A woman may be living in the house having been deserted by her husband, who may perhaps have taken up residence in some other house.  This woman who is living in what she regards as the family home may find that she will not be the joint owner of the house if it is in her husband's name.  That is a matter of concern.</P>
      <P>Senator Neville mentioned a figure of about 15,000 who have been drawing deserted wife's allowance.  There are vast numbers of people who are not getting that but who are getting maintenance of one type or another.  It is far greater than the 15,000 mentioned; I cannot put a figure on it.  I am very worried that many women will suddenly find they do not have joint ownership as they thought they would.  They will be excluded in this instance from joint ownership.  It is essential therefore that this amendment be supported.</P>

      <P>I agree with what both Senator Enright and Senator Neville have said.  This is complex legislation and I would be grateful for clarification from the Minister.  My understanding was that women who were in the home as of 25 June would be entitled to joint ownership. <Col N="18" /> I did not realise that the situation Senator Neville outlined could arise and I would certainly be concerned about it.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the matter of changing the date when he addressed the House on Second Stage.  He said he was aware that there were those who would advocate greater retrospectivity, as he called it, but he believed that this was as far as he could go.  I would be concerned in light of what Senator Neville has said.</P>
      <P>Most of the people in this situation would be women.  Women tend to be the more vulnerable of the two spouses.  I understood that if the marriage had broken down and there was a judicial separation everything would have been sorted out under the Judicial Separation Act.  However, if there was not a judicial separation and they could lose the home in which they were residing as at 25 June, I would be particularly concerned.  I ask the Minister to clarify that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This involves quite a radical change in the law.  We are giving half the beneficial interest in a family home to the non-owning spouse.  If the home is in the name of one person, the effect of the legislation is to give half the beneficial interest to the other spouse and make them joint tenants.  This means that when one dies, the other will automatically get the entire property.  This obviously necessitates defining the term &ldquo;matrimonial home&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Matrimonial home&rdquo; is defined in the definition section as:</P>
      <P>a dwelling in which a married couple ordinarily resided or reside on or at any time after the 25th day of June, 1993, as their sole or principal residence and includes any easements attached or annexed to such a dwelling and exercisable over any other land.</P>
      <P>If one is defining the matrimonial home, that is, the property in which one is creating the joint interest, it must be defined by reference to some starting date and that is precisely how it is done in the legislation.  It is essential that there is a starting date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the concerns which motivated Senator Neville to put down <Col N="19" /> his amendment.  However I do not feel that the amendment is practicable or workable.  There is a limit to the extent to which legislation should reach back into the past in the fashion proposed by Senator Neville's amendment.  I have strong doubts as to whether the amendment proposed would be in accordance with our Constitution.  That is not just a throwaway remark.  We have to consult the Attorney General in relation to all legislation and the Attorney General is very doubtful about the constitutionality of such a proposal.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there will be difficult cases which will be caught on the wrong side of the line.  However, individuals in this situation are not without alternative remedies.  As Senators are aware, under the Family Home Protection Act, the wife in the example given has the right to veto the sale of the home.  Even though one of the spouses may have left the home before 25 June, it is still a family home for the purposes of family home protection.  In addition to that, the wife can bring a case requesting a property adjustment order under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in section 18 of this Bill which allows people to apply to court in a summary manner to deal with all questions relating to the ownership of property.  I realise what the Senators are saying but the spouses &mdash; and it generally will be the wife &mdash; in the case the Senator outlined has alternative remedies.  In legislation such as this we must have a starting point somewhere and the starting point.  The starting point here is by reference to the definition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill creates two categories of separated wives.  One category is those who were separated prior to 25 June who do not have joint ownership of the family home and who must resort to other legislation to obtain joint ownership. The intention of the legislation is to move away from a situation where wives have to go to court to obtain ownership of the home if they are separated.  Wives <Col N="20" /> who are separated or deserted after 25 June will have joint ownership while wives deserted on 24 June will not.  The latter will have to go to the court to obtain ownership under the Family Home Protection Act.</P>
      <P>I understand that when that Act came into force in 1976 there was no cut off point.  A wife could retrospectively obtain protection under the Family Home Protection Act.  I see this legislation in the same light.  It is designed to cater for women in a vulnerable situation, who are separated and do not own the home in which they are living.  However, the people being excluded are the most vulnerable, that is, those who are already separated and who are living in a home while their husbands are living elsewhere and may have another home jointly owned with another person with whom they have entered into a second relationship. These people who have been separated must go to court to obtain their rights when it was the intention of this Bill to cover that situation.  My amendment is designed to ensure that the Bill is fair to all separated wives, especially the most vulnerable who have been separated for some time, by giving them the right jointly to own the home in which they have been living and probably rearing their families alone.  This Bill does not cover that situation.  In fact, the husband who has left or deserted the wife will continue to own the home after this Bill is passed. No ownership rights are vested in the spouse who has been living and rearing a family in that home.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister cannot assist the most vulnerable people, those who have been separated for some time.  Those who were separated after 25 June 1993 will have joint ownership of the family home but those who were separated in April 1993 will not.  That is unfair and it should be corrected by acceptance of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill endeavours to safeguard the rights of husbands and wives, particularly wives.  In this instance, as Senator Neville outlined, ownership of the home is not vested and will not <Col N="21" /> vest in the deserted wife is living in the family home and whose husband is living elsewhere and may have another relationship.  In the event of the death of the deserting husband he may leave the dwelling where the deserted wife is now living to the person with whom he set up the new relationship.  In that situation the deserted wife does not have an automatic joint tenancy.  The third party has a will and the most the deserted wife is entitled to claim is one third of the property.  The remaining two thirds can go to the third party, who may already have another home.  There is a real difficulty in that up to 15,000 women may be in that situation. The Minister is putting a number of women at risk who, through no fault of their own, are caught by a technicality. When the Family Home Protection Act was introduced I do not think it included a cut off date.  There should not be a cut off date in this Bill either.  Many of these women can, to all intents and purposes, be disinherited.</P>
      <P>Many deserted wives have already endured much trauma and they are particularly vulnerable people.  Many are quite strong but others are not.  They would have little knowledge of the law and may not want to go to court.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should accept this amendment.  I have consulted a number of people about it.  It is the only contentious issue in this legislation and we feel so strongly about it that we will call a vote on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify a matter. The Minister stated that the Bill creates joint ownership, which we all accept and welcome.  I may have misunderstood the Minister but I thought he said that he did not want to give a deserted wife joint ownership because if the deserting husband died she would acquire the house. Was that what the Minister wished to convey?  I do not think that women in this situation, who tend to be the most vulnerable, should be asked to remain <Col N="22" /> vulnerable because the Minister is concerned about the deserting husband.</P>
      <P>I also agree with the points made by Senator Neville and Senator Enright. Women in this situation do not, in many cases, have the resources to go to law. The home may be the only thing they possess and they would not have independent means or access to the law.  The Minister said they have other legal means of redress but they cost money and many women do not have the necessary financial independence.  I am concerned with protecting their rights.</P>
      <P>The Minister on Second Stage said that where couples separated since June 25 the provisions of any separation agreement or court order relating to the home would override the provisions of the Bill. If such things had happened prior to 25 June that could also be the case.  It is complex and it could be difficult but I am concerned that all women should have the protection of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Enright has given a practical example of the point I made. Most women who are separated prior to June 25 will assume that under this Bill they have joint ownership.  They will not go to court even though they have that right under the Family Home Protection Act.  Most of these people are vulnerable and trying to survive from day to day. They will assume that they own the family home.  They will not know that part of their house has been willed to a third party after the death of the husband.  The home might have to be sold if the third party wishes to obtain the value of their share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had an interesting discussion and there are some points I wish to clarify.  There is some illusion about the question of going to court. Senator Enright mentioned the spouse's right to one third of the estate under the Succession Act of 1965.  If a married person makes a will and ignores the spouse's legal right to one third under the Succession Act of 1965, the Senator will be aware of the procedure.  She must be informed of her options in that regard by <Col N="23" /> the personal representative.  It would be crazy if anyone had to go to court to establish a right to their one third.  Any solicitor will advise her that under the Succession Act she does not have to go to court.  If she had to go to court to get it the cost would come out of the estate. Nobody will dispute that.  There is no legal point at issue here.  I am sure the courts would be very angry to have somebody coming before them claiming what is clearly provided for in the legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Neville mentioned the question of going to court under the Family Home Protection Act.  That will not arise. Under the Family Home Protection Act the spouse has a veto if the other spouse wishes to convey his family home.  He cannot convey a proper title in that family home unless the other spouse signs the consent.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Honan's point, we are not trying to discriminate against deserted wives.  We are introducing an innovative radical provision whereby every matrimonial home &mdash; regardless of whose name it is in &mdash; is now being put into joint names.  We are defining a matrimonial home as a home in which the husband and wife ordinarily resided after June 25 1993.  There must be some starting point.  To follow through the example, if a home is a matrimonial home because there is a couple living in it in an ordinary marital relationship on 25 June, 1993 and if at any time subsequent to that date one party deserts the other, it remains a matrimonial home and they are still joint owners although they are no longer living together.</P>
      <P>With regard to the arguments made by Senator Neville and Senator Enright, I have to agree with the Attorney General that there is a limit to how far we can go back in the past.  Let us take an example where people separated 20 or 25 years ago and one of the parties remains in the home.  Forgetting about the law for a moment, can that logically be described as a matrimonial home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Enright outlined a situation where somebody would only get one third if the separation had occurred <Col N="24" /> before 25 June, 1993.  I will give another example where two parties separated 25 years ago and the wife continues to live in the family home.  Perhaps at the time of separation the home was in the wife's name or it may have been in the name of the husband, but now the wife, by virtue of her undisputed occupation, will have possessory title.  The effect of the amendment would be that the deserting husband, wherever he is, would automatically come back in as a joint owner of the family home.  Surely that cannot be right but it would be the logical consequence of the amendment.</P>
    <P>There are difficult cases which fall on both sides of the line.  The best that can be done is to try to get a logical starting point and work from there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely section 6, the exclusion clause, would cater for the latter situation.  The Minister of State is talking about where somebody has left &mdash; the exclusion clause.  The Minister of State has not answered the case where somebody was deserted, for example, last April and the husband dies having made a will leaving the home to a third party.  What is the wife's position in that case?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State did not explain why there is retrospection in the Family Home Protection Act but not under this legislation.  Surely they are similar as they try to achieve the same objectives of protecting the vulnerable partner, usually the wife, in separation circumstances.  I fail to understand why we could not have retrospection in this Bill since it is in the Family Home Protection Act, 1976.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State makes the point about a cut-off date and as a generality that is reasonable.  The point here is that there are particular circumstances envisaged to which it is argued the generality should not apply. It must be the function of legislation not to penalise any citizen unduly and that would be the effect of leaving the legislation unamended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State made the point that there is a limit to which we can go <Col N="25" /> back in the past.  I hope he will tell that to the Minister for Finance and to the Revenue Commissioners.  I say that as an aside.  He made the point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not a lawyer but it seems that section 18 deals with title and possession and not residence and they not quite the same thing.  I do not share the Minister of State's confidence in the value of section 18 as an adequate safeguard.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Neville's amendment. I reiterate the point that as a generality starting points may be required but somebody should not find themselves in a situation where the starting point penalises them to the extent envisaged in the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief on this point.  The Minister makes the point that a woman may have been living in the home for, let us say, 15 or 18 years.  In the event of her husband's death she can claim title by law of possession and may get title to the home.  The difficulty is that normally if there is a family or maintenance is being paid and the husband visits the house maybe twice or three times yearly, he would be in a position to claim that he has retained ownership in <Col N="26" /> the house.  In the event of a widow making an application to the Land Registry she would have to overcome that-challenge by a third party to claim title to it.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State refers to the Succession Act and claims that if the person had been living in the house a court would frown upon such an approach.  The courts will abide by the Succession Act, the Family Home Protection Act and the provisions of this Bill.  That is what a court will base its decisions on and in many instances there is a grave risk of a widow coming down on the wrong side and losing out in this regard.  This is a matter we feel strongly about and although I do not think the Minister of State will accept what we are saying we ask him to consider it carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said that I would like this provision to go back 20 years.  If a wife is living in a home and has been separated for 20 years I have no problem with her obtaining joint ownership of that home if it was originally owned by her husband.  If it is owned by her and the husband comes back then surely section 6(5) covers that situation. The wife can go to court and prevent the husband getting joint ownership of the family home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to clarify a few points.  Senator Dardis referred to penalising widows.  The purpose of this legislation is not to penalise anybody but to give a wife a joint interest share in the family home.  That is benefiting somebody, which is the thrust of the Bill. Senator Dardis also said that he did not accept the idea of going back indefinitely. If not then he cannot accept the amendment, which goes back to the year dot and there is no starting point or cut-off point.  It is like God; it has no beginning and can go back indefinitely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take Senator Enright's point about the possessory title.  We have all dealt with such cases and are aware of the complications which can arise.  I would put the other case where the husband is the owner of the family home and the <Col N="27" /> wife has left him and taken off with somebody else, perhaps 30 years ago.  The effect of the amendment would be that she would automatically become joint owner of the family home.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 6, which involves a referral to court, are we really suggesting that everybody who owns a house and had been deserted 20, 30 or 40 years ago should as a result of this legislation have to go to court to stop the person who deserted them becoming joint tenant of their property?  That would be the net effect.  There is no point referring to section 6 as that is directly what it means.</P>
    <P>In regard to Senator Enright's example relating to somebody willing the property to his mistress, having deserted his wife, the legal position will be that the wife has a legal right to a one third share.  No matter whom the property is willed to, she can claim her one third share.  There will be no question of going to court because the solicitors for the other side will inform their client of the Succession Act whereby the wife is entitled to her one third share and that it has to be conceded.  In addition, the wife in that case can apply for a property adjustment order under the 1989 Act which would involve her getting a share of the property now.  That is the reality of the 1989 Act.</P>
    <P>The final point was in relation to the Family Home Protection Act and why there was no cut off point under that Act while there is a cut off point under this Bill.  There is a simple explanation for that, namely the Family Home Protection Act did not create any property ownership rights.  It only gave a spouse a veto.  This Act creates ownership rights, an entirely different matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a legal person. If a husband deserted his wife last April and the husband now dies, what is the legal situation with regard to the ownership of that property if he has willed the property to a third party?  I do not understand what would happen in that <Col N="28" /> situation and it is important that the matter be clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The wife would have the legal right to one third of her husband's entire property.  If his property comprises more than the family home the wife can appropriate the family home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>If his property comprises only the house she has a legal entitlement to one third of his house.  I agree that if somebody deserts on 24 June that person will be treated differently from someone who deserts on 26 June.  We have taken 25 June as the starting point.  Hard cases will arise in relation to people who are deserted on 23 and 24 June, 1993, but if we are to cater for those cases in a broad way, as proposed in the Senator's amendment, we would also have to cater for cases of people who were deserted on 23 June, 1943 or 23 June, 1933 and that is our difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister accepts that there will be hard cases, but 95 per cent of cases of desertion entail the husband leaving the matrimonial home, leaving the wife.  In most cases the house is owned by the husband.  I agree there will be hard cases if retrospection is allowed indefinitely. However, on balance, I believe this to be the better approach because it is likely that the husband deserts the wife rather than <i>vice versa</i> and in such cases the wife is always the more vulnerable because in many situations she is not working, does not have a separate income and is rearing a family.  Secondly, 90 per cent of houses, and 99 per cent if one goes back 40 years, would be owned by the husband, who has a 90 per cent probability of leaving the home should separation arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot base the law on percentages like that.  We cannot have a situation where everybody who was deserted before 23 June 1993 has to attend court to stop the legislation giving <Col N="29" /> the deserter a joint interest in the family home.  It is not practicable.  Secondly, we have serious doubts about the constitutionality of this amendment.  We must have a starting point somewhere, especially when ownership rights are being created.  This is not simply a question of a veto, as in the 1976 Act.  It is a question of ownership rights.  We cannot legislate on the basis of percentages.</P>

      <P>I want to make the last point on this issue.  The Minister deals with the legal right of a widow whose deceased husband decided to leave the house where she is living to a third party, such as another lady with whom he had commenced residence or some other party.  The Minister specifies that the widow is entitled to a legal right of one third and then proceeds to deal with the family law under the Judicial Separation Act.  In regard to this, the widow would have a one third right, but there is a grave danger then that the executor of the husband's will may move to have severance and may move to have the house sold or something of that nature.</P>

      <Col N="31" /> Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 4:</P>
    <P>In page 4, subsection (1), to delete lines 19 and 20.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Reference in this Act to an interest in a matrimonial home shall include a legal or beneficial interest in shares held in a company where the legal or beneficial interest in a property in which a married couple ordinarily reside is vested in such a company.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the majority of cases the family home is owned either by the husband or wife or is in their joint names.  The amendment which I propose is designed to ensure that either spouse does not get around the Act's objectives by engaging in legal mechanisms to do so.  The experience following the introduction of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976 showed how those who wished to do so devised legal mechanisms to attempt to get around the Act.  This amendment will ensure that a husband or a wife does not exclude the other by forming a company, with another person holding a minimum amount of shares.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will say that section 4(11) covers this situation.  I wish to clarify that the position outlined in my amendment is fully covered by section 4(11).</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

      <P>Provision is already made in the Bill to ensure that the benefit of joint ownership cannot be denied to a spouse by using the mechanism of transferring the matrimonial home to a company after 25 June this year, the date of the Bill's publication.  I understand that Senator Neville wants to simplify the anti-avoidance mechanism, but I am <Col N="32" /> advised that the situation he is trying to avoid is fully covered under section 4(11).</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask one question which I raised on Second Stage.  I stated clearly and unequivocally on that occasion that I fully support the principles of what we are attempting to do in ensuring that the spouse is legally protected. It is a mechanism whereby the property can become owned as a joint tenancy by the husband and wife.  I and most practitioners strongly recommend that properties be put in joint tenancy. Normally there is total consent and both parties are very favourably disposed towards it.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a point earlier about a woman deserting the family home, coming back and claiming rights many years later.  I am concerned about a situation where a husband and wife have joint tenancy.  The husband is living with another party or residing with his wife but is a heavy gambler or heavy drinker.  There is a family and the wife is seriously ill and knows that she will die. In that instance the wife will be concerned that since the property will become the sole property of her husband in the event of her death there is no protection whatsoever for the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody that is married has responsibilities towards their children.  I agree with the principle of the Bill but I do not know how that situation can be remedied or whether there could be a severance to try to protect the interests of the children.  It is a serious concern.  If <Col N="33" /> the father is a waster and decides to sell the property and spend the proceeds on drinking or gambling, there is a genuine problem.  I do not know how it can be resolved.  The Minister, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, in 1990 contacted the Law Reform Commission about this.  I was not aware of this until recently when I read a Law Reform Commission report. He foresaw this situation many years ago but it was only when I read the Bill that I realised the consequences.</P>
    <P>I accept that under section 6 there are some protection and safeguards, but they are insufficient.  A husband and wife have responsibility towards one another but they have great responsibility towards their children.  A good mother who is seriously ill, facing the prospect of passing into the next world, may be concerned that the home will be sold and the children will have nowhere to reside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the unfortunate spouse in such a situation could apply under section 5 of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976 to have the ownership of the house transferred into her name.  Is the Senator talking about a situation where the husband is the sole owner and is carrying on like this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>After the passing of this Act they will be joint tenants of a property. Perhaps one of the parties is totally irresponsible.  It is not simple to ground an application to court to safeguard it. There is a real danger that such a person, if left with sole rights to the property, might sell it and waste the assets.  That is the crux of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator is aware the child also has a right to apply under section 6 to disallow what has happened under section 4, even after the death of the other spouse.  That is in addition to section 5 of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976 which I will read for the purposes of the record:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where is appears to the court on the application of a spouse that the other spouse is engaging in such conduct as <Col N="34" /> may lead to the loss of any interest in the family home or may render it unsuitable for habitation as a family home with the intention of depriving the applicant spouse or a dependent child of the family of his residence in the family home, the court may make such order as it considers proper, directed to the other spouse or to any other person for the protection of the family home in the interest of the applicant spouse or of such child.</P>
    <P>I will have to clarify this with my advisers but my understanding is that in such a situation if any bank or anybody gets an order against the gambling spouse's interest in the family home that will effect a severance and the other spouse will hold as tenant in common.  In other words it will change from a joint tenancy to a tenancy in common.  The order will not have any effect on the innocent spouse's half share in the family home, as I understand it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not just a half share here.  Somebody owns all of what was a joint tenancy.  I refer to a problem that can and will arise where on the death of the one of the spouses the other spouse becomes the sole owner of the property and wishes to sell it.  The problem is that the children do not have proper protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The child can apply under section 6, even after the defaulting person's death, to have the provisions of section 4 disapplied, in other words to make it not a joint tenancy, as it were retrospectively.  I accept Senator Enright's point concerning people, especially those who are ill, calling in lawyers and going to court, but section 5 of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, allows them to do that.  Unfortunately, as Senator Enright, like myself, knows that everyone does not behave perfectly and we cannot legislate to make them do it.  I accept the point he is making; it is a genuine one.  We have gone as far as we can to resolve it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 (2) states:</P>
      <P>An application under subsection (1) by the personal representative, or by or on behalf of a child, of a deceased spouse shall not be made later than 9 months after the death of the spouse or 3 months after the grant of representation, whichever is the later.</P>
      <P>That is a short period of time.  Again, one is dealing with minors in most instances who will not be aware of their rights, and the immediate family on either side may not be anxious to involve themselves or to interfere.  This is a genuine problem and is the one concern I have with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a real problem in that we have seen many cases of battered wives, desertion and other unfortunate behaviour on the part of husbands in practically all of the cases where the wife is concerned.  If a wife is terminally ill, obviously she is not going to take her husband to court, regardless of what the behaviour is in the home.  I am interested to hear the Minister say that section 6 can be applied retrospectively.  In such circumstances, the ownership will revert to the sole ownership of the wife, who is deceased at that stage.  I am anxious to know how that would operate, how the children can benefit and the mechanism for the management or the ownership of the home if, as the Minister said, subsequent to the spouse's death, section 6 can apply retrospectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 6, if section 4 is disapplied following an application by a child, or behalf of a child, the ownership reverts solely to the name of the former spouse and that spouse will have been deemed to have died intestate as being the full owner of the house in question. The property will then be divided equally among the children.  That is the legal position there.  I take Senator Enright's point about the period of nine months being short.  There was a great deal of discussion about that matter in the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>What Senator Enright is referring to is only one side of the coin. There are genuine spouses as well and there may be an urgent reason why they may want to sell.  We cannot extend the limit indefinitely within which they cannot sell &mdash; a balance must be found. Many can argue that we have balanced it wrongly &mdash; too much on one side or the other; that is the problem when one tries to find a balance &mdash; but the reason there must be some limitation period is that we must bring some certainty to the matter, from the point of view of genuine spouses who need to sell as a matter of urgency and be able to convey a proper title to the property they are selling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to the report of the Law Reform Commission on land and conveyancing law. One section dealt with the conversion of a joint tenancy into a tenancy in common.</P>
      <P>Mr. Mervyn Taylor T.D, wrote to the then president of the commission in May 1990, suggesting that a joint tenant should be able to sever unilaterally a joint tenancy by giving notice that the property would henceforth be held under a tenancy in common.  His concern arose in cases where a husband and wife who held the family home as joint tenants have separated.  The husband had left home and the wife and children are residing in the home which is held on a joint tenancy.  If the wife dies first, her interest in the family home passes to the husband automatically, by way of survivorship and the position of the children may be undermined.  In such cases, it may be impossible to secure the husband's consent, during the wife's lifetime, to any severance of the tenancy and conversion into a tenancy in common, so as to give the children a vested interest in the property.</P>
      <P>The commission went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="37" /> This type of situation will hopefully be ameliorated by the implementation of the Government's proposed legislation providing for ownership of the family home.</P>
    <P>In fact, it has failed to grasp the point. The Minister should insert a provision in the Bill to safeguard the position of the children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the Law Reform Commission report to which Senator Enright is referring &mdash; it is gathering dust on my desk.  I am sorry now, in view of Senator Enright's intervention, that I have not yet read it.  It proposes major changes in the law relating to conveyancing and property ownership generally, as he will be aware.  I do not know if the final report is available &mdash; I suspect it is not &mdash; and what Senator Enright quoted from may have been the discussion report.  When the final report is available - obviously the commission was set up for a reason &mdash; the Government will be looking at its results and will be bringing in further legislation on the basis of the final recommendations.</P>

      <P>Amendment No.6; Amendment No. 11 is an alternative and both may be discussed together.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 45 and 46, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) a spouse in whose favour section 4 applies is convicted of the murder of the other spouse, and</P>
      <P>(b) immediately before the death of the other spouse, an interest in the matrimonial home was vested by virtue of section 4 in the spouse in whose favour section 4 applies,</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tabled the amendment especially to meet the point raised by Senator Neville's amendment No. 11. The question whether a spouse who murders his or her spouse, having benefited from the joint ownership conferred by this Bill, should continue to retain that ownership has already received extensive <Col N="39" /> debate in the Dáil.  Initially, the Minister took the view that the general law, in combination with the specific provisions of section 6, was sufficient to cater for the rare instance when this issue would arise.  However, in line with the flexible attitude the Minister has adopted in regard to worthwhile amendments, he has given further thought to this issue. On reflection, it seems to him that in the specific instance of murder, it would be appropriate to set aside the statutory joint tenancy and therefore I am going to accept the principle of Senator Neville's amendment.</P>
      <P>It has been necessary, however, to make specific, detailed provision for a number of matters, one of which is the revesting in the deceased spouse's estate of the share of the joint tenancy received by the murderer under section 4.  Because that was not provided for in his amendment, I ask Senator Neville to accept this amendment, which was brought in to meet his suggestion and the principle which underlaid his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking on board the content and spirit of this amendment.  It highlights difficulties which an Opposition has in framing amendments.  I am not a legal person and we do our best in this regard.  We do not have legal backup from Departments or otherwise and it would help the legislative process if we could bounce our views off somebody who would put them into proper legal terminology.  I mentioned a number of weeks ago that we should simplify the wording of legislation. This has been done in other countries, including Australia where legislation is framed in ordinary language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> This amendment would only apply in exceptional situations.  It also applies under the 1965 Act relating to inheritance. That Act includes exemptions for manslaughter and attempted murder.  Is there an anomaly in that a spouse convicted of manslaughter or attempted murder is deprived of their inheritance right under the 1965 Act, although this does not apply under this legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I take Senator Neville's point about Opposition spokesmen getting professional help from the Civil Service. This should be provided and I will convey the Senator's views to the appropriate quarter.  The 1965 Act gives the surviving spouse certain rights on intestacy, when one spouse dies without making a will.  When the deceased spouse has made a will it gives the spouse what is known as a legal right.  Section 120 of the 1965 Act automatically provides that in certain situations the surviving spouse is unable to avail of those rights, for example, where the deceased spouse has been murdered by the surviving spouse or where the surviving spouse is guilty of manslaughter or another crime carrying at least two years imprisonment.  Joint tenancy is excluded in the specific case of murder.  If the surviving children take an action under section 6 to have the joint tenancy disapplied retrospectively, they will succeed in cases such as manslaughter. In one case it is disapplied automatically and in the other it will certainly be disapplied by the court.</P>

      <P>This is a technical amendment. Under section 12 of the Land Act, 1965, the consent of the Land Commission is required where, among other matters, an agricultural holding is to be subdivided.  It is, therefore, desirable to include a reference to that section along with section 45 of that Act, which also relates to the vesting of certain interests in land and for which explicit provision is currently made.</P>
      <P>When the Bill was originally drafted, section 12 was forgotten, but it is now being included.  Section 12 states the consent of the Land Commission must be obtained for the subdivision of certain agricultural holdings.  I presume the parliamentary draftsman had in mind that the transfer, the division of the family home might, in certain instances, constitute the subdivision of an agricultural holding because it includes surrounding land.  We are providing that the permission of the Land Commission does not have to be obtained in such a situation.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 11, lines 32 to 48, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the subsection:</P>
      <P>(1) Where an interest in a matrimonial home has vested in both spouses by virtue of <i>section 4</i>&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) in the case of registered land, if one only of the spouses is registered in a register maintained under the Act of 1964 as owner of the interest, both spouses or (in case the spouse so registered has died) the surviving spouse shall be entitled, on application in the prescribed form by either of the spouses or by the surviving spouse, to be registered as owners or owner thereof, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) in the case of unregistered land, if one only of the spouses appears from a deed or deeds registered in the Registry of Deeds or otherwise to be the sole owner of the interest, a declaration in writing that the interest has so vested may be made by either of the spouses or, as the case may be, by the surviving spouse and a copy of the declaration certified by that spouse to be a true copy, may be registered in that Registry, and, upon such registration, any legal interest in the home vested, or becoming vested, in the spouse who is so registered or who appears from the deed or deeds to be such owner shall, subject and without prejudice to the rights of an <Col N="43" /> other person, vest in both spouses as joint tenants or, as the case may be, in the surviving spouse.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are technical in character and relate mainly to the Land Registry.  Two matters are provided for.  It is now being made plain that where one spouse is registered as sole owner of land which includes a matrimonial home, the other spouse has a clear entitlement to apply in their own right to be registered as co-owner of that home. Ideally, this registration should take place during the lifetime of both spouses, but where the owning spouse has died without such registration having taken place, the surviving spouse will still be entitled to apply for registration.</P>
      <P>To facilitate registration by a surviving spouse, the provision in the Registration of Title Act, 1964, whereby the registrar of title is compelled to recognise the personal representative alone as having any rights in respect of the land of the deceased is being set a side in the specific instance of the matrimonial home.  In addition, no assent by the personal representative will be necessary to vest the outstanding legal interest in the surviving spouse.  The assent is the means by which the actual transfer of the assets of the deceased to the persons entitled under the will or intestacy is usually carried out. Any legal interest of the deceased in the matrimonial home will remain with the personal representative until it vests in the surviving spouse on registration.  The personal representative is precluded from executing any assent in relation to that specific interest or from transferring it to any other person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is a technical one because the equitable interest, the real beneficial interest of the deceased in the home has already passed to the surviving spouse by survivorship and any legal interest remaining is of a nominal character only.  Provision is also being made to cater for a situation where the surviving spouse may have died before he or she had time to register their ownership interest.  In that case, the personal representatives <Col N="44" /> are given the right to do it on their behalf.</P>

    <P>(b) If the surviving spouse has died without the legal interest in the matrimonial home concerned having vested in that spouse pursuant to subsection (1), that subsection shall apply to the personal representative of the surviving spouse as it applies to that spouse and, accordingly, upon compliance by that personal representative with that subsection, that interest shall, subject and without prejudice to the rights of any other person, vest in that personal representative for the purposes of the administration of that spouse's estate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Dáil on Report Stage the Minister introduced an amendment to ensure that a judgment mortgage could not be registered in respect of debts incurred prior to a section 4 vesting.  This amendment is somewhat analogous. Under the Bill as now drafted, if a benefiting spouse is bankrupt at the time the section 4 interest would have vested, the joint ownership provisions of the Bill will not apply.  However, where a benefiting spouse is adjudged to be bankrupt after that interest is vested in respect of debts which arose prior to that vesting, his or <Col N="47" /> her share in the matrimonial home would be available for distribution by the official assignee in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, 1988.  This amendment is designed to prevent this happening since clearly, in respect of debts incurred prior to the section 4 vesting, any such distribution by the official assignee would be unjust and unfair.  I imagine that this will meet with approval from Senators on all sides.  We are, in effect, protecting the interest of the spouse who becomes bankrupt provided the debts in respect of which he or she became bankrupt arose prior to the vesting.</P>

      <P>We are referring to an annulment as well as a marriage.  In the context of an annulment it is not appropriate to refer to a marriage that no longer subsists.  That is the effect of the text.  We would be referring to an annulment as meaning a marriage which no longer subsists.  The legal implications of an annulment are that the marriage never existed in the first place, so we are just changing around the wording to recognise legal reality.</P>

      <P>If one had a situation where section 4 applied after a marriage, which in fact was registered in the land registry, and there was a subsequent annulment, would that render the registration of the joint ownership void?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is that it would effect what they call in legal circles a <i>restituo in integrum</i>.  It would go back to <Col N="48" /> the beginning because the home would not have been a matrimonial home, for example, because a married couple would not have been living in the home. The marriage never existed so it does completely invalidate the effect of section 4.  Section 4 will be deemed never to have applied.  That is my interpretation of it anyway.</P>

So, obviously, out of those 27 applications there were reports available setting up precedents to be followed by the other courts.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>(12) A spouse may sever his or her joint tenancy and opt for a tenancy in common provided that a court of competent jurisdiction is satisfied that the other spouse is likely to dissipate the assets to the detriment of the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious that in such an instance, the spouse who has concerns or worries would be able to sever the joint tenancy and perhaps establish a tenancy in <Col N="53" /> common which will give an actual tenancy. This would be an exclusion because I presume that up to 90 per cent of people would be in favour of that and this Bill is making it 100 per cent.  However, this is an exception where I feel it is essential to have some sort of safeguard.  In this instance, perhaps one of the spouses is concerned that in the event of their death the other party will waste the assets to the detriment of the children.  The survivor can opt to sell the property on the death of their spouse or in the event of the survivor remarrying, the property will vest in him or her solely.  It will become a new joint tenancy.  We want to introduce this exemption in order to prevent a situation arising where children will be affected.  I hope the Minister will consider this amendment.  The Minister will say that under a joint tenancy this amendment will not change the existing law to any great extent.  However, existing law is unsatisfactory with regard to safeguarding the rights of children.  Under the new legislation the situation will remain the same.  I hope this amendment will benefit and safeguard the rights of children.  A husband and wife have their own rights and responsibilities.  A spouse whose husband is drinking, gambling or wasting money might be worried about safeguarding their children's rights.  That is the reason I move this amendment.</P>

He suggested that a joint tenant should be able, unilaterally, to sever a joint tenancy by giving notice that the property would be henceforth held under tenancy in common.  We are giving expression to this and we are outlining the circumstances which should be included in such proposals. A court of competent jurisdiction should decide if the spouse can opt for the tenancy in common.  This was discussed on Committee Stage and Senator Enright outlined in detail the situations which could arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> We should cater for children who may be left destitute and without accommodation as a result of a reckless spouse who may dissipate the family assets for selfish reasons.  A spouse who is terminally ill, perhaps, would be concerned about this, particularly if there is a possibility that the surviving spouse would sell the family home and waste the assets. In view of the many amendments which have been accepted and proposed by the Minister during the course of this Bill, this amendment would complete the legislation.</P>

      <P>I want to correct Senator Neville on a point he made.  It is unfair to say that the Minister, Deputy Taylor, suggested that this change should be made in the context of this Bill.  He made his suggestion in a recommendation to the Law Reform Commission at a time when this Bill was not mooted and this change had not been spoken about.</P>
      <P>From the discussions before the break I thought that what Senator Enright and Senator Neville had in mind was a situation where either spouse could, by declaration or unilaterally, sever the joint tenancy.  However, this would be impractical as it would undermine the basis of the Bill and it would enable either spouse unilaterally to destroy the right of survivorship. I am glad they have now raised the question of a court of competent jurisdiction.  They are saying that if one spouse is dissipating or likely to dissipate the family assets, including the matrimonial home, the other spouse can apply to court to sever the joint tenancy created by the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sympathetic to the thinking behind the amendment, but the Senators must appreciate that we have a short time to consider this.  It has many implications and we do not have time to show it to the parliamentary draftsman or to consult the Attorney General.  Perhaps my interpretation of the discussion before the break is wrong, but it seems to me we have shifted ground.  In view of this move and the fact we are talking about a court, the situation which this amendment seeks <Col N="55" /> to address is already fully covered by existing law.</P>
    <P>In the case of a matrimonial home, if the husband was the original owner and then became joint tenant with his wife under section 4, and if he proceeded to behave so recklessly that the home was in danger, his wife could go to a court of competent jurisdiction, which is the same as the court mentioned in the amendment. Under section 5 of the 1976 Act his wife could go to court and have the full ownership or less than the full ownership of the house transferred to her.</P>
    <P>The existing law is stronger than the change proposed in the amendment because under the amendment the innocent spouse can go to court to sever a joint tenancy.  This means they will be tenants in common in equal shares.  The most the wife can get is half the house. Under section 5 the court has discretion to transfer to her the entire house or a lesser part, if the court sees fit in the circumstances, to do so.  If the husband was the benefiting spouse, that is if he acquired the joint interest only by virtue of section 4 &mdash; that is where the wife is the original owner &mdash; his wife would have an additional opportunity to get redress as she could proceed under section 6 and have section 4 disapplied.</P>
    <P>In so far as the amendment will affect the general law governing joint tenancies, it would be necessary to study its full implications.  This is not possible in the short time span available.  If it is proposed to change the law along the lines suggested in the submission to the Law Reform Commission, the appropriate place to do that would be in the legislation which would result from the final recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>I am sympathetic to the thinking behind the amendment, but I cannot accept it for two reasons.  First, the possible implications which could arise as a result of the short period of time we have had to consider it, the lack of consultation with the Attorney General, which is a norm with any legislation, and the lack of consultation with the parliamentary <Col N="56" /> draftsman.  Secondly, now that we are talking about applying to a court, the existing law is stronger in many ways than the law which would result from this proposed amendment.  Although I sympathise with the Senators' views, I cannot accept the amendment at present.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with this amendment, but I understand the Minister's explanation.  The spouse who is worried about the other spouse disposing of the home, the children's protection, would have to take legal action.  I understand what the Minister is saying.  Senator Enright and Senator Neville have highlighted a valid point because this type of situation could occur.</P>

      <P>The points made by the present Minister, Deputy Taylor, in 1990 were made in good faith and I accept he has done everything in good faith.  I commend him and the Minister of State on the Bill.  I tabled this amendment in the same spirit because I am concerned about the rights of children in many of these cases.  The Minister of State knows the type of situations where people are unable to manage their own businesses as a result of carelessness, recklessness, etc.  As a result, the wife will be concerned about what will happen if she dies. We tabled this amendment in order to provide an additional safeguard.  I thought the Minister would have been able to accept this amendment.  I appreciate his difficulties as we are in the final Stages of this Bill and it must be returned to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>We may be able to include this amendment in future legislation.  It is a matter to which I would ask the Minister to give full, detailed consideration because most husbands and wives would be anxious that the rights of their children be safeguarded in the event of a death when the family home could be sold or alternatively, in the event of a remarriage, where the children of the first marriage could be the losers.</P>

I thought the amendment they were proposing would give an automatic right to the children and that they would not have to go to court.  The Minister's explanation has clarified that matter for me.  I understand, as Senator Henry said, that in either case they must go to court. I thought the amendment would give an automatic right and therefore I was supporting it.  Obviously it will not and I accept what the Minister has said.  The Senators' intention, the conferral of additional safeguards on the children, would have my support.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Taylor and indeed Deputy O'Dea for introducing this Bill.  We have been asking for it since December 1991 when the Supreme Court changed what we then thought was the situation.  It is progressive legislation.  We require similar and other legislation before a divorce referendum because we cannot be sure that the referendum will go through regardless of the present indications.  We must try to ensure that everything is covered so as to assist the easy passage of the referendum.</P>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said on Committee Stage.  He did not get enough time to fully consider our amendment and to refer it to his Department and there is a lesson in that.  We should not be running the different stages together. The purpose of having stages is to allow reflection and consultation on issues that arise in the previous stage.  I again wish to congratulate and thank the Government for bringing this Bill forward.</P>

      <P>I very much support this Bill and welcome it.  It fulfils one of the <Col N="58" /> most important recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and it gives real emphasis to the value of the work of women in the home. I, as one of the ordinary women of Ireland and having no legal training, understand it to mean that those women living with their husbands in their homes on and up to 25 June 1993 would have a legal right to half the matrimonial home whether or not it is in their joint names and, on the death of their spouse, a legal right to the whole home.  They are advised to take legal steps to have this registered.  Although it is not essential the fees will be nominal.  If they were separated before 25 June 1993 I believe that any legal arrangements they have made regarding their matrimonial home and other affairs still stand and indeed if they have not made legal arrangements they are in a position to proceed to make legal arrangements.  I am delighted to see the Minister nodding; I have obviously got it quite clear.  If they have not made legal arrangements.  The worst that can happen is that on the death of their spouse, they will only get a third of his estate, which may only be the matrimonial home, rather than owning 50 per cent already.  They will then in fact only lose one sixth of the family home.  The Minister is still nodding.  I gather that is the main substance of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I say this because reading Bills such as this is incredibly difficult and I would like to be sure that this is what I have been party to passing.  I know many women will be anxious to know what it actually means and the language is quite difficult to understand.  I am delighted that this Bill has not been taken solely in relation to divorce and that it is standing on its own.  It enhances marriage and the situation for women in this country.  I hope the Government will go further with other recommendations regarding community of property for example, access to knowledge of the income and assets of the other spouse and a right to half the income of the family.</P>

      <P>I join with the other speakers in congratulating the Minister, <Col N="59" /> Deputy Taylor, for the initiative he has shown in bringing this complex legislation before the House.  In many ways it is a watershed in terms of equal rights for people and a recognition that those rights need to be enshrined in law.  The establishment of a Department of Equality and Law Reform has welcome ramifications and implications for men, women and children throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on the way he has tried to meet the very good case in the submissions of Senator Enright and Senator Neville.  In many ways those submissions were a model of how people should act if they wish to amend Bills.  They were argued very cogently and the response by the Minister was in layman's language.</P>
      <P>When one sees people, particularly lawyers, having a debate amongst themselves, a layperson might just as well be on Mars or some other planet because it is usually very specialised.  However, in the case of Senator Enright and Deputy O'Dea who are both lawyers, it was intelligible to the layperson and this is to be welcomed.  I hope that other speakers in this House take a leaf from that book. Our own spokesperson, Senator Gallagher, is a member of that profession. As a layperson, I am glad to see that I was in the Seanad and not in the Four Courts.  I congratulate the Minister once again.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister.  He was quite open in accepting amendments right through. It is a small step on the road to equality as it now provides spouses who had no ownership up to now with joint ownership rights in the family home.  This will particularly benefit women and particularly women in the home.  The vast majority of Irish women are working fulltime in the home.  On their behalf, I greatly welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also support what Senator Henry has said.  Now that we have completed this Matrimonial Home Bill, we should move on to the community of property.  I think the Minister when summing up in the <Col N="60" /> other House said this was something at which we could aim.  We already have community property in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act and there is compulsory sharing of assets on death.  These should not be the only two areas.  When people are in a marriage situation, there should be joint ownership of all assets and income.  I again congratulate the Minister and hope he will take this further step.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for a very constructive debate.  There have been many amendments to this Bill since it was first published but that is only to be expected because we are breaking new ground.  I am glad to announce to the House this evening that this legislation, which is now on the Statute Book, puts us ahead of other common law jurisdictions in this field.  That is saying something in view of the fact that our record in law reform over many years was somewhat less than other common law jurisdictions. We have now moved ahead of them in a particular field and I think the Minister is to be complimented for that.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators and indeed Deputies for the expertise and practical common sense which they have brought to bear on this subject.  We have taken on board suggestions from people who had no training in the legal field and I hope that is a portent of things to come.</P>
      <P>I want to make one final point.  The explanatory memorandum of the Bill has not yet been updated to take account of all the amendments.  I will ensure that is done immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Education to recognise and make provision for the special educational needs of children with autism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my pleasure to move this motion in the name of my party colleagues.  I am <Col N="61" /> sad that there is an amendment down because while one would not wish to stymie debate in this Chamber, I do not think the issue is politically contentious. It is an issue of how we care about people who have difficulties.</P>
    <P>Autism is a lifelong disability which devastates the lives of hundreds of children and adults in this country. Children with autism have severe impairments in the development of communication, social awareness and behaviour.  The consequence is a child who has great difficulty understanding the world, which can become a frightening place, full of incomprehensible sounds, sensations and activities, a truly frightening world in which to live.</P>
    <P>Although autism is frequently associated with a degree of mental handicap, children with autism may be of normal intelligence but will never be able to appreciate the good things in life such as friendship, real communication or social contact.  As yet there is no cure for autism but children with autism respond, often very dramatically, to specialised education suited to their needs.  It is now internationally recognised that full, classic autism affects an estimated four in 10,000 of the population but up to 20 in 10,000 exhibit so many of the symptoms that they are usually included within what is known as the autistic continuum.</P>
    <P>On that basis, one can argue that there are between 300 and 1,500 children between the ages of four and 18 years with autism in this country.  A small number of these children will enjoy appropriate education in specialised environments suited to their needs. Sadly, the vast majority of children with autism will end up in unsuitable situations and, more often than not, they will be misplaced as adults in totally unsuitable long-stay psychiatric or large mental handicap institutions and hospitals.  This is a tragedy for them.  It is a tragedy for their families and it is a tragedy for this country.</P>
    <P>Government policy states specifically that the individuality of each mentally handicapped person must be recognised <Col N="62" /> and that care must be related to specific need.  This being so, it is imperative that the Department of Education should fully recognise, without question, the individuality of persons with autism and draw up programmes to cater for their specific needs.  Since the educational and training needs of the person with autism is multi-disciplined, both the Department of Education and the Department of Health must co-operate closely and use their respective expertise to alleviate the plight of all persons with autism.</P>
    <P>In this context, it is worth recalling that in 1980 the White Paper on education development identified the need to enable children in special education to continue their schooling at second level. They were noble sentiments but the situation on the ground is less than admirable. At present it would appear that the Department of Education provides no national guidelines for the education of children with autism.  Some voluntary programmes, enthusiastically drawn up, exist but because of the non-involvement of the Department of Education with its fund of teaching expertise, these programmes lack the professional input which the Department inspectorate could contribute.</P>
    <P>The education and training of the child with autism must take place in four areas: first, the home; secondly, the school; thirdly, the residential home and, finally, in the community.  The care of the child with autism must be multi-disciplinary. The education and training needs of the child require at all stages special skills from the personnel involved; not only special skills but also particular dedication. Since the education and training of many of these children is on a 24-hour a day basis involving the home, the school and the residential centre, the normal school management structures clearly do not apply.  As a consistent school programme is vital throughout the years these children must not be discharged for the two or three months of the summer nor must their education and training be interrupted for the usual Christmas or Easter breaks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> It is very important that children be integrated into the family structure so that social behaviour at each stage of their development will be as normal as possible.  If this policy is followed, difficulties in acquiring acceptable social behaviour at a later stage will be averted. There is a considerable financial benefit to the State in investing in training at this stage to avert the problems later.</P>
    <P>This all points to the need for co-operation between the professionals, particularly the professionals in the Department of Education, and the family.  It points in particular to a need for the Department of Education to appoint visiting specialist teachers from a special education section to focus on children with autism.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of schools, I cannot avoid reference to the special school which operates in James Connolly House at Blanchardstown.  My colleague, Senator McGennis, wishes to refer to that.  I suggest to the Minister &mdash; and it was suggested to the Minister in the Dáil recently &mdash; that urgent attention is required there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>As the right to education is enshrined in Article 42 in Bunreacht na hÉireann and also in Article 2 of the United Nations declaration on the rights of the mentally handicapped, I respectfully request the Minister for Education to consider the following recommendations which have been proposed by the Irish Society for Autism with a view to implementing them in the interest of all children with autism requiring the specialised expertise of the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> The first point suggested by the society is that the Department should give official recognition to autism as an affliction suffered by a specific group of children omitted from the categories of handicap in the report of the primary education review body of 1990.  Secondly, the society suggests that we should ensure that individual education programmes are drawn up to cater for the specific needs of children with autism.  Thirdly, the Department should ensure that the individuality of each child with autism is recognised and that they receive education in a stress free environment where well thought through stimulation will be readily available and progress made, recorded and evaluated and, in particular, evaluated by the inspectorate of the Department.  Fourthly, the Department of Education should provide a comprehensive service which would be responsible for the special needs of the autistic child but which should also provide a follow-up service beyond 18 years of age.  It is an established fact that the capacity of a person with autism will still be developing at that age and it is very important that such young adolescents be exposed to continuing learning experiences of an appropriate kind.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education should ensure that special education and training of children with autism will result in their learning first, expressive skills &mdash; communication and receptive &mdash; secondly, leisure skills &mdash; the skills of normal play activities, interaction with other children and adults, participation in simple games &mdash; thirdly, self-sufficiency and independent skills, to prepare these children for a meaningful existence in their adult life; fourthly, social skills which will enable them to share in the good things of life that we all take so much for granted and to encourage interaction with others.</P>
    <P>The Department has also been requested to acknowledge that there should be no justification for excluding the person with autism from access to the accumulated expertise of the teaching profession.  Special teachers catering for the special needs of children with autism <Col N="65" /> should be employed and supervised by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>The next point put forward in the programme by the society is that psychologists employed by the Department of Education and engaged in programme planning have also built up a considerable fund of expertise.  Perhaps this fund of expertise could and should be used in in-service training for teachers.</P>
    <P>The society suggests that the Department should ensure that all teachers taking the special education course should be acquainted with the methodology as well as the theory and practice of teaching the child with autism.</P>
    <P>The next suggestion the society makes is that planning ahead can only be haphazard without in-depth research.  The society has put forward the reasonable proposition that schools of medicine attached to our universities must be encouraged and assisted to become involved in research into this condition.</P>
    <P>Finally, the society suggests that, since the special needs of the child with autism requires the multidisciplined skills of the Department of Education and of the Department of Health, both Departments should accept joint responsibility for their respective inputs and that those inputs should be forthcoming without any limitation.</P>
    <P>Autism has been described as one of the most bewildering, devastating, heartbreaking and puzzling disorders known to man.  Whatever its cause it is a cruel condition for the autistic person.  It is a nightmare for the family.  The Irish Society for Autism was founded in 1963 and is one of the oldest in the field in Europe.  It has achieved a huge amount through purely voluntary effort.  At its community farm project in Drumfirth it provides for the care and development of young people with autism.  I recently visited that farm and I was moved beyond expression by the care, love and attention evident there.</P>
    <P>In partnership with the Eastern Health Board and through the Gheel training group the society provides services and training, four residential homes, a day care centre and a therapeutic workshop. <Col N="66" /> It is a founder member of the international association, Autism-Europe.  I put these points before the House simply to prove the bona fides of the society, its acceptability, and that the society has 30 years of experience in this field.  The society is now in its thirtieth year and it has succeeded in getting the Department of Health to recognise autism as a specific syndrome since 1983.  It is now time, ten years later, for the Department of Education to do likewise.  I put to the Minister of State &mdash; I know he is a compassionate person and will carry the message from this House to the Minister for Education-that every other developed state in the world has now taken this step and I cannot understand why our Department of Education should be out of step as there is only a small point of difference.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister of State handled questions on this issue on the Adjournment in the other House.  I read the Minister of State's reply with great interest this morning and at first it raised my spirits but when I read deeper into the response I was disappointed.  On the final issue of recognition the Department has not moved enough.  I will listen carefully to the Minister of State's response here tonight and I know he will do what he can.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Fine Gael amendment, I know it was put forward in the sincerest way but it is a mistake.  This issue should not be confused with other issues, which would happen if we were to accept the amendment.  I commend this motion to Senators and I hope it will have their support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me pleasure to second this motion as it deals with a serious problem.  We must do everything possible to ensure that children with this or any other handicap get the best in training and education and whatever services can be made available.  I am heartened because when I first joined the health board 20 years ago there were only mental hospitals available for disabled and mentally handicapped children and that was sad.  I took a positive stand in 1982, the year of the disabled, and I <Col N="67" /> drove a pony and trap from Bundoran to Ballsbridge to highlight and increase awareness of the need to do more for handicapped children.  I am glad that since then quite a lot has been done.</P>
      <P>Autism is a relatively rare but complex disability.  It is estimated that one child in every thousand will develop autism and that approximately three quarters of all autistic children and adults also have a mental handicap.  Diagnosis is not always easy as there may be other disabilities and childhood may present them in quite similar ways.  Diagnosis can only be made when a particular pattern of behaviour is evident and the symptoms include language impairment, impairment of social relationships, inflexibility and rigidity.</P>
      <P>The experience is that all of these symptoms are usually evident by the age of two and a half to three years.  It also occurs in conjunction with other disorders and most frequently with a mental handicap.  When I was researching this I was amazed to discover that it affects three or four times more boys than girls. Some autistic people seem to have exceptional talents such as musical, numerical or memory skills.  It is estimated that up to 80 per cent of all autistic people will require support and supervision throughout their lives.</P>
      <P>While it is important to provide education etc., we must also make other provision for people with autism.  Education is only a step on that ladder and we must continue it.  I know that there is considerable interest in the service provision in my own health board area. While the numbers are small in our region there would be 20 children in the north-west who would be considered to be primarily autistic and who have varying levels of mental handicap secondary to their autistic condition.  As has been the case elsewhere it has been found more difficult to define autism in adults.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up until recently the majority of children with significant autistic features were referred from my health board area, the north-west, usually to St. Paul's or Beaumont Hospital for diagnosis.  This external service will now be supported in <Col N="68" /> the region following the appointment of a consultant child psychiatrist for the north-west.  This is important and every health board should have sufficient child psychiatrists to assess those children at as early an age as possible.  As we all know, to detect and confirm what is wrong with somebody is half way to solving the problem. It is important that we have more of those professionals.  It also requires co-ordinating a range of services including paediatric services, child psychiatric consultant services, psychology services, speech and language services, counsellors, social workers and nursing services.</P>
    <P>During the summer of 1993 an informal meeting took place in my health board between parents and professionals to discuss the possibility of setting up a branch of PAPA (Parents and Professionals Autism) a voluntary support group and there has been a follow up meeting in recent weeks.  The support group is now making good headway.  In April 1993 the North-Western Health Board took its own initiative with regard to in-service training in autism and a range of professionals working in the area attended a two day course on the treatment and education of autistic and related communications-handicapped children.</P>
    <P>The first thing we must do is educate more people on how to treat autism.  That seminar was very valuable.  Good professionals spoke at it and more health boards should have such seminars and get in professionals who know their job and who can talk with the parents and the professionals dealing with autism.  In that way we would really be making progress. Speech therapy is one of the first things we should consider.  If we can improve the speech and the ability to relate to speech then we will be taking a step toward further education.  Whatever we spend, I appeal to the Government to make it a priority to ensure that those children get a first class service.  The numbers involved are small &mdash; one in every 1,000.  There are only 20 in the north west.  The only way of ensuring this is by doing what our health board is undertaking, namely co-ordinating all the services <Col N="69" /> that are necessary, to come up with a system that will be effective in ensuring that the child will be better equipped to meet the world at the appropriate time despite its disability.</P>
    <P>Much can be done and I welcome the motion.  It gives me great pleasure to second it.  The booklet <i>Parents and Professionals and Autism</i> outlines the characteristics of the child with autism as follows:</P>
    <P>Autism isolates.  Alone, even with others.  Unusual play.  Twiddles and twirls with objects.  Indifferent to other people.  Strange movements and mannerisms. Most have severe learning difficulties.</P>
    <P>Learning difficulties for children who are fully fit can be severe, but for autistic children they are much more severe and they need extra care and attention.  It has been proved that where such children receive this attention they do learn.</P>
    <P>The booklet continues:</P>
    <P>Speech impaired or absent.  We should have more speech therapists to help such children.  Obsessive routines and attitudes.  Lack of normal eye contact. Anxious and distressed by change.  Tantrums and destructive behaviour.  Echo words in a meaningless way.  Sometimes possesses a special talent.</P>
    <P>That last feature is a key point, perhaps the most important point to emerge from my reading on the subject.  It is important that so many of them have this special talent, for figures, for words or for music. We should ensure that the special talent they have is exploited to the full.  That is why we must give 100 per cent support to this motion and ensure that those facilities are provided.</P>
    <P>In my own health board area I believe that we are doing a good job.  We have only 20 autistic children but we intend to keep working on it and we will have some more seminars.  Such seminars are very professional.  We had prominent speakers at the recent one day seminar, including Miss Heather Crawford, a speech and language therapist, Miss Kate Doherty, <Col N="70" /> a support teacher and many others.  It is important that people like these be involved.  Not alone must we educate the children, we must educate ourselves on how to pass on that information and make it relevant to the child.  That can only be done by more services and therefore it gives me great pleasure to second the motion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;deplores the failure of the Minister for Education to honour specific commitments given to the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland, that £25 million would be provided in 1993 to support and develop services for the mentally handicapped including autistic children of which only £8 million has been provided to date.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senator Roche claimed that this amendment would not be very useful to the discussion in the House today, but I believe that it provides an interesting background to the discussion.</P>
      <P>I compliment Senator Roche and Senator Farrell on the excellent introduction to the debate.  I hope this debate will be the beginning of something rather than merely another few thousand words with nothing to show for them at the end of the day.</P>
      <P>During the course of the last election, Barry Desmond, who was then the director of elections for the Labour Party, saw fit to write a letter in unequivocal terms making a clear positive commitment.  He stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of mental handicap there is a recognised crisis for the 25,000 people with such a handicap.  That crisis may relate to education, training, employment or residential care &mdash; depending on family and individual circumstances. Among the detailed proposals in Labour's programme is the provision of £25 million next year to catch up on the &ldquo;Needs and Abilities&rdquo;<Col N="71" /> report prepared by the last administration and effectively shelved.</P>
    <P>That letter was sent out on 18 November, 1992 obviously for the purpose of gathering a few votes together.  Can one imagine the ethos of the party that would do that to the most deprived group of people in the country, trying to gather together a few votes from the parents, the families and the carers of the mentally handicapped and autistic children?  It was quite incredible and diabolical that this should have been done.  The Labour Party has done far too much of that.  They went out to the hangar in Aer Lingus also.  The chickens are coming home to roost on a Boeing 707 and they do not have to stop at Shannon.  What has happened in the last 12 months is quite incredible and the Labour Party is reaping its just rewards.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with this matter yesterday in the Dáil in answer to a question by Deputy Callely.  I assume that the content of the Minister's speech today will be somewhat similar.  He gave a good diagnosis of the difficulties involved with autism.  There are matters which the Minister spoke of yesterday with which we would have to disagree.</P>
    <P>We can imagine the difficulties parents face when they realise that one of their children is autistic.  My information is that a child for perhaps six to 12 months can appear to be normal and then suddenly there can be regression and the child at that stage can be confirmed to be autistic. One can imagine the pain and suffering of parents when they discover that awful fact in the initial stages.  Parents need support and we in this House would have to agree that the State is not good at offering that kind of support.  We must accept that and work from there.  The support services that are offered are entirely inadequate and misdirected.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed the Dáil yesterday in his analysis that depending on individual circumstances, educational provision can be made.  He went on to give four instances.  First, the child can be sent to an ordinary national school <Col N="72" /> with the support of a remedial or resource teacher.  The second option is to attend a special class at an ordinary national school.  Third, they could attend a special school for the mentally handicapped.  The last alternative was to send an autistic child to a special school for children with emotional and/or behavioural disorders.</P>
    <P>The fourth option is entirely unacceptable to people with autistic children and also to the Irish Society for Autism. Ireland is the only country in the developed world still accepting the notion that autistic children can be cared for in that type of environment.  I ask the Minister to examine this issue with his officials and decide that is not an appropriate way to deal with autistic children. Perhaps he will indicate this evening he has changed his mind.</P>
    <P>The Department is only now coming to terms with this matter.  As a result of the commitment made last year the Minister for Education may straighten her thinking before this year is out and the Minister of State and herself will start to provide adequate services from next year.</P>
    <P>There is not a great level of awareness of this problem.  If a survey was carried out it would be found the number of people who understand or who have come in contact with autism would be relatively small, because the number of children suffering from it is also small. Autism comes in varying degrees and depending on the definition used the figure for sufferers is between 300 and 1,400.  The population of autistic children is scattered, which makes it more difficult to deal with the problem.  That does not mean we cannot tackle it.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said last night there are various ways of handling the issue. The first three options he mentioned are quite acceptable but standing on their own they are useless.  What is the point in sending an autistic child to an ordinary national school even if it has a remedial teacher if that teacher knows nothing of autism?  It is impossible for the teacher to cope and impossible for the child to benefit from that.  Sadly it happens all over Ireland.  The vast majority of <Col N="73" /> remedial teachers know nothing of autism.  They do not understand it or know how to deal with it.</P>
    <P>A number of steps need to be taken. One would be to ensure every autistic child, no matter where they are placed, will have the services of a teacher who understands and is able to deal with the difficulties they have.  The autistic population in Ireland is suffering enormously as a result of the lack of services provided. Many end up unable to cope in circumstances where they should be able to, because of poor support.  The years of frustration they suffer means their behavioural problems are enormous and some who normally would be able to work in rehabilitation clinics and similar places cannot do so because of their ill-treatment.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine the issue and decide autistic children have no place in schools for children with emotional and behavioural disorders.  That should be settled tonight and be the basis of future development.  Since Dublin has one third of the population of the country there is a greater concentration of autistic children here and that is true to a lesser degree in the other cities.  A special centre should be developed in Dublin.  It would have enormous advantages because research could be undertaken there also.  A centre for about 20 autistic children would be most beneficial and a good start.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should speak to the Minister for Education with a view to making the £25 million available next year to set up centres for autistic children which are appropriate to their needs.</P>

      <P>This debate is obviously to embarrass the junior partners in Government when one sees the words of the Motion: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Education to recognise and make provision for the special educational needs of children with autism&rdquo;. It is proper that Fianna Fáil cannot fully embarrass its junior partners, so Senator Cotter has put down the amendment. There is a lack of funding for this purpose and for autistic and mentally handicapped children.  The Senator is right to say Mr. Barry Desmond, the former Labour MEP, announced before the last General Election that Labour would provide £25 million towards alleviating some of these problems.  A mere £8 million has been provided.</P>
      <P>I come from County Mayo, the third largest county.  It is part of the Western Health Board along with County Galway, the second largest county, and County Roscommon, which is also large. Autism is a huge problem in County Mayo alone.  Proper facilities for the county would require substantial funding. The Minister should consider setting up a school in the western region for this purpose.</P>
      <P>These people feel they are forgotten, especially so at present.  Just over 12 months ago, a matter of days before the election, Mr. Desmond made the famous announcement about the £25 million to the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland.  There were no &ldquo;if&rdquo;s, &ldquo;but&rdquo;s or &ldquo;maybe&rdquo;s.  There would be no backing away from the commitment because of financial constraints. That was made clear in the statement. Labour was going to put mental handicap services on a proper footing for once and for all.  The mental handicap association and parents and friends of the mentally handicapped believed the Labour Party. What happened was that only £8 million was given, unevenly distributed around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do we realise the trauma and pressure associated with the handling of people with mental disabilities at a time of inadequate finance?  Many such parents are prisoners in their homes because of the <Col N="75" /> lack of services and the need for constant, 24-hour vigilance.  This is particularly so with autistic children, whose crisis relief is to be severely curtailed or drastically altered to give them a crisis relief service in theory but one totally unsuited to the personal needs of the autistic sufferer. Parents are begging for the most basic facilities for their children.  Is it right that these parents should have to scrounge and beg on the doorsteps of their communities for voluntary contributions in order to try and scrape together the semblance of a service?  Is it right that these people should have been told in the second week of November last year by the Labour Party that it would give £25 million in 1993 only to be told a mere few weeks later that it was to cut back on that by £17 million?</P>
    <P>All they want is a service adequate to cater for the people's needs.  I believe that the money can be found to give them the service they require if the political will is there, but I am not sure that it is there.  I compliment the Fianna Fáil Members here this evening for putting down this motion.  Senator Cotter has no option but to go the whole way in putting forward this amendment and I compliment him.

      <P>I come from a county that takes pride in the provisions that exist for many of our handicapped.  We take pride in the fact that people from all over Europe and the world have learned from those provisions, particularly since the late fifties regarding the Hope organisation and the Rehab centres in our county.  We are very proud of that but of course we are not proud that, unfortunately, we have so many handicapped and sick people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I seldom try to embarrass or question <Col N="76" /> any person in Government if I felt they were doing any good.  If moneys were being allocated I would welcome that.  I welcome this discussion on this issue.  I am very conscious of it because I have a nephew who is autistic.  I am very conscious in particular of one sad and very disturbing instance regarding a person who took a case to the High Court about a handicapped child.  I welcome the fact that the High Court recognised that the person was entitled to a basic education. All children in the Republic of Ireland are entitled to a basic education.</P>
    <P>I do not normally do this but sadly we are now in a situation where the same people who said they would make sure that £25 million would be allocated have not only said that they will not be allocating it but have appealed to the Supreme Court against a decision of the High Court regarding a person and a handicapped child.  Sadly there is nobody on the other side of the House who is relevant to that party and that Minister.  I find that very disturbing, not just coming from the Minister as a Labour Party member but from the Government. Decisions on such issues must be discussed at Cabinet level.  I find it disturbing that this person can be told by Department officials and the Minister that their High Court costs, which came to something in the region of £7,000, would be paid but at the same time the question as to whether the child is entitled to basic education is being appealed to the Supreme Court.  That is a very sad reflection on us as a people. They were prepared to say we will give £25 million, which they did not do, and then they appeal a case.  Has the Minister any information as to why the appeal should go ahead at all?  Basic excuses were made.  For instance, it was disclosed first in a Sunday paper at that time, as I am sure the Minister is aware, and then the Minister's officials&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward) Liam Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I apologise for the absence of the Minister who is unavoidably away.  I assure Senators that the views expressed by them in this important debate will be brought to the attention of the Minister and the officials and will be taken fully into consideration.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I wish to say that I recognise the special educational needs of children with autism.  This condition is one of the most severe developmental disorders affecting children, characterised as it is by acute difficulties with communication, relationships and behaviour. In addition, it is usually associated with a variable degree of mental handicap. One of the problems facing service providers is that there is some uncertainty regarding the exact prevalence of autism. The number of children so identified may vary, depending on the criteria being used.  However, we know that somewhere between two and four per 10,000 children can be expected to have autistic symptoms to a marked degree.  Therefore, from 12 to 22 new cases per year may be anticipated.</P>
      <P>These figures would suggest that there may be up to 176 children with autism in the eight-year primary school age range, and up to 110 more in the five-year post-primary age range.  A greater number of children may show lesser symptoms of the disability.  Approximately 75 per cent of children with autism come within the mental handicap range and boys outnumber girls by a ratio of three or four to one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of areas of functioning affected and the degree to which they are affected varies from one individual to another.  Approximately half of those with a significant level of autism cannot use language for communication.  About <Col N="78" /> 80 per cent are likely to need life-long support and supervision and from 5 per cent to 10 per cent may become independent as adults.  Early identification and intervention are essential for children with autism to enable appropriate provision to be made.  Depending on the circumstances, general practitioners, public health nurses, paediatricians, area medical officers and teachers, may at some point be confronted with a child with autism.  Hence it would be desirable that the training of these professionals should include information on the diagnosis of the disability.  Early diagnosis and prompt referral will enable the health authorities to implement a pre-school programme for each affected child. Home based programmes will usually be supplemented by pre-school attendance by the age of three.  Depending on the level of intellectual impairment and additional handicaps, the child may be appropriately placed in a local pre-school or a child development centre.</P>
    <P>At school age the child with autism requires an education suited to his or her assessed needs and the provision in each case should take account of social, language and cognitive development. Depending on individual circumstances, educational provisions can be made in any one of a number of areas.  Senator Cotter has disagreed with item (d) but I will go through them and then take up that matter, they are: (a)  an ordinary national school with the support of a remedial or resource teacher; (b)  a special class in an ordinary national school; (c)  a special school for children with a mental handicap; (d) a special school for children with emotional and/or behavioural disorders.</P>
    <P>The nature of the educational provisions that should be made for autistic children was one of the issues examined by the Special Education Review Committee. That committee concluded that the special education needs of autistic children could vary from child to child and that accordingly a range of different provisions, including placement in a special school for emotionally disturbed individuals, might be appropriate.  Any <Col N="79" /> such placement would only take place after a psychological and psychiatric assessment of each child.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that no one type of educational provision will meet the needs of all children with autism.  There is a continuum of special educational needs which is best served by a corresponding range of educational provisions.  Accordingly, some needs may be catered for in the ordinary school while more acute needs can best be met in a more specialised setting.</P>
    <P>The particular requirements of children with autism have been examined by the Special Education Review Committee as part of its remit covering all children with special educational needs. While generally supporting the strategies outlined above, the committee made specific recommendations in relation to the level of teaching support for autistic children enrolled in special and ordinary national schools; the adoption of a standard classification system for identifying and describing autism; and the appointment of child care assistants in schools and classes with autistic children.  In addition, the committee identified a number of principles which should underpin the provision of educational services for all children with special educational needs, including those with autism. Among these principles are that: all children, including those with special education needs, have a right to an appropriate education; the needs of the individual child should be the paramount consideration when decisions are being made concerning the provision of special education for that child; a continuum of services should be provided for children with special educational needs, ranging from full-time education in ordinary classes, with additional support as may be necessary, to full-time education in special schools.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are being made at present for the publication of the committee's report and my Department is actively considering its recommendations. Also, in keeping with the policy of encouraging the maximum <Col N="80" /> amount of discussion and debate in relation to educational issues, a seminar dedicated to special education and the committee's report is being organised for 6 December next in the Royal Marine Hotel, Dún Laoghaire.  Among the objectives of this seminar is to allow those involved in special education, either as deliverers or recipients of the service, to convey their views on the nature and development of provision in this vital area.</P>
    <P>On the subject of service deliverer, I must at this stage pay tribute to the enormous contribution made by the voluntary organisations in the provision of care and educational services for those with disabilities.  In particular, the Irish Society for Autism has, since its foundation in 1963, played a leading role in promoting services for people with autism and that contribution is much appreciated.</P>

      <P>Let me turn now to the question of health funding for the people with a mental handicap, including children with autism.  I would first like to emphasise that the Government is fully committed to the provision of the highest possible level of service for persons with a mental handicap and to ensuring that the services which they need are theirs as of right.  The integration of services with those for the community as a whole will be encouraged so that persons with a disability will feel and regard themselves as an integral part of that community.</P>
      <P>Services for people with a mental handicap have developed substantially over the last 20 years.  High standards of service provision have been achieved; nothwithstanding the fact that our country's economic resources are lower than most of our European partners with whom we tend to compare our services. This is in itself an achievement and is due to the sustained efforts of the voluntary and statutory sectors.  We have established an international reputation in the field of mental handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> The Government has outlined its commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to the provision of additional resources to accelerate the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services &mdash; Needs and Abilities.  A substantial amount of money is being spent on a range of services for people with mental handicap.  In 1993, approximately £217 million will be spent on these services. This expenditure includes the funding provided by the Department of Health to the direct funded voluntary agencies, services provided for people with mental handicap in psychiatric hospitals, in health board centres and by voluntary agencies funded through section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, and other grants by the health boards.  It also includes expenditure on disabled persons' maintenance allowances and domiciliary care allowances. In the budget this year, the Government made an additional £6.5 million available to develop services for people with mental handicap.  In addition to this, the Minister for Health made available a sum of £2 million from within the Estimates of his own Department to strengthen the funding base of some direct funded mental handicapped agencies and to meet some essential service needs.</P>
    <P>Some £4 million has been allocated to the health board regions and this money will be used to provide a broad range of additional services along the following lines: 90 residential places for the provision of ongoing care and for emergency and respite care; 200 day care places for a wide variety of community based services; the improvement of the home support programme which was initiated last year; the continuation of the transfer of persons with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals to more appropriate hostel accommodation in the community; the creation of further early intervention and child education and development services; the improvement of services in St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane and the commissioning of new bungalow accommodation <Col N="82" /> at the Daughters of Charity on the Navan Road in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Provision has also been made for the capital investment necessary to support the initiatives which will be put in place this year.  The allocation of the £2.5 million capital funding made available in the budget will be directly related to the service developments agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees and approved by the Department of Health.  This is by far the largest single allocation ever made to services for persons with a mental handicap and is a mark of the determination of the Government to give a high priority to the development of services for such persons.</P>
    <P>A discussion paper on services for autism, prepared by the Department of Health's adviser on mental handicap, was recently circulated by the Department to the various service providers, both statutory and voluntary, and to others interested in this field.</P>
    <P>On the question of a commitment made in relation to a specific level of funding, I understand, and I have learned here this evening that a promise of an additional £25 million for persons with a mental handicap was made in the Labour Party election manifesto.  This matter was dealt with in some detail by the Minister for Health when he addressed the Dáil on 25 May last.  On the Programme for Government discussions he explained that compromises had to be made. However, I would once again like to reiterate that the various commitments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This debate is too serious for that type of behaviour. However, I would once again like to reiterate that the various commitments in relation to persons with a mental handicap and a disability generally, as set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government, are real.  Progress has already been made on a number of these commitments, for example the appointment of a Minister for Equality and Law Reform to co-ordinate all Government initiatives for persons with a disability and to promote their rights; the provision of an additional £8.5 million in 1993 to speed up the implementation of &ldquo;Needs and Abilities&rdquo;; the increasing involvement of parents and families of persons with a mental handicap in the planning of services through their representation on the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees.</P>
      <P>While the Government has, in 1993, made available the largest ever increase in funding for services for people with mental handicap, it does recognise &mdash; I am only too ready to admit this &mdash; that much more needs to be done if we are to meet the needs of those with mental handicap who are on waiting lists and for their families.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House that the goodwill of the Ministers concerned, both in Education and Health, as already shown by their actions since coming to office a few short months ago, will direct this goodwill towards those with mental handicap.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  However, I felt his speech addressed the amendment to the <Col N="84" /> motion on mental handicap far more than the main motion itself regarding autism and this is disappointing.  One development I am glad to see is that no contributor has made any attempt to romanticise the handicap because autism is a serious condition.  It pains me enormously when I find that many are inclined to describe various types of mental handicap as trivial conditions which can be coped with by parents and families.  This condition certainly cannot.  While Senator Farrell was correct to refer to certain children and young adults with special skills, for example, in mathematics and music, the romanticisation of the condition in the film &ldquo;Rainman&rdquo;, where Dustin Hoffman was portrayed as a mathematical genius with autism, was unfortunate.</P>
      <P>Autism, as Senator Roche said, is a most bewildering condition.  I can remember the first child I saw with this condition when I was a medical student in Harcourt Street Hospital.  Unfortunately, the child often looks normal and it seems that if one could snap their fingers behind them, all would be well and that they would respond, make eye contact, speak properly &mdash; all the points the various Senators have mentioned and described correctly.  &ldquo;Bewildering&rdquo; is the right description for this condition and one of the first matters that we must recognise is that early diagnosis is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the special training for those in general practice &mdash; public health nurses and so forth &mdash; so that these children are recognised at an early stage.  We also have to address the grave shortage of child psychiatrists because they are the ones who will have to make a definite diagnosis.  We are learning more often that an initial wrong diagnosis in mental handicap can cause years of incorrect education and treatment being given to children.  There is a shortage of child psychiatrists and there are long waiting lists.  This matter must be addressed before the Minister tries to educate these children.  The lack of places for educating these children was <Col N="85" /> described in a moving letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> from somebody from Senator Burke's area, County Mayo.  I quote:</P>
    <P>I am the father of an autistic young man, Caleb, who is nearly 18.  For the past 12 years he has attended a school for the moderately mentally handicapped &mdash; a square peg in a round hole, as autistic people require specific programmes and management.  He has had to travel nearly two hours every morning and two hours every afternoon during this period.</P>
    <P>How would we feel if normal children had to travel for two hours each morning and afternoon?  We would consider it disgraceful. The fact that a child with these severe problems must do this makes it worse.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>We are desperate and we know many others in the same position (I have forwarded names and case histories to the Minister).  I don't know how we are going to cope.  We are an isolated, marginalised group who find ourselves scrabbling with one another over the scraps from the table.</P>
    <P>The fact that such a letter must appear in a newspaper is disgraceful.  It should be possible to deal with this situation given the small number of these children.  Not only is it important that these children be dealt with and given specific educational programmes for their own sake, but also because they can be extremely difficult to deal with at home, which may cause family stress.  The man who wrote this letter said that parents feel desperate.  In his letter he thanks the Archbishop of Cashel and Emly who pointed out that people should not have to resort to public demonstrations to get help for their children in this type of situation.  These children and their families deserve justice.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman has also written about this matter.  These people have explored all avenues to try to get help for their children.  As Senator Roche said, little residential care is available for these children.  Residential care is appropriate because the children are spread throughout the country.  When the Minister <Col N="86" /> reports back to the Minister for Education he should urge her and the Minister for Health to approach this matter jointly.  The phrase &ldquo;the child was a square peg in a round hole&rdquo; is important, as autistic people require highly specialised programmes and management.  Yet the Minister did not address this situation this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion. As Senator Cotter said, few of us understand this matter.  Those who fully understand this matter are in the public gallery this evening and I apologise that this debate has become a political football because that it is not what they came here for.  Fianna Fáil put down this motion because we recognise all is not right in this area and we are attempting to rectify some of the problems which exist.</P>
      <P>I will refer to some of the correspondence I received from the group According to the document <i>Autism-Europe:</i></P>
      <P>Once a child has been diagnosed he should be provided with specialised educational services.  The provision of such services should depend on the severity of the autism.  There is positive evidence that people with autism can benefit from specialised education in a suitable environment.  Depending on the needs of the child with autism, services could be provided in any of the following settings.</P>
      <P>Some of this concurs with part of the Minister's speech this evening and the report in the Dáil yesterday.  It appears some elements of this document have been lifted, for example, a normal class in ordinary schools; special classes in ordinary schools; special schools for the development of children with autism; special classes in schools for handicapped children on a day or residential basis and parents should be counselled and instructed in their child's problem and needs, etc.  The Minister has been selective and he has left out the important aspects of this matter.  We are not contributing one iota to helping children with autism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> The families of children with autism believe they should not be categorised and treated in special schools for children with emotional and/or behavioural disorders. This is wrong and it is a misclassification. They believe there is a need to identify the needs of the child. To lock the child into this category is a serious misclassification and contributes nothing to their circumstances.  The purpose of this motion is to ask the Department of Education to recognise the syndrome of autism rather than regard it as a mental handicap, although that has not happened this evening.  Individual education programmes are a necessity if the needs of children with autism are to be met.</P>
    <P>The document <i>Autism-Europe</i> refers to the involvement of parents.  The existing system is inadequate as less than 12 per cent of parents have any meaningful involvement in the development of programmes. The most important thing for a parent &mdash; I have three children and I thank God they are healthy &mdash; is a meaningful involvement in the growth and development of a child, particularly in the case of autism.  Parents feel excluded, they are on the receiving end of what is dished out.  They are worried that staff dealing with the problem are not fully trained and are unaware of the specific needs of the children.  I do not mean to be critical because I do not fully understand this and if I had to deal with autistic children I would do all the wrong things.</P>
    <P>Again, I will quote from the document <i>Autism-Europe:</i>&ldquo;50% of staff reported that their knowledge of autism only came from an in-service seminar.&rdquo;  I welcome the Minister's statement that a seminar on autism will be held in December. Some 16 per cent of staff did not have training in autism.  That is scandalous. We would not send an unqualified teacher into a remedial class.  If these figures are correct, and I have no reason to doubt them, I could not defend the situation.  Only 22 per cent of staff had post-graduate university training and less than 45 per cent use the term &ldquo;autism&rdquo;<Col N="88" /> when discussing the needs of the child with its parents.</P>
    <P>We have fallen into that trap this evening.  One parent mentioned that people refer to these children as &ldquo;children like that&rdquo;.  We have not referred specifically to autism, we referred to mental handicaps, etc.  Autism is a specific syndrome.  I do not want to take away from the intention of the motion, but this has reduced the debate to a level which it should not have done.</P>
    <P>Given my experience of three healthy children and from speaking to the parents of autistic children, by placing them with emotionally and behaviourally disturbed children, their potential cannot be realised.  Unless they are placed in a proper environment with specific educational programmes, they will be unable to reach their potential.  The purpose of the educational system is to allow children to reach their potential and that will not happen if they are misplaced.  This will continue to happen if we have what I refer to as the &ldquo;D-category&rdquo;, mentioned this evening and in the previous debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche referred to the situation in Blanchardstown.  I was not aware the school had been moved to this location. The Minister said a three-teacher school catering for autistic and emotionally disturbed children is located in two separate premises.  To be fair, it was a Labour Senator who brought it up in the House. The Minister responded and said it was a three-teacher school catering for autistic and emotionally disturbed children, located in two separate premises.  The interesting thing is that 12 autistic children attend the main school building, comprised of pre-fabricated accommodation, located in the premises of James Connolly Memorial Hospital which is in my constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>A further eight emotionally disturbed children are in residence in a school in a large private house known as Court Hall, four miles away.  I know both these buildings well, <Col N="89" /> and in fact I canvassed at Court Hall. Court Hall is a fine, absolutely beautiful building providing the proper kind of care for those children who are emotionally disturbed.  However, I am glad that the children who are emotionally disturbed have been cared for in the right kind of accommodation, but the children with autism are located in a pre-fab in the JCM hospital which was a TB hospital. When I was there on Sunday with my daughter I had to go down to the casualty department.  As far as I can see, that entire unit is empty.  Nothing is being done with it; nobody is using it.  To put children with special needs, autistic children, into pre-fabricated accomodation is wrong.</P>
      <P>One of the parents who is a vice-principal in a school told us that the portakabin in his school went on fire and burnt down completely in six minutes. I do not think we take such risks with children who are fully capable, or adults, but to put children with special needs into pre-fabricated accomodation means there is no way they could be evacuated from that building if it went up in flames, although I would hope that I am wrong. If it burnt down in six minutes I would have serious reservations and worries about that.  It says something about how we view this.  The autistic children are in the pre-fabs, the children with behavioural needs are, thank God, being provided with decent accomodation.  I know of other circumstances where they certainly are not.</P>
      <P>To conclude, I share Senator Henry's view and I think that the Minister's reply has had to address the amendment.  I would have preferred if we had been able to do something positive.  I am not going to make a political football of this but I am prepared to take on anything that I feel is wrong.  I am not going to sit on this side of the Chamber and start ballyragging the Minister for something he did not do.  We could have done something positive here and the Opposition should have supported us.  We are trying to improve situations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This partnership in Government seems to have come unstuck, as I said, because there is nothing to stop the major partner from working this out at the Cabinet table. Some form of a stunt is going on here.  It is an effort to wash their hands at the lack of performance so far by this Government, and, in the Minister of State's speech, an effort also &mdash; I am sorry to say it but I have to, it is written down &mdash;<Col N="92" /> to embarrass the Labour Party who made the promise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>However, having said that, it is very difficult when you are a politician not to take note of political happenings around you, and I have to do that.  I am sorry I have to do so.  Like many other people I have, over the years, been involved in associations to help the mentally handicapped.  If this had not been done many of our services, that the Minister of State lauded here, would not be in existence.  It was the ordinary people who had to go out and organise fund-raising.  We all know that in every area there are always two or three people who seem to carry the burden, but they do get support.</P>
      <P>This has produced our services and accomodation &mdash; schools for children with special needs, is the way I would like to phrase it.  There is no doubt that the well-being of parents of children with special needs is affected.  On occasion I have met parents who were at the end of their tether, their nerves were gone because they felt isolated.  They had been to health boards, the Department of Education and schools, yet nothing could be done to meet their special needs.  That is really what we are talking about: children with special needs who need special attention.  The only way that situation can be catered for is (a) to recognise it and (b) to provide the funds.  We always seem to come back to funds.  Unless the proper commitment and will is there to provide funds then this will not happen.</P>
      <P>At present, the people who can provide the funds are in Government.  On that side of the House we have two parties in Government and I hope, apart from this debate, that through their own parties &mdash; and especially the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; they will make their voices heard and press their Minister for Finance to provide funds to give us the services we are all asking for.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Education to recognise and make provision for the special educational needs of children with autism.</P>
      <P>Frankly I listened here and in my office to the opening comments of Senator Roche and I thought he put the motion in context, and I would support it fully.  But what Fine Gael did, as they are apt to do, was, instead of looking at this on its merits and saying, &lsquo;Let us support it because it needs to be done&rsquo;, to say, &ldquo;How are we going to gut this bloody Government?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>When I hear people talking about political footballs I always think those who are pushing are doing the right things.  If anybody thinks Fine Gael made a political issue of this tonight, it is nothing like the issue I intend making of it, politically and otherwise.  This is a political issue because the parents and friends of the handicapped and disabled, people with specific syndromes, to use their own words, have, for as long as I have been involved in education, which is more than a quarter of a century, not only had to deal with the specific problem in their own families but have also been required and compelled to collect a local education tax in the guise of contributions to various organisations dealing with the handicapped.  They have been kept in control by threats from Governments of all sides not to rock the boat.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael tabled an amendment to the motion.  If it was not appropriate it should have been ruled out of order.  The Government side should not be whingoing about it; it is either in order or it is not.  I have a clear attitude to both the amendment and the motion.  I support the amendment which is quite specific and I support the motion.  It too is quite specific.  I will vote in support of both.  It is the only thing that anybody who is committed to dealing with the issues of special education can do.  There has to be regret that the money has not been provided.  Regardless of the reason and of any compromises Governments had to make, it is a matter of regret for anybody involved in special education that the money was not provided and I deplore its non-availability.  Similarly I support the proposal that Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister to recognise and make special provision for autism.  There is no problem for those of us who are Independents regarding what we have to do. It is very clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> Approximately half a million pupils attend primary education.  By any international standards about 15 per cent of them would require special help and attention, including remediation at various levels, and dealing with special syndromes. About 1,000 remedial teachers are dealing with approximately 30,000 pupils.  The Department of Education's own statistical bulletin shows there are approximately 12,000 other pupils being dealt with in special classes or special schools.  This means there are approximately 30,000 pupils in the primary education system who are not receiving the attention, support and levels of interest from the Government to which they are entitled.  This reality puts this State in breach of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was signed by the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, in New York three years ago.  It puts us in breach of the spirit of our own Constitution which says the State must provide free primary education for all our pupils, including those with the syndrome of autism.  Such children are losing out. There is no right or wrong on this issue. These people have been ignored by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>I will be debating this area of special education at some length in other fora including the forum on 6 December, the report of which I will welcome.  It is a superb report.  I do not know if it has been published yet but I have seen it. Those who compiled it have done excellent work and we will support every one of its recommendations, including the one on autism which is superb.  However, it cannot be implemented without funding and no level of funding is being provided at this time.</P>
    <P>I had intended to deal with the integration of children with disabilities, handicaps or, to use the words of Senators, specific syndromes, into the ordinary local school.  I may have time to refer to it later.  I now want to deal specifically with autism.</P>
    <P>About two months I asked the INTO representative in the south city area to visit the two locations &mdash; schools is too grand a word &mdash; where children with <Col N="97" /> autism are being taught.  One location is in Quarryvale and the other is in the James Connolly Memorial Hospital.  If animals were being dealt with in the way those children are ignored they would not qualify for EC agriculture funding. The only reason I have not taken action on those schools and closed them down is because of our concern for the children and their parents.  It is nothing short of a national disgrace; nobody could stand over it.  These children are not regarded as a priority.  None of the areas on which money is spent by the Department of Education is more important than the need to provide money to look after these children.  In many cases they are young adults.</P>
    <P>I was in the James Connolly Memorial Hospital location a few years ago when another group moved there from the James Street location, as I recall.  There are two classes in a portacabin there.  The pupils are being looked after in totally unsuitable accommodation.  There is no way any of the things Senator Roche mentioned in his excellent presentation can be implemented in that location. Those children, young adults, individuals, Irish citizens, are not receiving any support from us in those two locations.  One is a private house in Quarryvale, the other is a portacabin in the James Connolly Memorial Hospital. Nobody can stand over this situation and everybody, including myself and my union members, stands indicted by it.</P>
    <P>My members would say to me it is a disgrace we have put up with this.  We have tried to do everything possible to exert pressure for the provision of alternative accommodation.  In every case accommodation has been promised.  It is like the snap apple &mdash; the more you push it the further away it goes.  We have been given promises and told to stay in line, not to rock the boat and we will be looked after.  We have had the same response tonight.  I know the Minister's views on disability and know of his support and sympathy for the issue, but his speech does not deal with the issue.  It is not any response to the needs of pupils going <Col N="98" /> to these locations, their parents or the society.</P>
    <P>I have not had direct contact with the society who are dealing with this.  I am aware of their work and congratulate them on it.  If I were those people and listened here to words of thanks, gratitude and support I would walk out the door and leave.  If people begin with words of thanks, it surely means there will be no signed cheque afterwards.  The cheque should be handed over first and then they should be thanked.  They are not being given any support.  They are in a private house in Quarryvale.  In 1978 they were told it was temporary but they are still there.  Two or three months ago they were promised alternative accommodation near Milltown but it was given to somebody else.</P>
    <P>I have received reports from the two schools.  They are disgraceful.  We all stand indicted on this matter.  It does not give me any pleasure to say we have spoken to the teachers and they feel abandoned and deserted by the system. They have been given a job to do without being given the resources to do it, without the benefit of in-service education, specific training and learning and access to specific research.  Our teachers are not being given the opportunity to give these kids a chance.  That is the reality and those kids are simply being shepherded through the system.  They are not getting the support to which they are entitled and how they come out at the other end will not reflect positively on the primary education system.  I will not go any further on that except to say that we in the INTO will be taking action on this issue.</P>
    <P>I want to make one addition to the point which was made about the two locations, which are 4.1 miles apart, according to my records.  How can a principal run that school?  How can there be contact there?  I do not think it helps anybody's cause to say that the children with emotional difficulties are being looked after while the children with autism syndrome are not.  There are no winners in special education at primary level that I know of.  Comparisons do <Col N="99" /> not help anybody.  Nobody in primary education is being over-funded.</P>
    <P>On the question of integration, I said at the beginning of my contribution that there are 33,000 pupils who are not receiving any help and are not involved in the system of special education and support.  Working on an average ratio of 12: 1, that would require approximately 2,700 teachers in order to give those pupils teaching support only.  That is a huge level of State investment.  If those children were not to be dealt with in special schools and classes but were to be integrated into ordinary classes &mdash; I use the word ordinary advisedly, I am just talking about the local national schools &mdash; it would require even larger investment. If it can be done, we will support it.</P>
    <P>I am supporting both the amendment and the motion.  This is the beginning of a debate.  There will be much talk about this area and I can assure the society, the teachers and the pupils that we in the INTO will be supporting them until they get that to which they are entitled.</P>

      <P>I am speaking in support of the motion.  I thank Senator O'Toole for opening up some opportunities for me to get further into this debate and also for being so afraid of my presupposed criticism that he was already covering himself.</P>
      <P>The motion has opened a can of worms, as far as I can see.  Unfortunately, &mdash; or perhaps fortunately some people would say &mdash; I have no direct contact or involvement with somebody who suffers or whose child suffers from autism.  I will be approaching this from an angle based on my experiences as a person with a disability and some of the special education needs which I required.  There is a parallel between the two situations.  I will be speaking on the motion in a slightly abstract sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State because I know from several discussions with him that he has a unique and in-depth understanding of the problems here.  The motion calls on the Minister <Col N="100" /> for Education to recognise the problems and to make provision accordingly. There are two strands to this motion which it is important to understand.  The Minister of State in his speech stated that at school age, a child with autism requires an education suited to his or her assessed needs and he laid out four types of possible educational provision &mdash; an ordinary national school with the support of a remedial or resource teacher; a special class in an ordinary national school; a special school for children with a mental handicap and, the most controversial, a special school for children with emotional and/or behavioural disorders.</P>
    <P>We all understand that there is no system which will suit everybody.  Therefore, a range of services and resources has to be provided in this context.  I have also heard much criticism of the two schools in Dublin &mdash; or to use Senator O'Toole's definition, the two locations in Dublin &mdash; where the services are at present being provided.  It is upsetting and wrong that those are the conditions which prevail, yet before they were provided in 1978 many of these people would not have been getting any education and would possibly have ended up in institutions totally unsuited to their needs where they might have been the victims of a misdiagnosis of their problem.  The question goes deeper than just dealing with children with autism and their education needs.  It requires a review of what the education system should provide for people with disabilities, those who suffer from specific syndromes and students with learning disabilities.</P>
    <P>Half of my education took place in the so-called ordinary system.  For the other half I had special needs because of my disability.  Integration in the Hamilton High School in Bandon, where I went to secondary school, was essential to my personal development and to my acceptance of my disability.  At the same time, I understand that there will always be a requirement for special sheltered education &mdash; if sheltered is the right word, I may be wrong in using that word &mdash; special remedial facilities and one-to-one teaching in some circumstances. <Col N="101" /> However, this can be part of an overall service.</P>
    <P>The most important thing is to ensure that the integration takes place at the earliest possible age.  It is important not only for the children with the disability &mdash; be it a specific syndrome, a learning disability or a physical disability &mdash; but it is also important that the other children involved within the integrated class have a greater understanding.  Let us never forget that prejudices towards people with disabilities and people who are different stem not from children themselves but from adults.  Those prejudices are passed from adults to children.  If the barriers and prejudices can be overcome at the earliest possible age, there is a hope for a better future for all of us.  I understand Senator O'Toole's point that every INTO document on this subject calls for resources, resources and more resources.</P>

      <P>Every time that Senator O'Toole stands up to speak about this topic, not only in this Chamber but also in other fora in which I have heard him, he says that they need more resources, that they will quite happily provide the services if they get more resources.  The problem is that there are resources available at present which are not being utilised because the INTO claims that they are not enough to provide the services. Let us try it on a test basis first to make sure that this system works.  The best system is a schedule within each school whereby a certain section is for integrated education, another is for remedial education and a third section is for the extra specialised education which is needed.</P>

      <P>There is background and backdrop.  Our Constitution guarantees the right to education.  That right is fully supported by the Department of Education, the Minister for Education and the Minister of State at the Department of Education.  There is no point adopting a single plan for the Irish Wheelchair Association, who want services for young children, the Irish Society for Autism, the deaf and blind association, etc.  There is a need for integration, not only between the people with special needs and the so-called mainstream students, but also between the different groups in the special needs area.  There is a need for greater understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I came into the Seanad I thought I knew a lot about disabilities. When I came into the House I discovered my ignorance in regard to blindness, autism, mental handicaps and learning <Col N="103" /> disabilities.  It is an educational process for us as well as the special students.  I support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I share some of the distaste which has been expressed by Senator McGennis and others about the tone of the debate, but it must be stated that this is a political institution and the Government is accountable to it.  We have an attitude which suggests that Parliament is irrelevant and that these decisions can be made in the offices of the Taoiseach and Government Ministers, without reference to the House.  This is where we decide and this is what we were elected to do.  We are a political institution and we make no apology for conducting our affairs in a political way.  It is irrelevant whether the amendment is good or bad. If it is ruled in order it is relevant and we speak about it.</P>
      <P>I am fortunate to come from County Kildare where excellent services are provided for people with mental disability. Care for the mentally handicapped is provided by the St. John of God Brothers and the Camphill Community.  They are providing a service on behalf of the State through the voluntary contributions of the people in County Kildare.  They are absolving the Government of its solemn responsibility to those with handicaps.  I have heard them described by the chairman of CARE in County Kildare as &ldquo;daoine le Dia&rdquo; or &ldquo;God's people&rdquo;.  We should remind ourselves of the value they can bring to us who are more fortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made much of the fact that this Government has allocated £217 million for services for the mentally handicapped.  I must congratulate him.  I <Col N="104" /> assume this figure embraces the education and health budgets which amount to billions of pounds, yet the Government has allocated £217 million.  We agree our economy is bound by lack of resources and that Government action is therefore limited.  However, that is not the issue.  The issue is where the resources will be allocated.  One of the reasons the resources have not been allocated to this sector in the way they should have been is that the people involved have been silent.  Often people who are disadvantaged are not able to speak for themselves.  The parents of these children and young adults are responsible people who do not make the fuss others do for their sectoral interests.  As a result, they have suffered, not only under this Government, but under other Governments as well.</P>
    <P>In a recent editorial in <i>The Leinster Leader</i> a reference was made to the fact that damage is being done to children with disabilities because they are unsuitably placed in mainstream classes.  This is not an acceptable statement.  This is a matter of fundamental choice.  If people with Downs Syndrome children or children with autism choose to send those children through the mainstream education system, that choice should be respected.  That choice has been upheld by the High Court.  When will the Government deliver on that judgment so as to ensure that those young people who wish to be part of the greater society and who can enrich that society are allowed to pursue their education through that system?</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the training of experts.  We need psychologists.  If this Government is to be consistent with the commitments made at the outset of this administration, it is now time to deliver.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Dardis for his time.  As a Member of the Seanad and the Eastern Health Board, I visited Drumfirth with Senator Roche and I became conscious of the problem of autism.  I, like Senator Crowley, suffer from a handicap.  In fact, autism and my <Col N="105" /> own handicap were associated with Rose Week recently.  My problem is often related to a mental handicap, which it is not.  The Department of Education treats autism as a mental handicap, although it is not.  The Department's attitude should change in this regard and it should give support to parents who have children with this problem.  Pressure is often put on parents whose children have a handicap. They should get every support from the health boards, the Department of Education and the Department of Health to help them overcome the problem in their lives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>At one stage the debate seemed to go off the rails.  Of course, this is a political institution and political points will be made.  I am not suggesting that the bona fides of any contribution made here should be questioned. However, I wish to make two points. First, the motion is specific.  I said it should be drafted in specific terms because there is a specific issue which needs to be addressed.  Secondly, I was surprised the amendment was accepted as being in order because it is a debate for a different day and one which deserves the fullest amount of time.</P>
      <P>I welcome the compassion shown here tonight and the fact that there has been a two hour debate for the first time on this issue in either House of the Oireachtas. Therefore, we have made progress.  I welcome the compassion shown by Members and, in particular, by the Minister and the Minister of State.  The Minister must lead his Department further in this matter.  I suggest to the Minister of State and the Minister that there really is not a huge gulf to be bridged here.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his contribution here and his reply in the Dáil last night dealt with the issue in a way which is causing difficulties for the Irish Society for Autism.  The Minister himself was fulsome in his recognition of the contribution of that society in this area. These are the people who can tell us something about what needs to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education, through several administrations, has <Col N="106" /> resisted requests and demands to view the mixing of children with autism and those with severe emotional disturbance as a mismatch.  I am familiar with the letter read by Senator Henry which suggested in eloquent but very simple terms that this was trying to put square pegs in round holes.  It is a gross misplacement to put a child suffering from autism and a child with a severe emotional disturbance in the same class.  I do not believe that either can be adequately treated or educated in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>The only quibble I would have with anything said by the Minister is the reference to the notorious clause D, which mentions a special school for children with emotional and/or behavioural disorders. This does not satisfy the need and that is the nub of the difference and the issue which separates the society and the Department.</P>
    <P>I would not for a moment question Senator Cotter's bona fides on this issue. Of course he is right to question Government and harass both parties in Government about funding because that is the task he has on that side of the House. The task which we have on this side of the House is to answer just criticism.  The issue tonight is not one of criticism but of principle.  It is an issue which should not have to be discussed at all.  It is the very special requirements of a very special group of children.</P>
    <P>It would be a tragedy if the House divided on this issue.  We need to take this issue and speak to the administrators, who are not uncaring people.  The people in the Department of Education care as much about every special child as we do. We need to say in a unified way to the Department of Education through the Minister of State that this House wishes the Department to recognise, as has been done in other Departments and elsewhere, that mixing autism and emotional behaviour or disturbance is not the correct approach.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1981 in the United States, after volumes of documentary evidence which deal with the destructive effect of misplacement of the autistic <Col N="107" /> child, the Senate took a decision on 16 January which singled out autism as a separate syndrome or category.  The Senate specifically removed autism from the category of severely emotionally disturbed and that is what the Irish Society for Autism wants to do.</P>
    <P>We did not come here to talk about whether election promises were honoured. Issues of finance will be debated fully on another night.  We should send a clear and unequivocal message to the Department of Education, the Minister and Minister of State that this House wishes on a unified basis that the special needs and special category of autism be recognised and not combined in an ill-advised way with any other category.</P>
    <P>I was reminded as I came here tonight that the cost to the Eastern Health Board per person suffering from challenging behaviour in institutional care amounts to £115,000 per year.  Unless we make the distinction and deal appropriately with autistic children we will condemn people who, in the later stages of their life, do not need to spend their lives in inappropriate institutions to doing just that. This is a tragedy.</P>
    <P>Even if we were heartless people, which nobody on any side of this House is, and we only measured concern in terms of money, we should surely realise that the misappropriate treatment of children with autism ultimately costs the taxpayers of this State dearly.  Some 50 per cent of children with autism who are appropriately treated will move on to a situation where they can, with degrees of assistance, be independent.  We should focus all our attention on ensuring that those children have appropriate attention.</P>
    <P>I ask the House not to divide.  I accept what Senator Dardis says; we are a political House but I do not think we are <Col N="108" /> divided on this issue.  It is accepted that something needs to be done.  I do not think a great amount separates the sides.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to pose a question to the Minister but I will be unfair because this is an issue which moves me.  I ask the Minister if it would be possible for him, the society and his senior people to sit down and iron out this last issue of difference. The Department of Education has a wealth of experience.  I sought to acknowledge that and the society has acknowledged it.  What the society wants is access to the Department and the expertise, care and years of experience that exist there.</P>
    <P>This House could help greatly if we were to adopt this motion without division. I know, twisting his arm as I am, that the Minister will use his good offices and I ask, on behalf of the Members of this House but more importantly on behalf of the parents and children involved, that we resolve the issue.  Could we make progress, sit down and have a discussion to resolve this issue?</P>

I ask that the amendment should not be pressed so we can, without cluttering the issue with politics, simply endorse what to me &mdash; and I am not an impartial judge in this matter &mdash; is a proposition beyond politics.  It is a proposition which deals compassionately with a principle and it commends itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter, a Chathaoirligh, in the light of an impression that was given in the press last Sunday about the problem prevailing at Irish Steel.  I am aware of the reply that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment gave to the other House last evening and I am particularly concerned about the ongoing problem.  I am not one to say that Irish Steel does not have a problem.  It has been known for some time.  I remind the House and the Minister of State of the urgency of this matter, particularly in the Cork region.</P>
      <P>Over a number of years we have lost many industrial concerns including the Verolme Cork Dockyard, Ford &mdash; through no fault of our own &mdash; and Dunlop, among others.  Unfortunately, in this case we are talking about the lower harbour area of Cork.  The amount of money put into the infrastructure of that harbour is enormous, as I know the Minister of State is aware.  We are, for example, talking about the deep water berth which at a cost of over £15 million now has a quay length of about 200 yards and can take tonnage up to 75,000 tonnes which is of enormous benefit to the port area.  From an environmental point of view Irish Steel could not be sited in a better place.  I am confident that we will never have a problem with Irish Steel as regards environmental issues.</P>
      <P>The reply from the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, last evening in the other House gives the impression that no opportunities are left open to Irish Steel except to rationalise and create a situation where fewer people are working there.  That is disturbing.  I am not saying that there should not be rationalisation or that Irish Steel should not work better.  The Minister also said he sees opportunities open to Irish Steel and I welcome that, but in saying that he does not give the impression of helping &mdash; rather the opposite.  He says that management and workforce have to get their act together and I agree with that.  I also agree that there is a surplus of steel in the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> I believe that there is a strong case to be made for Irish Steel.  The Minister claims that other partners should be brought in, although he does not say what type of partners.  Partners have been brought into other semi State bodies over the years, an example being Verolme Dockyard.  Massive amounts of money were invested in Verolme.  There was a great workforce and the then Taoiseach gave a commitment when the other partner was brought in that 300 to 400 people would be working in the yard.  At present there are four people working there.  Let us not assume that simply by finding a partner Irish Steel will stay alive.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave the impression that no argument can be made for Irish Steel at EC level, while at the same time he readily admitted that there are problems in the EC regarding steel plants in other countries which are losing money.  This is an island and we should be making an argument for a steel plant.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself cited the example of the Aer Lingus management and workforce trying to construct a better company.  I agree with that, yet the Minister admits that money can be forthcoming, namely £175 million.  That £45 to £48 million is to be allocated for redundancies is an embarrassment to us, albeit a fact of life.  I do not suggest that that type of money or anything like it should be forthcoming, but the towel has been thrown in from the EC point of view.  We are not prepared to make an argument. The Minister claimed that we have no right to make an argument.  This is an embarrassing situation and I would not like to believe that we are adopting a despondent attitude.  We as a country should be making an argument within the EC that we should hold on to the one steel plant on the island of Ireland.  It is important from a raw material point of view and from an export point of view. Why should we import something which we can produce on the island?</P>
    <P>I recognise that there is need for rationalisation and rethinking.  However, I ask the Minister of State not to forget that up to two and a half to three years ago <Col N="112" /> Irish Steel was making money.  If there is a depression in the market at this time let us not put the total blame on the workers or management of Irish Steel. Cork, having lost many industrial plants, cannot afford to lose another.  The Minister has given the impression in his statement that if Irish Steel management and workforce cannot do it for themselves it cannot be done at all.  We need a little bit of enterprise here, a little bit of motivation and positive thinking.  I expect more from the Minister than the statement that he is not prepared to make a case at EC level.  In other words the towel was thrown in, which is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>We can and must make an argument at that level to ensure that steel plant is maintained.  The European Commission has confirmed that some steel plants need to close, but nobody has said at any time that the Irish plant should be closed.  It is imperative that we should argue at EC level.  We did so in regard to Aer Lingus, when other airlines were saying there was no way we could get money for the company.  The same should done for Irish Steel.  It is for the Cork region.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Cregan for raising the matter in this House.  As the Senator said, the matter was raised in the Dáil last night and it is equally important that both Houses should debate what is a serious national issue.</P>
      <P>At the start of his submission, the Senator spoke of the report in last Sunday's paper.  That report was inaccurate in many respects as we all know that from time to time newspapers put stories together part of which may be flawed in one respect or another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to make the point because the Senator raised the issue himself.  If one was to go around denying everything that was in a paper about a person or what was said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Col N="113" />
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very serious issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;one would never be stopped and the Senator knows that quite well.</P>
      <P>The Senator has said that we should not adopt a despondent attitude.  The attitude we have is one of realism.  A serious matter, such as this is, can only be tackled in a realistic fashion.  In that way nobody is led up blind alleys or <i>cul-de-sacs</i> from which there is no escape. We know that Irish Steel is in difficulties because of a depressed market, poor prices and costly and less than satisfactory production arrangements.  The company has no control over the state of the markets, as clearly that is out of their ambit of control.  We can only hope that the market will pick up in time and indeed there are some very faint signs of that. However, it is down the road somewhat.</P>
      <P>Management and workers do have control over their own production arrangements and they must address immediately the problems giving rise to the current unsatisfactory production arrangements.  If they cannot address those, then the risk of the business failing could not be ruled out.  Should it fail, it would not be because of any decisions by Ministers or officials, but rather because it is not getting its act together to save cash and to improve arrangements for production of steel.  It is our business in this House and the Dáil, and indeed in the country, to encourage management and workers to avoid such a situation by making such adaptations as can be made to improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all familiar with last year's financial figures for the company.  The company lost almost £13 million on a turnover of £58 million.  Like the Minister last night in the Dáil, I do not intend to speculate on the firm's cash flow or whether it might run out of cash.  It would not assist the company's affairs if I or anybody in this House were to do so, but we can say, as Senator Cregan has said several times, the situation is serious.  I must therefore emphasise strongly the urgent need for management and unions <Col N="114" /> to agree on savings and on work arrangements to put this mill on a level of performance that compares to any other such mill in the rest of the EC.  That is essential if the matters are to be rectified.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel's main competitors are other EC producers and consequently the company cannot afford to ignore what is happening in the rest of the community where loss making companies are either having to close or reduce the production capacity of their plants and subsequently the numbers of employees.  Some 30 million tonnes of crude steel capacity has to be permanently taken out, with the resulting loss of almost 70,000 jobs.  We are not part of those reductions, but I repeat that Irish Steel must, if it wants to survive and compete, carry out its own reductions in production costs and improve work practices.  It is not easy to compete in European markets when one is on the edge of Europe.  The Senator clearly stated that an island nation must take its business seriously.  However, Irish Steel will be able to do so only if it can bring in change, flexibility and better cost production arrangements.</P>
    <P>It is not allowable for governments to shore up loss making steel companies. The Community rules prohibit governments to aid steel companies and these are rigorously enforced by the European Commission.  The Senator said we would go forward with an ambitious programme and compel our colleagues to agree to it. Many countries, for example Denmark, take a keen interest in what happens in steel production in other countries.  We would need the unanimous agreement of the Commission and of each member Government to permit us to fund or invest in Irish Steel.  The only way we could get that agreement would be to offer sufficient capacity reductions at the plant to counterbalance any aid given. As has already been made clear in both Houses, Irish Steel, because it is a single plant operation, cannot afford to reduce its production capacity.</P>
    <P>There is some hope that following agreement on reducing costs and putting in place new work arrangements, this company could then attract the interest <Col N="115" /> of a strong outside steel maker.  A partner with all the necessary financial, marketing and technical resources could help overcome some of the inherent disadvantages from which the plant suffers and thereby put the company on a better, more secure footing for the future. However, in order to interest a potential partner the company must first improve its costs and work practices.  That requires some adaptation not just by workers but also by management. Regrettably, progress in achieving savings and more efficient and profitable arrangements is slow and I strongly urge both sides to get back to the negotiating table to agree solutions.</P>
    <P>This is a business like any other which needs strategies to ease and improve its cash position.  Businesses that cannot innovate and show flexibility to cover costs can and do fail.  That applies not just to Irish Steel.  More and more businesses will have to change, adapt and be innovative. If this business, its workers and management cannot make the necessary adjustments it will not be helped to stay afloat and, given the strict EC rules, there will be nothing the Government can do to prevent that.</P>
    <P>We would all want the unions to give the problems much more urgent consideration and I urge the management to negotiate for the maintenance of the greatest number of jobs.  If there is any hardship as a result of change and adaptation it should be equitably spread, from top management through the entire workforce.  Cost savings may involve some reduction in job numbers over time.  This should be a matter for discussion between management and workers.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel has been a successful and resourceful operator in its marketing, sales and distribution.  If it could improve its production we would be able to look forward to its becoming a competitive mini-mill.  With appropriate partnerships or alliances it could be as successful a player in the European steel industry as any other.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="116" /> The current issue is the difficulty about urgently achieving more efficient and lower cost production arrangements.  My colleague the Minister, Deputy Quinn, called on the other House last night to send a message to all at Irish Steel on the need to move quickly to negotiate improvements.  Without them the economics of steel making in Cobh will not be at all promising.  I call on this House and Senator Cregan to reinforce this message. I am glad to have had the opportunity to come to the Seanad to debate this serious issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her concern and her interest.  If we are asking management and unions to organise proper production and to rationalise, can we give a commitment over a period and recognise the need to update some of the plant?  We must ensure some funds are made available over a period of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing the question to be taken and I thank the Minister for his attendance.</P>
      <P>A number of blind children in Donegal travel to two schools in Dublin every week.  There are 12 in all, attending St. Mary's in Marino and St. Joseph's in Drumcondra.  I ask the Department of Education to provide a minibus to pick up the children on Sunday evenings to take them to Dublin and on Friday evenings to leave them home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can understand the dangers for blind children in travelling in an express or private bus from an area like Carndonagh, County Donegal on a 200-mile journey to Busáras where they are collected by the school staff.  It causes worry for parents.  It might be suggested that the parents accompany the children but it is not possible for some to do that because <Col N="117" /> it involves them leaving for Dublin on Sunday afternoons, arriving in the evening and possibly having to stay overnight. These people cannot afford to stay in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The children come from Letterkenny, Carndonagh, Donegal Town and Dungloe. Both the children and the parents are worried about the weekly journey. One has to consider danger of accidents. When they stop at the café in Monaghan no one is available to help them out of the bus to go to the toilet or for a cup of tea.  Their clothes or money could be and have been stolen.  Some parents are worried the children might be kidnapped. The current court case in England concerning the child of two kidnapped by boys of 11 shows the danger for blind children of six or seven who do not know their way around.</P>
    <P>Deaf children from Northern Ireland attend school in Dublin.  The education authorities in the North provide a bus which takes them to and from Dublin. The Northern Ireland bus takes two children from Donegal, which means we are not looking after those people adequately.</P>
    <P>The Bus Éireann schedule is excellent and the parents are happy that the bus always arrives on time.  However, the children are left not in Donegal but in Derry.  Given the current problems in Northern Ireland the parents fear the bus could be stoned or hijacked.  The children would have no one to take care of them.</P>
    <P>If the Minister cannot provide the minibus I call for, I hope consideration will be given to providing an escort to travel with these children to and from Dublin. The EC provides that a companion pass be given to a blind person at 18 years.  It seems ridiculous that these vulnerable children should be denied such a pass. To travel on a train a blind child must have an escort and in some circumstances a social worker travels with them.  No such provision is made for buses.  Blind people appear to be catered for only when they reach 18.</P>
    <P>These children are being discriminated against.  There is no educational facility for them in Donegal, so they have to go <Col N="118" /> to Dublin.  Children going to national school there are given a bus pass but those who are blind and travelling 200 miles do not get a pass.  I ask the Department to alleviate the discrimination and do something to help these children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Maloney for raising this matter. I am at a disadvantage because the matter given to the Department gave no specific details so I do not have a specific reply. I am aware of and fully appreciate the difficulties encountered by some children with disabilities in travelling to special schools and classes and I would be anxious to alleviate those difficulties wherever possible.  The present position is that Bus Éireann operates the school transport system as agents of my Department. That company assesses the eligibility of all children for transport and organises the provision of services for those who are eligible.  The Department does not make detailed arrangements on the ground.  Bus Éireann decides on the pick up and set down points and the size of vehicles for particular routes.</P>
      <P>In the organisation of school transport services all routes are planned in such a way as to ensure that as far as possible every eligible pupil has a reasonable standard of service from the point of view of timetable and distance from the route while at the same time ensuring that all vehicles are fully utilised in the most efficient manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children attending special schools and special classes are given special consideration in the matter of transport to school.  This is in recognition of the nature of the disabilities involved and the relatively disperse locations from which many of the children concerned have to travel to school.  The Department provides transport or alternatively a grant is made towards the cost of private transport arrangements or a combination of both.  Due to the high cost of some services and the inconvenience to other pupils it is not always possible to provide a home pick up and set down service and <Col N="119" /> in such cases a grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements is made.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate pupils attending residential special schools, such as St. Joseph's, the Department makes available transport vouchers which enable pupils to travel home at weekends on mainline rail and bus services.  The successful operation of this service depends on a degree of co-operation between parents, pupils and the school authorities. In the current year approximately £38 million will be spent on the provision of school transport services.  Of this amount approximately 20 per cent will be spent on services for pupils with a disability. This is a considerable commitment given that such pupils constitute only 2 per cent of the school going population.</P>
    <P>The issue of school transport for children with disabilities and the range of services and equipment required in that context were among the matters which were considered in detail by the Special Education Review Committee.  The Minister for Education has just received the committee's report and will be giving early consideration to the committee's recommendations.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the motion came <Col N="120" /> without any specific detail.  We could only assume that Senator Maloney was referring to the two blind children who travel from north-west Donegal each weekend. In those cases the Department provides a weekend pass on the scheduled bus service from Derry to Dublin for both of these pupils.  A grant for both has been sanctioned towards the cost of private transport arranged between their homes and scheduled services because there is no suitable service from there.</P>
    <P>Approaches have also been made to the Department for the provision of a minibus service from Donegal.  The initial reaction of the Department was that this was not feasible because of the high cost involved.  I also understand that one of the parents of the pupils involved raised the issue of an escort on the buses.</P>
    <P>I have not got a detailed reply because of the lack of information received, but I assure the Senator that I will take on board all that he has said and bring the matter to the Department's attention. We will communicate with him as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 4 November 1993.</P>
