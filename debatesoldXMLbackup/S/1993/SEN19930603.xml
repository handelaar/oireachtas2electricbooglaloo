      <P>I have notice from Senator McGennis that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to have prior consultation with the local community before recommissioning the incinerator at Blanchardstown Hospital, Dublin 15.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Marine to investigate the oil spillage along the east coast with the resultant harm to wildlife and beaches.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to include in its regulation on health and safety in the Army, the regulation agreed between PDFORRA and the Health and Safety Authority in place of the wording included by the Minister which is totally unacceptable to Army representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="918" /> I also received notice from Senator Farrelly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to state if she intends to purchase a site for a second level school in Dunboyne, County Meath; and if funds will be made available in 1993 for the commencement of this work.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators McGennis, Cosgrave and Neville and Farrelly as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators McGennis's and Cosgrave's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Neville and Farrelly may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>The Criminal Law (Suicide) (No.2) Bill, 1993, has been passed in the Dáil and it is proposed to take it until 2 p.m., item 2 will be taken from 2 p.m. until 4 p.m.</P>
      <P>The House will sit for three days each week from next week because of the considerable legislative programme coming before the House.  Next week we will sit on Friday also and after that it will sit on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>We will co-operate with the Criminal Law (Suicide) (No. 2) Bill since that Bill should have been initiated in this House.</P>
      <P>I draw the attention of the House to an undesirable development over a number of weeks on the adjournment debate.  On several occasions Ministers taking the matter on the Adjournment had no connection with the Department concerned.  I realise Ministers may be unavailable, but the point of the Adjournment Debate is that the Minister in question is answerable to the Member who raises the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that the Minister with responsibility for the particular brief be present.  A Minister who does not have responsibility for that area does not have the required knowledge and does not <Col N="919" /> deal with the appropriate civil servants. Such practice is an insult to this House and would not happen in the other House.  It is not the fault of the Leader of the House, but it is a message which must be conveyed to Government.</P>
    <P>Since the Government appear to be granting an amnesty a week, perhaps it might consider an amnesty for those who voted for change in the General Election and instead received more of the same.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the question of amnesties.  Is the Leader of the House worried the Government may be confused with Amnesty International?</P>
      <P>Today's newspapers suggest the Ceann Comhairle has favourably received a proposal that a family room be established in Leinster House in order to accommodate the families of Members of both Houses. This is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>However, today we, the Independent Senators, received notice from the union representing our staff that they are no longer prepared to tolerate existing working conditions.  Evidently, other committees receive a more positive response from authorities in the House. It is an extraordinary situation and we have now been asked to continue working under these conditions.  The ante has been raised considerably and I do not know how the present impasse can be overcome.  The union has made its position clear.  There is never natural light; the secretaries always work with the lights on.  Conditions are overcrowded, unhealthy and unhygienic and somebody must bear the responsibility.  I have continuously put on the record of the House our appreciation of your support, a Chathaoirligh, and that of Members on both sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a benign and powerful Seanad which puts forward proposals that are then ignored.  Trying to get any kind of movement is like trying to push-start a streamroller.  It is not possible, a Chathaoirligh, for us to tolerate this situation any longer.  I know you are giving me leeway to make this point, but it has <Col N="920" /> been made clear by the union representing our staff that their conditions are no longer tolerable.  It has been made clear to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges by the Members working in those conditions that it is not suitable and we are no longer prepared to put up with it.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to disrupt the proceedings of the House every day but that is the only option available to us in order to make everybody else feel as uncomfortable as we are under our condition.  In taking whatever action is necessary, we do not aim it personally at Members on either side of the House but to draw attention to the fact that we cannot do our work.  I heard people who attended committees yesterday were annoyed they had to leave for votes and quora &mdash; that is how it will continue to be, and worse. I propose a change on the Order of Business to take item 15 so that we can discuss this matter at length today.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the previous speaker.  Could we be told what the up-to-date position is, why this issue has to be continually raised in this manner and why the Senators in question are being denied the facilities to which they are entitled?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to formally second Senator O'Toole's amendment.  Our situation is intolerable and this House should direct the functionaries involved to provide appropriate space.  It is not a question of our asking them to do so, we should direct them to solve the problem.</P>

      <P>I am repeating what I said in the past, and I have taken a personal interest in this matter although there was no need for me to do so.  I have spoken with all of the relevant people whom I thought could help us, at Civil Service and other levels.  I accept the situation for the Independent Members is very bad.  I will continue to seek a solution and I hope it will be resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a sad reflection on us.  I have been out of the House for a few years but I did not think it would come to this.  Could I ask the Leader if anything can be done before the proposal is put to the House because it reflects badly upon us.  It is serious that some Members are not receiving the same benefits as others.  I have never seen this happen before and I ask for serious discussions to take place.  I ask Senator O'Toole to give talks another chance because a motion like this is an indictment of the House.</P>
      <P>I thought the impression was being given with modern facilities and the upgrading of committees, particularly in the other House, that Members want to move ahead.  However, in this House some Members and their staff, employees who are here five days a week, do not enjoy the same facilities as others. Serious discussions should take place and the motion should not be put at this time. I ask that it be deferred for another week.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Law (Suicide) (No. 2) Bill, 1993: Second Stage.</Title>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Máire Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  The loss of any human life is a tragedy and suicide is particularly so because it is self-inflicted and should, therefore, be avoidable.  In 1991 over 300 people in Ireland committed suicide, that is close to one a day and approximately three-quarters of those who committed suicide were male.  Young men in the age range of 15-25 years are in a particularly high risk category for suicide.  The factors giving rise to suicide in society have been the subject of debate and research for some time but there is no one simple explanation.  Studies in Ireland have highlighted that there are many factors involved.  These include physical and mental illness, alcoholism, personality structure and social isolation.  Although a high proportion of those who commit suicide in Ireland are unemployed, studies suggest that financial poverty itself is unrelated to rising suicide rates; rather it is the poverty of relationships and social opportunities that affects the rate of suicide. The assessment of suicide risk is <Col N="925" /> notoriously difficult and few individuals who threaten suicide actually go on to complete the act.</P>
      <P>The rate of suicide in Ireland has risen since the 1960s.  Even allowing for discrepancies in statistics one study suggests the real rate of suicide doubled in the period 1968-87.  Notwithstanding this increase, the rate of suicide in Ireland is still relatively moderate and is considerably lower than the rate in countries such as Denmark, France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany.</P>
      <P>The tragedy of suicide and the sense of bereavement of those who have lost a loved one to suicide is not helped by the fact that suicide is still a criminal offence. In my address to this House on 28 April I made my position clear.  I see no justification for maintaining suicide as a criminal offence and I hope to see this Bill decriminalising suicide enacted as soon as possible.  There is no evidence whatsoever that making suicide a crime has ever prevented a suicide and I suspect the stigma of criminality attached to suicide may have actually prevented an open approach to the issue as well as adding to the grief of the family and friends of the deceased.</P>
      <P>People who are prone to suicide need help, not the threat of criminal sanctions. They need to be able to discuss their problem openly without fear of the taint of criminality.  My aim in introducing this Bill is to take the act of suicide out of the scope of the criminal law and to put it firmly in the arena of health in the broadest sense where it primarily belongs.  Suicide should not be a criminal activity but it is a problem that requires a caring and sensitive response from society at all levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I go on to discuss the detailed provisions of the Bill it may be helpful if I touch on the existing criminal law as it affects suicide.  Suicide is a common law offence.  It was not created by Statute but formed part of the ancient unwritten law of England as interpreted by judges.  I cannot offer a satisfactory explanation as to why it was originally made a criminal offence other than because it was <Col N="926" /> regarded as self murder.  The fact that the perpetrator of the crime of suicide was dead did not prevent the common law from imposing penalties.  Up to 1870 the property of a person who committed suicide was forfeit to the State and it was the practice in England to bury a person who committed suicide at a crossroads with a stake through the heart.  This practice was only prohibited in England in 1882 by the Interments (<i>felo de se</i>) Act, 1882 &mdash;<i>Felo de se</i> being the legal Latin term for suicide.  The relevant provision was section 2 which states, and I quote:</P>
    <P>It shall not be lawful for any coroner or other officer having authority to hold inquests to issue any warrant or other process directing the interment of the remains of persons against whom a finding of <i>felo de se</i> shall be had in any public highway or with any stake being driven through the body of such person ...</P>
    <P>There are also reported instances where persons who, having attempted suicide and survived, were subsequently hanged.</P>
    <P>Suicide is a felony under the common law and all felonies may be tried on indictment.  Under the common law any attempt to commit an indictable offence is itself an indictable offence and by virtue of this attempted suicide is therefore under the existing law an offence.  A person convicted of attempted suicide may be sentenced by the courts to any term of imprisonment up to life or to a fine or to both at the discretion of the court.</P>
    <P>Suicide is a felony and as such, any person who is an accessory before the fact to a suicide or who counsels, procures or commands a person to commit suicide may be tried, convicted and punished in all respects as if he were a principal felon. Attempted suicide is a misdemeanour and a person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of any misdemeanour is liable to be tried, indicted and punished as the principal offender. The provisions governing these matters are set out in the Accessories and Abettors Act, 1961.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Bill itself.  It is extremely short, only three sections.  The <Col N="927" /> main provision is section 2 (1) which states clearly and concisely that &ldquo;suicide shall cease to be a crime&rdquo;.  Abolishing the offence of suicide also automatically abolishes the offence of attempting to commit suicide.  A similar situation arises in the case of the offence committed by a person who is an accessory to suicide or attempted suicide.  The abolition of the offence of suicide means that it will no longer be an offence under the common law to be an accomplice to suicide or attempted suicide.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the existing offence of being an accomplice to suicide gives rise to certain dangers.  The sanctity of human life must be respected and the law cannot condone a person who wilfully encourages or assists the taking of a human life even if the actual act is self inflicted.  For this reason section 2 (2) of the Bill makes it an offence for a person to aid, abet, counsel or procure the suicide or an attempted suicide of another person.</P>
    <P>The subsection provides that a person convicted of such an offence shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years.  This is less than the existing penalty of life imprisonment but it still marks out the offence as being serious. The reason that a severe penalty is being provided for is to cover situations where a person deliberately procures the suicide of another for his own motives.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (3) in effect provides for a verdict of complicity in suicide as an alternative verdict in cases where a person is charged with murder or manslaughter.  If the facts support it, the jury may return a verdict that the accused aided, abetted, counselled or procured the suicide of another person as an alternative to a verdict of murder or a verdict of manslaughter. This type of scenario is most likely to arise in the case of a suicide pact where one person survives.  The jury will have to decide on the basis of the evidence whether the accused killed the other person and is therefore, guilty of murder or whether the accused was merely an accomplice to the suicide of <Col N="928" /> the other person and, therefore, guilty of an offence under subsection (2).</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) is a technical provision which means prosecutions can only be taken by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions; because of the nature of the offence of complicity in suicide it is considered right that there should be some central control on the initiation of prosecutions under the new offence created by subsection (2).</P>
    <P>Section 3 is a straightforward repeal of section 9 of the Summary Jurisdiction (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1871, which was amended by section 85 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936.  The section provides that, where a person is charged with and confesses to attempted suicide before a judge of the District Court, he may be convicted and imprisoned for any period not exceeding three months unless he does not consent to having his case heard by the District Court or the judge is of opinion that the charge is fit to be made the subject of prosecution by indictment rather than to be disposed of summarily. This provision will be superfluous once the offence of suicide is abolished. Indeed, if the provision was not to be repealed it might cause confusion as to the abolition of the offence of attempted suicide.</P>
    <P>Suicide raises many issues outside the scope of this Bill.  As well as being responsible for criminal law reform, I am also responsible for the operation of the prisons and suicide has important implications in this area.  I would like to touch on the question of suicides by persons in custody.  The number is running at between three and five a year.  This has been a matter of concern to me and to my predecessors and, for the information of the House, I should say that the strategy for dealing with suicides in the prisons is as recommended in the Report of the Advisory Group on Prison Deaths which was published in August 1991.</P>
    <P>The report has 57 recommendations and so far 50 of them have been or are being implemented.  These include 24 hour medical orderly cover in eight closed institutions which was made possible by the appointment of 43 additional <Col N="929" /> trained staff at a cost of £500,000 a year; an increase in the number of clinical psychologists which will shortly increase from three to six and will include a female psychologist for work in the women's prison; professional counselling of both prisoners and staff after a suicide is discovered; the installation of a cell-call system in all institutions to enable a prisoner in distress to call for help; the introduction of a service by the Samaritans in seven places of detention which will shortly be extended to the remaining five places; the provision of a dedicated phoneline to the Samaritans for prisoners' use which is now available in three places and which is to be extended to the remaining places as soon as possible; training for staff in suicide awareness; setting up of a suicide prevention group in each place of detention to monitor developments in relation to suicide prevention and to take precautionary action on the spot; the improvement in GP services; the improvement in the arrangements for special observation of prisoners at risk; the revision of the Rules for the Government of Prisons, 1947; improvements in committal arrangements; training with resuscitation equipment; and provision of in-cell sanitation &mdash; a seven year programme.</P>
    <P>The remaining seven recommendations are more long term in nature and will be taken into account as the prison system develops.  They include the provison of a committal assessment centre, a new female prison, a new open centre for women prisoners and a special unit to cater for psychiatrically disturbed violent prisoners.  The advisory group itself recognised the long term implications of these recommendations.</P>
    <P>While no effort is being spared in pursuing a planned programme of action in suicide prevention, it has to be said, regrettably, that no prevention programme can guarantee complete success. This is a fact which the advisory group acknowledged when they said &ldquo;if a person is sufficiently determined to commit suicide, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to prevent him doing so&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> Constant and unremitting supervision of a prisoner at risk might be successful but again the report cautions that this could be &ldquo;an obstacle to a person recovering from a trauma or crisis that puts him in the risk category in that the supervision itself would be oppressive&rdquo;. The group made the further comment that &ldquo;whereas many people who commit suicide in prison are or have been regarded as at risk, suicides occur among inmates in respect of whom there is no indication whatever that they are at risk&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the prisons, as in society at large, we are dealing with a highly complex phenomenon for which there are no easy remedies.  In relation to prisons I hope it is clear that all practicable steps are being taken to anticipate and prevent suicides. I wish I could confirm that these efforts will be fully effective but given the complexities involved I would prefer to confine myself to the hope that prison suicides will be kept to the absolute minimum.</P>
    <P>I think it would be appropriate at this stage to make reference to the Private Members' Suicide Bills introduced by Senator Neville in the Seanad.  He presented his first Bill in 1991 and then a second slightly expanded Bill in 1992 and a third in 1993.  He very graciously withdrew his own Bill when I first published my proposals at the end of April.</P>
    <P>I regret that a commitment I gave to this House that the Government's Bill on the decriminalisation of suicide would be introduced here first was not acted upon. I regret that because matters were outside my control and, because of arrangements between the Whips in the other House, it was not possible to come to this House with the Bill first.</P>
    <P>It has to be acknowledged that Senator Neville has played an important role in keeping this issue in the public eye and he is to be admired for his dedication to this issue and complimented on the work he has done.  I know we both share the same aim, which is to decriminalise suicide, and I hope I will get the full support of this House in achieving this aim.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her kind words and for bringing the Bill to the House and for bringing the decriminalisation of suicide to a satisfactory conclusion.  Ireland can now closely examine the reason for the increased incidence of suicide in recent years, particularly among young people.</P>
      <P>It is now almost two and a half years since I placed a motion on the Seanad Order Paper asking the Government to decriminalise suicide.  The motion was placed on the Order Paper on 23 January 1991.  It also asked the Government to set up a task force to tackle the mounting problems of suicide among youths.  No debate on that motion took place and on 12 June 1991, I published a Private Members' Bill &mdash; the Suicide Bill, 1991 &mdash; which was debated in Fine Gael Private Members' time on 27 November and on 4 December 1991.  The then Minister for Justice, Deputy R. Burke, promised to bring a Bill before the Houses to decriminalise suicide by Christmas of that year and the then Government parties voted down the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill.</P>
      <P>That Bill is almost an exact copy of the Bill before us today.  I fail to understand why a promise was made to enact the contents of this legislation within three weeks of voting down our Bill and now, two and a half years later, we have a similar Bill before us.  Throughout 1992 on the Order of Business in this House Senator Manning and I repeatedly asked the Leader of the House when we could expect the Government's Bill.  There was no information forthcoming and I raised the matter on 20 May 1992 under Matters of Concern to Members and called on the Government to honour its promise to decriminalise suicides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When no progress was achieved throughout that summer I reintroduced the Private Members' Suicide Bill, 1992, on 8 October of that year.  This, of course, fell with the general election in November. In the absence of progress by the end of March 1993, I republished the previous Bill and placed it on the Order Paper of the Seanad, and this was introduced <Col N="932" /> in Private Members' time one month later on 28 April 1993.</P>
    <P>On the morning the Government introduced its own Bill; I welcomed this and during the debate in Private Members' time I withdrew my Bill at the Minister's request on the basis that she would immediately introduce her Bill in this House.  I quote from the Minister's speech &mdash; she has spoken about the concern we had at that time:</P>
    <P>As there is now a Government Bill decriminalising suicide before this House I would ask Senator Neville not to pursue his own Bill.  It would be most unfortunate to have a divisive vote on an issue where we both share the same fundamental aim which is to decriminalise suicide.  I now ask the Whips of the House to arrange the Second Stage to be taken in this House as soon as possible in view of what I feel is widespread support to decriminalise suicide.</P>
    <P>On this understanding Fine Gael withdrew its Bill and I believed, in view of the developments, that no division between parties should take place on the matter. However, the Government did not see it in this way.  One week later, this House was divided when the Government parties were forced by their masters to withdraw the Bill from the Order Paper. Everybody in the House expressed regret and I accept the Minister's expression of regret today.  The masters decided that it should be withdrawn and that severely damaged the dignity and standing of this House.  The reason for the withdrawal of the Minister's Bill from this House and its initiation in Dáil Éireann is to ensure that credit should not rest with Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>All this divisiveness and delay could have been avoided if the then Government had had the foresight and confidence to accept the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill in 1991.  The acceptance of such Bills would enhance the role of the Oireachtas.  Such legislation coming from any side of the political divide should not be rejected regardless of its merits, by Government.  There is a high <Col N="933" /> expectation of performance from politicians. The public look at us more and more to be legislators.  We must spend more time looking at ways of changing and improving society through the legislative process.  The performance of both Houses must be judged on this.  I ask the Government to accept worthy Private Members' Bills.</P>
    <P>That suicide and attempted suicide remain crimes in Ireland is an indication of our failure to understand and recognise the outcome of research in the area and reflects a tendency by Irish society to view suicide as a scandal rather than a tragedy.  This approach must now end.  It is time that we studied and understood the pressures which caused the suicide rate to increase sixfold since 1970.  Irish society must accelerate its change in attitude and recognise suicide as a public health issue.  I recently met a retired garda who had the experience of charging somebody with attempted suicide.  The trauma he went through and the experience he had are still with him.  It was in the Bridewell in 1965.  The person had attempted to drown himself in the Liffey and the following morning the garda brought him before the court to be charged.  He discussed his experience with me in detail.  It is not long since this was a real issue as a crime.</P>
    <P>In decriminalising suicide, I ask the Government immediately to initiate anti-suicide programmes.  I call on the Minister for Health to establish a counselling service for those who attempt to commit suicide and to help those bereaved by suicide.  Understanding, compassion and professional counselling must be the response to suicide.  I pay tribute to the Samaritans, the Cork-based Friends of the Suicide Bereaved and other organisations who work on a voluntary basis in this area.  They do excellent work.  This should be a health issue and I ask the Minister for Health immediately to allocate funds to establish a counselling service for those who attempt suicide and for the suicide bereaved.  While the decriminalisation of suicide is an important issue, the change must be used to establish progressive, compassionate and professional <Col N="934" /> services throughout the health boards to monitor the whole area of suicide and assist those affected.  Suicide must now become a matter for the Department of Health and must be removed from the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>In the 1960s, officially recorded suicides averaged 60 per annum.  This figure is now in excess of 320.  In the 1960s, Ireland had one of the lowest rates of suicide in the world.  As in other countries, there was a level of under recording. Irish emigrants retained this low rate of suicide, although the rate was somewhat higher than among the Irish at home.  The rate in Ireland at that time was therefore genuinely low and the increase in the incidence of suicide cannot be attributed to changes in recording practices.  If this was the case there would be a consequential fall in accidental drownings, accidental poisonings and cases of open verdicts.  This has not happened.  The official increase in suicide levels since 1960 is about 400 per cent among men and 200 per cent among women.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the low level of suicide in the past, it is accepted that there has been an under recording of suicide incidence.  It is accepted that the true figures are two to three times the official rate.  In a study in County Limerick in 1989, which I referred to previously, Dr. Peter Kirwan of the Mid-Western Health Board found that the true suicide rate was 18.05 per 100,000 while the official figures for that period were 7.1 per 100,000.  The figures reported from Galway for 1978 showed a rate of 13.1 per 100,000 in contrast with the official figure which was 4.6 per 100,000, again <i>circa</i> three times the official rate.  These studies add further weight to the view that the official rates for suicide greatly underestimate the true position.  The figures could be in the region of 1,000 per year.</P>
    <P>The compilation of accurate figures is hampered by the fact that a coroner is precluded from returning a verdict of suicide. This makes the collection of accurate figures very difficult.  The information is obtained from the investigating garda <Col N="935" /> whose view is given to the Central Statistics Office.  I understand from the Minister's previous contribution that the existing prohibition on returning a verdict of suicide arises because such a finding involves investigation and consideration of the criminal liability of the deceased person for his own death and is therefore prohibited under section 30 of the Coroners Act, 1962.  I attempted to overcome this in my Bills in 1992 and 1993 but I understand from the Minister's statement to this House on 28 April last that once the offence of suicide is abolished, a finding of suicide will not attribute criminal liability to any person.  I understand that complicity in suicide will be an offence but provided the inquest does not investigate or consider who aided and abetted the suicide there is no conflict with section 30 of the Coroners Act.  My understanding from the Minister's submission on this issue is that, as and from the day this Bill is enacted in law &mdash; hopefully, in a month's time &mdash; coroners will be in a position to bring in verdicts of suicide at inquests.  I ask the Minister to confirm this because it has implications for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>While I still have some reservations regarding the public identification of suicide victims because of the traumatic effect on the bereaved, I accept the Minister's view that the blanket of silence should be removed and that it is not in the long term interests of those who have to overcome bereavement that the reality should be covered up.  My previous proposals in this area allowed for the issue in a case of self-inflicted death to be considered in private by the coroner.  The Minister's view is that such an approach would be dubious in the extreme and would run counter to the purpose of inquests which is to determine publicly the identify of the deceased and how, when and where death occurred.  The proposal for two types of procedure is not unique.  This is practised extensively on the Continent where there are quite sophisticated approaches in Sweden and in Switzerland.  However, the Minister decided to go further in this area than I <Col N="936" /> thought acceptable to society today.  I accept this and I am in favour of opening up the whole area of suicide, removing the stigma and taboo that surrounds it, and bringing Ireland into the 20th century in the way it reacts to the issue.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the coroner's hearing, I would like to refer briefly to the procedures involved which have been raised with me by the Samaritans and the Friends of the Suicide Bereaved on several occasions.  Attendance at inquests is one of the hardest parts of the suicide bereavement experience.  The trauma experienced in public by members of the family is extreme, with the bereaved often obliged to wait around in court listening to sad, tragic cases.  Surely waiting rooms could be provided where relatives could remain until their case is heard.  Everything should be done to ensure that the dignity of the bereaved of suicides, and indeed the bereaved of any tragedy, should be respected.  I would ask the Minister to look at the whole approach to the presence of bereaved families at the inquests of their loves ones.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us is similar to the Bill I introduced in 1991.  There are three sections in both, and the core of the Bill is that suicide shall cease to be a crime. I welcome section 1 (2) of the Bill which state that this Act shall come into operation one month after the date of its passing.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) is a very important aspect of the Bill in that it introduces criminal liability for complicity in suicide, stating:</P>
    <P>A person who aids, abets, counsels, or procures the suicide of another, or an attempt by another to commit suicide, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years.</P>
    <P>My original Bill specified a period of ten years, but I do not have any problem with the new proposal.</P>
    <P>Nothing must undermine the sanctity of human life or the general view of society that suicide, even though it will not be illegal, is a dreadful offence <Col N="937" /> against nature.  The sanctity of life is the rock on which our society is formed.  We must ensure that there is no movement towards putting a cost on preserving human life, and section 2 (2) of the Bill ensures that this is not changed in law. The wording of the section is almost identical to that of my Bills of 1991, 1992 and 1993.</P>
    <P>Now that the debate on decriminalising suicide has almost been completed, a debate must take place on reducing the levels of suicide and understanding the issue.  We must have a sane, rational and compassionate approach to those who commit, or attempt to commit, suicide. We must also understand the special bereavement problems of the families and friends of the victims.  Seven out of every ten people are affected in some way by the suicide of a member of their family or a friend.  The pressures of modern day living have changed our society.  There is extreme pressure to succeed and avoid failure, as judged by our peers.  We set standards and expectations for our young that places extreme pressure on them, while the fear of failure can bring about further pressures.  Are our value systems changing to a degree that makes life unbearable for those who cannot achieve our sometimes unrealistic goals?  Are changes in the cohesion of society, the high levels of unemployment, and the changes in traditional values, having a greater effect on our people than we realise?</P>
    <P>We need urgent research into the dramatic increase in suicide and attempted suicide amongst all age groups, but especially the young.  Society must change its attitude to those who attempt to commit suicide.  In most cases those who attempt suicide, if hospitalised, are given a quick psychiatric assessment and returned to the community.  The attitude in hospitals to such people often reflects attitudes in the community at large: &ldquo;they are taking up a bed for someone who is genuinely ill&rdquo;, or, &ldquo;they are taking up scarce medical resources required for people who really need them&rdquo;.  This is a symptom of society's ignorance of the social, and even pathological, disease <Col N="938" /> that suicide and attempted suicide represent.</P>
    <P>We must embark on an intensive programme of education and discussion to change our outmoded medieval attitudes. Society must realise that this is a social disease.  We must treat it and must acknowledge the relationship between suicide rates and other changes in society, including the levels of unemployment. We must realise that a changing society, a secular society and a society that is less cohesive will have an increase in suicide rates.  That has been the experience in other countries.  We must acknowledge and deal with such a problem.  People who become suicidal must know that they are not alone, that help is available, that their extreme despair is at most a transitory emotion, and that society recognises their position as a health problem which can be treated.  An intensive educational programme is required to reach this stage, and it must not be delayed.  We must develop anti-suicide programmes.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the Minister's statement on the difficulties involved with, and her approach to, suicide in prisons. Fine Gael's motion No. 18 on today's Order Paper deals precisely with this issue and refers to suicide rates in prison, as well as calling on the Government to introduce the suicide prevention strategy in prisons as recommended by the 1991 Advisory Committee on Prison Deaths. The motion also calls for improved psychological services for prisoners, in addition to allowing the Samaritans to have access to prisoners.  I raised this point earlier with the Minister and I am pleased with her response today.  Perhaps she would look at item 18 on today's Order Paper which details the changes Fine Gael is calling on the Government to introduce.</P>
    <P>I thank everybody who supported the decriminalising of suicide including those who contacted me over the years, and particularly the psychiatric service personnel who urged us to continue with our aims.  I hope today we are beginning to recognise suicide for what it is &mdash; a public health issue and not a crime.</P>
    <Col N="939" />
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I accept the Minister's explanation regarding the delay in introducing the Bill, and I join in thanking Senator Neville for his input and concern which was welcomed by everybody.  The Minister has rightly recognised the important contribution made by Senator Neville.</P>
      <P>It is not easy to talk about the subject matter of this Bill.  I come from a part of Donegal that has had its share of problems with a number of young people taking their own lives.  The Minister indicated in her contribution that those at high risk are young boys between 15 and 16 years of age.  I welcome the decriminalising of suicide, as will many parents who have suffered in this way.  It is a very sad time for any family.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated certain factors that give rise to suicide, including, &ldquo;physical and mental illness, alcoholism, personality structure and social isolation&rdquo;. Another factor is the life image projected on the screen. I know we cannot blame television for all our ills and failures, yet there is an image which is projected in advertisements showing the glamorous life that some people are accustomed to in certain areas.  It is hard in these circumstances for young people to understand how their own seeming failure is brought about.</P>
      <P>Some young people do not have the courage to accept their lot in life and to hope for and work towards their future. Many young people are disappointed when they find themselves with less than their neighbours or with less than the world appears to have in goods, wealth and prosperity.  This problem will become greater.  One may argue it is a matter for the Minister for Health or the health boards.  It is also a matter for the educational authorities in primary and secondary schools.  This is not a taboo subject to be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have met many families where young people committed suicide.  In one tragic case, two boys in one family killed themselves. To have suicide classified as a criminal offence on top of the loss is more than should be imposed on any family. <Col N="940" /> The Bill is welcome. All legislation takes time to come to this stage.</P>
    <P>I have a query about the use of the word &ldquo;committed&rdquo;.  Does the use of the phrase &ldquo;committed suicide&rdquo; indicate an offence?  If a different word is available I suggest we use it.</P>
    <P>Everyone in public life has met families where there has been a suicide and has had the unpleasant task of being present there.  On three occasions I have called upon people contemplating suicide.  I took an approach which I did not take from a book and might have been unorthodox. I tried to counsel those people by saying no-one could help them and it was a personal decision.  I said people could not give them advice after the fact. I said I had studied life and had attended many funerals of young and old.  I had noticed that in the early morning a graveyard is a lonely place.  I suggested that a person contemplating suicide spend one night there while alive and assess their lot after that.  One would be a long time in the graveyard, for a definite duration. I do not know whether my advice was followed but none of the three committed suicide.</P>
    <P>The reality of suicide must be impressed upon anyone who contemplates it.  There is no better way than to suggest such a person spend a night in a graveyard.  One will have no difficulty deciding after that.  The Minister says it depends who is with you in the graveyard. That is the lighter side of the issue.</P>
    <P>The saddest function one performs is attending the funeral of a young person. One walks away from the grave and no words can express the sense of tragedy that a young life is left behind cemetery walls.  I do not claim to have a solution but one must extend friendship and concern to families affected by this problem.</P>
    <P>I urge that attention be paid to danger signs at primary and secondary level. Children may be indicating distress by remaining isolated or not getting involved in play groups or the social life of a school.  Attempts should be made and facilities provided to identify these high risk children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> This Bill is a great step forward. Nationally, there is no conflict on the issue.  We had difficulties bringing the Bill to implementation.  Nevertheless it is important to have a Bill accepted by all parties.  In decriminalising suicide, we have taken a step towards relieving the burden of guilt on the bereaved.  I thank the Minister for her concern, input and reasonable approach to this important legislation which is a significant achievement. It may not gain headlines tomorrow but it is a humane piece of legislation, long overdue.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. Like everyone else I welcome the Bill to the House.  Tribute must be paid to Senator Neville who has pursued this matter for several years.  He was told once there would be an immediate response but immediate meant years.  I was glad when the current Minister promised an immediate response there was one.</P>
      <P>During the reading of Senator Neville's Bill here I was critical of what went on in the prisons.  I thank the Minister for her prompt response to me on that occasion and for her speech today.  It is dreadful that people who have been incarcerated, often for petty crimes, cannot be given 24 hour surveillance.  It is impossible to provide the money needed for that and therefore people sometimes commit suicide in prison cells.  I compliment her for what she has done in this regard.</P>
      <P>Coroners are also due praise.  For many years they have pressed for the decriminalisation of suicide.  Dr Bartley Sheehan of Dún Laoghaire has been vociferous on this issue.  A large number of suicides are dealt with in the Coroner's Court.  The possibility of it being labelled a criminal offence is an added hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The medical profession have been dealing with attempted suicide for a long time.  Definite figures are difficult to obtain but I was appalled to see recently that for every suicide there may be 50 attempts. It is important to remember this is not just an Irish problem, it happens internationally. We can look at other countries to see what can be <Col N="942" /> learned from their efforts to decrease the incidence of suicide in their jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>It is always stressed how sad suicide is among the young. It is terrible that those in their twenties with their lives before them experience such despair.  The average age for suicide is actually 41.  A large number of old and lonely people who feel their lives have been entirely useless, commit suicide.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that schoolchildren commit suicide. I am glad the Stay Safe programme lays major emphasis on bullying and attempts to confront that problem.  It is important to attempt to do something with that because very often when these sad cases are investigated, the victims who commit suicide have themselves been victims of serious bullying at school.  There must be a considered approach to the issue.  While unemployment, depression, previous psychiatric illness and other such factors are important, there is a range of other factors which occur at different age groups.  It is a large ethical and moral issue that must be examined.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill is of great importance to the medical, nursing and paramedical professions, and also to the family and friends of a very ill or incapacitated person who may wish to commit suicide. There are some people whose life becomes so unbearable that this is their wish.  I am not referring to euthanasia, but rather the conscious wish of the person.  It is important to undertake a long philosophical examination of this issue.  It is not an issue we have considered in this country, however it has become a serious problem, particularly in the USA.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has indicated that proceedings cannot be taken against any person for aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring except by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  This is important for the medical profession, including nurses and paramedics, who can encounter considerable trouble in this area.  For example, in a recent medical defence report, the widower of a woman who committed suicide tried to have her doctor brought before a disciplinary <Col N="943" /> committee because the doctor had prescribed 30 anti-depressant tablets for his wife, two to be taken each day. The woman ingested all 30 tablets together and the widower alleged that the doctor should have known his wife would take them in order to commit suicide.</P>
    <P>Senator Maloney would agree that it would be impossible to supervise every person who was given 30 anti-depressant tablets.  Furthermore, if any doctor or paramedic who prescribed such tablets were to be charged with aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring a very serious situation would arise.  However, it is important to note in this debate that events like this can happen.  Fortunately, in this case the disciplinary committee did not agree with the complaint and considered the doctor's actions to be within reasonable medical practice.</P>
    <P>Normal medical treatment which the patient misuses to commit suicide cannot be foreseen by a doctor.  However, there are situations in other jurisdictions where patients who wished to commit suicide have been allowed to do so.  For example, in Canada there was the case of a girl who was a quadriplegic from a car accident and could not survive without the resuscitator on which she was dependent. After two and a half years she appealed to the courts to allow her to have the respirator turned off as she had a right to die.  She was living in a room where all she could do was watch television and it was modern medicine that was keeping her alive.  The Canadian courts acceded to her request.</P>
    <P>All human life is scared, and that is recognised in this country.  However, the intervention of modern medicine can keep many people alive for a long time when only a few short years ago they would have died.  How are the rights of such people, who are mentally competent, to be addressed?  Are we in a position to decide what is in their best interest?</P>
    <P>This issue is different from euthanasia. The law can appear illogical.  On the one hand, one could allow a respitator to be <Col N="944" /> turned off, and the person smothers to death; or one could allow a person to starve to death &mdash; I hope force feeding would not be advocated; or a person could be allowed refuse medical treatment on grounds of religious belief, such as the Jehovah's Witnesses who do not accept blood transfusions, but on the other, lethal injections for people who are dying in pain are outlawed.</P>
    <P>These are decisions which we make as a society and I do not advocate any specific approach to them.  However, from a philosophical, ethical and moral viewpoint, they are decisions which must be carefully considered, especially because of changes in modern medicine.  For many people, quality of life is more important than the length of life.  For example, when a great athlete gets older and has trouble walking he might consider that to be a severe problem but to me, a person who was never interested in athletics, this would not be a problem. People's view of life varies and it is important that we adopt an active approach to this problem.</P>
    <P>I have viewed developments in medicine in America over the past 20 years. America is at the cutting edge of hightech medicine, and it has an ageing population. Serious problems have arisen there regarding the quality of life of older people.  Approximately 25 per cent of the money people in America spend on medical care is expanded in the last six months of their lives.  In this context &ldquo;living wills&rdquo; are becoming common in America and elsewhere.  When a person is fully competent and before the onset of any serious illness, he can request his doctor and his nearest and dearest not to take any extraordinary measures to prevent death.  It is important to distinguish this process from assisted suicide.</P>
    <P>This issue requires urgent consideration, especially in view of a recent survey of American hospital doctors. Two of the statistics in the survey are disturbing.  First, 70 per cent of respondents said they felt that they overtreated patients who were approaching death. This is not something we would like to <Col N="945" /> think would happen to us or to anyone we love.  Second, 70 per cent of respondents thought they under-treated their patients with analgesia because they were too afraid that if the analgesia shortened the patient's life they would be accused of hastening their death.  This is not the philosophy of the hospice, and I would not like it to become the norm in this country.  We must be careful about overtreatment of patients, including prolonged periods in intensive care units hooked up to machines with tubes in every orifice and, worse still, withholding drugs, such as morphine.</P>
    <P>Administering morphine to a dying patient is not going to make that patient a drug addict.  Patients have a right to drugs; they should not be subjected to an undignified death because of the views of those treating them.  This is an area that needs to be opened to much wider consideration. I am glad Senator Neville pressed to have this Bill introduced.</P>
    <P>Stillbirths were not talked about for many years, but when they were brought into the public arena people were able to cope much better with the death of a child.  It has been suggested that decriminalising suicide would make it more difficult for bereaved families because coroners could say that deaths were due to suicide.  I do not think this will be the case. The present situation is tragic because the bereaved cannot seek help and comfort from those around them by discussing what has happened.  This makes it more difficult for them.</P>
    <P>Controversy about lack of analgesia and the overuse of intensive care and high technology medicine for people who are dying is closely connected with the fact that doctors fear legal action by relatives if they do not do all in their power to keep patients alive.  Situations where the wishes of patients are overridden by relatives are difficult to deal with because death with dignity is desired by most of us.</P>
    <P>This is totally different from the situation in England recently where a doctor in Wiltshire, Dr. Nigel Cox, gave a lethal injection of potassium chloride, <Col N="946" /> which has no analgesic powers, to a longtime patient of his who was in terrible pain and wished to die.  This doctor could have been charged with murder but for the fact that his patient's body had been cremated.  He was charged with attempted murder and received a suspended sentence because of this history of his relationship with the patient over such a long time.</P>
    <P>It is very important that it be an offence to aid, abet, or counsel another person to commit suicide.  There are situations where this is happening.  For example, in Michigan until very recently the law on aiding and abetting suicide was very lax. I believe it was the only state in the US where it was not a crime.  A doctor in Detroit, whom the American popular press called &ldquo;Dr. Death&rdquo; but whose real name was Dr. Kevorkian, perfected a suicide machine which he kept in the back of a van.  Patients who wished to commit suicide, most of whom were terminally ill, consulted him.  After he discussed the matter with patients, who were sometimes accompanied by relatives, he brought them into the van, inserted needles in their arms and asked them to press a button which gave a lethal injection. This is so horrific it is unbelievable, but it shows what can happen in the absence of laws prohibiting the aiding and abetting of suicide. The doctor was certainly involved in the deaths of nine people before legislation was enacted which outlawed aiding and abetting suicide. One of the nine was a 53-year-old woman who thought she had Alzheimer's disease. The main reason given for this diagnosis was that while she could still play tennis she found it very hard to keep the score.</P>
    <P>This is a very important Bill and I hope it will be considered very carefully on Committee Stage.  This Bill should initiate a national debate on this issue. We will all grow older.  The elderly represent an increasing proportion of our population.  When an uncle of mine died in America following what I consider gross over treatment, his widow's only plea to us was that we would not allow her to be admitted to hospital prior to her death.  We managed to do that.  I <Col N="947" /> certainly would not like a situation where the wishes of patients are overridden.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome her statement on Senator Neville's Bill to decriminalise suicide.  I congratulate him on the work he has done in this area.</P>
      <P>I worked in the psychiatric service for many years and have seen many cases of suicide where people hanged themselves, slashed their wrists or throats, immersed themselves in boiling water of 250 degrees Fahrenheit and died from shock or took tablets from hospital trolleys when staff were under pressure at night. One's concern afterwards is for the parents. It is more difficult for bereaved families to cope with deaths from suicide than deaths from road accidents or serious illnesses.  Parents and relatives of suicide victims even after 15 or 20 years still talk about these deaths and still feel stigmatised.</P>
      <P>Suicides in Ireland increased fourfold in the 20 years to 1988.  That is the figure for recorded suicides.  I have no doubt that the real figure is much higher.  People are reluctant to disclose that a relative has committed suicide and give other reasons for sudden death.  Until 1988 the figure for male suicides in Ireland was 12.2 per 100,000.  Surprisingly, the rate of female suicides was 3.4 per 100,000, almost a quarter of the male figure.  We may have something to learn from these statistics.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to collect suicide statistics. It is unacceptable for coroners to bring in a verdict of suicide. They have to record death from suspected suicide as self-induced. The rural suicide rate in Ireland is much higher than the urban rate.  Loneliness and isolation may be two of the main reasons for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suicide rate among prisoners increased dramatically in recent years, especially among younger prisoners.  It is perfectly understandable in the liberal times in which we live that young people find it very hard to be locked up and accept the prison regime, which is tough. They are institutionalised, taken out of society and are away from their family <Col N="948" /> and loved ones.  All this probably increases the possibility of suicide.</P>
    <P>Suicide is not a disease, it is the result of a number of factors, usually emotional ones such as guilt and sorrow.  It is wrong to classify as a crime the committing of suicide by a person left to face life alone after a bereavement.  That is why I welcome this Bill.  The present law in my estimation is an ass and it is good to see it being removed.  Shame and fear are other reasons for committing suicide. We may never unearth all of the reasons. Increases in suicide have corresponded with increases in drug and alcohol abuse. These problems come to the fore in our liberalised society.  Increased suicide figures seem to be connected with these trends.  In the areas where I worked young men seemed to be more susceptible to suicide than females.  Many attempted and actual suicides took place as a result of broken romances which young men were unable to accept. That women can take such events better says much about the female character.</P>
    <P>Unemployment also leads people to commit suicide.  Such cases have recently been highlighted by the media.  The sad case in Limerick comes to mind.  Marriage problems are another cause, especially when one spouse leaves another. Religious beliefs also have an effect, a recent example was the mass suicide in America by members of a religious cult. In Ireland sexual problems have been highlighted dramatically in recent years, maybe at times for the wrong reasons. These problems are also a cause of suicide. Suicide may seem to be way out of situations such as the rape of a young girl and incest within a family with which people may not be able to cope because of the hangups society seems to have. Suicides in some areas seem to have a spiral effect.  A suicide by one person seems to encourage others to do the same.  Senator McGowan mentioned that this happens in Donegal where both he and I live.  This is a very sad situation.</P>
    <P>What can be done in situations where suicide is a possibility?  It is advantageous when a person is admitted to a psychiatric hospital to know if he or she has suicidal <Col N="949" /> tendencies.  Nursing a person with a suicidal tendency is one of the toughest jobs imaginable.  One must ensure that such persons do not commit suicide.  Praise is due to the psychiatric staff in Ireland for their care of suicidal persons.  I worked in St. Conal's Psychiatric Hospital in Letterkenny, County Donegal where nursing and medical staff often spend months rehabilitating suicidal men and women.</P>
    <P>What happens when people who admit themselves to hospital decide to leave of their own accord?  Nursing staff do not have the right to keep them in hospital, even though they may be suicidal and their parents concerned.  However, will the parents decide to commit them to hospital even when they know suicide is a possibility?  Often, parents do not and people die.</P>
    <P>Research in the psychiatric services shows that 50 per cent of the people who have committed suicide intended to do so and had made previous attempts.  This is a high figure and it gives an indication of the task ahead.</P>
    <P>We must be aware of warning signs. However, I remember the case of a 15-year-old who was participating in a hospital programme to help him overcome depression.  Half an hour before he was due to be discharged, he hung himself with a leather belt.  He had not given any indication of his intention to commit suicide.</P>
    <P>Suicidal people have been discharged from psychiatric hospitals.  This concerns me because the psychiatric services are now sending many people back into the community.  There is a lack of proper back up facilities for these people, some of whom should not be discharged.  The Department of Health should ensure that proper back up facilities and care are provided for people who are being discharged from psychiatric hospitals.  I would not like to think people are being discharged for economic reasons.  Many go back into their own communities and are unable to cope after being institutionalised for twenty years.</P>
    <P>Countries such as America and Canada have intervention programmes in the form of educational and mental health <Col N="950" /> programmes and specific suicide programmes. I ask the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, to examine the possibility of introducing such programmes in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I also send a warning to the media which often sensationalises the Irish suicide problem.  They should give more assistance to the general public by featuring articles about what can be done to assist suicidal people.  We read about the sensational cases, but not enough is being done to alleviate the problem.  The media should work with the Department of Education and the Department of Health to prevent suicide.</P>
    <P>Many psychiatric staff are trained as therapists enabling them to talk to the suicidal person and to develop their trust in a one-to-one relationship.  The results from counselling and therapy are significant. Many people leaving hospitals are more positive and assertive because of the help they have received.  They have learnt to control their problem.</P>
    <P>The Samaritans do a tremendous job. However, as a voluntary organisation they are unable to provide this service in rural areas where it is badly needed. Recently I read about the telephone charges.  I hope the Samaritans are not affected because for people who talk to them on the telephone for a considerable length of time it may mean the difference between life and death.  This point should be taken into consideration and the Samaritans commended for the work they do.</P>
    <P>Other groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Gamblers Anonymous must also be supported because they too bring to the attention of the authorities and the medical people the fact that certain people intend to commit suicide. People have been saved as a result of their action.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill to decriminalise suicide. How can a person be charged when they are dead?  Primary intervention is needed to stop suicide.  The health boards have a major role to play in this area.  A life skills programme will educate people early about the help which is available. The public must be made aware of that help before they take that final step.  I <Col N="951" /> call on the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, to develop a national policy on suicide prevention.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and I hope it will be passed quickly in the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Criminal Law (Suicide) (No. 2) Bill, 1993.  I welcome the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, to the House.  We were disappointed the Minister initiated this Bill in the Dáil, rather than in the Seanad.  I know the Minister was not directly responsible for this but that it happened because of a lack of Government legislation making the Minister a victim of Government.  I know the Minister intended to reintroduce it here rather than in the other House.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed the Minister did not accept Senator Neville's Bill.  The Minister's Bill, as introduced in the Dáil and now in the Seanad, is almost identical to that Bill, with the exception of a few minor changes in the terminology. However, I am pleased the Minister has acknowledged in her speech the efforts of Senator Neville over a number of years to highlight this important issue and to register it in the Department of Justice as a matter requiring urgent attention.  I am delighted the Minister and the Department of Justice have finally responded and that this legislation is almost complete.</P>
      <P>It is ridiculous that suicide is a crime because it is impossible to take a dead person to court, as Senator Maloney said. It is now time to remove suicide from the list of indictable offences on our Statute Book.  The issue must be treated with sensitivity, compassion and understanding.</P>
      <P>Many Irish families have been affected by the tragedy of suicide.  In many areas, even today, reference will be made to the fact that a certain member of a family committed suicide 50 years ago.  As a result, the family's sanity may be questioned. This is sad and it shows that society is not aware of the reasons why people commit suicide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" /> Other Senators have attempted to identify the many reasons why suicide is committed.  We must acknowledge that many who commit suicide are extra sensitive and are unable to cope with the pressures and difficulties of modern society.  We have not identified these difficulties or responded to the serious circumstances in which people find themselves.</P>
    <P>We must have an open national discussion about the reasons for suicide and about the lack of facilities and support for potential victims.  Yesterday Mother Teresa was conferred with the Freedom of the City.  During her address to the people she referred to the dearth of neighbourliness and the lack of community support.  People experience not only financial poverty, but also poverty of relationship and community.  People who feel that there is no concern for them in their family or community are often driven to suicide.  In this modern society where people are always in a hurry and operate under severe pressure, we must depend on people close to them, whether in their own family or in their neighbourhood, to watch for signs of difficulties, and if they see such signs, to be prepared to take action.  Because of their inhibitions, people are often reluctant to make the necessary advance.  In some cases I have heard about if people had only had the courage and confidence in themselves to talk and relate to people who have stresses and difficulties some of these unfortunate instances could have been avoided.</P>
    <P>There is no point talking about the past.  We need to look to the future and perhaps the Minister for Justice, with the Minister of Education, could ensure that this matter is covered in second level education.  Young people come under stress.  It is not unusual in their exam years, particularly at leaving certificate and in the early years at university, for them to experience pressure and to feel unable to cope.  Others around them might be in a position to recognise this if they were alerted and had been educated in this area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the social services and <Col N="953" /> psychiatric services, I am worried about the level of support being provided at local level at present.  In recent years we have seen psychiatric patients leaving psychiatric hospitals and going into community care.  Unfortunately, the necessary support is not being provided for community care at ground level and many difficulties have arisen and many suicides have occurred as a result.  This area must be urgently examined.  Voluntary groups have done great work in this regard; the Samaritans have already been complimented here today.  They are one group and many others have done great work providing support and help for these unfortunate people who are under stress, and many of these groups have prevented people taking their own lives. There is a need for stronger professional support on the ground.</P>
    <P>Senator Maloney referred to the difficulties which the psychiatric services have in dealing with the situation.  There seems to be a reluctance among some medical personnel to commit a person for psychiatric care. They are inclined to try to treat the person at home and often not give them the care necessary.  This can be due to a lack of facilities in various institutions, and that is extremely unfortunate. This issue affects thousands of families who are traumatised by a suicide. Many of them find it difficult to cope and we must provide a support service for them.  It is important that the local community, neighbours and friends, provide the support that is essential.  Rather than shunning the families, they should talk to them.  People often feel awkward and embarrassed and do not know how to make the necessary approach.  That is unfortunate.  Much of this is due to the stigma the community attaches to suicide. Thankfully that has reduced in recent years but in some areas it still exists.</P>
    <P>I hope that, as a result of the decriminalisation of suicide there will be a greater public understanding of suicide. However, that can only occur through discussion in this House and public discussion generally.  Only then will suicide be seen for what it is, only then will the <Col N="954" /> trauma suffered by families be recognised, only then will the factors that can lead a potential victim to suicide be recognised and the necessary preventative measures taken.</P>
    <P>I compliment Senator Neville for his consistent, diligent and genuine approach over the past two or three years to bring this matter to public attention.  I also compliment him for introducing three Bills in this House.  He succeeded in getting the Department to introduce the necessary legislation.  I would also like to compliment the present Minister for introducing this important Bill; had it been another Minister it might not have happened.  I wish her well and I hope she will be in a position to tackle other important issues which, for a variety of reasons, have not been tackled by former Ministers.  She has the will and the determination not to stand back and that she will take on the work ahead of her with diligence and courage which is her hallmark.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate her for introducing this Bill.  It is a positive step forward for all of us who deal with young people who face tremendous pressures.  I am happy to see the Bill decriminalise this taboo which has existed in society for many years and it will allow us to look at this subject in a new light.  The taboo nature of suicide reminds me of tuberculosis &mdash; in the past it could not even be mentioned but now it can be spoken about.</P>
      <P>In the past 20 years the pressures of life have been one of the main causes of suicide.  I would like to refer particularly to the pressures of the university points system.  This is an area in which I have experience and I have come across many young people who, because of the pressure of getting points for university or being pressurised by their parents into a particular lifestyle or career, have attempted or committed suicide.  This has been a cause of distress and this trauma will remain with families for the rest of their lives.  Suicide is often the result of an emotional upset, but it is something a family will never forget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="955" /> We need to talk about suicide and bring it out into the open.  If not, it will be swept under the carpet and we will be back to square one.  I am glad the Minister has opened the subject, but we need to ask to what extent society can adapt to that attitude.  The first step should be through our education system.  I know the Minister has a strategy in relation to attempted suicides in prison.  We must see how best we can prevent suicides in our prisons.  Having read the Minister's speech we should try to involve the Department of Education more.  Perhaps young people, who feel they have nothing to live for, who are suffering from posttraumatic stress and who are unable to cope, could avail of second chance education. We must involve counsellors and psychologists.  I am aware that the Minister has increased the number of counsellors and psychologists in the prison system.  These young people should be removed from the prison system and rehabilitated through our education system.  This would be a welcome development.</P>
    <P>We must also involve the family.  In the past, we tended to work in isolation.  We all have a role to play, but we must not work in isolation.  This is an extended area and we must involve parents, family, relations and medical personnel.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry spoke about psychotherapy versus medication.  Perhaps we should move away from medication towards psychotherapy.  I have experience in this area and, while medication is important, I believe psychotherapy on a one-to-one basis deserves priority.  The Department of Justice and the Department of Health must allocate sufficient funds to this area.</P>
    <P>We must decriminalise suicide and make it a non taboo subject. Suicide may often be attributed to family problems, including marital breakdown.  Some young people grow up in an unstable environment.  They are unable to cope and internalise everything that happens to them.  The prevention of suicide begins in the family.  I realise that part of the prevention process necessitates the decriminalisation <Col N="956" /> of suicide.  The Minister is guiding us in the right direction by opening up this subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has acknowledged the work done by this House.  I believe she regrets the fact that this Bill was taken from this House to fill a deficiency in the other House.  That kind of behaviour is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" /> It is important that this legislation is passed.  We should not worry unduly over the name attributed to it.  It is important that suicide is decriminalised.</P>
    <P>The Minister highlighted some interesting facts in relation to suicide.  It is tragic that young men between the ages of 15 and 25 are a high risk category.  I welcome the Minister's other proposals in, for example, the area of homosexual law reform.  This is a concealed factor. Although I know six people who were murdered, one of whom, a pastor of the Baptist church in Paris, was murdered by the French secret police, I do not know directly anyone who has committed suicide because of being gay.  I know a number of people who have committed suicide, including a professional colleague who became depressed because of the conditions in which he was working. I understand, however, that suicide is more likely to occur in the 15 to 25 year age group if the individual is homosexual. It is a way out for those who have not come to terms with their sexuality.</P>
    <P>I do not admire suicide; it is an act of aggression.  It is not only an act of aggression against the self, but it is an act of aggression against the family or the colleagues of the individual, who are often devastated by the suicide.  It is appropriate to decriminalise the offence of suicide and attempted suicide.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the historical background to this offence.  It was not created by statute but by the unwritten law of England as interpreted by judges. The Minister can not offer a satisfactory explanation as to why suicide became a criminal offence, other than it was regarded as self-murder.</P>
    <P>I have recently been reading the history of the early papacy.  The Minister may not be aware of the tradition among early medieval popes of exhuming the remains of their predecessors.  They then tried them for heresy and executed the corpses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps this offence has an ecclesiastical background.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="958" /> The Minister pointed out that the property of a person who committed suicide was forfeited and the surviving relatives were disinherited, thus compounding their grief.</P>
    <P>There was a practice in England where people were buried at a crossroads with a stake through their hearts.  This affords me the opportunity to introduce the subject of James Joyce's <i>Ulysses.</i>  In the Hades episode, there is a poignant discussion on suicide in the carriage on the way to Glasnevin cemetery.  This discussion emanated from the attempted suicide of a young man, Reuben J. Dodd. One of the characters intervenes to say that suicide is the worst offence of all, not realising that Leopold Bloom's father had committed suicide in the Queen's hotel in Ennis, County Clare, by taking aconite.  Bloom recalls that people were buried at a crossroads with a stake through their hearts, as if the heart was not broken already.</P>
    <P>The Minister is addressing this human factor in this enlightened Bill.  It is inhumane to arraign before a criminal court people who have been placed in circumstances so distressing that they make an attempt upon their own lives and then further to penalise them under the criminal law rather than deal with them in a therapeutic situation.  I am glad the Minister has seen fit to lighten this burden by the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have one reservation about the Bill. Section 2 (2) makes it an offence for any person to aid, abet, counsel or procure the suicide or an attempt at suicide of another person.  It seems illogical that assisting somebody to commit an act which is no longer criminal is in itself a criminal offence.  I understand some of the reasoning because it has been put to me that, for example, in the case of an elderly person with substantial property, undue psychological pressure might be placed upon them to encourage them to take the easy way out &mdash; particularly easy for the relatives if they were hoping to inherit.  I acknowledge this difficulty but I am aware of situations where assistance in suicide was not only honourable but was also a morally desirable act.  It is one <Col N="959" /> which I would not have the courage to perform, but I know people who have.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Henry, has spoken on the medical aspects and she is particularly qualified to speak in this area.  It is good that we have somebody of this standing to contribute such material to our debate.  She may have mentioned a case which I discussed with Senator Neville during a previous debate on this Bill.  I cannot remember the name of the woman involved, but the doctor was a Dr. Nigel Cox.  The patient suffered from rheumatoid arthritis and was in the last extremities of agony.  Her son described her as howling in pain like a dog and begging to be assisted out of this appalling situation.  The doctor gave her an injection of potassium chloride, which is a salt, and apparently this painlessly put her down.  The family expressed considerable gratitude.</P>
    <P>The doctor was brought before a disciplinary tribunal and censured.  He did not lose his licence but he was reprimanded and his career was clearly affected.  It seems to me that he acted humanely.  The woman was in the terminal stages of an illness, racked with pain, covered with bedsores and in an appalling state.  A dog in a similar state would be put down.  Why should we treat a human being with less compassion?  Is it criminal to assist somebody's mother, brother, sister, aunt, lover, somebody they cared about, to end such appalling pain?  I think he was a good and caring doctor and all his colleagues believed the same, but because of the state of the law in England he had to be disciplined and his career has been seriously affected.  He could easily have been sent to jail.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of provision which is being introduced here and I regret it.  I understand the argument that people may be put under some kind of pressure but at the same time it is wrong and illogical to make assisting at a non-criminal offence, a criminal offence itself.</P>
    <P>I was very moved when a close friend of mine in Israel, who is a most fastidious person, gave up his job when one of our friends, called Rafi, developed AIDS. <Col N="960" /> Rafi's friend was in the airforce and could not look after him.  My friend looked after him for six weeks in situations of considerable discomfort and uncleanliness. The man became incontinent and so on and died.  A second friend of ours became ill with AIDS.  He believed he was in a monogamous relationship, but unfortunately his partner was not monogamous and both of them contracted AIDS.  This man died on his own, apart from the assistance which my friend Ezra gave to him.  In the terminal stages, when he was no longer physically capable of administering whatever poisons he had accumulated with the intention of giving himself a dignified exit, he asked my friend to assist him to die, which he did. I found that an act of extraordinary courage and moral nobility.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that I would have the courage to assist at a suicide, although I have never been placed in that situation. I believe it was the right thing to do in that case.  If somebody whom one really cares about is in extraordinary distress, pain and discomfort, and if they know clearly what they are doing and they beg one to help them to end their life in dignity, which may be just a matter of 24, 36 or 48 hours, I believe it is a moral act to do so and I do not believe that it should be punished.  I accept that there are arguments in this matter but on balance I would come down on that side.</P>
    <P>I am slightly worried about section 2 (3) because, as the Minister explained, it allows the introduction of a verdict of assisting at suicide rather than murder or manslaughter in, for example, the case of a failed joint suicide in which only one person is successful in the act.  I wonder what purpose is served by prosecuting the unsuccessful suicide.  It should be a matter for therapeutic treatment rather than criminal prosecution, although it may be the Minister's intention, if I am reading it correctly, to reduce the severity of the accusation from one of manslaughter or murder to one of assisting at suicide.  However, the penalties are very severe, in the region of 15 years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> I have another reservation which concerns the involvement of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I wonder if the Minister is satisfied with the operation of that office.  I certainly am not and I will inform the House why.  It concerns legislation on incitement to hatred.  I occasionally receive offensive material but I normally do not worry about it. I am sure the Minister receives similar post.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure that in recent months the Minister has received some fairly interesting post, as I have.  I imagine that she treats it with the same amused contempt as I do.  Some prominent women citizens of Galway wrote to me enclosing the front page of a rag called <i>The Galway Advertiser</i> which was a clear incitement to hatred.  On 8 April, because they were requesting me to take some action as they were so distressed about it, I sent it to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I did not receive any reply. I telephoned yesterday, and I was told there had been a mistake and that there was a letter in the pipeline.  That letter was typed after my telephone call and it just stated baldly that they did not intend to prosecute.  I would like to know why they do not intend prosecuting.  It was a clear case of incitement to hatred and I am not satisfied that no action is being taken.  I did not even receive the courtesy of the normal response which states that the office has received one's letter and it is being brought to the attention of the Minister or the Director of Public Prosecutions. If another group had been attacked would some action have been taken?  I question the placing of this matter directly in the hands of an individual, whose judgment I occasionally suspect.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister has addressed at some length the situation with regard to suicide in the prison service. This matter was been ventilated repeatedly in this House, especially by <Col N="962" /> former Senator Costello who took a particular interest in this matter and raised it on several occasions.  The Minister has indicated the various improvements which she is proposing in this area.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that I welcome the Bill.  It is a progressive and enlightened measure, as I would expect from this Minister.  I have, however, a couple of reservations, the principal one being the introduction of an offence of assisting the commission of suicide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate her on this legislation. I also congratulate Senator Neville who worked tirelessly for many years on what was, at times, an unpopular issue.  The purpose of this Bill is to abolish the crime of suicide and thereby remove the stigma of criminality from those who feel that suicide is the only solution to their problems. For that fundamental reason I support this legislation.</P>
      <P>When deliberating on the Bill we must never lose sight of the fact that suicide is a human tragedy.  The American author, William Styron, in his revealing book on depression called <i>Darkness Visible</i> offers considerable insight into the feelings that lead to suicide.  Ultimately he sees suicide as the final act of someone who can no longer tolerate the pain and suffering of life: it is an act of release, a final act of utter loneliness and despair.  That is the true tragedy of suicide, a tragedy that leaves permanent scars on families and friends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who commit suicide deserve our compassion; those whom it scars deserve our support.  Moral indignation helps no-one. The Bill recognises the need for compassion.  The criminalisation of suicide has done nothing to eliminate the problem and was originally introduced because male suicide deprived the king of a good fighting soldier.  Instead the criminalisation of suicide has caused guilt and shame among friends and family of the deceased.  Although no person has been prosecuted in this jurisdiction for attempted suicide since about 1967, the mere presence of the criminalising provision on the Statute Book had a stigmatising <Col N="963" /> effect.  This Bill marks a fundamental change in the State's approach to the problem of suicide.  It heralds the dawn of a more enlightened attitude and demonstrates the progress made by a society which now recognises the value of therapy and counselling for potential suicide victims and for those bereaved by suicide.</P>
    <P>The Bill is concise and in common with other speakers I would like to focus on section 2 (2) which deals with aiding, abetting and procuring the suicide of another. Unlike Senator Norris, I welcome this provision.  Somebody who aids, abets, procures and counsels a suicide does not necessarily do so for altruistic reasons.  It may not be a situation like that outlined by Senator Norris in which a man helped his friend, who was suffering from a severe illness, to commit suicide. Assistance to a suicide may be offered by somebody who has an ulterior motive: for example, to benefit through inheritance. Hence, this offence must be instituted.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals only with the criminal law aspects of suicide.  In 1990 and 1991 there were over 300 suicides each year, a harrowing figure that calls for an understanding of the severity of problems confronting people.  One of the better known studies of the problem of suicide was conducted by Dr. Michael Kelleher, a consultant psychiatrist on suicide in Cork, and Miss Maura Daly, and was published in the <i>British Journal of Psychiatry.</i> They highlighted the many factors which probably, in their opinion, contribute towards the decision of an individual to commit suicide.  Those included physical and mental illness, alcoholism, personality structure and social isolation.</P>
    <P>There has been an alarming increase in recent years in the number of suicides in Irish prisons.  I am glad the Government and the Department of Justice have undertaken to implement many of the recommendations made by an advisory group that was set up to look into the problem.  We can only hope that in future the number of prison suicides can be kept to an absolute minimum.  We cannot expect they will be eliminated because <Col N="964" /> one cannot watch somebody all of the time and if a person is intent on committing suicide, unfortunately he or she will find a way and a time to do it.</P>
    <P>Suicide as a criminal offence is a relic of a more brutal age when the property of a suicide could be declared forfeit to the State which was particularly traumatic for the bereaved family.  The Bill not only abolishes the offence of suicide but also the offence of attempting to commit suicide.  However, the act of abolition is only the beginning.  In time it must be followed up with a wide ranging programme of support for potential suicides and bereaved families and friends. Compassion must be put into practise.</P>
    <P>Studies in suicide are important if we are to understand the reasons for suicide. Knowing these reasons we can formulate health and social care policies that effectively address the problem.  The most effective action is to recognise the potential suicide and, through counselling or other means, to avert the taking of life and lay the basis for a long term recovery. In Ireland the Samaritans deserve national praise for their work for the prevention of suicide.  Without the Samaritans the Irish incidence of suicide would be much higher and they should be given every possible support not only from Members here but also by Government in future allocations of funds.  The Samaritans have first hand experience of the anguish of the would-be suicide and are equivalent to emergency rescue services whose heroism is rightly praised.</P>
    <P>The Minister's quick response to Senator Neville's request is a credit to her and confirms her intention of making the Irish legal system not only more humane but also more realistic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>This day must be a satisfying one for Senator Neville.  He has laboured long in the vineyard and in Opposition one does not expect to see one's work bear fruit.  The fact that this Bill will be passed is a well deserved tribute to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I heard of the Minister's appointment to the Department of Justice I was delighted.  The Department of <Col N="965" /> Justice, of all Departments of State, is the Department most in need of a more humane image.  One tries to encourage children to trust a uniform and to seek out a garda as the first refuge in times of trouble.  Therefore, it is distressing to see scowling faces on members of the Force on the beat; they are more likely to send children reeling away than to encourage them to come forward.  It is a defect in the training programme at Templemore that more emphasis is not placed on the importance of identifying with children and appearing approachable to them. Perhaps the Minister might examine that aspect of garda training which is particularly important in the light of current horrific disclosures of the sexual abuse of children.  If it could be instilled in children that uniformed gardaí will respond sympathetically to their approach it would be a great comfort to the general community. The proper response to children should be an important element in garda training and I hope the Minister will ensure that it is.</P>
    <P>I witnessed a suicide as a cabin boy on a tanker when I saw a member of the crew dive overboard.  A frequent feature of suicide is its total unpredictability.  People talk about the State's obligation to establish preventive structures.  Sweden, of all States, is the one which had the best kind of all embracing social structures, yet it had a very high rate of suicide.  It is not possible to legislate for all eventualities in this area.  I was in Los Angeles a few years ago and I met a man called Jarvis who became famous &mdash; or infamous &mdash; depending on your viewpoint, for moving Proposition 13 in the state of California, which capped the State's ability to raise revenue, and led to the closure of some public services, mental hospitals in particular. The effects of this were immediately visible in Los Angeles.  There was an enormous increase in the number of suicides.</P>
    <P>The emphasis on community care is good but trying to close down large mental asylums overnight and pretending that the inmates can live in the community can be highly dangerous.  I watched <Col N="966" /> a television programme on BBC last year which showed the effects of closure of mental hospitals.  The policy which led to such closures was well intended, but created havoc in the short term.  We must take great care before we release long term inmates of mental hospitals into the community.  Where appropriate, this must be done carefully but sometimes it cannot be done because people simple cannot cope outside a sheltered environment. They are totally institutionalised. However sorry we feel for them, there is only one place for them, and the State must recognise that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, it is one of those pieces of English legislation which should have been repealed years ago.  We inherited much ridiculous legislation, and I am glad that the Minister has the sense to repeal the more ridiculous parts.  I commend her for that.  People talked about the stigma attached to suicide.  The stigma was never a legal stigma it arose from the sense of shame and failure the family experienced, which will never go away.  We can, however, do much more to educate people so they can understand what happens when a person is in so much despair that they take their own lives.  This education does not start in the Garda station or in the hospital, it starts in school when children are taught about these issues.  I cannot imagine trying to explain to children that the State will prosecute them when they are dead.  Now that this law has been repealed, we should start to teach children about the realities of life and, unfortunately, suicide is one of the realities of life.</P>
    <P>Another area I would like the Minister to consider is, and it encompasses other Departments, is the attitude of insurance companies and State bodies to suicide. Suicide happens rarely, we would prefer it did not happen, but when it does we should not allow the insurance companies to use it as a loophole to avoid their responsibilities.  In many cases they put extra strain on families already under tremendous pressure.  We all know that insurance companies are notorious for trying to avoid their obligations by using the small print, and that is an area we <Col N="967" /> must consider.  The family members of a person who has committed suicide have to live with the consequences and anything that can be done to ease their burden should be done.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Garda Síochána for the very difficult job it has had up to now in investigating what must initially be treated as a murder inquiry.  I know that this will not change greatly, but at least those investigating in the future will not treat it as a criminal act.  I welcome the Minister's action in providing for an offence of aiding, abetting, procuring or counselling a suicide.  This would be a very dangerous omission.  Anybody with a couple of hundred acres of land would be very uneasy if that was not included in the Bill, and I am saying that in a lighthearted manner.</P>
    <P>The last serious point I want to make, which was brought to my attention by a former prisoner, was in regard to a snide remark made about his wife, after a visit. It was a sexual remark by a prison officer to a prisoner, and nothing is more calculated to drive somebody insane than such a remark when the person at whom it is aimed is confined in prison.  It should not be part of the custodial system and every prison officer inducted to prison service should be told this.  It should be an indictable offence to make that kind of remark to a prisoner.  I ask the Minister to consider this point.  I know how difficult a prison officer's job is, but even one remark is unacceptable in that situation.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by paying tribute to Senator Neville and all his hard work.  I look forward to the Minister's reforming zeal.  She did very good work as a Minister of State in Europe, and I am sure she will do a magnificent job in the Department of Justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Senator Neville on the initiative he has taken, and on his consistency in bringing this matter not just to our attention here, but through us to the attention of the public. As Senator Magner said, he must be happy we have reached this stage, that <Col N="968" /> the Minister has in fact adopted in a provision for statute law most of the elements he would have wanted to include in his own Private Members' Bill. I also acknowledge the positive and enlightened response from the Minister in what is clearly an area of consensus in this House and in society.  On many occasions there was a consensus but official action lagged behind that consensus in its interpretation in statute law. This is one of the most enlightened examples of statute law modifying what has been firmly established in common law.</P>
      <P>The common law is as much part of the law under which we operate as statute law.  The law as administered by the courts over the years held suicide to be a felony.  All the consequences of that felony were visited on the family who were already sufficiently burdened by the suicide.  To have the taint of criminality and illegality attached to them as survivors of the suicide is unbelievable. However, that is the law.</P>
      <P>It is significant that we are now doing what statute law should always do, represent the enlightened consensus of society, and to change, where necessary, the common law, which will be the binding law of the courts.  There are many occasions where we say the courts interfere too regularly in the role of the Executive and the Government, that they interpret the laws we pass in a way we did not intend.  I do not want to get into that issue just now, but this is a perfect example of the Legislature bringing in legislation to eliminate the elements in the common law which are outdated and unacceptable.  This is a very important development, not just because of the issue itself, but because of what it represents in terms of an effective and enlightened approach from the Executive through the Minister in bringing our statute law up to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude to suicide which was reflected in the courts' approach permeated society at all levels.  We should always bear in mind that our laws in many ways reflect the prevailing ethos, some of them based on religion and inherited <Col N="969" /> attitudes.  In other societies, Japan, for instance, <i>hara-kiri</i> was regarded as a passport to eternal recognition and honour for one's family, many who committed it regarded it as a mark of honour and commitment &mdash; something our society would find hard to understand. These things cannot be divorced from inherited attitudes.</P>
    <P>Now that the Statute Book is being brought up to date, the stigma which attached to suicide will, I hope, be eliminated from our social attitudes.  For instance, many of those who committed suicide were not buried in consecrated ground in cemeteries; people I knew personally are buried at the entrance to the cemetery instead of inside.  Society should never have tolerated such a judgment on a blameless family.  This is something we have to eliminate and the legislation will go a long way towards doing that, because there will no longer be a stigma attached to suicide.  We had a strange attitude to suicide although I have much to say about the positive values of Irish society and I will come back to that in a moment.</P>
    <P>I heard the expression &ldquo;an ordinary respectable criminal&rdquo; used in court. There was a begrudging admiration for such ordinary, respectable criminals, especially in rural Ireland, and there were also some ordinary &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; crimes. There was a very different attitude towards the families of people who had been convicted from that to families where one member or maybe two had committed suicide.  It was assumed that there was some strange weakness in such a household and the taint attached to such unfortunate families was unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister's action will show that the State is not entitled to impose such a burden.  The taint was never mentioned publicly, but hinted at quietly throughout the community. That was one of the less welcome attitudes in Ireland but fortunately we are moving away from it with the introduction of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, there were more suicides and social disorder in the past than we were <Col N="970" /> aware of, but there is empirical evidence that the rate of suicide has increased.  If that is the case we have to look at the factors behind that increase.  The Minister and Senator Magner referred to the rates of suicide in other countries.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what are regarded as modern, enlightened, secure and tolerant societies, particularly in Europe; the countries we are asked to emulate in standards, family relationships, general relationships and tolerance towards a certain kind of behaviour.  I do not wish to attack their norms, but it is significant that the societies of Northern Europe &mdash; those most tolerant, enlightened, free and liberal and in which everything is a matter of individual choice where there is no such thing as social discipline and it is old-fashioned to talk about any positive elements &mdash; have the highest rates of suicide: Denmark, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany and Sweden.</P>
    <P>Does that not tell us something about the pressures of modern society and that the real reason for the increase in suicides is that people cannot cope with these pressures?  What are the pressures of modern society and what are we doing to try to relieve them?  Will we try to enrich society and give people more secure and stable values and give them that great feeling of secure relationships to which the Minister referred to when she said that a poverty of relationships and social opportunities affect the rate of suicides. A poverty of relationships is evident in our society.  Yet, sometimes we are not allowed to question why this is the case. Is it because we are not prepared to tell our young people that a positive element in healthy relationships is the discipline attached to being a social being?  No man, as John Donne said, is an island.  We live in society and the actions we undertake as individuals will affect that society for good or ill.  Instead of reacting and acceding to all the demands for various freedoms, we should look at positive values and try to support them.  That is the aspect I would like to see promoted, because otherwise we will be reacting ineffectively to the pressures of modern society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> Is this the first generation of modern society and will society suddenly stand still in 1993 having reached modernity? Was there a modern society in the days of the Greeks who were a very enlightened people or during the great enlightenment in Europe?  I believe so.  In 100 years people may look back at these times and say they were anything but modern. There will always be change but values must be constant.</P>
    <P>There must be positive and enriching values based on the discipline required of social beings which would create the atmosphere in which many of the problems of today could be dealt with more effectively.  What the Minister is doing is important and enlightening, but it cannot be expected to get at the root cause of the problem.</P>
    <P>Another feature of modern society in which the Minister is involved, in cooperation with her European Community colleagues, is the explosion in the use of drugs.  Those from certain backgrounds in this and other cities&mdash;perhaps it is affecting rural life as well&mdash;who have been unfortunate enough to fall prey to that addiction are greatly at risk.  There is constant, significant evidence of this. In the course of consultations with our colleagues in Europe in terms of the control of drugs, it is frightening to learn that there is an established trail of drug trafficking through some of the countries of the EC.  It is widely known that in northern Spain, Galicia, the social order has nearly broken down.  Even the judicial order has broken down.  The drug culture has literally dominated and judges have retired.  I hope the Minister, in the course of her consultations with her colleagues, will raise this vitally important matter.  We want to protect the norms of society.  Each country has an obligation to regulate and control the problem.  I am not trying to make a judgment on any country.  I am talking about regions within countries where it is known to be widespread, giving rise to problems and great human suffering.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out in her historical analysis that the term <i>felo de se</i>, <Col N="972" /> the Latin term for suicide, became a felony of itself by definition, which had direct and immediate consequences.  One of the consequences was that not only was the felon not entitled in any way to benefit from an attempted suicide which had been frustrated, but that their families, next of kin and personal representatives were also prevented from benefiting from the consequences of what was seen as a felony.  I would like clarification from the Minister on this issue. Senator Magner referred to this in relation to insurance contracts.  Until now, insurance companies could legitimately justify the exclusion clause because suicide was established in law as a felony or misdemeanour.  Nobody under a civil contract such as a contract of insurance, their successors in title or personal representative, could benefit from the consequences of a criminal act. Now that the taint of illegality and criminality is being removed, what can be done to ensure that the civil law in relation to civil contracts of insurance will be brought into line and that people will not be excluded from the benefit of life assurance?  It would be the last stage in ensuring consistency in this whole area. It would be a logical consequence of an enlightened action which the Minister introduced in this House today which would be welcomed.</P>

Mar a dúirt an Seanadóir O'Kennedy ar ball beag, tá chuile dhuine aontaithe ar gach aon taobh den Teach faoin mBille seo. Tá mé buíoch den tacaíocht a fuair mé ón Teach agus gabhaim buíochas speisialta leis an Seanadóir Neville as ucht an méid oibre atá déanta aige faoin cheist seo ó 1991 i leith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody is concerned about the stigma of suicide on families.  A number of Senators mentioned the lack of community and parish support or indeed extended family support when a suicide occurs.  While we might not have had the direct experience of Senator Magner, we <Col N="973" /> all know of families in our own areas who have had this experience and the terrible trauma that it brings.</P>
    <P>The point raised by Senator Kennedy and Senator Magner was also raised in the Dáil, specifically in relation to insurance companies but I know other issues are involved.  I have already raised with my colleague in the Department of Equality and Law Reform, the possibility or necessity of amending civil law to take account of the changes we are making in this Bill.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, is already looking at the area of insurance companies. If I remember correctly, during the discussion on Committee Stage in the Dáil, it became clear that although suicide was decriminalised in the United Kingdom in 1960, there may still be difficulties in certain instances where insurance companies are using exclusion clauses in this area.  It is an issue which I have raised and will rise again as a result of the debate here today.</P>
    <P>Senators mentioned the prisons and the prison system.  I thank Senator Neville and others who said that there were a number of positive changes in the recent past.  Various support measures must be put in place within the prison system to help prisoners.  We cannot easily or always identify people who might have a tendency towards suicide. We can never, regardless of all embracing support services which are put in place in the community or in the prison system, eliminate the possibility of someone committing suicide.  However, the various changes in the recent past are positive and I thank the House for welcoming them.  We also need support for prison officers and prison staff.  It is a traumatic experience for any prison officer, male or female, to find a prisoner who has committed suicide, that person needs intense support and counselling in the immediate period thereafter.  That is being put in place in the prison system.  I will raise Senator Magner's specific point with the prison management and the Prison Officers' Association who meet me on a regular basis.  I do not think that either of those would like to see a <Col N="974" /> situation develop where any loose comment made by a prison officer or a member of staff would in any way contribute to causing difficulties for a prisoner.</P>
    <P>Members mentioned community care, the psychiatric services and the lack of back-up facilities in relation to the early discharge from psychiatric hospitals of patients who might have a tendency to suicide.  That is a relevant point, one which was raised in the other House.  I will be raising that point once again with the Minister for Health.  It will primarily be a health issue when this Bill is passed, the point Senator Neville and others made.  The health services, the Department of Health and the Minister for Health will be looking specifically at the support systems already in place, how they need to be improved and how that should be done.</P>
    <P>Section 30 of the Coroners Act, 1962, was raised by Senator Neville.  He is correct in saying that one of the implications of this Bill is that it will no longer be in conflict with section 30 of the Coroners Act to return a verdict of suicide. However, there will be no compulsion to return a verdict of suicide and indeed there is judicial authority for the view that there will be a presumption against suicide.  Mr. Justice O'Hanlon in The State (McKeown) <i>v.</i>  Scully, 1986 ILRM 133, indicated his agreement with the following quotation from an English case:</P>
    <P>It seems to me to fail to recognise what is perhaps one of the most important rules that coroners should bear in mind in cases of this class, namely that suicide must never be presumed.  If a person dies a violent death, the possibility of suicide may be there for all to see, but must not be presumed merely because it seems on the face of it to be a likely explanation.  Suicide must be proved by evidence, and if it is not proved by evidence, it is the duty of the coroner not to find suicide, but to find an open verdict ...  There are many many cases where there is real doubt as to the cause of death and <Col N="975" /> where an open verdict is right, and where anything else is unjust to the family of the deceased.</P>
    <P>I do not want at this stage, and I am sure that Senator Neville does not want either, to enter into a debate on what verdicts should be returned at inquests.  I am aware of the point raised by Senator Neville about the facilities available at inquest for the relatives and family.  I will certainly undertake to have a look at the practice and procedures at inquests to see in what way they can be improved upon to make life a little easier for those suffering a great loss.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan raised some concerns about the use of the word &ldquo;committed&rdquo; in the context of suicide.  I assure him that the word does not carry with it any implication that the act is a crime. The word &ldquo;commit&rdquo; was chosen by the parliamentary draughtsman because he considered it was the most appropriate word in the circumstances.  Senator Maloney and other members once again talked about the back-up facilities for discharged psychiatric patients and that is something I will raise with the Minister for Health.  Senator Maloney also mentioned an interesting proposal in the United States in relation to intervention programmes and how our health boards, the Department of Education and the schools system might introduce such programmes at an early stage.  That is something on which I would be delighted to report to my colleagues.</P>
    <P>Senators mentioned voluntary organisations, I referred to them in my earlier contribution.  I would also like to be associated with the words of support and encouragement for the voluntary organisations. The Government is well aware of the support they need at all times because they do a very important job. Speaking particularly of the prison system, the open line now available to prisoners and the back-up facilities to prison staff by the Samaritans, are very important, worthwhile and necessary that I would like to see continued and expanded upon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> Senator Norris expressed concerns about the operation of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I am quite sure that his comments in the House will be brought to the attention of the DPP and that any difficulties the Senator is having in relation to that office may be addressed.  Senator Norris also raised a point to which Senator Magner responded in advance of my own comments, asking why aiding, abetting and counselling someone to commit suicide should be a crime under the Bill.  We are all aware that not every suicide occurs for clearly defined reasons.  Senators Norris and Henry raised deep philosophical points of view in relation to the medical and ethical problems surrounding suicide. I would not like to go down that road, and I do not think we should discuss those kind of medical and ethical views in the context of this Bill.  They are, however, deep views about which both Senators feel strongly and perhaps that is a debate we could have at another time.</P>
    <P>There certainly have been cases where an inordinate amount of pressure has been put on people, particularly in rural Ireland, involving a large amount of land or a large amount of money in the bank. Such pressures, when exerted, could well drive someone to commit suicide.  It is not so long ago that we read in the national newspapers of a case in the west in a county close to my own, where a father and son returned from the pub one evening and, because of an argument that developed, the son went to one of the sheds outside the house, procured poison used on the farm, left it in a mug on the range and the father drank it.  Now in that particular case a verdict of aiding and abetting suicide was not returned by the court for various reasons.  Things like that can happen, so it is important that that provision is part of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised a point discussed since the Bill was published concerning the question of medical personnel and the possibility that they may in some way be implicated in complicity in suicide. Before a person could be convicted of aiding a person to commit suicide under section 2 (2) of the Bill it would have to <Col N="977" /> be shown that a person committed or attempted to commit suicide, that the accused knew that the person intended to commit suicide, that with that knowledge he or she did some act which assisted the person to commit suicide, and that he or she did that act with the intention of helping that person to commit suicide. There is no question of offences being committed by medical personnel who prescribe various medications to somebody who is ill and subsequently commits suicide, or of that person being implicated in complicity in suicide.  I hope I made that clear earlier.</P>
    <P>All the other issues are more or less similar.  Senator O'Kennedy raised an important question in so far as Ministers for Justice in the European Community are concerned, the area of drug abuse.  It is an area about which we are concerned and various programmes are being introduced, both in the prison system, and by the Department of Health in the education system, to ensure that we educate young people not to participate in this glamorous world of soft drugs as they are called.  We all know that when one goes down that road it leads to a different road later on in life.  Senator O'Kennedy and others may be interested to know that last week and again this week at a Justice Ministers' Council we discussed the issue of drug trafficking.  Yesterday we signed a significant Europol agreement on drug abuse and drug trafficking.  As Senator O'Kennedy said, there is genuine concern both here, in other European countries and on the fringes of the European Community where there is drug trafficking that this should not continue and that our police forces should co-operate. In this age of free movement of persons we must be vigilant and our police forces and drug squads must be strengthened to ensure they can cope with these difficulties. Senator O'Kennedy may rest assured that this issue is raised every time that EC Justice and Interior Ministers meet.</P>
    <P>We discussed health and education programmes and the social and psychiatric services which need to be provided, as well as the local voluntary organisations. <Col N="978" /> Local community, family and parish support is vital and I hope that, as Senators mentioned, now that suicide is being decriminalised people will be able to talk about it in an open and frank way and remove the stigma that has been there for centuries, not just in Ireland but all over the world.  We need to have an open discussion to allow families to cope with this problem.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde raised the points system in education and the pressures it puts on young people.  All parents of teenagers studying for their leaving certificate know the enormous pressures involved.  Sometimes the pressure is piled on by parents and teachers, and sometimes the teenagers themselves put on the pressure without any urging from home or teachers.  There is peer pressure there, and if they want to do a particular thing they need a certain amount of points.  I agree with Senator Ormonde that huge pressures occur at this time and there is an increasing tendency by young people in that age group to commit suicide. We need support for families, preventative measures and intervention programmes.  I will be raising those matters with my colleagues around the table. I would like to thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and the other Senators for their support for the Bill, I am glad that everyone welcomed it.  In particular I appreciate the tremendous interest Senator Neville has taken in this area since 1991.</P>

      <P>My query arises from what the Minister said in response to <Col N="979" /> Senator McGowan's contribution.  As this Bill has been passed by the Dáil there is no real prospect of amending it.  I am persuaded by the Senator's reference to the term &ldquo;commit&rdquo;.  I accept it is a matter for the parliamentary draughtsman to find an appropriate term.  An amendment to the Bill at this stage would cause practical problems.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;commit&rdquo; classically applies to offences.  All of us fall into the habit of saying, for example, &ldquo;committing suicide&rdquo; or &ldquo;committing an offence&rdquo;.  The word does not apply to an ordinary action untainted by criminality or illegality. Retaining the term may not be deliberate on anyone's part but, nevertheless, even in such an enlightened Bill the old terminology remains.  A more neutral word could not be substituted at this point but, perhaps, that could be done in the future. The word &ldquo;effect&rdquo; could be used in regard to suicides in the Bill.  One would hardly use the word &ldquo;achieve&rdquo; because that would be a term of commendation.</P>

      <P>It might.  Senator McGowan's suggestion has merit.  I remember the first time I was in this House the Minister's predecessor, our beloved colleague, Deputy Lenihan, explained he could not accept an amendment because his parliamentary draughtsman would be &ldquo;in high dudgeon&rdquo;. That did not commend itself to the Members at the time such as Senator Sheehy-Skeffington.  I find it interesting to hear 28 years later the parliamentary draughtsman is mentioned, not in high dudgeon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would not have any difficulty in accepting a word like &ldquo;effect&rdquo; but as the Bill was prepared by the parliamentary draughtsman it will be necessary to see if that word will be legally acceptable.

      <P>Subsection (2) has been discussed at length.  Any movement away from section 2 as drafted might allow for euthanasia.  The experience in the Netherlands is that while the law was not changed to allow for euthanasia there is a tolerance of it.  There are now a large number of involuntary euthanasias because the frontiers were pushed back. This is an important section and I disagree with some of my colleagues on that issue.</P>
      <P>I should like to quote what Dr. Kelleher, a leading investigator of suicide in Ireland, quoted by Senator Crowley, said in regard to euthanasia.  He said:</P>
      <P>For the caring professions the dilemma is even more starkly put.  How can doctors, nurses or social workers reduce suicide and rehabilitate self-poisoners and those who harm themselves if beneath the surface they countenance these behaviours?  It is not farfetched to envisage a time in the Western World when the cost of maintaining and preserving life will be seen as too great particularly when the individual is no longer productive even though he may have been productive when age and health were on his side. If doctors enter into the business of assisting suicide then those who see the treatment of the chronically disabled as being an unproductive loss of society's resources may also find means to reward surreptitiously those professionals who put a medical stamp of approval on the despatch of the disagreeable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My next point is about a different part of the Minister's response and the Bill can cater for it.  Section 5 of my Bill was intended to help improve the collection <Col N="981" /> of suicide statistics.  The Minister has said this will only be improved marginally. Some way must be found, by amendment to the Coroners Act or some other method, to ensure we obtain figures of the true extent of suicide.  Until we know the true extent of the problem we cannot implement proper anti-suicide measures. A problem cannot be dealt with fully until the extent of it is known.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>One can make a distinction in regard to euthanasia.  That would arise through the active intervention of another party who does something for a person suffering from ill-health or a condition.  It would not be the direct action of the person suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonetheless, euthanasia as it is practised is not related to the wishes of the person suffering.  It is often the decision of someone who intervenes to terminate suffering or, as it might be seen, a life with no further prospect of useful purpose.  I sympathise with Senator Neville's concern but that distinction can be made.</P>
      <P>An earlier speaker, I believe it was Senator Magner, said the pain and suffering an individual was undergoing meant there was no other option as he or she saw it.  I am not saying Senator Magner is presenting the case in that way. That shows an impoverished attitude to pain and suffering.  It is not for me to proclaim that many can turn the experience of pain into a positive attitude, provided they have a spiritual conviction.  I am not here to preach but for those who have no spiritual anchor pain and suffering have no meaning.  In that case the only option is the termination of this useless, meaningless, unacceptable life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those with something to hold on to the option of suicide would never arise. How many times did previous generations say, &ldquo;Welcome be the will of God&rdquo;?  Are we allowed to say that anymore or is it too old-fashioned to contemplate saying it?  For people who said <Col N="982" /> that suffering would never have been a justification for looking at the only other option.  I am neither qualified nor entitled to judge but where we have inherited values to positively cope with pain and suffering that have enhanced sufferers and their families we should not let it be said the termination of life is the only option.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I fundamentally reject the idea that there are people whose religious adherence is so weak they cannot cope with life or with pain.  Suicide affects people who decide for themselves.</P>

      <P>Regarding euthanasia, there are people who decide for themselves that the quality of their life is no longer bearable.  They take a conscious decision and, in many cases, it has little to do with the hereafter.  Ludovic Kennedy produced a report on the Euthanasia Society of London.  People with a deep conviction and great faith and belief in God have decided for themselves in a logical way that they no longer wish to remain alive.  I respect such decisions and they are for the individual to make.</P>

      <P>We must distinguish the discussion on euthanasia from the present position on medical technology outlined by Senator Henry, where a person can be clinically dead but kept alive by machinery.  Like the Minister, I <Col N="983" /> am not qualified or experienced to elaborate on this issue.</P>
      <P>Regarding euthanasia, one can accept the practise in certain circumstances, but is it possible to prevent the spread of the practise?  For example, in the Netherlands euthanasia has now spread to the involuntary, where it is not the patient but the family or other third parties making the decision on the patient's behalf.  The Dutch authorities are now retreating from that situation and examining a society that has developed in this manner.  My concern is that if the door is opened at all on this issue, how can it be prevented from opening further?  The Bill prevents that door from opening and for that reason I welcome this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the issue of statistics raised by Senator Neville, I understand that since 1967 a special form is completed by every garda investigating a death for the coroner in which he or she indicates whether he or she believes the death was accidental or suicidal.  Up to 1985 this form was used in conjunction with the coroner's verdict to determine suicide statistics.  Since 1985 coroner's have not returned verdicts of suicide; however, they do return verdicts such as self inflicted killing.</P>
      <P>There has been speculation that official records seriously underestimate the true incidence of suicide.  However, the CSO does not agee with this view.  The CSO, I understand, has co-operated in some detailed studies and the conclusion is that the official data probably understates the actual number of suicides by perhaps 15 to 20 per cent at most.  A number of studies have been undertaken in regard to this issue.  I accept Senator Neville's concerns in regard to correct and updated statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding aiding and abetting, and the disquiet in the medical profession on this Bill and, specifically, the provision whereby a person who aids and abets or counsels and so on is committing a crime, the concerns of the medical profession revolve around two areas both of which have been mentioned by Senators.  I <Col N="984" /> should like to refer to the medical doctor who prescribes medication, whether in tablet form or otherwise, to a person who takes all the medication at once and dies in consequence.  I do not believe anybody could condone a situation where that medical practitioner would be accused of aiding, abetting or counselling a person to commit suicide and there is no such intention in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville raised the question of a person who is clinically dead and a decision is taken by the family, on the advice of a doctor, to turn off a machine, but before doing so to donate organs from the person's body.  It would be a tragedy if in some way that work were to be prevented because, under the Bill, either the family or the doctor would be accused of aiding and abetting.  That is not the intention of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to welcome the Minister.  My last engagement as Minister for Agriculture was in Germany in October 1991 where I had discussions with buyers from prominent German supermarkets. The supermarkets, especially those in Berlin, pay a higher price for Irish beef than any other buyers not just in Europe but throughout the world. Berlin probably has the highest level of income in Europe.  One of the buyers from Berlin informed me that he could not conclude contracts for Irish beef because he could not compete with intervention prices.  This is an appalling indictment of a system on which Ireland and other European countries have been too reliant.</P>
      <P>We have many advantages in Ireland such as the tradition, culture, suitable climate and grass and the reputation which should help us reach those markets and command premium prices.  Reform of the intervention system is long overdue although it may cause short term problems. When I was Minister for Agriculture for four and a half years I argued constantly with my EC colleague that the beef industry was of such importance to Ireland that not only could we not accept sudden and dramatic changes to intervention arrangements but we needed special arrangements which recognised this importance.  We succeeded in obtaining these special arrangements. However, I always pointed out to producers that while I was happy to obtain such arrangements to maintain price stability they should never see this as a justification for not concentrating on the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> Some of the habits and practices which have developed in Ireland, and elsewhere, relating to the overuse of hormones and, even more insidiously, clenbuterol, commonly known as angel dust, were directly associated with qualification for intervention at a price level above a certain norm.  There is no point overlooking the fact that farmers were sometimes encouraged by buyers from factories to use substances to up-grade their cattle in order to qualify for higher intervention prices.  This certainly did not improve the quality of meat sold on the home market.  This was one of the adverse consequences of a system which served us well in many ways.</P>
    <P>Although intervention is a fail-safe mechanism, and probably has been more availed of by me than any other Minister in recent times, I do not wish to have it on the record that I saw intervention as being the way forward for us.  I am happy that the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, which we are now discussing, involves less dependence on intervention.  I regret that the European Council of Agriculture Ministers in its recent decision, probably for the first time, did not recognise the special position of Ireland.  It is proposed that the qualifying weights should be reduced. This may pose problems for us.  However, it is the long term to which we should be looking.  Other countries which are unable to compete with us in the markets also rely on intervention.  The intervention system does not exist solely for Ireland's benefit.  Now is the time to take a positive, vigorous view that short term loss can be turned to long term advantage.</P>
    <P>My second point is in regard to the set aside scheme which is not directly linked to Common Agricultural Policy reform but is related to it.  I vigorously opposed this scheme when it was introduced and said that as a concept it would not be acceptable in Ireland.  When the scheme was introduced it was not compulsory on individual producers but it was compulsory on member states to have a scheme which could be availed of by producers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> This scheme, which involves taking land used for growing cereals out of production, is contradictory in a world which is short of food.  In many parts of the world cereals are used for dietary purposes in ways which beef cannot.  All the indications now suggest&mdash;these were not as clear three or four years ago when the scheme was introduced&mdash;that the effects of global warming and the depletion of the ozone layer will result in major cereal growing areas of the world being unable to achieve anywhere near their existing levels of production.  Instead of encouraging the continued growth of cereals which can be used to alleviate famine throughout the world, we are introducing a policy which involves saying to producers that not all land can be used and providing incentives for them to take land out of use.  It is not surprising that there is a problem in Ireland in regard to qualification for the scheme.  I will not regret it for one minute when the words &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; no longer exist in the vocabulary of farming, particularly in view of the need for food in regions of the world where people are starving.</P>
    <P>Policing an intervention system makes great demands on any Department and Ministers have many other positive things to do.  They are not policemen, chief superintendents or police commissioners; neither was I during my period as Minister for Agriculture.  Some 99 per cent of my time as Minister for Agriculture was devoted to the role of a Minister and involved the development of agriculture and the agri-food industry in all its forms.  The maximum amount of time spent on the policing role was 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>Before I left the Department of Agriculture I asked that consideration be given to the establishment of a separate intervention unit.  It is not part of the ministerial role to be linked to an intervention unit.  As in other countries, there is a strong case for this unit as long as intervention exists.  I made this point before the beef tribunal.  If we have an intervention unit it will not be possible to accuse Ministers of involvement in certain <Col N="988" /> matters.  As a Minister who was subjected to unfair criticism, I would like to think that none of my successors would be subjected to the same criticism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the reforms announced under the Common Agricultural Policy will have serious consequences for Irish agriculture. On the other hand, the consequences of not acknowledging the need for fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural Policy will be more serious, not only for agriculture, but also for the Irish economy and the European Community. A farming policy which produces goods without a market, increases consumers' weekly food bills by £15, consumes 60 per cent of the entire EC budget and allows 80 per cent of all price supports to go to the top 20 per cent income bracket, has no future.</P>
      <P>There were no more enthusiastic advocates of Irish membership of the EC than the farming organisations who promised that the country would benefit from the access of Irish agriculture to Common Agricultural Policy funds.  Two decades later, despite the substantial transfer of funds, the contribution of the agricultural sector to GNP remains unchanged.  The number of people who make a living from farming has declined by 40 per cent.  The changing structure of farm costs reflects a change in the use of resources in Ireland. The proportion of these costs represented by wages dropped from 11 per cent to 7 per cent between 1970 and 1990, while capital costs &mdash; depreciation and interest on debt &mdash; rose from 7 per cent to 28 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The replacement of labour by capital on Irish farms in recent decades was the result of economic and monetary policies which included massive State borrowing, export subsidies, an abundant money supply, inflation and high taxes on labour.  Any agricultural policy at national or EC level should be assessed on how it meets certain objectives.  It should provide an adequate and varied supply of quality food as cheaply as possible; enable the land to provide the maximum number of families with sufficient <Col N="989" /> incomes, and increase its overall contribution to the economy in terms of income generated and employment created.</P>
    <P>The proposals for direct income support, rather than subsidies on production, are welcome and should be of value to the small farmers who need them most.  We must ensure that the level of EC support for Irish agriculture is at least maintained at existing levels, so that the economy will be cushioned against the immediate effect of the proposals.  The producer, and not the product, should be subsidised.  This would result in more people staying on the land.</P>
    <P>The MacSharry proposals are only part of what must be an ongoing process of reassessment of agricultural policy at both EC and national level.  In many respects, the problems of agriculture are similar to those of the peripheral regions and they must be approached in a similar way.  Direct payments to small farmers can only be a temporary arrangement. There is also no long term value in protecting low paying inefficient industries.</P>
    <P>The existing Structural Funds must be retained, although they need to be substantially increased.  Any decrease in Common Agricultural Policy spending in the long term must be compensated for by an increase in Structural Funds.  There must be a move away from intensive production in favour of organic methods of production.  The demand for organic food products will continue to grow.  This move could benefit Irish agriculture and other less developed regions of the EC.</P>
    <P>As part of an interventionist industrial policy of higher paid, value-added, high technology industries, there must be a move from the cramped centres to the less developed regions.  There must be a specific programme of direct investment in the development of industries based on natural resources which are indigenous to the peripheral and aricultural regions. The EC must assist in the reorientation of Irish agricultural production so that it fits in with industry.  Support must be provided for diversification into the production of non-surplus food and other products.  We need a radical approach in <Col N="990" /> this regard if we want to keep families on the land in rural Ireland.  There is no alternative employment available to people who leave the land.  The situation would be different if we had a good industrial base.</P>
    <P>The priority for national agricultural policy must be to use the country's agricultural resources as productively as possible.  There is a need for a comprehensive plan to work towards this objective.  This plan should identify small farmers with development potential and provide them with the means to reach that potential.  Small farmers who do not wish to expand, but who wish to remain in agriculture, should be encouraged to diversify into new areas such as forestry and agri-tourism.  Farmers who do not see a future in farming should be allowed to retire in dignity or move to new careers.  In the agri-tourism business it is usually the wealthy, and not those in need, who benefit because they are able to meet the requirements.  A greater emphasis should be placed on improving people's standard of living.  There is a strong case for diverting some of the Common Agricultural Policy funding, which is currently given to large farmers, to the EC Structural Funds with the aim of creating new job opportunities in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Recently, set aside land, adjacent to streams and rivers, was burnt by landowners. Grass will not grow there for a number of years.  It is appalling to see this happening.  There should be a policy where small farmers who need land can rent set aside land.  This would improve their standard of living.  No effort has been made by the bureaucrats to rectify this situation which they created.  The Mansholt plan, which we fought against in the 1970s, is being implemented by stealth.  It was a development plan to rid this country of small holders but it came in by stealth.  That is what is being done with the set aside scheme.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, to this debate and I welcome this opportunity to discuss the Common Agricultural Policy and <Col N="991" /> agriculture in general with a view to the future of this vital sector of our economy.</P>
      <P>Agriculture is the single largest industry in our economy in terms of numbers employed, value of gross output, its contribution to the net export earnings and supplies of raw materials for the highly significant food industry.  In addition to its economic contribution a strong agricultural sector is vital to the social fabric of rural Ireland and the way of life it gives people.  The outcome of the Common Agricultural Policy reform negotiations early last year, while not containing all we in this sector wished for, puts the agricultural industry on the correct long term strategy and ends the uncertainty which hung over the industry for a number of years, as rumour and speculation destroyed confidence in the future. This House should today record its thanks and praise to the Irish negotiating team who represented us and successfully negotiated on our behalf.</P>
      <P>The strategy of the Common Agricultural Policy is correct and Irish farmers will respond to the change as they have done in the past.  I ask the Government to give them the assistance they require to respond to these changing times.  While in May of last year we were presented with the broad framework of the new support arrangement, we now have the detailed and complicated rules of the various schemes.  I compliment the Minister and his staff on the campaign of assistance offered to farmers by his Department and Teagasc in filling out the area aid application forms in recent weeks.  I hope this level of assistance can be offered to farmers in the future.  The recently launched Teagasc Common Agricultural Policy reform advisory service is ideally placed to give the assistance required and can be of great benefit in the future in the area of compensation payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort must be made to safeguard the income of the smaller producer. I welcome the increase in the limits for small scale milk producers from 12,619 gallons to 25,638 gallons, to quality for the suckler cow premium.  The abolition of the ten cow limit under this <Col N="992" /> scheme is of great benefit to my own area of Cavan-Monaghan where the average income from dairying is £3,500 per annum.  The special beef premium and the slaughter premium running from January to April will bring the slaughter season into line with demands and will be of great benefit to the industry.  The early retirement scheme will allow farmers to retire, following a lifetime of hard work, with dignity and security for the future and allow younger, more progressive farmers to farm the lands.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give consideration to the disappointing uptake of forestry grants in recent times in County Mon-aghan. Perhaps the Department could examine why this has been the case so as to allow greater use of the forestry element of the Common Agricultural Policy reform programme.  The new regime will bring change to which we must all respond.  The approach is correct with the introduction of the produce-led market.  This will suit Irish farmers who have a tradition of producing quality produce from a clean, green environment. We look forward to the successful implementation of these farm proposals for our farming community and all our people.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for being here today and wish him well.</P>

I would encourage research and development in the field of agri-business and this is why I was dismayed with the suggestion in the Culliton report that we could not be in the forefront of research and development in certain areas, that we would only be in the second string.  We cannot possibly be in the second string in the area of agri-business.  We must be at the forefront, and we must say to people involved in research and development that although the resources are limited, and research in other areas would be <Col N="993" /> better funded, they must come up with the goods nonetheless.</P>
      <P>It worries me that we have not talked about the consumer in this debate.  Without producing products which we can sell &mdash; which we have all been aiming at &mdash; progress will be impossible.  I strongly recommend that we take notice of a major report done by Nutrisan, a body in Trinity College Dublin which produces independent reports on what the consumer wants to eat, from a national and European perspective.  Every Member of the House should try to read this report as it is important to see where we should concentrate our best efforts.</P>
      <P>Since joining the EC, much effort has been put into agriculture.  I am sure Members of the House are pleased with improvements regarding pigs.  For example, I cannot be the only one who remembers, as a child, getting bacon with four inches of white fat, a thin ribbon of pink meat through it and, on top, skin with bristles if I was lucky.  Unless that was marketed now as some sort of exotic <i>charcuterie</i> from west Cork one would not be able to sell it.  We now have slim, trim, brim-full-of energy pigs which Mr. Vincent O'Brien might cast an eye upon, and which sell extremely well on the market.  Great efforts have also been made with regard to lambs.</P>
      <P>I spoke about headage payments in the House recently.  A worrying thing about the headage payments scheme is that it targets quantity rather than quality. Quality has to be our aim and the aim of the Department of Agriculture.  On what basis can we sell if not on quality and our green environment?  I was delighted to see that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has been stressing this.  I was also glad to see that when he was in the North of Ireland he talked with Lord Arran about this and the idea of having a sales campaign for agri-business and food produce based on our green environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard an interesting lecture by Mrs. Myrtle Allen from Ballymaloe House, County Cork.  She is a member of an organisation called Eurotoch whose members include some of the best chefs in the European Community.  She said <Col N="994" /> that to their dismay they now find that shelf life is the top priority regarding food.  With due respect, shelf life may be of interest to Senator Quinn but to those of us who are interested in nice good food, flavour, tastiness, vitamin content and nutrition are more important.  This is an area in which we can progress by saying that we have the freshest and tastiest food rather than food with the longest shelf life.  As a consumer I am suspicious of items with long shelf lives because it means that something peculiar has been done to keep them that way.</P>
    <P>The situation regarding cattle and the 380 kilogramme top weight for intervention is a topical issue.  I realise that this will be a dreadful imposition on some cattle breeders because many of them have been encouraged to bring in continental breeds such as Charolais, Simmental and others over the last 20 years. As far as I know these are the most efficient convertors from food to meat and naturally if one is in the business for commercial reasons these are the animals one would choose.  I also understand that this is the type of meat that is sought on the Continent.  Consequently there has been much pressure on farmers to supply what consumers require.</P>
    <P>Are we wise to start a case in the European Court of Justice about the limit?  I am aware that this will apply right across the Community but our main source of likely support is from French farmers because they will mostly be affected in the same way.  I do not know how strong our position is.  I am not a lawyer and therefore I have no idea how the European Court of Justice will find on this issue.  However, I understand that only 15 or 16 per cent of our carcase beef is over the limit.  Are we wise to take such a stand at this time?  The situation will become very serious when the limit reduces to 340 kilogrammes next July.  At that stage some of the other dual purpose breeds, such as Holsteins, Friesians, Herefords and any of the crossbreeds, which are so important to the dairy industry, will also be affected.  Would the Minister not be wiser to negotiate perhaps a limit of 360 kilogrammes for next year rather <Col N="995" /> than holding out for a 380 kilogramme limit this year?  If this was done we might get more support in the Community. Sometimes it can be best to lose one small battle to win a war.  In this instance perhaps we could win the war with more Community support by settling for a limit of 360 kilogrammes rather than 340 kilogrammes.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will encourage research and development in the agri-business area.  For example, how much effort is being made regarding vacuum packing of meat?  Vacuum packing is a far more satisfactory way of dealing with meat than freezing.  As a result of cellular breakdown during freezing there is water loss and the quality of meat is not as good.  Vacuum packed meat has a shelf life of approximately 90 days, which is very good.  I do not know if much is being done in this area.  I am sure there are other Senators who are more involved in agriculture who would know.  We must constantly try to extend our frontiers.  We cannot wait for other people to give us their ideas and research and development. We have to be ahead of the rest. We cannot sell into intervention forever. Our produce has to be the best quality and sold at the best prices for our farmers. I look forward to the Minister's comments on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  On a number of occasions I have heard people refer to Common Agricultural Policy as &ldquo;curtail agricultural production&rdquo; or &ldquo;curtail agriculture prices&rdquo;.  It is important to note that the reform of Common Agricultural Policy is the most fundamental change facing agriculture and rural Ireland in the forseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CAP has succeeded on a number of fronts.  It has benefited consumers in that food prices have stabilised and farmers have benefited because a market has been available for their unlimited produce.  Common Agricultural Policy has succeeded so well that it has reached its limit and will have to be adjusted to alleviate the problems of oversupply. <Col N="996" /> Common Agricultural Policy has been must successful for Irish commercial farmers.  Unfortunately, as Senator Sherlock mentioned, marginal areas have not benefited.  A commercial sector is important because it subsidises less well off areas.  It makes agriculture and the agri-business food sector more viable but unfortunately too much money has gone to too few.</P>
    <P>I am from an area which is quite affluent in agricultural terms, especially the dairy sector.  This is evident when one travels to other parts of the country and sees poverty and deprivation.  This must be immediately addressed and rebalanced if rural Ireland is to be sustained. Commercial farmers are the backbone of Irish agriculture and this is an area we must discuss at a later date because if their development is retarded the entire agricultural sector will suffer.  Progressive commercial farmers borrowed and spent money, purchased much capital equipment and benefited consumers by supplying quality produce on a regular basis. The viability of commercial farmers must not be undermined.</P>
    <P>It was correctly pointed out that larger commercial farmers can adapt more readily to forestry because they have more finance available.  People are not inclined to invest in forestry because it is a long term investment.  More will have to be done to encourage people, especially in marginal areas, to invest in forestry.  I urge the Minister to make it attractive and interesting for a farmer to use his land for forestry.  It is very difficult for a farmer to look 25 years ahead and contemplate what a tree will be worth and if there will be a market for it.  Steps have been made to encourage investment in forestry but it must be more forceful.</P>
    <P>Agri-tourism was also mentioned and this is an area which will have to be exploited.  Tourism is the answer to rural Ireland's migration and deprivation problems.  If agri-tourism is to be put at the top of the agenda it will have to be done in conjunction with the reform of Common Agricultural Policy.  Larger, commercial farms benefit from Common Agricultural Policy but such farms are in <Col N="997" /> areas where tourists do not normally go. Ireland's scenic areas are mountainous and remote and tourism must be brought to them.  It is difficult to find accommodation, amenities and facilities associated with tourism in the areas that are most scenic.  That is a sad reality.  More funds and grants will have to be made available to encourage people in marginal areas to participate in agri-tourism.</P>
    <P>I have some complaints with regard to the Common Agricultural Policy and they probably have much to do with national policy, in conjunction with European policy.  The policy of one day becomes the problem of the next. Senator Henry pointed out earlier that the Government encouraged the introduction of large beef breeds &mdash; Charolais, Blonde d'Aquitaine etc. &mdash; a couple of years ago and the EC are now talking about only accepting carcases under 380 kilograms for intervention.  We now have large cattle who will not qualify for the premium amount in intervention.  I welcome the Minister's stance on it because it has grave implications for the beef sector, which has already been badly hit. This must be rectified immediately.</P>
    <P>When we talk about intervening in the market, which is no longer capitalist driven or market oriented, we create a problem by solving a problem.  I have already referred to the beef and carcase weights.  There is now a problem with set-aside. This is psychologically damaging for any country and especially for any food producer and must be addressed immediately.  I cannot understand the philosophy which insists on having a field laying idle.  As Senator Sherlock said, grass has been burnt off because it is easier to maintain them that way.  Senator O'Kennedy said that grain is versatile and a staple diet for many countries.  This problem will have to be addressed because in the long term set aside will be damaging to the psychology and system of agriculture in Ireland.  The Common Agricultural Policy will have to be reformed, and I acknowledge the work done by the Minister and our ex-EC Commissioner. Farmers recognise that there is a limited source of funding and the <Col N="998" /> taxpayer will tire of paying for produce for which there is no market.  Some aspects of the way it was handled at EC level were damaging to our morale. However, the Minister has performed admirably in the EC and, in common with former Ministers of Agriculture, has fought for, and secured, areas that are vital to agriculture in this country.</P>
    <P>Rural Ireland will have to be seriously considered.  There used to be 20 million farmers in Europe; there are now only 10 million.  They are leaving the land at a rapid pace and it is especially evident in Ireland.  This must be addressed because it is creating problems in urban areas through migration, despite infrastructural development in rural regions. Through using the Structural Funds and making some changes to the Common Agricultural Policy, we may come up with a solution to encourage people to stay in rural areas.  Many modern amenities required for living there could then be provided from the funds.  This is a fundamental issue and must be addressed on a long term basis.  I know it cannot be done overnight but this is where Common Agricultural Policy has failed us in the past.  We are only addressing this slowly on a national level and it must be quickened up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this important issue. It needs to be discussed and the public need to hear our views and be given some glimpse of the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy has had a dual effect on the development of Irish agriculture.  It has been good for it in one sense and bad in another.  We had stable agricultural prices which ensured continuity of supply and allowed people to plan for the future with some degree of certainty &mdash; that was good.  However, all Senators would agree that the Common Agricultural Policy was also bad for the development of agriculture. Protectionism is always bad and has resulted in our processing sector becoming lazy.  Many Senators know of factories that operated for three or four months of the year solely for intervention purposes <Col N="999" /> and which made no input into research and development and proper marketing. That is a perfect example of this laziness &mdash; it has happened across the EC as well &mdash; which is a result of this mismanagement of the dairy and beef sectors in particular.  We had a guaranteed market and many of our people spent most of their time trying to find the best ways of exploiting intervention.  There was always a cold store around the corner; it was a handy place to dump a product, especially when one was paid for it.  The industry recognised this over the past few years and decided that it could not last for ever.  That realisation is coming home to us now and is being strongly conveyed to both the Minister and the Minister of State for Agriculture, Food and Forestry when they go to the EC.  The old methods will have to change and it will be a painful business.</P>
    <P>Those of us living in what is termed rural Ireland, especially in the western counties, are not looking forward to good times.  We are afraid and have every reason to be.  There are, however, some changes taking place.  In my own constituency, Monaghan Co-op has successfully diversified.  It is a small co-op but it currently operates a yoghurt factory and also has a range of desserts and other by-products on the market.  It was late in entering this area and does not have the financial resources to compete internationally in the area of marketing, but is working as hard as it can and has carved out a market niche for itself.  It is a pity it does not have the financial resources to expand its markets further into Europe.  It is an example of what is happening. There are factories in County Monaghan, such as meat factories, who are getting increasingly involved in research and development and are beginning to sell successfully.  Many of them are small and the economies of scale are difficult.  Although they are following the correct path, their resources are limited.</P>
    <P>The importance of agriculture to Ireland has never been recognised at EC level.  I will give some statistics to put this in perspective.  Approximately 15 per <Col N="1000" /> cent of our population still work in agriculture, while the corresponding figure for the developed countries in the EC is approximately 3.5 per cent.  That is a colossal difference.  In the UK, for example, the figure is approximately 4.7 per cent.  We are dependent on agriculture for jobs and for GNP.  Agriculture provides approximately 10 per cent of GNP.  The corresponding figure in the developed countries of the EC is approximately 4.1 per cent.  These figures highlight the importance of agriculture in this country.  In 1984 the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, obtained recognition for that fact at EC level, but this recognition has not been followed through.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that we will not benefit from any restructuring of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The number of people employed in agriculture will decrease from 15 per cent to the EC average.  We must accept that regime which is in place in the developed countries of the EC.  Not only will the number of people employed in agriculture decrease, but GNP from agriculture will decrease to the EC average.  This will have a devastating effect on those living in western counties where the structure of agriculture is weak.</P>
    <P>The average farm size in County Monaghan and County Cavan is under 40 acres.  When one visits a Germany 10,000 acre farm which grows 4,000 acres of potatoes and keeps 1,000 cows, one sees the chasm between farmers in this country and those in Germany.  A gulf exists between large industrial farms located throughout the EC and small producers in Ireland.  We now realise that small producers will be eliminated, yet we are afraid to tell them.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Hyland, whose knowledge of agriculture is second to none, is working to try to offset the effects of what will happen.  However, he will be unable to do this because there is no substitute for mainstream agriculture and his efforts will be insignificant.  Rural development is necessary but the sum of GNP received <Col N="1001" /> from agriculture and the earning potential from rural development and diversification will be minimal.</P>
    <P>Many small farmers would prefer to work in a factory and earn one week's wages.  There is an insufficient number of factories for them to work in.  County Monaghan has developed its industrial structures with little input from multinationals and one is surprised by the number of factories throughout the country. The poultry industry has been fully exploited and we even have a quail factory in County Monaghan.  One may have read about quail at national school, but most people have never tasted quail.  The poultry sector has been fully exploited with little outside help, except from the IDA and FEOGA.</P>
    <P>County Monaghan should be used as an example of how things should be done. However, the population of the county, according to the last census, decreased by 3 per cent.  We need people to eat our produce.  If we could double the population of Ireland, we would have a strong home market and a base for development.</P>
    <P>New Zealand, a country which has not benefited from protectionism or intervention, has developed a strong agricultural economy.  Denmark has managed to attain a supreme position on world markets.  We are dependent on agriculture, yet we have not managed to develop in this regard and that is a shame. Some 15 per cent of the population face unemployment because of Common Agricultural Policy reforms and calls from President Clinton for the liberalisation of world trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak.  We have already discussed reforms in the Common Agricultural Policy and the need to halt the decline of rural areas, towns and villages.  The implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy has not halted the decline of rural areas.  It has not succeeded in creating employment and people must leave small family farms to seek employment outside the regions.  The population continues to decline.  Many Garda <Col N="1002" /> stations, post offices and small national schools have closed.  These closures have an impact on the rural population. Beautiful areas in the west have great potential and it is frightening to see the fall in population in places such as Kilbaha, Carrigaholt, Crossooha, Ennistymon and and the Burren area in County Clare.</P>
      <P>An integrated system must be put in place because the development of agriculture and the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy will not solve these problems.  A new framework for rural development involving the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Common Agricultural Policy reforms &mdash; which will be beneficial and will halt rural decline in the long term &mdash; and operations like the Leader programme and the western development schemes must be introduced.</P>
      <P>Rural development has been frustrated over the past number of years.  A combination of industrial and agricultural activity is needed.  We can already see very positive signs of rural revitalisation such as the resettlement programme which has been operated in west Clare by Jim Connolly.  Families have been transferred from Tallaght, Coolock and other parts of Dublin to one of the most beautiful parts of Ireland around Kilbaha on the west coast.  They have managed to prevent the closure of small national schools and have put some life back into areas which have suffered a decline of population since the Famine.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister of State with responsibility for rural development is here because he has already shown a keen commitment to this area.  He knows exactly what is needed and represents an area which has suffered a decline similar to that in the areas I have mentioned.  I believe he can mobilise the State agencies and Government Departments in a new plan which will result in a major drive to revitalise rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The available incentives should be coordinated and integrated in a way which will make an impact on the employment figures and halt the population decline. <Col N="1003" /> They should provide opportunities for many people, especially those with small family farms, to develop small enterprises in the agri-tourism business or the craft industry.  The craft industry in the west has declined to a state where it is almost non-existent and the marketplace is being filled with imported products such as leprechauns made in Japan.  I could mention numerous examples where the market for craft commodities is being supplied by imported products, to a large extent because of our failure to develop these products.</P>
    <P>In the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy the opportunity should not be missed to look at ways which the whole economy of the western areas can be developed.  I refer to these areas because I live there, in what is probably the most remote part of the European Community.  It is a most attractive area which should have the greatest potential for development, yet it is the area which is suffering the greatest decline.  The regional problem within the Community must be tackled, as well as our own failure to take regional decisions.  We cannot blame the European Community for a lack of regional policies and initiatives if we fail to take the decisions which are so necessary to ensure the kind of development and response which we expect from the revised Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>I know there have been quail and snail plants and similar enterprises, but the basic strength of the agricultural industry must be underpinned.  This is possible with the reform measures.  It is not good enough to expect rural communities to survive where, at present, they do not even have a basic county road network. In the planned reform and in the allocation of Structural Funds, some attention must be paid to the chronic state of the county roads.  At present, children cannot get to school and families are finding it difficult not alone to get their produce to markets but to travel anywhere because of the collapse of the whole country road network.</P>
    <P>It is important in the integrated development which I speak about that <Col N="1004" /> the Minister of State with responsibility for rural development should encourage the Minister for the Environment and other Government agencies and Departments to pay some attention, even at this late stage, to the declining infrastructure, especially in the most beautiful and scenic parts of the west.  Investment should take place to enable these areas to develop and retain their population.</P>
    <P>My message today is to urge the Minister of State to take some further initiatives. I welcome the initiatives which he has taken so far under the auspices of the Leader programme, the developments which have taken place under the Shannon Free Airport small companies development programme and the work which is being done under the western development scheme.  All these things are important but they need to be integrated into a large scale operation involving all Departments.</P>
    <P>A member of the Government must be given the overall responsibility to ensure the prevention of the closure of post offices, Garda stations and small schools in rural areas.  The incentive and opportunity should be given to many young, enterprising people in small family farms who would live and work in these areas if the opportunity was there to do so. The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is welcome.  It should help to redress the imbalances which have taken place, especially in the severely handicapped, isolated rural areas.  If it does not, then it will have been a massive failure.  I do not believe we should allow that to happen.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State well in his work for rural development.  He should have our support in doing what is needed to halt the decline which has been devastating the west of Ireland for the past 40 or 50 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It seems a short time since we last debated this subject &mdash; I think it was about a month ago.  I had the sense of almost making history at that stage because I had the impression that I was the first person in many years to <Col N="1005" /> speak about Common Agricultural Policy on behalf of the consumer.  The consumer has been paying the bill for Common Agricultural Policy over the past years and is a voice which has not readily been heard.  I am delighted to say that having listened to Senator Henry today, I realise that I have a colleague and I am sure that I was not making history because it has been in the minds of many others.  The point I am making is that we hear the other voice so admirably and so capably expressed.  Senator Daly, Senator Cotter and Senator Rory Kiely made the point on behalf of agriculture.  I wish to speak on behalf of the consumer.</P>
      <P>The lesson from the most recent negotiations is the same lesson which we should have been learning for the past 20 years.  It is a lesson to which in this country we really only paid lip service &mdash; it is that the only future for agriculture is the marketplace.  That is the point I put to the Minister of State today.  We have turned our back on that fact and have continued to rely on the artificialities of the Common Agricultural Policy, namely the intervention system.  This system is so wasteful and extravagant that any sane person could have seen over those years that it could not go on forever, yet I do not think we recognised that.  Instead of preparing our agriculture sector for the inevitable reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the world of the marketplace, we have spent our energy trying to put off that terrible day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the economic history of the last third of this century in Ireland comes to be written, the Common Agricultural Policy will be seen for what I believe it is, a disaster for Ireland rather than the boon which many people considered, and still consider, it to be.  It will be seen as what held us back from properly developing our agriculture and food industry.  It is a little late in the day but I am an optimist and I believe that it is still not too late to do something about it.  We still have the opportunity to build a market-driven agriculture sector and food industry. In order to do this, we need a change of attitude to the whole issue, almost a road to Damascus-type conversion.  All <Col N="1006" /> of us, and especially may I suggest the farming interests, need to face up, once and for all, to the fact that our only future is in the marketplace and not in intervention.  There is a good future for Ireland in that marketplace if we go about doing things the right way.</P>
    <P>I made a very modest proposal when I had the honour of being a member of the Expert Food Group.  I found it a very useful body to be on, but I was probably one of very few people looking at it from the perspective of the marketplace rather than that of the production area.  The cause of our problems in the food industry is that the industry is production driven rather than market driven and I believe that so strongly that I submitted a short minority report to the Expert Food Group whose report was issued last month.  I suggested the best way to make the food industry market driven was to take it out of the control of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. I want to see the appointment of a separate Minister for Food, not a Minister for Food who will always play second fiddle to the interests of the Department of Agriculture.  As a consequence the new body we propose, An Bord Bia, would be responsible to the Minister for Food and not to the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>My suggestion is becoming more attractive every day.  Developments in the industry are persuading more people that the central issue for agriculture and food, which are so important now and may be even more important in the future, is whether they will be production driven or driven by the needs of the market place.  It makes sense if we cannot make the transition to a market led approach for the entire agriculture industry overnight to start with the food industry sector.</P>
    <P>I conclude by repeating my point: the only future for Irish agriculture is in the market place.  In ancient Rome one Senator gave a warning to the Senate every day: <i>delenda est Cartago</i>&mdash; Carthage must be destroyed.  The other Senators got tired of him and of his daily harangue but eventually he was proved correct.  I make no apologies for repeating <Col N="1007" /> my point and give notice that I will continue to repeat it in the years ahead. We must disabuse people of the notion that Irish agriculture can survive by means other than by providing customers with attractively priced products which are competitive with those of other producers. I believe if I repeat myself often enough we will eventually have a Minister for Food rather than a Minister for Food and Agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and agree with Senator Quinn's comments in relation to the marketing of agricultural products.  It is one of the most important aspects of the industry and has not received sufficient attention in recent years.</P>
      <P>It is increasingly evident that it is vitally important to charge a Government Minister with responsibility for the food industry alone and especially for the food processing sector.  If we intend to create more employment nationally we must look at our natural resources of which agriculture is the most important.  There is huge untapped potential for employment in agriculture particularly in the food processing sector.  Too much beef is exported on the hoof which, with proper packaging and marketing, could be slaughtered and processed at home. Unfortunately that part of the industry is not sufficiently developed and it will not be until it is directed by a Food Department that recognises the importance of customer satisfaction not only at home but throughout Europe.  The potential is there because of the unique &ldquo;green&rdquo; quality of our produce; our cattle and sheep are fed on good quality grass which is quite different from production methods in other areas of Europe.  As a result we have a special product to offer but it is not marketed adequately nationally or internationally.  It is important that we address that issue and I hope the Minister will impress on the Department and on Government the need for greater emphasis on that aspect of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> On the subject of Common Agricultural Policy reform, one issue that is causing great concern in the farming community is the recently introduced restriction in beef intervention limits.  From the 1 July 1993 there will be a limit of 380 kilos on beef going into intervention.  A further reduction of 40 kilos to 340 kilos on 1 July 1994 will be extremely serious for the beef producers and for agriculture generally.  Some of our top quality beef will be exempted if this regulation is implemented.  All producers, from the small dairy farmer who produces calves to the cattle finisher, will be seriously affected.  The Minister, Deputy Walsh, must take full responsibility for the consequences and accept that he has failed to convey the unique position of the Irish producer to his counterparts in Europe. As a result of the methods we employ to produce and fatten cattle which differ from those on mainland Europe we have been seriously discriminated against and it is important that the Minister pursue the issue vigorously.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister intends to take this matter to the European Court on grounds of discrimination and that the French Government may also take a case but the Minister could have saved the situation earlier by urging other measures, aside from the weight restriction, to limit intervention.  Other possibilities, for example fat content, were not sufficiently examined or exhausted in the course of the negotiations and that is unfortunate for the Irish farmer.  I hope this situation can be retrieved because otherwise the consequences will be serious and extensive.  There are enough restrictions in the agriculture sector without introducing more.</P>
    <P>Coming from County Clare where there are many small milk producers, I consider the amount of money provided for the milk restructuring scheme &mdash; £1.9 million &mdash; paltry and unacceptable.  It is not adequate to make the impact required.  As a nation of family run farms our long term aspiration would be that all dairy farmers would have a viable quota.  Unfortunately, a number of farmers operate with quotas as small as 7,000 <Col N="1009" /> to 10,000 gallons.  One would hope that eventually everybody would have a quota of about 25,000 gallons from which one could make a reasonable livelihood.  This unfortunate restructuring scheme will not provide the necessary finance; £1.9 million is only peanuts when distributed across the co-op areas.  With the current price of roughly £1 per gallon or £1.80 to buy in milk immediately or £2.70 over a period of a few years, the small farmer cannot afford such expenditure so he or she cannot make progress.  Small farmers will not receive the assistance necessary to keep them in agriculture and the traditional small dairy farm will not survive. I appeal to the Minister to examine that situation with a view to giving hope to small farmers.</P>
    <P>In County Clare I see young farmers leaving their farms to seek employment elsewhere because they believe in the long term they will not make a living from their farms.  Given the directives continually being issued by Europe, they do not see a possibility of making a viable living in the long term.  This is extremely unfortunate at a time when we should be giving hope to young people who have the expertise and the commitment to remain is isolated parts of this country so as to maintain local communities.  It is important to address that issue.  The present proposal is quite ridiculous.</P>
    <P>The area aid forms are causing consternation. I am delighted that for those other than cereal holders, the Minister has adopted the Fine Gael proposal to introduce a more simplified form.  I welcome the fact that this simplified form is currently being sent out to farmers.  I resent the level of intrusion that this form represents.  I thought that under the Constitution we had a right to privacy.  This area aid form is a huge intrusion on the right to privacy.  What is being done is over bureaucratic.  I personally resent the level of intrusion that the area aid form entails.</P>
    <P>At one time a farmer could simply get on with his work, but now every farm family needs one person on a permanent basis monitoring accounts and the various application forms for aid.  Farming <Col N="1010" /> has become more a bureaucracy than an honest living and that is a pity.  The simpler these issues are, the better for all of us.  I appeal to the Minister of State, whom I know to be a sensible man, to do his best to examine the matters I have raised.  I take this opportunity of complimenting him on his work as a public representative.  We might not always be pleased with the replies that we get from him, but he makes a serious effort to help those who ask his advice and I wish him well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members from all sides for their objective contributions on Common Agricultural Policy reform. The Minister addressed all of the main issues of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy during his contribution to the House.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity in the context of this debate to report on behalf of the Minister to Members of this House on the outcome of last week's Council which dealt with the 1993/94 prices and related issues.  In effect the prices for most products had already been agreed in the Common Agricultural Policy reform negotiations and, as a result, the negotiations to a degree centred on related measures for sectors which are of major importance to Ireland.  In addition, the Minister took the opportunity to raise issues of concern for Irish farmers in a number of sectors.</P>
      <P>The main issues involved besides the prices were a series of milk issues, difficulties in the beef and sheepmeat sectors, and set aside in the arable sector. In overall terms the outcome represented a reasonable package, given the difficult budgetary situation facing the Community. There are a number of aspects in the agreement which will be of considerable benefit to Irish farmers particularly in the dairying area.  As in all such negotiations there were some aspects where we had hoped for a more positive outcome but these were clearly outweighted by the benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> I would like to outline briefly the results in the various sectors.  In the milk sector the Commission had proposed a 5 per cent price cut in the support price for butter, a postponement of the 1 per cent quota cut, the allocation of additional quota to SLOM III producers from existing national quotas and adjustments in the milk quotas for Spain, Greece and Italy.  In the course of the negotiations the Minister succeeded in securing considerable improvements in these proposals.  The milk price cut was reduced to 3 per cent of which 2.5 per cent had already been agreed in the context of Common Agricultural Policy reform.  In addition, in the course of the prices negotiations, the milk co-responsibility levy was abolished from 1 April and this is worth some £10 million to Irish dairy farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Walsh, also secured an increase of almost seven million gallons in our national milk quota. This is more than sufficient to deal with the legal entitlements of SLOM III producers. It is proposed to use the balance to help solve particular quota problems and to deal with restructuring quota for certain categories of producers.  In addition, at the Minister's request, it was agreed that the Community would fund, to the tune of almost £2 million, restructuring arrangements here.  Together these measures will be of considerable benefit in rationalising our milk production and have been welcomed by all producers organisations.  The Council did not in my view deal realistically with the 4.5 per cent suspended milk quotas and this aspect will now be decided on finally by the Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>While the agreement reached in Council does provide for some additional allocations for 1993-94 to Spain, Italy and Greece, in part to address long standing statistical errors, the arrangements involved provide for an actual reduction of production in those countries amounting to almost 500 million gallons.  This represents about 2.2 per cent of Community production and should go a long way towards stabilising the Community milk market.  The Commission will closely monitor the system in these countries <Col N="1012" /> and it will be for the Council to decide whether the increased quotas should be continued in 1994/95 and beyond.</P>
    <P>In the beef sector the Commission, in response to strong representations by the Minister, Deputy Walsh, agreed to undertake examinations of the market situation and the intervention system. The Commission has undertaken to report back to the Council by 30 November. In the course of the negotiations, the Minister had sought to convince the Commission to defer its decision on imposing a weight limitation on carcases eligible for intervention.  The Commission was unwilling to do this and in the circumstances we are seeking a review of the validity of the decision by the European Court of Justice and a deferral of the decision pending the outcome of that review.</P>
    <P>The Commission will also undertake an examination of the market in the sheepmeat sector and report to the Council by 30 November next.  Last year the Commission and the Council agreed to grant additional compensation to sheep producers in view of the difficulties experienced by Irish producers.  That decision did not address the inherent inadequacies of the current regime and expect that the report will not only deal with the problem in the short term but will propose amendments to address the fundamental deficiencies of the support arrangements.</P>
    <P>At last week's Council, agreement was also reached on an increase in the payment rate for set-aside, which in Ireland's case will give a new rate of £134.25 per acre from next year as against £105.99 this year, and on a normal rate of 20 per cent for those opting for fixed set-aside as against 15 per cent in the case of rotational set-aside.</P>
    <P>Fixed set-aside will permit farmers to leave the same land in set-aside rather than rotate their set-aside around the farm.  This arrangement should provide greater scope for environmental management. On the latter point, a reflection document on set-aside generally which was presented by the Commission was <Col N="1013" /> particularly welcome.  This document which will form the basis for discussion on possible developments in the policy of land set-aside examines possible options aimed at making the system more flexible, simpler to administer and more environmentally friendly.</P>
    <P>I would like now to turn briefly to the applications for compensatory payments under Common Agricultural Policy reform.  Farmers claiming aid for arable crops or declaring forage areas for the livestock premia schemes had to have their area aid applications with the Department by 15 May 1993.  However, where the forage areas to be declared consist entirely of permanent pasture, the area aid application can be supplied with the first livestock application but not later than 1 July 1993.</P>
    <P>In order to resolve difficulties experienced by a number of farmers in securing maps in good time, the Minister arranged that area aid applications could be submitted by 15 May, without maps, provided that the relevant maps were received by 31 May.  However, no extension has been granted by the EC Commission to the closing date for receipt of area aid application forms, nor has there been any change in the rules which provide for a penalty of 1 per cent per day for each working day by which applications are received late.</P>
    <P>In order to assist farmers to meet the deadline, the Department's offices in Dublin and throughout the country were opened on Saturday, 15 May to receive applications.  I am pleased to be able to report that these arrangements appear to have worked quite well.  The number of applications received after the 15 May has been minimal and the vast majority of applications were accompanied by maps.  I am also happy to say that in general the quality of applications submitted has been quite good, despite criticism which have been raised regarding the complexity of the area aid application forms.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable, however, due to the fact that this is the first year of the new Common Agricultural Policy reform schemes, that some errors will have been <Col N="1014" /> made in completing the area aid applications. In this regard, the written statement supplied by the Commission at last week's Agriculture Council that farmers who discover and report obvious errors in their applications will be given the opportunity to correct these errors without being penalised is very welcome.</P>
    <P>In respect of the livestock premia the Minister recently announced that he had arranged to issue simplified area aid application forms together with help sheets to assist farmers in completing the forms.</P>
    <P>The issue of the simplified forms commenced last week and all farmers should have them in the next week or so.  They are geared specifically towards farmers whose entire holdings are under grass in 1993 and have been so since 1987.  The simplified form does not preclude the use of the original area aid application form should a farmer so wish but it should help enormously in making it easier to apply and qualify for grants in 1993.  The Department and Teagasc will be holding meetings throughout the country over the next few weeks to explain the forms to farmers.  Details of these meetings will be announced next week.  I would like to pay a tribute to Teagasc on their efforts in assisting farmers in completing the application forms to date.</P>
    <P>I cannot remember a time when there has not been some criticism of an Agriculture Minister following a prices package or similar negotiations.  Most of the criticism have stemmed from unrealistic expectations or from a lack of appreciation of the issues appropriate to the Council.  The Minister, Deputy Walsh, has been involved in three long and arduous series of negotiations in the Council starting with Common Agricultural Policy reform and including the December package last year and the current prices and related measures agreement. In all of these negotiations he has endeavoured, with considerable success, to secure the optimum results for Irish agriculture and its related industries.  I have no doubt that he will continue to do so in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter because, unfortunately, the manner in which I became aware of it was by rumour.  I received representations last year from a member of the staff of Blanchardstown hospital who was concerned about the possible recommissioning of the incinerator.  I contacted the planning department of Dublin County Council and was assured that there was no application for permission to commission the incinerator at the hospital.  On foot of that information, I reassured the member of staff that it was not going ahead. Unfortunately, I did not realise that because there was an existing incinerator in the hospital, it did not require planning permission to be recommissioned.  The first problem is that something so significant should have come to my knowledge, and indeed to the knowledge of the community, by way of rumour.  That is not the way the hospital should do its business.</P>
      <P>Later I was contacted by a community group when it became apparent that there were plans to recommission the incinerator in the hospital.  They asked me if I would meet the management of the hospital and the community group to see exactly what was happening.  I wish to raise two aspects, one is the principle of incineration of waste and the other is the position in relation to the James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown. In relation to the incinerator in the hospital premises, the Beaumont Hospital Triennial Report states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incinerator installed in the hospital has proved to be totally unsuitable for the disposal of hospital waste. As in the case of other stack emissions, the incinerator, when it was in operation, was the single biggest source of complaints from public representatives <Col N="1016" /> and residents in relation to smoke pollution.</P>
    <P>The hospital was forced through such pressure, and indeed pressure from the operating staff, to close down the incinerator operation after spending considerable time and money in seeking, without success, a satisfactory level of pollution control.</P>
    <P>All future incinerator plants will have to conform to the most stringent standards in relation to atmospheric emissions.  Funding is not available to provide these complex and highly sophisticated incinerator facilities at hospital level and future developments will be concentrated in hospitals providing central disposal facilities for the use of all hospitals.</P>
    <P>The hospital incinerator has been out of commission since mid October, 1989 and will not be recommissioned or replaced in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>I refer to this because Beaumont Hospital was purpose built.  It is one of the most modern hospitals in Dublin.  If a hospital of that quality and which cost that amount of money feels there is no possible chance of incinerating its waste, it is nonsensical that a hospital like James Connolly Memorial, which was built in the 1940s or the 1950s, could even consider reintroducing such a practice.  I know that the hospital carried out some improvement works to their incinerator at the request of Dublin County Council. I have taken this up and intend pursuing it further with the county council.  The environmental section does not seem to speak to the planning department and hence as a public representative, I was not aware until a community group informed me that one arm of the local authority was granting permission for this to go ahead and said they would monitor the emissions.  That is the principle of incineration of waste and there is a question mark as to whether this is feasible, practical or safe.  I ask the Minister to consider that as a separate issue.</P>
    <P>I received correspondence from a representative of the union which was sent to the hospital.  That correspondence &mdash;<Col N="1017" /> and this is where the crux of the matter lies as far as I am concerned &mdash; refers to the site of the incinerator.  The union says that much work needs to be done at the site on which the incinerator stands.  That is an understatement.  The improvements detailed in the correspondence include repairs to the roof of the building, the removal of all rubbish inside and outside the building and states that present and future clinical hospital waste needs to be secured properly in containers where there is no possibility of cats, dogs, birds, rodents, or unauthorised person interfering with same.  I will not bring you through the whole lot but there are a number of proposals.  They state that hot welding operations should not take place where there are plastic bags stored.  Clinical waste should only be burnt when the prevailing wind is blowing away from the adjacent workshops.  Operators must be properly trained, air samples must be taken, a safety and health audit should be carried out of workshop procedures being carried out nearby by a competent safety and health expert.</P>
    <P>I can make this correspondence available to the Minister and I can tell him that almost all the requests by the union have not been complied with.  I visited the site and met the member of the staff whose job it is to get this up and running again.  I met him on an amicable basis, explained the worries and saw their side of the case.  Waste must be disposed of but none of us can ignore the manner in which it is done.  I understand the hospital's problems.  I asked for details of written reports in relation to the type of waste which would be burnt, how much waste would be burnt, if it was the intention that only waste from Blanchardstown hospital would be burnt or that other waste would be taken in.  This was an informal meeting with the hospital staff representative.  I also wrote on two occasions seeking this information.  To date, neither I nor the community groups in the greater Blanchardstown area have received one iota of correspondence in relation to our representations.  What is emerging now, again by way of rumour, is that the hospital authorities are tired <Col N="1018" /> of listening to me and members of the community who have expressed reservations about the possible recommissioning of the incinerator.  They have reached the end of the line with us and are not prepared to discuss it any further and it is their intention to proceed with the recommissioning of the incinerator. The smoke emissions will be monitored for the ten weeks and on foot of that they will then decide whether they will burn the rubbish on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>I live in Blanchardstown, very close to this hospital.  The area around the site where the incinerator is located is completely open.  It is a rural area, beside Abbotstown veterinary laboratory.  The union letter refers to unauthorised persons. A child is an unauthorised person. The hospital has been singularly unsuccessful in stopping me from driving up to the site, taking photographs and walking around it so they will be totally unsuccessful in stopping young children gaining entry to that site.  I am not exaggerating when I say that it looks as if the roof may cave in.  The correspondence from the union supports fears that the building in which waste is stored is dangerous. Maybe I should take that up with the dangerous buildings section of Dublin County Council, I possible will.  There is a very large ventilation shaft in the room which houses the waste which would allow me &mdash; or somebody bigger than me &mdash; to gain entry through it.  It is certainly big enough for children to get into.  There are sharps stored on the floor; they may be securely stored but they are on the floor of this building.  Clinical waste in bags, which are easy to open, are also stored on the floor of this building.</P>
    <P>The possible environmental pollution is only one aspect and I am not assured that there will be no environmental pollution as a result of emissions from the incinerator.  I am convinced that the site at present is dangerous and constitutes a serious hazard to children who will gain access to it.  Will the Minister stop Blanchardstown hospital from recommissioning this incinerator, at least until the community have had their worries allayed and the site totally secured?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to respond to the question raised by Senator McGennis in relation to the incineration of hospital waste at James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown. I understand from the Eastern Health Board that the plant in question was taken out of use by the board's own engineers approximately three years ago pending maintenance and upgrading. Since then much of the waste has had to be disposed of, at considerable expense, using outside contractors.  The proposal by the health board to recommence using the plant at James Connolly Memorial Hospital follows extensive consultation with Dublin County Council.  The county council officials have agreed that, following upgrading, the plant could be used for a ten week trial period.  During this period the performance of the plant would be monitored and permission for the continued use of the plant would be subject to the health board and county council officials being satisfied with the standard of incineration being achieved.</P>
      <P>While the county council officials have given clearance for the ten week trial, the health board has deferred commencement of the trial pending discussions with the local community.  To date there have been three meetings between health board officials and representatives of the local community.  In addition there have been meetings for the purpose of informing employees concerned with trade union representatives. My Department has been assured by the Eastern Health Board that the incinerator at James Connolly Memorial Hospital will not be brought into use for the trial until full consultations have been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of my Department are currently looking at the whole question of hospital waste generation and disposal and, no doubt, will be kept informed of developments at James Connolly Memorial Hospital.  As well as incineration, alternative modern technologies are being considered with a view to coming up with the most appropriate methods of waste disposal to meet the <Col N="1020" /> high environmental standards expected today.  A proposal to hold a trial of an alternative disposal system involving shredding and disinfection by microwaving is currently under consideration. In a related area considerable progress has also been made in the formulation of a health service waste policy.  The implementation of the policy will take account of the situation in existing hospitals such as James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am slightly reassured by the reply of the Minister of State. The report states that discussions will continue and if the incinerator is to be recommissioned, the site must be totally secured.  The health and safety officer on the hospital's staff has not been allowed to attend any of the meetings between the community and hospital management.  In future, discussions between the hospital and community groups should include a representative of the health and safety officer.  If this is to go ahead, and I hope it does not, the site must be completely secured before incineration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Defence and the Marine.  Most of us cannot fail to have been affected by the wanton carnage of birds along a one and a half mile long beach near Clogherhead with the resultant damage to wildlife and the beach.  Various questions remain unanswered in relation to the spillage. Will the Minister set in train an investigation to come up with answers as to exactly what happened?  There are conflicting views as to whether a ship released crude oil or perhaps emptied its waste into the sea off the coast.  It is not clear whether the ship involved had been berthed in an Irish port, but this has to be looked at.  Last weekend, as far as we are aware, over 350 birds were killed off the County Louth coast and further bird losses were reported off Dublin, Kilcoole, County Wicklow, and off the Wexford coast.  In the main, some 260 razorbills, guillemots, puffins and other species <Col N="1021" /> were affected.  The damage has been described by the Irish Wild Bird Conservancy as a very serious and critical loss to them, comparable to the disastrous loss off the Sheltand coast some time ago.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is concerned to know how this happened resulting in the bird carnage, loss of fish stocks and the ongoing damage to beaches which will certainly prevent swimming and boating. The problems should be investigated at EC level.  I am sure the Minister would have the support of all the Members of this House and his EC colleagues in investigating the oil spillage.  Dumping at sea requires investigation as it causes wanton destruction of marine and bird life.  I would like to pay tribute to the many volunteers, including members of the Irish Wild Bird Conservancy, who painstakingly recovered some of the affected birds last weekend.  Unfortunately, while some birds were recovered, the vast majority were dead.  It is important to have clearly defined policies to deal with ships that wantonly release their oil or waste at sea.  This whole area must be looked at, and I am sure the Minister's Department will investigate the matter to see if further regulations should be introduced.  Given the international aspect of the seas it would take a combined effort between the EC authorities and international shipping to bring about regulation.  If we do not work together we will eventually wipe out the wildlife and its natural environment we have been seeking to protect.</P>
      <P>The latest incident represents a dreadful loss of wildlife off the east coast.  It is not certain how far off the coast the spillage took place but I understand that some of the birds affected had been ringed in south west Scotland as far back as March 1990.  It is difficult to know if the full extent of the loss has yet been discovered.  I again thank the Minister for coming here, and I hope he can respond positively.  I appreciate that investigations are ongoing, but the Minister should keep the question of ships releasing their oil and waste at the top of his agenda, particularly in relation to EC meetings and discussions with his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cosgrave for his intervention.  It is something of which I am very much aware and it is important that it has been raised.</P>
      <P>I will set out the events sequentially. At 8.30 a.m. on 28 May 1993 the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre of the Irish marine emergency service was notified that a number of birds, coated with oil, had been washed up on the beach at Clogherhead, County Louth.</P>
      <P>In accordance with established procedure the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre immediately alerted the Clogherhead coast and cliff rescue service, the Clogherhead harbour master, Clogherhead Royal National Lifeboat Institute, the oil pollution officer of Louth County Council and the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>Following contact with the Department, the Air Corps scrambled a Cessna aircraft in an effort to locate the source of the oil.  A radio navigation warning was broadcast every four hours advising shipping in the area of the incident and requesting information on any oil sightings. Air traffic control at Dublin Airport was also asked to seek information from aircraft overflying the area.  The coastguard at Belfast, Holyhead and the Isle of Man were notified and the UK marine pollution control unit carried out an aerial surveillance of the area.  I thank the UK and Irish bodies involved in the overall operation.</P>
      <P>Despite the extensive efforts, no trace of any oil was found at sea.  An examination was undertaken of the wind speed and direction along with the tides and currents in the area at the time of the find.  On the basis of that examination and the fact that no oil slick was spotted near the shore, it is considered the likely source of the oil was in the area between County Down and the Isle of Man.  It is assumed the incident was caused by an accidental or deliberate discharge of oil by a passing ship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand Louth County Council took samples for analysis, the results of which are awaited.  That would conform to the Senator's request for an ongoing investigation.  As soon as the samples have been analysed and the results confirmed <Col N="1023" /> positively or negatively I will let the Senator and any other person interested have the information.</P>
    <P>Illegal washing of tanks is an acknowledged problem for coastal states with busy shipping lanes.  Air surveillance of the Irish Sea is carried out by the UK and Irish authorities using sophisticated oil detection equipment.  A Memorandum of Understanding with the UK authorities to formalise joint co-operation and assistance in the event of marine emergencies involving search and rescue and pollution control is being finalised at present.</P>
    <P>The MARPOL Convention which regulates the discharge of ships' waste at sea imposes obligations on port authorities to provide adequate facilities for the reception of such waste at ports.  The Senator will be aware MARPOL is the acronym for the convention on marine pollution.</P>
    <P>The culprit in this case would appear to have been a vessel in transit and not one calling to an Irish port.  I can, however, advise the House that Ireland hopes to ratify the MARPOL Convention very shortly and to implement the MARPOL Regulations which are designed to prevent pollution of the sea by oil, noxious liquid substances and garbage. In anticipation of the coming into effect of MARPOL we have examined the adequacy of reception facilities in the commercial ports, fishery harbour centres and a number of other important ports.  By and large these facilities are satisfactory.  Upgrading, where necessary, will be undertaken by the port authorities.</P>
    <P>The <i>Braer</i> incident which took place off the Scottish coast on 25 January 1993 has drawn international attention to the need for the identification of environmentally sensitive areas within the European Community.  The matter is included in a resolution outlining priority measures for a Community action programme on maritime safety and pollution prevention.  The resolution is due for adoption at the Transport Council of Ministers on Tuesday next, 8 June.  The Minister of State at the Department, <Col N="1024" /> Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, will attend that meeting.  He will stress the need for action to implement the agreed measures quickly and effectively.  We are laying particular emphasis on the need to protect the ecologically sensitive Irish coastline from potentially serious marine accidents through the establishment of exclusion or avoidance zones and ship reporting zones.  We intend to put forward our proposals shortly to the European Commission and the IMO for endorsement.</P>
    <P>On the home front I have identified a need for more immediate and less formalised contact between the Irish Naval Service and the Department of the Marine.  This is being examined urgently. In the meantime criteria for the selection of Community areas of high ecological importance are being developed by the Commission and we are actively participating in this process which I hope will be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>Incidents such as this underline the importance of action now to ensure the risk of pollution incidents is minimised. The putting in place of comprehensive precautionary measures such as the exclusion zones and ship reporting measures is, therefore, my main priority.</P>
    <P>My information is the French on the north-western part of their coast have a 37-mile exclusion zone.  This is not something new, it already exists.  There is no reason why we should not have a 20-mile exclusion zone at minimum.  These people should be kept well away from our coasts.  Ireland is the most vulnerable country in the EC in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is one of my great fears as Minister for the Marine that we may have to face a marine pollution disaster.  It is a recurring nightmare and we must ensure within our competence that such a disaster does not happen.  It is preventable if we take action now and not when it is too late.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Senator for raising the matter and I appreciate his concern. I will communicate to him the outcome of any investigations into the matter.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 9 June 1993.</P>
