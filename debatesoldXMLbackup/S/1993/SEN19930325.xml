      <P>I have notice from Senator Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide a special £1 million grant from the national lottery to restore library bookstocks which have been severely depleted in recent years.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator O'Sullivan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to give approval for the contract for a new reservoir and water tower at Castletroy, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Mooney and O'Sullivan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. The Order of Business is more than agreeable to us but I wish to serve notice that the substance of Item 10 on the Order of Business, which was raised by my colleague Senator O'Toole yesterday, will be placed next week before the House so that it can be debated unless there is a clear indication that there will be an improvement in the conditions under which we work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for your welcome.  I very much welcome the decision to make provision for an exchange of views in Seanad Éireann today on the critical question of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am grateful that you have given me an opportunity to open this series of statements by presenting some reflections of my own on this subject.  I also hope to be in a position to respond later today to some of the points which Members may wish to raise.</P>
      <P>It is fitting that the discussion should take place early in the life of this Seanad. One of the important functions of this House is to provide a forum where representatives of different currents of Irish life can debate in a reflective and considered way the great issues and challenges facing our society.</P>
      <P>It is commonplace to include Northern Ireland among the most serious of these issues, but I worry sometimes that the long duration of this problem may have numbed us to its terrible impact on our lives or caused us to lose sight of how costly it truly is.</P>
      <P>The heartrendering pictures of the Ball and Parry families in Warrington, which we saw on our television screens, echo the anguish which has been felt, each in their own way, by the families of more than 3,000 victims who have died in the course of the conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The indirect costs of the conflict impose other severe burdens.  It is tragic that, in spite of the outstanding achievements our people have to offer the world, there are still many areas where the word Ireland evokes, first and foremost, the idea of terror, violence and civil strife. At a time when so many young people on both parts of the island are crying out <Col N="920" /> for the basic amenity of a job and a livelihood, it is deeply frustrating to witness the effects of this conflict in terms of wasted economic opportunity and the diversion of scarce resources.  The bombs and bullets destroy hope as well as human life and limbs.</P>
    <P>It is therefore no mere figure of speech when the Programme for a Partnership Government says that the future welfare of all the people of Ireland is overshadowed by this conflict.  The programme, and the Government, draw the logical conclusion.  This must be a priority issue for us.  To come to grips successfully with this problem would be one of the greatest benefits which could be conferred on the people of this island, and indeed of our neighbouring island as well. The priority given to it by the Government is justified on eminently practical grounds, as well as on the higher grounds of moral and political duty.</P>
    <P>Having agreed at the outset on the importance of the Northern Ireland issue, the Government programme also sets out a number of principles and general pointers on the discretion in which progress must be sought.  Members of the Seanad will already be familiar with that section of the programme.  I want to make clear from the outset that I do not believe any one person or group has a monopoly on wisdom in terms of a solution.  If we are to escape from this terrible legacy of history, as I believe we must, we will need a co-operative effort of all the forces of goodwill on this island.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a new spirit abroad in both parts of Ireland in relation to this problem.  I believe a new generation wants to escape from the shackles of the past and establish a new basis for our relationships on this island.</P>
    <P>That will require change on all sides. Our starting position must be the acknowledgment that all previous approaches have failed.  In my reading on the problem recently I was greatly struck by a comment made in 1970 by the late Seán McEntee, a Northerner and one of the stalwarts of the War of Independence. Looking back in old age over <Col N="921" /> a lifetime spent dealing with Irish politics and the issue of partition he said:</P>
    <P>We elders have failed to find a solution for the problem; and after 50 years we may be forgiven for thinking that perhaps we went the wrong way about it.  Maybe we were too rigid in our approach, too tenacious of our own point of view, too proud to temporise or placate.  Whatever may have been the reason, we made no headway; so our successors must start from &ldquo;square one&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We must indeed, I believe, again start at &ldquo;square one&rdquo; in terms of our readiness to rethink and redefine for our own times the nature of our approach to the problem.  When we analyse the failures of approaches to date, I believe we will find a common thread running through them.  All of them involved to some degree the denial by one tradition of the reality of the other.  They involved implicit &mdash; and sometimes loudly explicit &mdash; assumptions of victory or defeat for one side or the other.</P>
    <P>We are now, belatedly, coming to a growing realisation that for both communities in Northern Ireland these extremes of victory or defeat are both impossible.  The four generations which have elapsed since partition have not caused Nationalists in Northern Ireland to redefine themselves as British, and any policy based on the assumption that they will do so in the future is bound to fail. The refusal of Ulster Unionists to conform to the role defined for them or to take the place set aside for them in Nationalist myth is no less categorical and deep-seated.</P>
    <P>The reality is that neither tradition can dominate or coerce the other, whether in a Northern Ireland context or in an all-Ireland context.  We have all learned that the hard way, but we have not yet succeeded in making the joint effort necessary to build a new political system on that key insight.</P>
    <P>If we do so, the prospects for peace will I believe be bright, for such a new system would be founded on a reality which we all recognise in our hearts, <Col N="922" /> rather than on our respective inherited myths which will allow terrorism and evil to flourish in the vast and perhaps unbridgeable gaps between them.</P>
    <P>I believe our search for a solution must address all of the dimensions of the problem, and in particular its political, security and economic aspects.  It must address satisfactorily each of the relationships involved &mdash; those within Northern Ireland, between North and South and between these two islands.</P>
    <P>It is common ground between all the parties to the Northern Ireland problem, without exception, that the path to progress lies through political dialogue.  It is the circumstances, conditions and objectives of such dialogue which are the points of deep difference, and explain the paradox that something which is apparently wanted by everyone should be so difficult to put in place.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to seeking the urgent resumption of political dialogue to address comprehensively all the relationships involved.  Since taking office I have had three formal meetings with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, to consider how this objective, which we both share, can best be translated into reality.</P>
    <P>I have actively sought to foster fresh thinking on possible new approaches to the problem.  I have tried to show that this Government means to continue, as it began, to quote from our programme:</P>
    <P>In a spirit of openness and honesty, with the overriding aim of achieving peace and reconciling the legitimate rights and aspirations of both communities, showing a willingness to discuss all constitutional issues and to initiate and incorporate change in the context of an overall settlement.</P>
    <P>I have taken care to ensure that all the significant Northern Ireland leaders were directly aware of my desire to meet with them for face-to-face discussions.  I have followed up with meetings with Northern representatives, both political and otherwise, wherever it was open to me to do so on a constructive basis.</P>
    <P>I shall be pursuing these efforts to the <Col N="923" /> utmost of my ability because I believe there is, quite literally, no alternative to political dialogue.  It is vitally important that both the Irish and British Governments use there collective resources imaginatively and well, to provide the impetus and set the parameters for new nogotiations.</P>
    <P>It is clear that in a problem as complex as this, a solution is not simply waiting to be found.  It must be constructed painstakingly, in a difficult process of give and take.  The British position is still the central focus of all the main political forces in Northern Ireland, whether on the Nationalist or the Unionist side, and that reality, however inconvenient, inevitably has consequences for the role of the British Government.</P>
    <P>I have sought to put beyond doubt that the Irish Government will play the most constructive possible role.  However, Northern Ireland political leaders have their own responsibilities.  There will not be peace and stability in Ireland unless the two main traditions on the island co-operate to create and sustain these conditions. The Unionist community holds one of the necessary keys, and it would be tragic if they refused to apply it.</P>
    <P>While a solution to this problem can ultimately be reached only by agreement between Irish people in Ireland, I believe we should not overlook the very helpful role which can be played by the concern and interest of friends of Ireland outside these islands.  The United States in particular has been enriched by the contributions of both traditions in Ireland.  It is bound by close ties of friendship to both Governments.  The constructive interest of President Clinton and his Administration, which I believe has been greatly strengthened by the recent visit of the Taoiseach to the United States, could be a very precious asset to all sides in the search for progress.</P>
    <P>In relation to security, the position of the Government needs little advocacy to our people.  I know the great majority of them abhor to the very core of their beings, as I do, the horrors inflicted on innocent people in the perverted service <Col N="924" /> of traditional ideals.  The dignity in suffering we saw in Warrington will have recalled for many of us the charity and forbearance of Senator Gordon Wilson, whose presence I am happy to welcome. The parents of Jonathan Ball and Timothy Parry, like him, have given us a moving testament of the capacity of the human spirit to rise above hatred and despair, even in the grip of the deepest pain and injury.  The inhumanity of the bombers finds its ultimate rebuke in their humanity.  Their forbearance and goodness neutralise the poisons which the terrorists on all sides so callously seek to inject into our relationships.</P>
    <P>As I address this House this morning, news is arriving of more murders in Northern Ireland and sadly that is a reflection of the times in which we live. Apparently three men were shot dead this morning in Castlerock, County Derry, which heightens the problem and provides more reason for us to do something about it.</P>
    <P>This violence not only leaves an indelible trail of misery and destruction; it is also utterly futile.  In Northern Ireland, the effect of a paramilitary campaign whose purported objective is to secure Irish unity has been to entrench and exacerbate the existing divisions among the people of Ireland.  Far from bringing people together, the violence has widened inexorably the chasm between the two communities and has damaged the prospects for reconciliation and co-operation. Far from promoting the objective of Irish unity, paramilitary violence is the one great obstacle to the achievement of understanding among the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government is determined to do all in its power to remove the scourge of paramilitary violence both from this island and from the neighbouring island.  It is intolerable that the desire of the overwhelming majority of people in Ireland and Britain to lead peaceful and orderly lives should be frustrated by a tiny minority, locked into doctrines which ignore even the most minimal respect for the democratic wishes of the people of Ireland and which <Col N="925" /> ultimately become simply a self-awarded licence for indiscriminate murder.</P>
    <P>The reality of violence offers the starkest possible remainder that the threat posed by instability in Northern Ireland is a threat to all the people of both islands.  It underlines the importance of the fullest possible co-operation between both Governments to ensure that those who adopt or support such methods do not succeed.  That principle of co-operation underlies the Anglo-Irish Agreement, as I believe it must underlie the search for a new and more broadly based agreement.</P>
    <P>Both Governments have made clear they are open to such an agreement, with, I hope, the support of all the significant political parties on the island who adhere exclusively to peaceful democratic means.</P>
    <P>Unless and until that point is reached, both Governments are committed to the fullest implementation of the present Agreement.  I hope to use to the full its potential for progress in every respect.  I believe it is a mistake to see the Agreement, as some Unionists do, as designed for the benefit of the Nationalist community only.  It gives the Irish Government a certain role in relation to the interests of the Nationalist community, and that is a recognition of a reality which some might wish to avoid.  However much of its agenda, properly understood, is in the long-term interest of both communities. That is eminently true of its commitment to equal rights.  The security dimension, to which it has made a significant contribution, is immediately and directly in the interest of every law-abiding citizen of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak in a little detail about another dimension of the Agreement, which is also in the direct interests of both communities, and which I am anxious to see developed.</P>
    <P>Overriding all political differences I believe all of us in this island have one simple ambition in common &mdash; to live a life of peace and to enjoy the benefits of the best standard of living and quality of life which the resources of Ireland, properly used, can offer us.  No-one <Col N="926" /> would claim that our political divisions reflect any neat geographical or economic logic.  Political differences can of course gravely damage our economic prospects, which is yet another reason why we must address them.  However it is also open to us to pursue our agenda of economic co-operation as an important programme in its own right.  I am very anxious to do so, using the very considerable potential of the Anglo-Irish Conference wherever that can usefully be done.</P>
    <P>We can build on the ever-growing recognition of the significant common ground which already exists between the two parts of Ireland in the economic and social field.  There are extensive common interests in the various sectors, far more than may generally be appreciated.  I have no doubt that, in the years ahead, many more common interests will be identified, particularly in the context of the Single Market and its associated challenges.</P>
    <P>The best way to pursue common interests is to develop joint approaches and strategies.  Working hand in hand, we can harness all the energies and resources of this island for the common good.  Co-operation in all the areas of economic activity, both at home and abroad, will generate significant new employment, increase business opportunities and improve the material welfare of everyone, North and South.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, this is surely what politics is about.  The people who elect us want us to do everything in our power to safeguard their livelihoods and to improve their material circumstances. That is an essential part of our mandate. As the Programme for a Partnership Government makes clear, it is an urgent and overriding priority for this Government.</P>
    <P>I know that political leaders in Northern Ireland recognize the enormous value of cross-Border co-operation in these areas and the tangible benefits which it will bring to their constituents.  The business community in Northern Ireland has as keen a sense of these benefits as their counterparts in the South and wish to see <Col N="927" /> structures put in place which will facilitate them.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement plays, and will continue to play, a pivotal role in the promotion of North-South co-operation. Over the past few years, the Anglo-Irish Conference has devoted considerable attention to this crucial area of its agenda. It has lent a powerful impetus to existing co-operation in the various sectors and it has identified areas in which there is room for expansion and development.</P>
    <P>The conference is at present discharing a substantial programme of work across a wide range of such areas.  At our meeting last Tuesday, for example, we carried out a detailed review of North-South trade and considered ways in which this might be developed further.  We also considered the scope for North-South co-operation in the area of tourism.  We reviewed the progress which has been made so far on a very noteworthy example of North-South co-operation, the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal, which will be an important tourism resource for both sides of the Border in the very near future.</P>
    <P>These are matters which are directly relevant to the material prosperity of Irish people, both North and South.  Our discussion of them highlights the continuing value of the Anglo-Irish Conference as a framework within which Ministers and officials of both Governments can co-operate on matters of practical importance and benefit for everyone on this island.  Over the coming months, we shall be discussing co-operation in areas such as employment training, science and technology, inland fisheries, education, transport and agriculture.</P>
    <P>Let me provide a few concreate examples of recent North-South co-operation from which direct benefits will flow for people on either side of the Border. An Bord Gáis are currently co-operating with British Gas on the construction of a gas pipeline which will link Scotland with both parts of Ireland.  The ESB and the Northern Ireland Electricity Board are engaged in an electricity interconnection project in the North-West.  The <Col N="928" /> Dublin-Belfast rail link is being upgraded and modernised at a cost of £73 million.</P>
    <P>Projects such as these help us to make more economic use of our scarce energy resources, to improve our infrastructure in a co-ordinated way and to derive benefits in terms of increased investment, employment and tourism revenue.  They help in the development of a single &ldquo;island economy&rdquo;, which I consider the only sensible approach in a global environment marked by increasing competitiveness but also increasing interdependence.  The co-ordination of effort and pooling of scarce resources will undoubtedly serve the common good of both parts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The business community North and South has recognised this.  A joint initiative undertaken by the Irish Business and Employers Conferderation and the Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland is proving very valuable.  An IBEC-CBI business development programme involving some 300 companies has enabled new opportunities for North-South trade and for collaboration in overseas markets to be identified. There has also been important co-operation between the Chambers of Commerce, North and South.</P>
    <P>The International Fund for Ireland is making a major contribution with its support for a number of projects in the business development area.  Valuable cross-Border co-operation in the economic sphere is also underway at local authority level as well as in the private sector and at the level of voluntary and community groups.</P>
    <P>At the European Community level, there is enormous scope for co-operation in our joint interest.  The two Governments intend to pursue a common approach in the Development Plans which we will be submitting in the context of the forthcoming Structural Funds discussions. A common approach in this area should help to convert European goodwill into further concrete support for our efforts to develop the &ldquo;island economy&rdquo;.  It should also act as an additional incentive to co-operation between business and private sector <Col N="929" /> interests North and South in the context of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>The time to act is now.  There is a vast spectrum of possibilities which we can explore jointly to our mutual advantage. Let us go forward together in each of these areas, playing to our strengths and building on what we have in common.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I join you in welcoming the Tánaiste to the House for this very important debate. The Tánaiste has a record of substantial and sustained achievement on the question of Northern Ireland.  His genuine concern for the problem is not in doubt and I hope that the progress he makes during his current term in the Department of Foreign Affairs will be as great as it was during his previous term as Tánaiste.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste's speech appeared to hold out some hope but when stripped to its essentials, the speech held out little hope.  If we are honest, the situation has never been as bleak as it is today on a number of fronts.  It is odd to look back to the beginning of the troubles 25 or 26 years ago and to read in the Crossman Diaries a report of the impact of the troubles on the British Cabinet at that time.  According to the Diaries, Mr. Jim Callaghan after his first visit to Belfast said that from the point of view of the British Government, the troubles had some advantages.  They deflected attention from British Government deficiencies and the mess of the pound; they had now, &ldquo;got into something which we can hardly mismanage&rdquo;.  That was the first reaction of the British Government in 1969-70.  We have seen over the last 25 years how we have all succeeded in mismanaging the Northern situation.  A quarter century of missed opportunities and mistakes has brought us to our present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are honest we have to first examine the bleakness of the situation.  There are no talks at the moment between the parties in Northern Ireland nor are there any plans for talks.  The reason given is the imminence of the local elections. <Col N="930" /> Invariably there is some excuse why talks will not take place.  Even if talks were taking place, is there any reason to believe that the possibility exists at present, for genuine dialogue or for real progress?  Sadly, from talking to people on both sides, I see little possibility at present of any real basis for agreement. The gap between the parties seems to have widened rather than narrowed in recent times.  It may be that the current spate of atrocities and the worsening political situation will encourage people to consider a compromise but there is little evidence of that at present.</P>
    <P>In spite of the hopeful list of developments outlined by the Tánaiste there are no real talks going on between the Governments at present.  The Anglo-Irish talks have resumed and for that we must be grateful, but there is no sign of any new initiative.  There is no sign that the talks which broke off last year are about to be resumed or, if they were, that any greater progress would be made.  I understand from those involved in the last talks that progress was made but only to a point.  We in the Seanad have to analyse carefully what we might have done to block progress.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland a considerable number of former councillors are not standing in the forthcoming local elections. Some of the best, most committed local councillors have simply had enough. They are frustrated by working in a political vacuum, sickened and tired by the viciousness which passes for politics on so many Northern Ireland councils.  An exception is Derry City Council which is a model of powersharing.  Derry City Council, led by the SDLP, has put into practice what the SDLP preaches.  Yet we may contrast that with the situation in Belfast where the antics of Belfast City Council would make anyone despair of the future for real politics.  Belfast City Council is a disgrace to the political process and it is no wonder that people are opting out of politics in Northern Ireland. It is no wonder that so many of the best and most intelligent young people are emigrating, and that few young people are tempted into politics.  If the best are <Col N="931" /> not going into politics the situation does not offer a great deal of hope.  Furthermore, there is increasing segregation between the communities in Northern Ireland.  A report in last Sunday's <i>Independent on Sunday</i> showed clearly the extent to which communities at all social levels are moving toward greater polarisation. Given that this physical polarisation undoubtedly leads to psychological and mental polarisation as well, what hope does that hold for a breaking down of the barriers which have existed in the minds and the hearts of the people of Northern Ireland for so long?</P>
    <P>As the Tánaiste was speaking this morning, word came of three more deaths at the hands of northern paramilitaries. When we consider the position of the paramilitaries in this week of all weeks, we can see how much worse the situation is now than even a year ago.  The Protestant paramilitaries have organised themselves as never before.  Ruthless, heavily armed and focused, their violence is now totally sectarian, unlike the random violence of the past.  We see their strong, vested interest in racketeering.  We must fear an extension of their activities to the Republic and there is every reason to believe that this may occur in the near future.  Most of all, there is no evidence that anybody is getting through to the Protestant paramilitaries.  We see no sign that they are listening to the leaders of the Protestant community or that they have any intention of changing their current tactics.</P>
    <P>The Provisional IRA are currently active on two fronts: in Northern Ireland with their regular weekly diet of bombing and murder and also in Great Britain. Warrington is the latest example and it will not be the last.  We have witnessed an attack on Downing Street and there have been plans to blow up Buckingham Palace.  It is only a matter of time before the Warrington atrocity will pale into insignificance compared with what the Provisional IRA are capable of doing and intend to do in Britain.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence of any change of heart or mind within the Provisionals. <Col N="932" /> Warrington was deliberate; if nobody had been killed there it would have been a failure from the Provisional IRA's point of view.  A policeman's death in Warrington would have been a qualified successs but the death of young innocent children grabbed the world's headlines. In spite of excuses, that was exactly what the Provisional IRA hoped to achieve in Warrington and we must never let them forget that.</P>
    <P>Mr. Séamus Mallon said this week in <i>The Irish Times</i> that perhaps the time has come to enter into political dialogue with Sinn Féin.  Mr. Mallon is a brave and decent man who knows more than most what is happening on the ground in the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland so what he says must be listened to.  I hold out little hope of Sinn Féin entering into meaningful dialogue so long as their ambivalence about what they call the armed struggle continues and so long as they can be ambivalent about the horrific bombing in Warrington.</P>
    <P>When we consider the current situation in Northern Ireland is there anything positive that gives us cause for hope?  I have mentioned the situation in Derry City Council.  Derry is becoming an example of what Northern Ireland could be and that is a tribute to all Derry politicians and in particular to the SDLP leaders.  The Tánaiste mentioned the encouraging high level of cross-Border co-operation with regard to CIE, Bord Gáis, ESB and business ventures.  In a variety of areas including education and social activities commendable daily co-operation is taking place with exchanges of visits by schools and so forth which was not the case a couple of years ago.</P>
    <P>We welcome the heightened level of interparliamentary co-operation between the Oireachtas and the House of Commons but sadly Unionists are still absent from that forum.  We see greater US interest in Northern Ireland.  I was in Washington last week and heard President Clinton speak at the Ireland Fund dinner.  I can attest to the high level of participation by prominent US public figures at that event, and to their commitment to finding some solution in <Col N="933" /> Northern Ireland.  Gone is the former certainty of Irish American politicians that they had a simple solution.  There is now a new sophistication and a new desire to help.</P>
    <P>Our diplomats in the US deserve praise for their hard work over many years to ensure that the Irish issue was kept on the US agenda and that US politicians are informed and up to date about what is happening here.  They have helped maintain US commitment to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Although these developments are positive and good, they amount to little in the face of the enormous problems associated with any possible Northern solution.  The problems, as I see them, are threefold, namely, the failure of the constitutional parties to find common ground within Northern Ireland itself; the failure so far as the two sovereign Governments to find an agreed framework for progress and thirdly, our failure to persuade or to force the paramilitaries to abandon their activities.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that any formula or set theory can solve the Northern problem. I sometimes envy the certainty of those who believe that if only their formula or ideas were accepted the problem could be resolved.  There is specific action we could take to help resolve some of the issues I have raised.  On the question of helping the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland to start talking to each other, all elected politicians in the Republic have a duty to involve themselves more with poltical counterparts in Northern Ireland.  How many politicians here regularly travel to the North to meet with politicians of all political parties there?  How many of us keep in touch on a regular basis?  How many invite Northern politicians here to put their point of view, to explain the situation as they see it and to face questions from a Southern audience?  Few from any party do so at present.  We are justifiably angry when we hear people talking about Northern Ireland when we know they have never visited that part of this country and have not taken the trouble to familiarise themselves with what is happening.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> There is a great deal we can do to create better personal relations with our opposite numbers in Northern Ireland by listening and talking to them and by taking them seriously.  By taking the Unionists seriously we can do a great deal to improve relations.  There is a tendency on our part to stereotype the Unionists, to brush aside what they are saying and to see them as one homogenous unyielding group.  That is not the case.  When we look at the progress the Unionists have made over the past year or two, it is quite impressive.  We know the place Dublin has in Unionist demonology.  The very fact that they were prepared to come to Dublin was a huge step on their part and is one we have not sufficiently appreciated. The Unionists' proposals to the last conference contained interesting and constructive ideas on a bill of rights and a council for the two islands.  This acknowledgment of the legitimate southern dimension, of our right to be involved and act on behalf of Northern Nationalists is encouraging.  We should make an effort to take them seriously and encourage them where they are making progress rather than closing the door or see them as one group.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste quoted a very interesting and honest passage from Seán MacEntee. It reminds me of another figure from that time, Frank McDermott, who was perhaps more visionary than most on the nature of the problem in Northern Ireland.  Frank McDermott made the point in 1936 that since we are the people who want the Unionists to change there is an obligation on us to go further than them and at least listen and try to understand their real fears.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the second problem, the fact that the two Governments are not talking to each other at a sufficiently deep level, there is much we can do. I welcome what the Tánaiste said this morning.  I appreciate the new impetus which his presence has given the dialogue between the two Governments and I hope this can be speeded up.  Over the past number of years we have not been doing enough to ensure that talks take place at a sufficiently deep level.  We are <Col N="935" /> all afraid of giving a lead.  We all have our ghosts from the past.  There is a reluctance today to be brave about Northern Ireland in the way in which Garret FitzGerald and the Tánaiste were during their time of office when, for the first time, the question was addressed seriously.  All this nonsense about Articles 2 and 3 is little more than that, Articles 2 and 3 are central to nothing. They are peripheral and I hope we can leave them aside for the moment so they do not interfere with discussion on more serious matters.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years the Anglo-Irish Agreement has not been used as it should be.  The Tánaiste knows better than most that the Anglo-Irish Agreement was not cast in bronze.  It was intended to be a growing, developing mechanism.  It was a deed of foresight which was capable of being adopted as circumstances changed, but only if it was worked.  We should remember that the Anglo-Irish Agreement allows us to put forward ideas on a wide range of issues in the political life of Northern Ireland. These include the political structures, human rights, policing, social and economic issues, the courts and prisons, even nominations to public bodies in Northern Ireland.  At least, we have the right to put forward proposals and ideas but we have not being doing that.  I hope the arrival of the Tánaiste in Iveagh House has ensured that the Anglo-Irish Agreement will be worked to its full potential.</P>
    <P>Through our contacts, through the British-Irish interparliamentary body and on social occasions we must also keep pressure on British politicians.  We must ensure that our counterparts in the House of Commons and in the House of Lords are kept fully informed and are not allowed to become so absorbed in their own problems that they push the Irish problem to the end of their agenda.  That pressure is necessary.  The positive attitude taken by senior politicians in the US can also be helpful in applying pressure on the British Government.</P>
    <P>The third problem is the most difficult of all, that is, how to get through to the <Col N="936" /> paramilitaries.  Unfortunately, there is no answer to that.  There are things we can do which may help.  For a start, on the question of security &mdash; and the Tánaiste devoted quite a bit of his speech this morning to that &mdash; there can be no fudging on our part.  There can be no question of ambivalence, of giving into the &ldquo;sneeking regarders&rdquo; in our society, of the nod and the wink to various paramilitary groups in this part of the country.  We have to be seen to be utterly serious, straightforward and transparent in the operation of security policy.  We must not give the slightest excuse to the Unionists to misrepresent us or to feel, with some genuineness, that we are not doing all that is possible.</P>
    <P>That is only one area.  The problem we all face is, how do we talk to these people who, after all, are Irish people.  Some of us might even know some of these people, without knowing that they are in the Provisional IRA.  There is little hope of us talking to the Protestant paramilitaries. This week Séamus Mallon said we should start talking.  Maybe the time has come for talks with Sinn Féin.  I see huge problems there.  Who speaks for Sinn Féin, who really calls the shots?  Can they be believed, can they deliver?  As long as they are ambiguous about atrocities like Warrington, can we really talk to them?  Is talking an excuse on their part at a time of great unpopularity to take some of the heat off themselves? These are all questions we must face. Nonetheless, if talking to Sinn Féin was to begin a process whereby people would be weaned away from violence and the work of the paramilitaries, then it would be worthwhile.  How is it to be done, I do not know.</P>
    <P>Senator Wilson is proposing to talk to the IRA and I wish him well.  The Senator has shown us an example of forgiveness and generosity in agreeing to talk to people who have done great harm to him and I hope he is successful.  In all our attempts to get to the Provisional IRA and the paramilitaries, perhaps there is a place for diplomacy.  In the past, we have seen feelers put out quietly behind the scenes that came to light only when the <Col N="937" /> real talking started afterwards.  I hope something is going on behind the scenes; I hope attempts are being made to do something to help because ultimately we will have to talk to many of these people. If we can begin to wean them away from violence, then it will be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>As I survey it, the scene is bleak and unhopeful.  Senator Wilson said on the radio this morning that we must have hope and we must continue to have hope. We must believe it is possible to bring this conflict to an end and ensure that everybody on this island can live together in peace and harmony.  I wish to refer to one of the central points in the Tánaiste's speech this morning.  He said: &ldquo;In a problem as complex as this, a solution is not simply waiting to be found.  It must be constructed painstakingly, in a difficult process of give and take.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As politicians, we have a small part to play and I have outlined some of the ways in which we can do it.  In particular, there should be better co-operation with out colleagues across the Border, we should listen to them and take their fears seriously.  We can help by example, by encouraging and putting pressure on our Government and by working with our colleagues in Britain and our friends in the US.  We must not give up hope.  I wish the Tánaiste well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste to the House.  He is here to take part in this important debate at a crucial time in the history of this island.  This debate is taking place against a background of escalating violence in the North of Ireland and in England.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of me and Members of this Chamber if we did not condemn the latest atrocities committed by the IRA and the Protestant paramilitaries in the North.  The atrocities committed by the IRA on an innocent population in Great Britain must be deplored.  The death of a four year old boy and the mutilation of a 12 year old boy in Warrington has highlighted the callousness of the IRA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the supporters of the IRA now realise that they are supporters of a callous <Col N="938" /> and unthinking gang, without conscience and consideration for their fellow human beings.  I hope a message will go out from this House today to the fellow travellers of the IRA that they are backing a gang without political or public support. The IRA do not care about the laws of God or man.  When we hear expressions of support for the IRA we must intervene and point out the callous nature of these murderers.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the people of Warrington in their sorrow.  I hope this atrocity might become a catalyst for the coming together of the people of these islands in an attempt to rid the gun from the political agenda of any group. Although appeals have been made by this House to the IRA I, once again, appeal to the members of the IRA to rethink their misguided campaign and the tactics they use to attain their political end, whatever that may be.</P>
    <P>Young people do not support the campaign of terror which the IRA and other paramilitary organisations in the North are engaged in.  Nothing positive can be achieved by this campaign.  However, a number of negative results can be seen. We have seen an escalation in the number of murders of innocent people by Protestant murder gangs in Northern Ireland; we have seen the suffering of the families of innocent victims of sectarian violence; Irish people in Britain are experiencing a backlash and are perceived as supporters of the IRA, which they are not.</P>
    <P>The IRA have no mandate from the people to carry out their murderous campaign nor do Protestant murder gangs have any mandate from their co-religionists or anybody else.  The murder by the UVF of a Sinn Féin member in Belfast yesterday must be condemned as vociferously as the murder of any member of the community in the North of Ireland.  I was saddened to hear the Tánaiste this morning mention that three more people had been killed in the North.  Violence begets violence and it will continue until the people of violence realise that it will not solve the problems faced by the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear that a <Col N="939" /> number of well known and respected politicians in the North will not stand in the forthcoming local elections.  These people have worked hard on behalf of both sections of the community in the North.  I appeal to these members of the body politic to reconsider because they are needed by the embattled people of the North.</P>
    <P>We must examine the common ground shared by people North and South.  Most people want the opportunity to live productive lives in an atmosphere of trust and one which recognises differences whether they are religious or ethnic.  We should be proud of the contribution made by both elements in society to life here and abroad.  Our primary concern must be the establishment of peace in Ireland. We cannot realise the enormous and creative potential of our people until peace becomes a reality in every area of our country.  Violence, bitterness and hatred are endemic in Irish society and these elements frustrate the aims they claim to promote.</P>
    <P>The recent round of talks between the Irish and British Governments and the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland have been constructive and represent an important breakthrough.  Unionists have entered into intensive dialogue with the Irish Government and this will help establish respect and understanding between both parties.  The reluctance of the Unionists to take part in future talks may be related to the forthcoming local elections.  Politicians in every country get scared before elections.  This can be seen in the United States in relation to their foreign policy.  When a presidential, congressional or senatorial election is imminent, certain issues are put on the back-burner because politicians will not do anything which might hinder their chances of election.</P>
    <P>I hope the Unionist politicians will resume talks because the people they represent depend on them to achieve a political change.  If political stability is achieved economic benefits will follow.</P>
    <P>The beautiful and spectacular scenery in Northern Ireland could attract millions <Col N="940" /> of pounds of revenue into the area through tourism and this in turn would help accelerate the development of job creation on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>We must take every opportunity to have funds allocated on an inter-regional basis to relieve the chronic unemployment created by the physical barriers of the Border.  We must, through dialogue, negotiation, and a balanced agreement between legitimate identities and the constitutional positions of both major traditions in Ireland, work our way out of the cycle of tragedy and economic deprivation.  We must work hard to overcome the cycle of sectarian strife which has become the principal deterrent to economic and political movement on the island.</P>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government states categorically that it is to recommence and sustain the process of dialogue with the parties in Northern Ireland and with the British Government building on progress already made.  Dialogue will be conducted in a spirit of openness and honesty with the overriding aim of achieving peace and reconciling the legitimate rights and aspirations of both communities.  Furthermore, there will be a willingness to discuss constitutional issues and to initiate and incorporate change in the context of an overall settlement.  Our long-term policy is to make possible the eventual achievement of a united Ireland by agreement and consent in the spirit of the New Ireland Forum report.  We will continue to operate the Anglo-Irish Agreement unless it is transcended by a broader agreement and the wish to step up the pace of North-South economic co-operation.  The Government seeks consensus in achieving an ultimate solution.</P>
    <P>The constitutional claim to the Six Counties contained in Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution is often referred to by politicians in the North, and by some in the South, as a deterrent to ultimate unity.  I do not agree with this.  The removal of these Articles from the Constitution would not accelerate the reunification process or initiate progress towards a mutually satisfactory resolution <Col N="941" /> of the aspirations of people who live on this island, be they Nationalists or Unionists.</P>
    <P>The final outcome of negotiations on the future of the island must be reached by consensus and then endorsed by a referendum on an agreed package which would achieve a balanced accommodation of the differing positions of the two main traditions on constitutional issues.  It would create structures which would bridge divisions and promote reconciliation between the Unionist and Nationalist traditions and ensure enhanced co-operation between both parts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The scope for economic co-operation is immense.  The CII points out that manufacturers in the South sell only one-third as much <i>per capita</i> in Northern Ireland as they do in their home territory and that manufacturers in Northern Ireland sell only one-sixth as much <i>per capita</i> in the South as they do in the North.  To promote economic development we must identify and agree measures that must be taken to address the problems and then implement those agreed measures.</P>
    <P>Tourism is one area where great benefits could accrue from cross-Border co-operation. Tourist revenue in the South in 1990 came to £1,207.6 million and in the North the revenue was only £226 million: in the South it is estimated that in 1990, 82,000 people were employed in tourism while in the North the CII states that only 5,000 jobs were supported by out-of-state tourism.  The position of tourism jobs could be dramatically changed if full co-operation and peace were achieved.</P>
    <P>Let us leave this House with a renewed vow to work harder with people on both sides of the Border to ensure progress towards peace and reconciliation.  Political commentators have repeatedly stated that politicians in the South are not interested in the status of Northern Ireland and only use the North as a political football during election campaigns. It is true that for southern politicians Northern Ireland affairs do not take up much time, on a day to day basis, but <Col N="942" /> that does not mean there is a lack of interest.  The constitution of my party is clear about our stance regarding the North and I do not know of any member of the party who wants to see that constitution changed.</P>
    <P>We want to see a reconciliation of the people of the North with the people of the South; as Ireland is an island we are physically united.  We must reconcile all sides of the political spectrum into whatever political entities that are needed to create a peaceful and harmonious country in which to live.  There should be more contact between the ordinary members of political parties in the South with their counterparts in the North, not only on a social or political basis but also on a practical daily basis.  At local level, contact between members of local and regional councils could be of immense benefit to both parts of the country as it is obvious that council members.  North and South, face the same problems.  The contacts could result in a better environment and quality of life for the people represented by the council members.</P>
    <P>Social contacts between North and South are equally helpful in promoting our aim to provide a peaceful environment in which our children can grow in harmony with their neighbours and their physical environment.  We have seen how sporting contact can help in this context and such contacts should be encouraged by all sporting bodies.  Interaction at school level is of tremendous importance and can only enhance the quality of life for young people.</P>
    <P>I was heartened recently, when listening to &ldquo;The Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; to hear the views of the boys and girls of two Catholic schools in Dungannon.  The programme portrayed a vivid picture of life in the North from a young Catholic's perspective and from the perspective of pupils at schools which gave them the means to attain economic freedom and advancement.  The problems confronted daily by schoolchildren were vividly expressed: the harassment of being stopped and searched on a regular basis and the trauma encountered by children who confronted death in their own families as <Col N="943" /> a result of the troubles.  Indeed, one girl spoke of her father who was killed in the South on his way home from a race meeting.  The trauma suffered by that child was equal to the trauma of the children who have encountered death because of sectarian troubles in the North.</P>
    <P>There was a realisation that most of their social encounters were of a sectarian nature and that, although job opportunities might arise in the future, education gave them the exit visa to a life outside the strife of the North.  The programme, however, did not leave a memory of children filled with despair. We heard young people describing life as it is and it was heartening to hear that many of them planned to enter third level education and to stay in Northern Ireland afterwards.  The joy and the music, both traditional and classical, came across as an expression of light in the North.  The memory of that programme will stay with me for some time and will be a beacon of hope for me when I get depressed over the future of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I was also impressed this week by the interview on &ldquo;The Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; with Dr. Feeney of the SDLP.  He gave a pragmatic view of life in the North from a political and a personal perspective.  I hope he will change his mind and stays in democratic politics.  The northern community needs politicians of the style and pragmatism of Dr. Feeney.</P>
    <P>On that programme Councillor Rogers, from the north of England, suggested that an integrated schools' system would solve the problems of the North. Contact between schools is important but I believe such an integrated schools' system is only practical in middle class, low problem areas.  None of the children from Dungannon suggested that an integrated schools' system would be of benefit to them either socially or educationally as they grew up in a community torn by strife.</P>
    <P>No political party or group in the North has a magic formula to break the long standing moulds of northern society.  The challenges facing both communities, <Col N="944" /> North and South, are daunting as we face a decade during which there will be many challenges in every area of life.  The economic challenges cannot be met in isolation and this is recognised throughout Europe and in the world economy.  The construction of Europe goes ahead but the construction job needed on this island is of massive proportions.</P>
    <P>How much easier it would be if we combined our marvellous energies into areas of mutual benefit instead of areas of contention?  Imagine the energies of east and west Belfast combining to create a Belfast of industry, education and co-operation. Imagine the benefit to the island if Border roads were re-opened and the many members of defence forces on both sides of the Border were released for duties of a civilian nature for which they are badly needed.</P>
    <P>Our peripheral situation in Europe requires a concentration of our energies to build a healthy and viable community. We must live together in a society which recognises differences and, through dialogue, uses the differences as strengths. The New Ireland Forum report states that existing structures and practice in Northern Ireland have failed to provide peace, stability or reconciliation.  As the conflict of Nationalist and Unionist identities has been concentrated within the narrow ground of Northern Ireland, this has prevented constructive interaction between the two traditions and has fostered fear, suspicion and misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>Let the cycle of violence cease, let the people be free and let us go out of this Chamber and endeavour to further the cause of peace.  Political and economic progress will follow in the path of peace.</P>

      <P>I express my gratitude to my colleagues on the Independent benches who have allowed me the privilege of speaking first this morning.  I must <Col N="945" /> catch a plane at lunchtime and, for that reason, I will not, unfortunately, have the privilege of hearing Senator Wilson's contribution.  However, I look forward to reading it in the Official Report and in the newspapers.</P>
      <P>First, it is a humbling experience for us to speak in the presence of somebody who has suffered so deeply and for whom the sad events of the last few days must be a source of renewed pain and difficult memories.  I salute Senator Wilson for the imaginative gesture he has made in seeking contact with the IRA.  I said on television, and I stand over my view, that this is, perhaps, a naïve thing to do and I do not mean that in a critical sense.  We must try to understand the thinking of these people.</P>
      <P>I do not believe Mr. Major's response is appropriate.  He is reported in the newspapers as saying that his Government will hound the IRA, pursue them and wipe them out.  It is not possible to do that.  This issue cannot be approached in that blunt militaristic way but somebody who has suffered may force these people to confront imaginatively the reality of what they are doing.  I believe members of the IRA are not monsters; they are human beings.  They are sons, brothers, sisters, wives, husbands, fathers; they have human connections, but they have closed off their imagination so that they do not fully comprehend the impact of what they are doing to other human beings.</P>
      <P>On a beautiful morning like this, one must be struck by how marvellous it is to be alive in this country.  It is a privilege. The most arrogant thing one human being can do to another is to take upon themselves the right to remove that precious gift of life.  I read in yesterday's paper the words, the simple, naïve words, of Jonathan Ball's father.  If any of these people in the IRA are fathers, sons or brothers, they must listen to this and try to understand the pain they have callously, deliberately and cynically inflicted.  Jonathan Ball was a beautiful angel, a lovely innocent child just beginning to enjoy life and that life was taken away from him at the age of three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="946" /> I do not believe the excuses of the IRA.  I do not believe they gave adequate warnings.  I do not believe they did not wish to cause civilian injuries.  They wished to cause maximum civilian injuries and maximum revulsion.  That is what terrorism is all about.  If the bombs had gone off ineffectively and had not injured people, or had not created a sensation or had not been splashed all over the newspapers they would not have been a success in the IRA's terms.  The bombs were a calculated attack upon the civilian population; there is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>There was a good article in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Jim Cusack in which he analysed 21 years of bombings.  He showed in the very beginning, in the Donegall Street bombings, the IRA gave a series of deliberately confusing warnings to the police.  In a most barbarous fashion they drove people from the path of one explosion into the next so that maximum carnage would be inflicted. This was deliberately and cynically planned and, in my opinion, so was the incident in Enniskillen.  There was a parallel bomb at another cenotaph which used a timer.  Nobody believes the radio messages of the RUC and British Army triggered that.</P>
    <P>Cynical, manipulative people are employing violence and terror as an instrument of policy.  Perhaps if they were brought face to face with the human cost and instead of hurling abuse at them and calling them names, we present ourselves in our full human vulnerability, that vulnerability might get through to them and open their imagination.  For this reason I applaud what Senator Wilson has set about today.  I recall his words at that awful moment in Enniskillen when he said &ldquo;dirty talk will do no good&rdquo;.  I believe he is right.  If you use epithets of condemnation, scorn and revulsion against the IRA and call them monsters, they will erect a barricade of psychological defence against that.  However if you present yourself as vulnerable, ask them questions and try to force them to stop by moral persuasion, perhaps there is a possibility of getting through to them.</P>
    <P>I would like to issue a challenge, and <Col N="947" /> I hope the Minister will bring this to Government.  I am suggesting a naïve, unsophisticated gesture for these two Houses of the Oireachtas to contemplate. There is a channel of communication to the IRA, that is Provisional Sinn Féin.  I know that because ten or 15 years ago I was supposed to have been sentenced to death by these people and I went around to interview them in the office.  The vast majority of people there had been convicted of some IRA offence; I could list them but that would be unfair to them and if I did name them on the record, it might make them targets for some other form of abuse.</P>
    <P>Senator Wilson approached the IRA and apparently has received a positive response through the channel of Sinn Féin.  I opposed Sinn Féin holding their annual conference in the Mansion House because it is always closed by a man from the military command appearing in a mask and giving a report from the army council; so there is a clear relationship.  I am not saying it is a one to one connection, but there is a connection.  I suggest that both Houses, the elected Members representing all the people of the Irish Republic, should go for five minutes and stand outside the main office of Sinn Féin and demand, in the name of the Irish people with the full authority vested in them by the process of democratic election, that they stop this campaign of bloodshed.  This will not have any sentimental impact on the people manipulating in the background but it might send a message to their supporters in North America, Northern Ireland or wherever and to the ordinary people on the street and in the ranks of these republican movements, that their acts are not an expression of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I also suggested in the past that we might consider some machinery by which people convicted of these particular horrible crimes have the privilege of citizenship removed from them.  That may be legally possible.  I do not want to share my Irishness with people who behave in this manner, who murder three year old children, who leave a 12 year old boy <Col N="948" /> scarred and today hanging on to life by a thread.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to what the Tánaiste, Senator Manning and Senator Lanigan had to say and there was much that was thoughtful and helpful in it.  The Government side frequently talk about reconciliation but it is always reconciliation on their terms, and that is inflexible.  Again imagination must be used.  We in the South must imagine what it is like to be a Unionist.  Whether we care for them, we must try to imagine what their reality is and, of course, we must address Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. There is no point fudging that issue.  I realise it would be unrealistic to say we are going to abolish them.  I do not believe it could be done and it is not politically practical, but it is a practical proposition to alter them.</P>
    <P>Two years ago I suggested a wording which could be used, and again I issue a challenge to the Government to respond to this.  After Articles 2 and 3 is should add a formulation like the following &mdash; in any attempt to realise this aspiration the use of violence shall be prohibited. Does anybody not agree with that?  Does anybody see it as more than an aspiration? Does anybody in this House believe that violence is justified in achieving a Thirty-two County Republic?  If not, what is the difficulty with amending our Constitution in a way that has been clearly illustrated as necessary by a succession of court cases?  It has been determined that far from being an aspiration, Articles 2 and 3 are a constitutional imperative.  That case also determined the use of violence would not be prohibited constitutionally in the case of the Six Counties, it would be a legitimate instrument of policy.  My second challenge is that the Government looks at Articles 2 and 3 and consider some change along the lines I suggest.  The vast majority of Irish people would find themselves able to agree to that if the Government campaigned in a unified way.  I would be interested in a response.</P>
    <P>I share the admiration Senator Lanigan expressed for many members of the SDLP, but they, too, can be inflexible. <Col N="949" /> They are not wholehearted in their support of the RUC.  I call on them to make that support clear, because the IRA have driven Roman Catholics out of that force and then claim it is sectarian.  They murdered the Roman Catholics who joined it and then say it is a sectarian force because there are no Catholics in it.  Any Catholic who puts his head above the parapet in the RUC is going to have it blown off.  I challenge the SDLP on that. I also noticed they were reluctant to participate in the moves to give the Freedom of the City of Belfast to the British Army bomb disposal squad.  They behaved in an ambiguous way on this matter.  This is something we must take seriously, the number of casualties is so large.  It is also ironic that the majority of people destroyed by Republican violence are Catholics from a Nationalist background. This has bred tragedy for the Nationalist community.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the AIDS problem in New York, Larry Kramer startled people by writing in the <i>Village Voice</i> a headline which said &ldquo;1,100 and counting&rdquo;. It went up, week after week, month after month.  There have been 2,300 killed in the North of Ireland and still counting.  How many thousand maimed on all sides?</P>
    <P>I speak as an Anglican.  Many people presume Anglicanism to be a form of Protestantism, although I maintain that it is not.  It is a reformed Catholic church. The actions of the Protestant Action Force or the Shankill butchers shame me. I condemn the murder of members of provisional Sinn Féin.  I cannot abide the policies of provisional Sinn Féin but that is not a reason to murder people.  Some time ago a man was murdered in front of his children simply because his brother was a Sinn Féin councillor.  That, in my opinion, is not defensible.</P>
    <P>I would like to come back to the question of the psychology of the IRA.  By and large, these people are ordinary people. They are not monsters, but have become capable of monstrous acts by some process which we must attempt to understand. A friend of mine is very wise in these matters and has had contact with <Col N="950" /> these people over many years.  He told me that he also asked these questions of people involved in the IRA and what he told me was sinister but interesting. When he asked how one gets ordinary young men to perpetrate atrocities, the reply he got was, &ldquo;you got to blood them first.  Once they are blooded they do anything&rdquo;. It is like fox hunting.  In other words, their part in an atrocity is arranged, forcing them to deaden their conscience and imagination.  This arrangement is made cynically by people in the background using these young people as foot soldiers, and after the first experience one can get them to do more or less anything.</P>
    <P>I would say directly to the young men and women involved in this so-called Irish Republican Army, that in later years they will reap the whirlwind.  When all the excitement of violence is over, when they are middle-aged or elderly, their imagination will surreptitiously recommence to work and they will have to face the horrible reality of what they have done.  I appeal to them, for that reason also, to cease what they are doing in the name of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>As a Dubliner I am fed up with reading reports which feature statements issued by the IRA from Dublin giving people the impression that the headquarters of the IRA is located in some skyscraper block in the centre of the city and that everybody in Dublin is perfectly happy with it.  I would like the message to go out that we are not happy with that and a special public relations exercise should be mounted by the Government to counter this impression.  Every time the IRA issues a statement it should be pointed out that they are ringing from a mobile phone somewhere because they are gutless. On that, perhaps not very reconciliatory note, I would like to hand over to Senator Lee.  I commend the House for taking this most important debate today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, I want to associate myself with expressions of horror about recent and ongoing atrocities, and with the tribute of Senator <Col N="951" /> Norris to Senator Wilson and the good wishes for his meeting with the IRA.  I also see Deputy Currie here as an observer.  Their presence reminds me how little one really knows about Northern Ireland and with what little authority one presumes to pronounce on matters concerning it.  I have found the discussion so far simultaneously encouraging and discouraging.  It is encouraging to note the fund of goodwill here and discouraging to realise that, if we are honest, none of us has any solution whatever. We have reached a stage of admitting or accepting the complexity of the situation and beyond that we simply do not know how to improve matters significantly.  I share the bleakness of Senator Manning's diagnosis and prognosis, and I do not expect that anything one can do in the short term will make a significant difference. However, it seems to me that we must try to focus on the essentials which tend to be obscured behind rhetoric of goodwill.</P>
      <P>I welcome everything that has been said about the possibilities and the potential of economic co-operation but I do not believe that will make much essential difference to the continuing conflict in Northern Ireland.  If there is one issue in the Tánaiste's contribution with which I disagree fundamentally it is where he talks about material matters as ultimately the crucial features or the essence of politics. He said that surely politics is about improving the material welfare of everyone North and South.  If we were talking about normal politics it would be, but we are not.  A vaster and more significant improvement in economic affairs and co-operation than has been possible up to now is not going to alter the essence of the Northern situation.  The mentality behind Enniskillen and Warrington does not give a tinker's curse about the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal link-up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No material improvement is going to crack the kernel of the problem which is one of conflicting and mutually exclusive identities.  Identity issues can never be solved in Ireland or anywhere else by material improvement, however desirable <Col N="952" /> that may be or however logical it may appear to national, and largely middle-class, thinking people.  Therefore, we have to address more fundamental issues than the ones we are confronting now.</P>
    <P>We are all in favour of reconciling legitimate rights, but what are legitimate rights?  That is the nub of the problem. The rhetoric of the reconciliation of legitimate rights brings us closer to doing so. The more we meet with northerners of various traditions, and the more they meet us, the better for the future but meetings do not somehow dissolve inherited issues of identity.  They may enable us to discuss these issues but I greatly doubt if they will enable us to resolve them.</P>
    <P>When the Tánaiste quotes Seán MacEntee, speaking in 1970, an old war horse in dealing with Irish politics and the issue of Partition, it is a revealing, dispiriting and honest admission, but an admission of what?  It is not an admission of a solution for the immediate problems of Northern Ireland in 1993, it is an admission of failure to resolve partition. Is that our prime purpose at this particular moment?  Senator Lanigan reissued the Fianna Fáil commitment to the unification of Ireland as a long-term objective.  What is our hierarchy of objectives at this moment, and what is the relationship between the short, medium and long-term objectives?  Do we have a hierarchy of objectives or are we simply staggering from the emotional effects of atrocity after atrocity?</P>
    <P>All the parties involved in Northern Ireland, whether constitutional or paramilitary, are behaving reasonably rationally within their understanding of the circumstances.  There is no reason to denounce as mindless even the most repulsive behaviour of paramilitary groups.  If we are going to change the situation in Northern Ireland we can only do so by changing circumstances; we will not do so by appeals, condemnations or demonstrations however worthy.  We will change circumstances only if we address the core of Northern Ireland, that is, mutually exclusive identities, between Unionists and Nationalists not only in <Col N="953" /> Ireland but also within Northern Ireland. We cannot evade the implications of partition however much we might now wish to banish it from our minds.</P>
    <P>Articles 2 and 3 have been mentioned. I agree with Senator Manning that they are not central to the main issue involved. They are, however, central conceptually to the Northern Ireland or Irish problem because they accept a territorial concept as the essence of Irish identity.  The Irish nation is not described in the Irish Constitution. All that is described there is the national territory and that may be because even when as consummate a Thomist as Mr. de Valera tried to describe one single Irish nation, he found the resources of the English language were insufficient.</P>
    <P>If we are thinking in exclusive territorial terms, there will never be a solution to the Northern Ireland problem because territory is a zero sum game. It is an all or nothing claim and as long as we, London or Belfast think in territorial terms there will be no long-term solution. There may be stages of modification or modulation of the conflict, but there will be no ultimate solution.</P>
    <P>Unless we can think of solutions to redress the territorial problem we will never get anywhere.  Within Northern Ireland the problem is Nationalist experience of domination and Unionist fear of domination.  That fear transcends the Border.  The Unionists fear domination by what they perceive the South to be. We have expressed Articles 2 and 3 in territorial terms partly because, historically, all forms of Nationalism thought in territorial terms.  We are perfectly normal in that respect.  We also express Articles 2 and 3 in territorial terms because various pieces of British legislation express their claims, not just aspirations but actual implemented claims, on Northern Ireland, in territorial terms where the phrase &ldquo;Northern Ireland and every part thereof&rdquo; recurs.</P>
    <P>As long as London and Dublin think exclusively in those terms then, however much they may co-operate on a day to day basis, there can be no solution to the <Col N="954" /> ultimate problem of identity.  The only direction in which I can see any possible solution &mdash; it is a very long term one and there may be any number of serious objections to it &mdash; is in some form of joint authority beginning initially in some predominantly Nationalist areas to try to provide evidence that it is possible for both jurisdictions to co-operate in a manner which is acceptable to the local communities.  That may be very long term, it may be unrealistic, it may even be Utopian, but at least it is some attempt to find a solution.</P>
    <P>Despite all the good intentions that have been expressed in this House, at public meetings and in the media, we have not seen any specific recommendations that have a possibility of resolving the problem, even in the long term.  Everything that is proposed is short term and condemnatory and leaves the problem as it is.  Good intentions will have no impact on the paramilitaries on either side, and I share Senator Manning's fears about the potential for paramilitary activity on the Unionist side. That is not the main reason we should be concerned with trying to find a resolution in a modified form of the joint authority proposal in the Forum report.  If there is not some evidence of a physical presence of both Governments in those areas of Northern Ireland that are prepared to accept it in the first instance, then we will get nowhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been encouraged by the welcome I have received from you, Sir, the Minister, the Members of this House, and those outside, and by the goodwill shown to me as evidenced by a message I have just received from Deputy Currie, a fellow northerner, for what I am trying to say today and to do in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak today from my heart.  I speak knowing that God is good, and that God is love. I speak not in my strength but in His.  I speak for myself and I speak as Marie Wilson's dad, but I know that I have the great honour of being an Independent Member of this Seanad.  I hope you, Sir, <Col N="955" /> and the Members of this House will excuse me if I read my statement.  I know it is not allowed, but I hope that, on this occasion, you will allow me to read it because I know many people will hear what I say and I want it to be right.</P>
    <P>I hope I do not look as nervous as I feel.  I hope I can control my emotions because Northern Ireland and all of Ireland and its people are close to my heart and we are bleeding to death.  It breaks my heart to think that overnight three more people are dead in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senators will know that in recent days I have tried to establish contact with the IRA so that I may speak to them.  I am happy to say that they have acceded to my request and I look forward to talking to them, but I am bound to tell you that I have not changed a word of my statement of this morning as a result of that acceptance of my request.  Many people may accuse me &mdash; it has happened in this House this morning &mdash; of naïveté, yet I believe they are wrong.  The IRA is composed of human beings like ourselves and they have suffered too, just as we have at their expense.</P>
    <P>We all have the capacity for good as well as for evil but, more importantly, we have the capacity to change.  While knowledge, logic and clear thinking are important in the resolution of conflict, so too are feeling, contact and person to person communication, for if Ireland needs something in particular at this time it needs most to sow seeds for a change of heart among those who have taken it upon themselves in the most brutal and crude manner to shoulder the burdens inherited because of the legacy of our long and bitter history and chose to fight for change rather than negotiate it.</P>
    <P>Where communication stops, frustration, anger and ultimately violence develop.  There was poor enough communication in Ireland for far too long. People felt disenfranchised, dispirited, even at times despised and we have paid the penalty for such historical legacy very dearly indeed.  Apart altogether from our historical legacy there are in today's <Col N="956" /> Ireland increasing numbers of people who feel, through unemployment or from other forms of powerlessness, that they are marginalised and alienated without a significant say in their own country.  None of us sitting here, privileged to be elected or nominated to this House, should ever be complacent about the enormous challenges both historical and contemporary which face Ireland and Irish society both North and South today.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it is my contention that violence by either attitude or action is not a solution for it is self perpetuating: the justification of more violence in reaction to it.  To be aware of each other's difficulties we must communicate more. To have any hope of resolving each other's difficulties, let alone the differences which divide us over our perceptions about such difficulties, demands that we communicate.  There are many severed hearts in Northern Ireland today; there are many broken hearts.  There are many wounded people and fragmented homes.  There is still a huge gulf keeping us apart but of this I am more certain than ever: that gulf of unreality will never and can never be bridged by political logic and political action alone.  Without a healing of wounds and a change of heart, this gulf will not be bridged, there will not be a fresh start, a reawakening of what is good in Ireland, a rebirth of hope that must travel some day like a torch held aloft to all four corners of our strife-torn land.</P>
    <P>Sometimes, I believe, we may be in danger of overlooking that the cross &mdash; that great symbol of our common Christianity &mdash; has a horizontal as well as a vertical level.  We get down so easily on our knees to communicate with our Creator and to ask Him as sinners for forgiveness. Yet, how much more difficult it is, as frail and prejudiced human beings, to stand up and reach across to those from whom we have been separated by the bad blood of past and present violation; separation, with its origins long before our time, widened, deepened and refined by past and present false perceptions which, through history, have led by falsehood and violence to the <Col N="957" /> rotten state of affairs so poignantly highlighted by recent tragedy and atrocity on the other side of the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>The accumulated historical legacy has also brought with it all the confusion associated with individual and collective guilt and remorse on the one hand, and resentment and desire for revenge on the other hand.  Thus the unbroken cycle, will go on and on for time to come unless, in addition to the application of fundamental democratic principles, we also search for the means of bringing about the change of heart which this sad island needs so badly.  Somewhere, sometime, the cycle has to be broken, so that the reciprocation of violation and violated from one generation to the next is finally laid to rest.</P>
    <P>The falsehoods on which so much of our prejudiced attitudes and actions are based have grown through time, with an accumulation of the hurt we have done to each other by attitudes as well as by action.  The falsehood will not be broken by sitting idly by; the actions will not cease without a painful reappraisal of ourselves before we start to appeal to others, for it is only by sharing their pain we will finally be able to release ourselves from our own pain.  Only by raising the mirror of truth before falsehood will falsehood be seen for what it is and the historical cycle broken, when a change of heart has prepared us to reach across courageously and with love to communicate person-to-person, core-to-core, on the one hand, repenting for our role in the split which, in keeping us apart, has caused so much grief, anger and despair and, on the other, with a willingness to forgive those who have hurt us so deeply.</P>
    <P>A physician once told me that his profession was trained to cure disease and was ill-equipped to promote health, which he defined as a &ldquo;state of well-being&rdquo;. To my surprise, he went on to say that curing disease on its own would not ensure a state of well-being.  For this, he was adamant, healing was required. We need the healing of our deep historical wounds, the healing of a socially sectarian and politically divided society. <Col N="958" /> Such healing demands of us that we truly reach across to each other and this is what I must talk to the IRA about.  If there is to be hope, then we must find it at the centre of our hearts, to move as Christ would wish us to move, to touch the hearts of those who have hurt us most.</P>
    <P>It is, perhaps, appropriate to recall that on the first page of J.C. Beckett's book, <i>The Making of Modern Ireland, 1603-1923,</i> is written:</P>
    <P>It is a proverb of old date, that the pride of France, the treason of England, and the war of Ireland...is like always to continue without God set in men's breasts to find some new remedy that never was found before.</P>
    <P>Having indicated this afternoon why I wish to communicate with the IRA directly, I would like briefly to go further by inviting this House to join me in creating a climate conducive to truce, ceasefire, and indeed the abandonment of the armed struggle.  First, I ask the House to support me in my attempt to engage the IRA by indicating that it is prepared to support my intentions in this respect, even if Members would find it difficult for party political reasons to engage the IRA in dialogue themselves at this time.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I beg of the Seanad to set aside some time at the end of the summer session for an open-ended debate on the findings of Initiative 92 and the Opsahl Commission, once these have been published. Over 500 written submissions were made by the people of Northern Ireland to Initiative 92 concerning the social, political, constitutional and economic issues which beset us.  Subsequently, the Opsahl Commission convened at various places in Northern Ireland, including Enniskillen, to undertake oral hearings of people and groups selected as a result of reading their written submissions.  New insights are bound to emerge, new problems must be addressed and new proposals considered.  It would be churlish, indeed, if this privileged Upper House were not to respond constructively and generously to the courageous and thoughtful efforts of so <Col N="959" /> many people in Northern Ireland to look at their own society and make positive suggestions towards the remedying of so many of its problems.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I ask that the Seanad consider setting up an all-party Seanad committee and to explore with parties, groups and concerned citizens in the North their fears and their hopes, and that the committee concerned should listen rather than prescribe, and respond appropriately when the time comes.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say something to the IRA.  In a very short space of time we have observed Europe changing quite dramatically.  With this change significant questions are being posed about matters such as sovereignty and self-determination. Surely then, the social and political energies needed to transcend the past, to enable the Irish people &mdash; all of them &mdash; to participate effectively in the building of a new future that will meet the current challenge, will never be mobilised adequately until we find the means of ceasefire.  Even the most fervent supporters of the IRA must have begun to question a campaign which seems, from the outside, more and more to have become a campaign for continued political stagnation.  A ceasefire and abandonment of the armed struggle would release the pent-up radicalism which has no chance as long as the IRA continues to drive people into their respective sectarian camps.</P>
    <P>I say to the IRA that, whether they like it or not, the Protestant people of Northern Ireland associate the republicanism which they have on offer with a desire to have them driven, against their wishes, into the sort of Ireland claimed for them by the 1937 Constitution, or alternatively out of Ireland altogether. This may raise smiles, cynical or otherwise; yet, it is how I feel.</P>
    <P>In the eyes of all but a small percentage of Irish people, the so-called armed struggle has degenerated into a campaign of sickening sectarian killing of fellow Irishmen and women who have had no recourse either to trial or appeal before being summarily executed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> Whether we will see social justice in our time, let us at least stop the killing, give the new ideas born out of conflict a chance and give our young people the opportunity to articulate and introduce them without fear for their lives.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I ask the Seanad to join me in the Prayer of St. Francis of Assisi:</P>
    <P>Lord make me an instrument of your peace.</P>
    <P>Where there is hatred, let me sow love.</P>
    <P>Where there is injury, let me sow pardon.</P>
    <P>Where there is doubt, let me sow faith.</P>
    <P>Where there is despair, let me give hope.</P>
    <P>Where there is darkness, let me give light.</P>
    <P>Where there is sadness, let me give joy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on what has become the greatest tragedy in Europe, or in the world. People of goodwill on all sides of this community have made every effort to restore peace to our island.  One of the lines of the Prayer recited by Senator Wilson, &ldquo;where there is despair, let me give hope&rdquo;, should be the theme of all people of goodwill on this island.  After hope, peace must prevail.  For political reasons, or for reasons of power or fear, people have failed to show feelings of hope and goodwill which would help to restore peace to this country.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, it needs the spectacle of atrocities on our TV screens before the ordinary people in the South take notice of what has been happening in the North for the past 25 years.  This is a small island which has, much to offer in terms of its people.  Yet, it is being rent asunder by this terrible tragedy.  Over the past 25 years politicians, religious leaders and international leaders have offered support, but there has been no solution.  I listened carefully to Senator Wilson.  He was born in County Leitrim.  He has lived in Northern Ireland and he and his family have suffered the terrible tragedy of the loss of their daughter but, unfortunately, there are, and there will be, many people like Senator Wilson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress cannot be made until peace is restored to this island and this will happen only when the men of violence lay down their arms.  It is good that we <Col N="961" /> are calling for peace here today but it is the men of violence who planted the bomb in Warrington which killed one child and left another fighting for his life. Many more people could have been killed.  We are familiar with the story that a warning had been given and was not acted upon.  However, when a bomb is planted in a public area, death may follow.  Violent organisations use propaganda as a major weapon to spread their desire to enforce terrorism and fear on our island.  I hope that efforts made in the future to restore peace are successful.</P>
    <P>The communities in the North have suffered tragically over the past 20 years. How many times on our television screens have we seen funerals in Northern Ireland with three, four or five coffins?  The heartbreak, loss, fear and anger are the same for each family.  The words expressed by Senator Wilson today strike at the heart of every human being who longs for the day when peace will be restored.</P>
    <P>We have much to offer and this can be achieved if people and politicians forget the past.  We must begin by aiming for the goal of peace.  People must be prepared to give their all, including, perhaps, giving up what they were brought up to believe, that is, fear of one side taking over from the other, of one side becoming stronger than the other and imposing their beliefs on the other.</P>
    <P>We often hear about two sides in the struggle but there is a third side, the people of goodwill who want peace.  Progress will be made when that third side realise their own strength and show they are not afraid.  In the last few days in Dublin ordinary people have been prepared to stand together at meetings or sign petitions to express their abhorrence of violence and their desire to see peace restored to this island.</P>
    <P>I wish Senator Wilson well.  I also wish the Government and the Tánaiste well in their efforts to ensure that dialogue continues between opposing side's in the North, between North and South and between the British and Irish Governments.</P>

      <P>It is with feelings of hope, despite the enormous difficulties that were outlined in the House this morning, that I welcome the Tánaiste, through the Minister of State, to the House, on my own behalf and that of the Labour Party group in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I also thank Senator Manning for his persistence in requesting this debate.  His analysis of the bleakness of the present situation is certainly valid in the context of Warrington, given that more than 3,000 people have been killed in the conflict and that news was received today of three more deaths in the North.  The Northern problem is huge and has been well outlined by Senator Manning, Senator Lee and other Senators this morning.</P>
      <P>We must seek a way forward through mutual understanding.  I listened to all of the speakers this morning and I will be here again this afternoon.  To find a way forward we must listen to each other not only in this House but in all parts of the island.  We must listen especially to Senator Wilson whose personal experience of this painful conflict has caused him to speak out in a spirit of courageous reconciliation.  He spoke this morning of his direct personal approach to the IRA. By that approach he, more than all of us in this House, may bring about change in the North because he speaks from his own personal, traumatic experience.  It is only by listening to people such as the Senator and by facing the enormous disturbance in people's lives as a result of the Northern conflict that we can find a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all have a duty to speak out and to respond to the savage assault on the people and especially the children of Warrington.  We have a duty to denounce the murders that have been perpetrated as a result of someone's obscure and distorted interpretation of what constitutes <Col N="963" /> political action and as politicians we have a duty to act.  If we do and say nothing we acquiesce in the current situation where we have a divided community intimidated by violence.  Is that what we want?  If not, and I know it is not, we must work towards new solutions which acknowledge and take account of present fears.</P>
    <P>We must examine our own views on Northern Ireland.  Have we been willing to open our minds to understand where others are coming from, to understand their fears, our own fears and the fear of moving from the safety of long held positions?  If we refuse to budge we continue to risk people's lives.  This does not mean throwing away culture and identity but it does mean accepting that others have an equally valid if different culture and identity.  It means working to set up political structures that protect different traditions and facing the challenge of the territorial claims as outlined by Senator Lee this morning in the search for an ultimate solution.</P>
    <P>In the Tánaiste's speech on 5 March to the Irish Association he proposed that we could:</P>
    <P>agree together basic rules and special provisions to uphold the rights, protect the ethos and guarantee the effective participation in power of any community in Ireland which finds itself in a minority position.</P>
    <P>He spoke of a new covenant with</P>
    <P>fundamental principles to govern all future relationships and entrench these beyond the reach of all changes in regard to sovereignty.</P>
    <P>We are all inclined to despair of progress after atrocities like the Warrington bombings but the framework and safeguards which the Tánaiste outlined in that speech may be the way forward.  We have to accept that there are different viewpoints to be embraced.  More importantly, we have to go beyond the notion that one side must win and another lose.  Compromise is essential.  I agree with Senator Norris when he said <Col N="964" /> that a solution cannot be found on our terms only.</P>
    <P>The Programme of a Partnership Government pledges to put an agreed package of new structures to the people in a referendum.  This package must be worked out over time and forged through discussion among all sectors.  Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution are a major part of the context and must, in my view, be scrutinised.  The programme outlines the need for the final outcome of negotiations to be acceptable to the people, North and South.  The programme pledges that:</P>
    <P>We will seek any necessary endorsement in a referendum for an agreed package which achieves a balanced accommodation of the differing positions of the two main traditions on constitutional issues, and create structures which will bridge divisions and promote reconciliation between the Unionist and Nationalist traditions and ensure enhanced co-operation between both parts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>If we regard Northern Ireland as a political and geographical entity only we will not progress.  Senator Wilson outlined clearly for us this morning that Northern Ireland is its people.  The real people of Northern Ireland are, of course, much more complex than the simplistic view of two intransigent and implacably opposed groups.  Interreligious co-operation and friendship exists in many communities.  Senator Lanigan mentioned integrated schools this morning, a most important and progressive move, North and South.  There are intercommunity and cross-Border links with regard to EC programmes, tourism and rugby, all of which were mentioned this morning.  Although Senator Lee in his contribution said that these links do not contribute significantly to an ultimate solution, I believe they are part of the solution, although admittedly a small part.  We must continue to forge links, and especially physical links, whether by canal, road or railway.  We must continue above all to talk to each other.</P>
    <P>Identity is neither static nor simple. <Col N="965" /> My immediate family and recent ancestry are a mixture of Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter.  Many of our children's children are likely to have new strands to their identity, as European and world paths open up for people as well as for products.  We must set up new political structures together, with courage and mutual respect.</P>
    <P>Doubts were expressed here this morning, mainly by Senator Manning, about the possibility of making progress towards a northern solution.  These doubts are sincerely felt and are based on reality.  We must build on the progress that has been made to date.  We must acknowledge the courage of the Unionist leaders who came to Dublin.  We must acknowledge courage on all sides of the community where people have moved to new positions.  We must acknowledge the ongoing work of the Anglo-Irish Conference, which was outlined this morning by the Tánaiste.  Senator Manning and Dr. Brian Feeney who spoke on radio yesterday morning, were absolutely right to urge southern politicians to visit northern politicians of all sides and their supporters. This invitation was repeated by Senator Wilson this morning.  I wish to respond positively to his proposal that we have an all party visit to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The people of Northern Ireland have a right to bring up their children in peace. We, as public representatives, have a responsibility to work to achieve this. There has been some progress through dialogue but there have been many setbacks. The ordinary people of Northern Ireland, the Republic and Britain want solutions.  The meeting in Dublin last night, which was attended by about 1,000 people, was an indication of our desperate desire for a peaceful solution.  I believe we are at a stage of history and public opinion when people are ready to put all strands and options on the table to forge a political solution.  This debate must contribute positively towards a solution.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by quoting from a song written some years ago by Paul Brady called <i>The Island,</i> in which he says: &ldquo;Up <Col N="966" /> here we sacrifice our children to feed the worn out dreams of yesterday&rdquo;.  We must dream and work for tomorrow, for the future, not yesterday.  It will not be easy but it will be worth while and I do not believe any of us can stand apart from it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the debate on the critical question of Northern Ireland.  I thank Senator Wilson for his valuable contribution.  My geographical location gives me an insight into the North and the way in which it operates. I was born and raised on the Border and I live in Castleblayney, County Monaghan, which is an enclave surrounded by County Armagh, a few miles from the unfortunately well-known towns and villages of Crossmaglen, Cullaville, Cullyhanna, Keady, Armagh and Newry.</P>
      <P>My life is intrinsically linked with Northern Ireland.  I pass through checkpoints every time I go home, where young soldiers ask me where I am coming from and going to and when I reply they are none the wiser because naturally they do not know these areas.  It is just a job for them.  Then one hears of a soldier, aged 19 years, being killed, and I think of my brother of the same age and wonder at the horror that brings about so many deaths.  On a wall outside Cullaville, the artists of the IRA have painted the words &ldquo;we aim to be free&rdquo; under a picture of a Kalashnikov rifle.</P>
      <P>The killings in Warrington hit the headlines, but such killings and maimings happen every day and are barely mentioned in <i>The Belfast Telegraph</i> or other newspapers because they are commonplace. The IRA have said that one killing in England is worth ten in Northern Ireland because of the publicity it attracts.  That media attention is the oxygen which feeds the terrorists.  I believe it would be wiser to refrain from highlighting some killings over others. Each life is sacred and each killing is murder.</P>
      <P>The media should be careful not to focus on tragedies in a way which encourages others to retaliate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such publicity facilitates the recruitment of young men and women into the <Col N="967" /> hands of the terrorists.  These people are young.  They are often from socially and economically deprived backgrounds and the attraction for them is to become important by being known locally as &ldquo;a member&rdquo;.  It is a simple idea of status rather than any ideological theory which attracts young people to violence in the North.  They are blooded by active service and become immersed in that dreadful system.  It is a fact that when these young people serve prison sentences or simply grow up they often leave these terrorist organisations.  Therefore, if we are serious about finding a solution we must look at the young people of the North.</P>
    <P>The real problem of the North is the ingrained attitude of both sides of the community.  Do people in the South realise that Protestants in the North have very little contact with Catholics and <i>vice versa</i>?  Do they realise that Protestant and Catholic children who went on holiday through a project known as Co-operation North, until then, had never played with a child of another religion?  Do they realise that Belfast city is divided into 51 wards, 35 of which are completely segregated to the extent that over 90 per cent, and in some cases as many as 98 or 99 per cent, of the residents are Protestant or Catholic?</P>
    <P>We can talk about political and economic co-operation for ever but we will not see any improvement in the North until we integrate the people in a social way, until they go to the same shops, leisure centres, pubs and discos and the children go the the same schools.  That segregation facilitates the terrorists.</P>
    <P>Recently some people daubed a car in a Catholic housing estate, knowing that in the morning the owner would come out to clean it and it was then that they killed him.  They did not know him from Adam. All they knew was that he had to be a Catholic because he lived there, that was all they needed to know.</P>
    <P>That is why I am strongly in favour of an integrated school system.  That is where we must begin.  Only when children come together on the buses, chat <Col N="968" /> and play together, will the great barrier of fear and ignorance of the other side be broken down.  That is crucial.  It will ultimately make it more difficult for those killers to step out and shoot a schoolmate or a neighbour.  An integrated school system will help to bridge the enormous gap between the two sides of the community. Housing must also be mixed.  If the authorities in the North really want to make matters difficult for the terrorists they would come up with some plan which would reduce the apartheid which exists in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Let me say this, and I speak from experience, the problems of the people of Northern Ireland are more complex than a spider's web.  Political talks will help and I very much welcome them, but talks on their own will achieve little unless at the same time the attitudes of both sides change.  The talks are a far cry from the everyday lives of people in Belfast who are confined to their own areas.  They are of little importance to Nationalist farmers in the North who find British soldiers hiding in their fields. They are of little help to the people in the North who live in fear of the terrorists, who cannot serve the Defence Forces in their shops let alone speak to them, who are afraid to speak out because of intimidation and who witness racketeering in every sphere of business life.  What good can come of talks when a former Lord Mayor of Belfast refused to welcome Michael Carruth, a sportsman, to the city?  If people there are so bigoted as to treat a sportsman in that fashion, what hope have our politicians?</P>
    <P>Dr. Brian Feeney of the SDLP said yesterday that genuine politicians in the Unionist parties are being gagged by those in charge, those who shout &ldquo;Ulster says no&rdquo;.  I would like to point out that includes a claim for territory which they do not own, counties Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan, which I very much resent.  They are the people who see Catholics as antichrists, those who call on us to remove Articles 2 and 3 from our Constitution as a precondition to talks. Remember this, if Articles 2 and 3 are a problem for the ordinary Unionists in the <Col N="969" /> North, which I very much doubt, the Border along which I live is a problem for the Nationalists in the North, and I do not hear the SDLP calling for its removal.</P>
    <P>Let us be realistic.  Articles 2 and 3 can only be removed by means of a referendum and I will fully accept the decision of the people on that matter if, and when, it happens.  However, will the existence or removal of these Articles really bring us closer to peace, or will it further alienate those people who consider themselves Irish?  Sadly, it takes so much more to achieve peace.  All people in the North must make an effort to achieve peace otherwise the violence continues while we wait, and each life lost causes so much hurt and grief and it is so utterly futile.</P>
    <P>The hope for unity is a legitimate one but the effect of a paramilitary campaign does us no favours.  Last year the UFF and other Unionist forces killed more than the IRA.  All are criminals of the worst kind and any attempt by them to defend their horrific acts on the basis of some ideal of unity, whether it be with the Republic or with Britain, must be quickly refuted and stamped on.  Those criminals &mdash; and that is what they are &mdash; operate beyond this and have only served to widen the chasm between the two communities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Tánaiste's reference to programmes and projects aimed at increasing co-operation between North and South in the economic sphere, in tourism and trade.  That will help, but I remind this House of what I referred to earlier &mdash; what is needed is a change of attitude.  This must be achieved in the minds of both communities.  We must break down the physical and mental barriers which have been erected through the troubles and the apartheid which feeds them.  Only then will we achieve peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and welcome the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to the House.  I wish him well in his very difficult task of dealing <Col N="970" /> with the Northern Ireland question.  He is part of a group who have to address that issue.</P>
      <P>I compliment Senator Gordon Wilson on his contribution here today and the great humanity and Christianity he has shown by being generous enough to make an offer to the perpetrators of the crime which killed his daughter six years ago. Such generosity, understanding, compassion and humanity must be lauded and this House should recognise Senator Wilson's generosity.  I am delighted the IRA have acceded to his request for talks and I wish him well.</P>
      <P>I was most moved by the Senator's compassion in recognising that the IRA have capacity for good as well as evil because it is true that most of us believe that most people in that organisation have a greater capacity for evil.  I hope Senator Wilson can exploit their capacity for good in the course of his talks.  The Senator must be the first person on this island who has spoken to the people who were responsible for the murder of a member of his family and I compliment him on his generous action.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the Senator's suggestion of an all-party committee of the Seanad to deal specifically with Northern Ireland.  We spoke when the Seanad first met of the relevance of the Seanad and is usefulness.  This is an area in which we as a group can at least make ourselves more useful by addressing this specific issue.  I hope that a number of the Members of this House will get together either in a formal or informal capacity to assist in resolving this very difficult problem.</P>
      <P>It is the function of politicians at every level to attempt to resolve political problems. It has been said that politics is the art of the possible and no politician at any level has a right, when a problem gets difficult, to throw their hands in the air and say, &ldquo;This is impossible, forget about it; we will no longer deal with it.&rdquo;  A politician has a responsibility to proceed along another avenue and try to find a solution to the problem.  If one avenue fails we must try elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Northern Ireland the climate <Col N="971" /> for talks is extremely difficult, particularly since the dreadful atrocities in Britain last week and the atrocities that took place in Northern Ireland this morning.  To sit down to talks in that kind of climate is extremely difficult and is challenging to all politicians.  However, the responsibility is on politicians to ensure that talks continue and are not stopped by the men of violence.  If the talks stop it is giving in to the men of violence who will then succeed in their objective to halt the political process.  As elected representatives we have a responsibility to ensure that negotiations and talks continue at all levels.</P>
    <P>I have been impressed by the contributions here this morning, particularly those of Senator Lanigan, Senator Gallagher and Senator O'Sullivan in relation to the fundamental issues.  We accept that politicians deal very much with the politics and the political reality of a situation but ordinary people are entitled to live ordinary normal lives.  They are entitled to have their political, administrative and social structures operate in an effective way and to live in a peaceful way so that they can go about their business.</P>
    <P>I disagreed slightly with the comment of the Tánaiste in his speech this morning when he said that paramilitary violence is the greatest obstacle to the achievement of understanding among the people of Ireland.  It is an obstacle but I believe one of the greatest obstacles is the problem of attitude and the total divide in outlook among the communities.  Until the barriers are broken down, we are not going to succeed at the top political level but politicians can assist in breaking down the divide.</P>
    <P>This matter was mentioned by Senator Gallagher and Senator O'Sullivan in relation to the fundamental issue of education. Governments provide funding for education and the more interdenominational education there is on both sides of the Border, the more understanding there will be of all traditions. The Tánaiste in his speech said neither tradition has yet set out to redefine their position.  Part of the reason for the lack of <Col N="972" /> the redefinition is the educational system which very definitely inculcates in the various traditions their very determined and strong beliefs.  The system does not encourage a spirit of understanding among the various traditions.  If there is more communication between the groups and if more interdenominational education is provided, then people will come to understand and respect each other's point of view.</P>
    <P>There is one group North and South, particularly in the North, that has not been considered in this entire debate; I refer to the women of Northern Ireland. The women and children of Northern Ireland have been the greatest sufferers and victims over the past 20 to 25 years. They are the people left without father or husband and the psychological effect of that on the women and children has been traumatic.  If the ordinary women of Northern Ireland from the Catholic nationalist tradition and from the Unionist tradition, were to come together as a group and operate at an ordinary level, away from the political scene, and if they decided they were not going to tolerate any more, they would be a powerful force.  Politicians should examine the possibilities of exploring that very powerful avenue in attempting to resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>It is not a simple matter.  As previous speakers have said it is good that discussion and dialogue takes place but until ordinary people are willing and agree to live in harmony, the dreadful atrocities on all sides will continue and the paramilitaries will not be hounded out of the various communities in Northern Ireland.  We must recognise that the attitudes of people have been inbred for centuries.  Such views have been held on this island for the past 800 or 900 years, in Northern Ireland since the beginning of 1600.  It goes back to the Ulster Plantation and the views that have been inbred for centuries in the minds and hearts of the people will not be rooted out overnight.  It will be a slow and difficult process but it must start in the educational system and in the communication between communities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> Perhaps it is naïve of me as a southerner to say that but, as Senator Wilson said, there is good and a capacity for good in all people.  We need to examine that aspect and to develop it because the situation existing for the past 25 years cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>It has been said that Senator Wilson is naïve in seeking discussions but his discussions with the IRA could be helpful. Communication between various groups at all times is helpful; unless doors are kept open and views exchanged, we are going nowhere.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by wishing the Tánaiste every success.  I know this is a matter he has been extremely interested in for years and in his capacity as Tánaiste in the Government of 1982-87, he was involved in the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  He treats this matter as a priority and I wish him every success in the work ahead.  I also wish Senator Wilson every success with his talks.</P>

      <P>Yesterday, the Cathaoirleach, referring to the Warrington atrocity, said it made him ashamed to be Irish.  This morning I want to say very deliberately that I have scarcely ever felt as proud to be Irish.  The reaction of the ordinary people of this country as evidence by the spontaneous expressions of sympathy for the victims, and their abhorrence of the violence of the Warrington atrocity, their reactions as evidenced at the GPO yesterday, Trinity College last night and today, in the countless bouquets being prepared to send to the families in Warrington, are the true expressions of the Irish people and they make me more proud than ever to be Irish.  They speak for all of us; the IRA speaks for none of us.  There is never any reason, when the IRA totally reject and repudiate the values of this country, any of us should feel ashamed to be Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we talk, the consequences of the tragedy keep coming through to us, and now young Timothy Parry has died &mdash; perhaps it is a merciful release.  One can <Col N="974" /> be proud of the new relationship and understanding between the people of Britain and Ireland that has been born of the terrible tragedy that these families have suffered.  The fact that this House has the opportunity to debate this issue now should make it absolutely clear to the people of Britain, Ireland and the world at large, that we still have our principles, hopes and expectations and we totally reject and repudiate people who perpetrate such horror and tragedy in our names.</P>
    <P>If one were not proud already, one would certainly be proud after the moving statement, the understanding and forgiveness expressed by Senator Wilson in this House this morning.  He would make any one of us proud to be Irish.  His is the truly authentic voice of Ireland, of the disparate backgrounds and traditions of Ireland.  It is a sign of hope, understanding and harmony for the future.  He may be politically naïve as he said but, there are times when naïvety has an important place in consultations. I am sure I reflect the views of all in this House in wishing him well in all his discussions, with the IRA and Sinn Féin. As an Independent from Northern Ireland he may have a better opportunity to meet these people than we would because of the possible implications of such discussions.</P>
    <P>For that reason it is very difficult to conduct a reasoned debate in the immediate aftermath of the Warrington atrocities. We are all united in our condemnation of these terrible deeds and of those who perpetrated them.  We reject and repudiate those violent men who have inflicted such destruction and pain on innocent children and their loving families.  When children are killed or maimed understandably there is an immediate and automatic sense of revulsion. However, we should not forget the tragedy that is inflicted on many other people.</P>
    <P>If the perpetrators of this tragedy are unmoved by the plea of the brokenhearted father of Johnathan Ball, who showed a great capacity for forgiveness when he said stop it right now, and if they <Col N="975" /> will not listen, we must make a renewed commitment to create the conditions which will eradicate violence North and South.  That is the role of public and constitutional representatives and we must use our influence to eradicate the causes of that violence.  The tragic events of Warrington impose an even greater obligation on elected public representatives in Britain and in Ireland, North and South, to face our responsibility as constitutional politicians and to leave no vacuum to be filled by the men of violence.</P>
    <P>I wish to address some of the positions of constitutional politicians because in this Republic we have always sought progress through consultation and agreement. That has not started now, it did not start last week, two weeks ago or five weeks ago; it has always been the position of the constitutional representatives of this country.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs for over two and a half years I represented that view.  Agreement between North and South, agreement within the North and agreement within both Governments has always been the fundamental principle of all Governments, and hopefully will always remain so, in addressing this problem.  That is the only basis to which we can apply all our resources to eradicate the cause of violence.</P>
    <P>While continuing our fight against terrorism we must seek progress and co-operation on a tripartite basis for agreement between North and South, within the North and between the Governments of Britain and Ireland.  As our approach is based on agreement &mdash; and I want to stress this &mdash; it follows that there can be no element of a claim by us on them in any constitutional position we adhere to in our relationship with our fellow Irishmen in the North.  Equally, there can be no suggestion of a jurisdictional claim of a takeover by us on them in the North. All such distortions of our constitutional position are incompatible with its fundamental principle of agreement.  We should make it clear that we will not <Col N="976" /> tolerate any distortion or misrepresentation of our position.</P>
    <P>I would say in relation to Articles 2 and 3 that they do not, cannot, never have and never will represent a claim by us on them.  Such claim would be totally at odds with the established approach of agreement which I am glad to see is still being pursued by the Government. Those who misrepresent that approach do no service to the cause of reconciliation and understanding.  I have had occasion to represent Ireland as Minister for Foreign Affairs in discussions about the North of Ireland and our approach was always based on economic co-operation. I met with Unionists in the North of Ireland many times as Minister for Foreign Affairs and as a member of the Fianna Fáil Party but I never advertised those meetings.</P>
    <P>There is great scope for common purpose and for economic co-operation and understanding between North and South. The Tánaiste said in his opening speech in relation to economic co-operation that it is self-evident that together we can do much to improve the lot of people North and South, through tourism, investment in industry and agriculture.  During my four and a half years as Minister for Agriculture, most of the agreements achieved for the Republic were automatically accorded to the North of Ireland; Northern Ireland farmers know that.  The British Government's interests in relation to agriculture differ from our interests and those of Northern Ireland farmers.  Agriculture is one area in which we have much in common with the North&mdash; tourism is another example and the control of illegal drugs is yet a third.</P>
    <P>Political representatives on this island have both obligation and opportunity to work towards the resolution of conflict in the North.  Representatives who choose not to meet that obligation or to take that opportunity can be accused of condoning further dissent, tension, fear, hatred and violence, just as much perhaps as those who perpetrate the awful deeds.  Let us hear from all political representatives, North and South, a total condemnation of every gunman on every side.  Let us <Col N="977" /> hear the same unqualified condemnation of the UVF, UFF and UDA that we express in respect of those who claim a common interest with us.  Those who choose not to take part in talks but who stand back and impose a veto are not meeting the obligations of a political representative, nor do they release their people from the chains of fear, mistrust and hatred.  It is easy to stand back and accuse others and easy then to feed off the prejudice generated by fear and misrepresentation. That is not the kind of political climate we want in Ireland today or in the future.</P>
    <P>If I have a unique claim to speak on this matter it is that I have been involved in talks on the Northern Ireland conflict on behalf of Government for almost 25 years.  The Unionist people of this island have a great tradition and, as the Tánaiste said, we must show them that we respect that.  There is a place for them on this island.  They, unlike us, are not represented in Europe at the Council of Ministers, the Commission or in the European Parliament.  They are not represented at the United Nations.  Surely they want a voice so that they, like us, can be heard.</P>
    <P>I will finish with a personal recollection that makes me feel deeply conscious of the great Unionist tradition.  I am not ashamed of the past, far from it.  My father was interned in Belfast jail during the War of Independence, and after his release worked in the woollen trade, in Belfast, with good Northern Orangemen. The friendship that developed between him and those men lasted for the rest of his life and my first introduction to the North was through good, gutsy Orangemen. I hope Unionists know we are ready to share with them in a spirit of trust and co-operation to realise the potential of Ireland for everyone.  Let nobody try to misrepresent or distort that position for the sake of sowing further seeds of distrust and hatred.</P>

      <P>I am deeply appreciative that the Tánaiste has shown such attention and interest in this debate which has been charged with emotion and concern.</P>
      <P>I have been concerned over the years that many people who are removed from the situation in the North have often spoken with ambiguity of simple solutions and have expressed vague aspirations on the subject.  I realise that it is only when one is personally affected by the violence in the North that its full impact is appreciated, as we heard from Senator Wilson today.  I speak from personal experience.  Some 20 years ago I received a phone call to say that my brother-in-law had been shot dead.  I had the responsibility of going to my sister to tell her that her husband had just been shot dead and that her seven children had lost their father.  Each time I learn from the media of another killing in Northern Ireland, I know exactly the feeling of those left behind and the impact of that killing upon them.  It is only when a death like that affects one closely that one realises the trauma and emotion affecting so many in the North of Ireland.  Sometimes I think we are brought to a state of utter helplessness at hearing of murders over and over again.  Surely this utter helplessness that ordinary people feel is one of the most depressing aspects of recent events.  From generation to generation we see the situation continue, getting steadily worse.</P>
      <P>The public response of the last few days following the Warrington killing &mdash; I understand from Senator O'Kennedy there has been a second death &mdash; need not be a flash in the pan.  The initiative undertaken by Senator Wilson may succeed.  I do not think we should expect an immediate response from the Provisionals but given the support Senator Wilson's initiative has received let us hope that something may come of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to talk about what we as ordinary people can do to help.  Beyond today's public expression of revulsion at <Col N="979" /> the Warrington bombings, is there some way in which individuals can act?</P>
    <P>We can do one thing; we can start regarding this country as a single unit in our own minds.  To do that we almost need a mind set change.  Let us start buying and selling more from each other. That is just one way that those north and south of the Border can help one another in a material sense.  It is one way we can build a practical bridge across the gulf that sometimes divides us.  We can also help through tourism.</P>
    <P>My mother came from County Armagh and my father from County Down. Therefore, it has been traditional for me to visit cousins and relatives, to holiday and play golf in Portrush and Royal County Down and to visit the Giant's Causeway.  How many of us have not had that opportunity because we have not had the link of a close relationship?  There is an uneven balance because there are far more northern people coming here than the number travelling to the North. We should try to learn and benefit from one another in that way.</P>
    <P>It seems ironic that the North is almost a no-go area for us when we go on holidays. It is even more ironic when one observes the increasing co-operation between the two tourist boards in attracting visitors from overseas.  They have made marvellous efforts in this area.  It is not well known that the two tourist boards co-operate in attracting what is referred to as the back-track traffic from London of people who are coming across the Atlantic.  They have learned to sell Ireland as a whole and they do this in many ways.  Yet, within Ireland, many people do not see this country as one when they are planning their holidays or short trips.</P>
    <P>It would be tragic if the outpouring of public sympathy and emotion following Warrington became dissipated in the next few weeks because it is clearly very strongly felt now.  These are some practical ways in which we, as ordinary people, can become involved in building a road towards peace in this island.</P>
    <P>There are other things we can do to <Col N="980" /> help move things forward.  We, in the South need to change our attitude.  It is a little ironic that while many of us share the aspiration of a united Ireland, most of us treat the North as if it was a foreign country.  This week, in our own company we decided to promote Irish products by placing a shamrock in front of the products on the shelves in the supermarkets and I was surprised when I went round the other day to discover that we had unintentionally become Twenty-Six County-minded.  Without thinking, we had sometimes omitted to regard products from north of the Border as Irish products.  There are things we do unconsciously that we can correct.  Some people feel the North is not our problem.  Surely a change of attitude is required here?</P>
    <P>There are common problems in both parts of this island quite apart from the question of violence.  Both share the highest unemployment levels in Europe and it makes no sense to ignore what we can do to help each other on such problems.  We can help each other by trading more with one another.  This part of the country presents a major opportunity for companies in the North but it is one which is largely neglected.  Now that customs posts have gone it is utter madness not to trade more with each other.  Northern Ireland presents a vast export opportunity for our companies but it is neglected in favour of Britain, mainland Europe or even markets further afield.  We forget that Northern Ireland is a market on our doorstep.  The point I am making is illustrated by the fact that An Bord Tráchtála does not even have representation north of the Border as it has in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>These are practical things the ordinary people of Ireland can do.  I have heard it said that the impossible is often the untried.  If we really want to try in the depths of the gloom and depression following these tragedies, we may discover that those things we thought were impossible are just things we have not yet tried.</P>

      <P>Our response to Warrington was correct.  It was wonderful to <Col N="981" /> see the flowers on St. Stephen's Green but our sympathetic response to tragedies in the North of Ireland has become far too muted.  Like Senator Quinn, I have many relations in Northern Ireland so I travel there frequently and my husband does a great deal of business there.  I spent St. Patrick's Day in Northern Ireland.  As I went through Newry to lunch with a friend in Lisburn, a British soldier was shot dead in Forkhill, seven miles down the road.  It was not the death of a child but his death left an 18 month old child who will never know her father. His death was as tragic as the death of the people in Warrington.  They are all interrelated and our response to deaths in Northern Ireland has become too muted.  It was interesting to visit Belfast. I have been travelling to the North all my life.  The wire around the Europa Hotel has been down for about a year but the prickly psychological wire around the people seems to be worse each time I visit.</P>
      <P>In a speech the Tánaiste gave in the Mansion House last week he said we are inclined to look on Unionists as lapsed members of the United Irishmen.  I think we are.  We do not realise that their aspirations are different from ours and that we will have to look at this seriously.  We are in a stronger position and when one is in a stronger position one always has to be generous and go forward.  The Unionist position papers suggested an inter-Ireland relations committee.  This was tremendous progress.  I never heard of such a proposal before and I hope the Government will make urgent efforts to set it up at whatever level is agreed.</P>
      <P>We should look at the situation from a European perspective.  If the Benelux countries conducted their trade and tourism as we do they would not be able to function at all.  Why have our efforts in these areas been so weak?  The Northern Ireland Tourist Board have opened an office in Nassau Street.  At least now one can complain about any problems one has with hotels in Belfast or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should get the reports of the Opsahl Commission and discuss them. They went all over Northern Ireland <Col N="982" /> meeting people in places such as Ennis-killen, Portrush and Belfast and listening to their views.  Andy Pollak must be congratulated on the efforts he made in setting it up.  It is most important that we listen to what people in Northern Ireland are saying.  Far too often grim faced politicians tell us what they think but little thought is given to the views of the public.</P>
    <P>I gather some people this morning were decrying cross-Border visits.  This is wrong.  The more effort we make to organise even the smallest event that brings us together the better.  Some years ago I organised a visit of women doctors from Northern Ireland to Áras an Uachtaráin. President Hillery's wife, Dr. Maeve Hillery, spent four hours talking to them.  They said she had done more for cross-Border relations than anything they could remember.  The following year we paid a return visit to the North.  Why did these visits stop?  Why do we not have the energy to organise such events?  Our needs are the same especially in relation to trade, agriculture, tourism, transport and so on.  By emphasising similarities we can progress and prevent the dreadful destruction experienced by the people of Northern Ireland.  Nothing will be accomplished if we stand back; we must go forward.  As we are the people in a position of strength we must make the greater effort.</P>

      <P>I opened <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday and I read a headline: &ldquo;Boy (12) injured in blast to be taken off life support&rdquo;.  This young boy has since died. The article also mentioned the three year old boy Johnathan Ball who was killed in the Warrington attack.  Another headline on this page read: &ldquo;McAnespie inquest finds soldiers broke standing orders.&rdquo; Aidan McAnespie, aged 23, was shot dead at a British Army Border checkpoint. On the following page one reads the headline: &ldquo;Woman bled to death, trial told&rdquo;.  The report continues as follows: &ldquo;The Belfast woman, Miss Karen Reilly, alleged to have been shot twice in the back when paratroopers opened fire on a stolen car two and a half years ago bled to death.&rdquo;  These are examples of <Col N="983" /> four young lives which were needlessly lost.  It does not matter whether they were killed by a bomb or a bullet.  Their lives are gone and their families are left to mourn their tragic loss.  This killing has to stop and it has to stop now.</P>
      <P>The heartfelt aspiration of most of the people is for peace.  If this aspiration remains limited to a popular desire it cannot become reality.  A genuine peace process needs to recognise that an end to conflict does not, of itself, lead to a lasting peace.  History has taught us that a mere cessation of hostilities will not lead to peace.  A peace process, if it is to be meaningful and enduring, must address the root cause of the conflict.  A genuine and sustainable peace process must be set in the context of democracy and self-determination. A true peace process needs to focus on these dimensions.</P>
      <P>I quote from the unanimous declaration adopted by elected representatives in Leinster House, Dublin on 10 May 1949:</P>
      <P>Solemnly reasserting the indefeasible right of the Irish Nation to the unity and integrity of the national territory,</P>
      <P>Reaffirming the sovereign right of the people of Ireland to choose its own form of Government and, through its democratic institutions, to decide all questions of national policy, free from outside interference.</P>
      <P>Repudiating the claim of the British Parliament to enact legislation affecting Ireland's territorial integrity in violation of those rights, and</P>
      <P>Pledging the determination of the Irish people to continue the struggle against the unjust and unnatural partition of our country until it is brought to a successful conclusion:</P>
      <P>Places on Record its indignant protest against the introduction in the British Parliament of legislation, purporting to endorse and continue the existing Partition of Ireland, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Calls upon the British government <Col N="984" /> and people to end the present occupation of our Six North-Eastern Counties, and thereby enable the unity of Ireland to be restored and the age-long difference between the two nations brought to an end.</P>
    <P>What has changed since 1949?  The only thing that has changed is that electoral districts are no longer gerrymandered. However, discrimination still exists.</P>
    <P>Dr. Patrick Hillery, when he was Minister for External Affairs, told the United Nations Security Council in 1969:</P>
    <P>Partition was accomplished by the British government as a concession to an intransigent minority within the Irish nation.  Ireland was divided as a result of an Act of the British Parliament in 1920, an Act in favour of which not one Irish vote, either North or South was cast.</P>
    <P>The New Ireland Forum in May 1984 said:</P>
    <P>Historically up to 1922 Ireland was governed as a single unit and prior to the Act of Union 1801 was constitutionally a separate and theoretically equal kingdom.</P>
    <P>I believe Partition is wrong and it is one of the basic causes of the problems of today.  It is wrong because it defies the wishes of the people and rejects the wishes of the population of Britain as expressed in opinion poll after opinion poll.  It flouts international law, it is undemocratic, and it is permanently abnormal and can only be maintained by extraordinary means.  Partition does not work at any universally accepted standards and its consequences have made victims of, in greater or lesser degree, the entire Irish nation for generations, North and South, Nationalists and Unionists.  It has been responsible for thousands of casualties in the Six Counties and in the United Kingdom.  It perpetuates conditions in which conflict seems almost inevitable.  It is a lesson of history in all societies that where peaceful evolution is made impossible violent revolution is almost inevitable.</P>
    <P>The reason the British Government <Col N="985" /> give for not withdrawing from Northern Ireland is the Unionist political veto.  The British Government has fostered political division between Irish Catholics and Protestants through a system of political, social, economic privilege and it has fostered a Unionist or pro-British stance in the Six Counties.  The late Cardinal Ó Fiaich said:</P>
    <P>The present policy of the British government &mdash; that there will be no change in the status of Northern Ireland while the majority want British rule to remain &mdash; is no policy at all.  It means you do nothing and it means that the loyalists in the North are given no encouragement to make any move of any kind.  It is an encouragement to sit tight.</P>
    <P>Advocates of the Unionist perspective represent 20 per cent of the Irish nation. They are a national minority; a significant minority but a minority nevertheless.  To bestow the power of veto over national independence and sovereignty on any national minority is a direct contravention of the principle of self-determination.</P>
    <P>The Partition of Ireland has dominated Irish politics for the last 70 years.  This artificial boundary has no basis in history or geography and it is viewed by the world as an archaic relic of bygone colonial days.  All efforts to solve the Northern problem &mdash; which is a problem for us all, North and South &mdash; on the basis of the legitimacy of Partition have been counter-productive.  It is like trying to heal a compound fracture with a sticking plaster.</P>
    <P>Ireland has suffered socially, economically and culturally as a result of Partition and its consquences.  It has suffered the tragedy of thousands of people who have been killed or psychologically or physically injured.  The scars and deep hurt felt by the community as a result of the strife and the violence which is a daily occurrence will last for a long time.</P>
    <P>We must try to stop this and I believe we can do so.  How?  We are a people who achieved internatinal prominence and fame as a result of our missionary <Col N="986" /> and peace-keeping work; as a result of our success in the fields of sport, culture art and crafts.  We have never colonised or sought to exploit any other country, as a result of which we are accepted as a neutral and fair contributor to the world order and peace.  Our stature among the States of Europe was evident during the period we held the European Presidency which was a model of professionalism, decorum and dignity.</P>
    <P>Against this background of world service and recognition, it is understandable that we should look to our many friends throughout the world for support and representation in our efforts to bring about a lasting and just peace for the whole of Ireland.  We must find a solution which would take cognisance of both political traditions on this island and forge strong links and promote mutual understanding in an All-Ireland alliance.  Such a development would be in keeping with the policy of cohesion in Europe and a reflection of the removal of barriers and obstacles which we are now witnessing. In many ways, the division of our country and its tragic consequences &mdash; which receives ongoing worldwide exposure &mdash; is a blight on the grand vision of the architects of European unity.</P>
    <P>The current debate on Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution is more of a distraction from, than a contribution to, a lasting solution to the problem.  It generates, more heat than light.  It adds to the division and suspicion and further polarises people and it alienates the Nationalist community from the political process.  They would question how the legitimate Irish claims to full sovereignty could be waived without giving offence to the Nationalist majority in this island while at the same time continuing to condone the British claim of control over the North as contained in the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.  To enter into such an arrangement because of political expediency would be seen as an act of betrayal by the Nationalist community in the Six Counties.  It would compound and exacerbate the problem and undermine the moderate, middle ground of the Nationalist community.  It would not <Col N="987" /> assuage the Unionist community in any significant manner.</P>
    <P>In his speech at the annual Wolfe Tone commemoration ceremony at Bodenstown on 18 October 1992 the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>While acceptance of the reality of Partition was part of the price of independence, the Irish people were nevertheless given clearly to understand that it was only intended to be temporary, that Northern Nationalists would be fairly treated on a equal basis with the Unionists population.  Further, an institution would be established which would facilitate North-South co-operation and assist progress towards eventual reconciliation.  Both the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and the Anglo-Irish Treaty, 1921, were based on this concept of the essential unity of Ireland to be re-established as soon as practicable and accepted by the British Government as a desirable long-term aim.  The balance was subsequently lost and forgotten.</P>
    <P>What is required at this stage is real and constructive dialogue which is representative of the middle ground and not of the extremes.  However, I believe that no dialogue will succeed unless Sinn Féin is included in talks in the future.  I know they have only 10 or 13 per cent support but that support must be recognised and taken into account.  It was not might that removed the barriers in Eastern Europe but the will of the people.</P>
    <P>We must accept that the majority of our people are reasonable and fair-minded, who possess a vision of Ireland which would best serve the needs of present and future generations and which would enable us to enhance our stature internationally as a democratic, sovereign and Christian people.  We must believe that, if we accept and contribute to unity of the diverse traditions of Europe, then a similar concept for Ireland is essential.</P>
    <P>Our duty is to persuade the British Government that the Partition of Ireland has been a disastrous failure.  Our duty is <Col N="988" /> to persuade the Unionists of the benefits of Irish reunification and to seek their views on the constitutional, legal and financial arrangements needed for a united Ireland.  We should also persuade the international community, through international fora and institutions, to support Irish national rights.  Our duty is to resist further erosion of Irish national integrity by opposing the deletion or dilution of that claim as contained in the 1937 Constitution, unless it is part of an agreed overall package which includes the Government of Ireland Act and a declaration of intent to withdraw by the British Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also said, in the speech I referred to earlier, that he would give an undertaking that any agreement reached between the two Governments and the political parties on the North of Ireland would be put in a referendum to the people, North and South, at the same time.  In that way all the people of this island would be given the opportunity to endorse simultaneously, for the first time since 1918, the form that future relationships on this island might take.</P>
    <P>We should use the Anglo-Irish Agreement, as is our right, to make proposals on political structures, on human rights, on political and identity problems, on policing and other security structures, on social and economic issues, on prisons, as regards policy and individual cases, on the courts, on the judicial system and nominations to public bodies.</P>
    <P>In that connection, on 28 May 1991, Deputy Blaney launched the &ldquo;Directory of Discrimination&rdquo; at a meeting in Dublin in which it was shown, using figures taken from the Fair Employment Agency and the Fair Employment Trust, that discrimination still takes place.  There is a motion for resolution before the European Parliament in the names of MEPs Blaney, Hume, Lalor, Maher, Andrews, Fitzgerald, Killilea, Fitzsimons, Lane and 44 or 46 other MEPs that there be an investigation into discrimination in access to employment in Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach in a speech to the American-Ireland Fund national gala dinner at Capitol Hill, Washington on Tuesday, 16 <Col N="989" /> March this year, said: &ldquo;The ending of discrimination in Northern Ireland will make a very important contribution to restoring peace and confidence there and building trust for the future&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is important also that we recognise and applaud the many positive everyday acts of kindness, co-operation and Christian charity between communities in the Six Counties.  They are more widespread and enduring than the divisive activities which receive so much publicity. Cross-Border co-operation between different organisations and agencies continues to grow and stabilise.  It includes projects in tourism, sport and culture and the results flowing from such solid co-operation are beginning to impact on the community in general.</P>
    <P>One project which comes to mind and which epitomises the co-operative spirit to which I refer is, appropriately, in the field of genealogy &mdash; the Irish Genealogical Project.  This multi-million pound project is now at an advanced stage.  It is funded by the International Fund for Ireland, by European Structural Funds and by private investment.  Of the 35 centres envisaged, North and South, 28 are already computerised.  The project has the support of the major churches, Civil Service, North and South, Bord Fáilte, the Northern Ireland Tourism Board, Shannon Development and the training agencies FÁS and ACE who, with the Irish Family History Foundation and the Association of Independent Genealogists, create a unique partnership for the whole island.  It is projects of this type that will make the Border irrelevant, and that is the only way it will disappear.</P>
    <P>The Irish Genealogical Project will not only be of service to the people of Ireland but also to thousands of people of Irish extraction abroad.  It reaches, through the centres, into nearly every county in Ireland and into every Irish heart worldwide. It is non-sectarian and nondenominational but it is wholly Irish.  It will make an immense contribution in the spheres of heritage, tourism, employment and community relations.  This project is a tangible model of what the future could hold for Ireland.  It is based on <Col N="990" /> constructive involvement, mutual respect and a commitment to our common birthright. It demonstrates, more than many other things, that our heritage is older than our political divisions.</P>
    <P>We must do everything in our power to cease the terrible conflict in Northern Ireland and to recognise the root cause. I believe the root cause is Partition and that, at some time in the future, the British Government will withdraw.  They have done so in every country they have colonised; it is only a matter of time.  At that point we must be ready and have structures in place to accommodate the people of the different traditions in the Six Counties and to integrate them into a united Ireland by giving them the financial, economic, social and other benefits they need to allow them freedom of expression in regard to their beliefs and attitudes.  I hope that one day, perhaps on St. Patrick's Day, we will see Orange bands marching in front of the GPO.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste to the House.  I am pleased he has visited the Seanad so early in the session.  I recognise the sincerity of his commitment to the Northern Ireland problem which was evident not only since he was appointed Tánaiste but also when he was in Opposition and previously when he was a member of the Government that signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
      <P>It was a privilege for me to listen to Senator Wilson.  We all accept he would not be a Member of this House if it were not for the Northern Ireland problem. As Senator Wilson says, he speaks as Marie Wilson's dad and it is because of her, and what happened to her, that he is a Senator.  This is something we often forget when we talk of Northern Ireland; we speak as if it was a territory, just a green field unoccupied by people. However, the problems of Northern Ireland, as Senator Quinn said, are the problems of the people and they have had sad consequences for Senator Wilson's daughter, for the people who were killed today, and for the people in Warrington who have lost their children.  This is often forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="991" /> We tend to think about the victims in Northern Ireland when we read about them on page three or four of the daily papers; we do not realise how each tragedy affects the lives of those who are left behind.  This is something which we in the South must face.  It is easy for us to sit comfortably in Dublin, Laois-Offaly or wherever we come from, and talk about the tragedies; we express our outrage and then carry on as normal. However, life is never normal for the people who are left behind in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn said that perhaps women from both communities in Northern Ireland could come together and in that way create some hope for the future.  In the past we saw how the peace people came together and tried to solve the problem but obviously such people find it difficult to progress alone.  Politicians must work to provide the drastic solution that is necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher spoke about changing attitudes; she said it is only when both communities in the North change their attitudes that we can hope to have lasting peace.  I accept this but I also believe we must help to change many attitudes in this part of the country.  We must always give clear messages to the men of violence and not just when atrocities are committed.</P>
    <P>We must also change our attitude as politicians.  The Tánaiste said in his speech:</P>
    <P>I have sought to put beyond doubt that the Irish Government will play the most constructive possible role. However, Northern Ireland political leaders have their own responsibilities. There will not be peace and stability in Ireland unless the two main traditions on the island co-operate to create and sustain these conditions.  The Unionist community holds one of the necessary keys, and it would be tragic if they refused to apply it.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Tánaiste, but we must ask ourselves: what keys do we hold? <Col N="992" /> What keys are we not using to solve this tragic problem?</P>
    <P>I welcome the developments that have taken place in the Ango-Irish Conference and the Northern Ireland talks.  The Tánaiste mentioned the conference meetings this week and how it is carrying out a substantial programme of work across a wide range of areas.  These areas included those spoken of by Senator Quinn: trade, tourism and co-operation in many sectors.  I think the main problems in Northern Ireland are violence and death.</P>
    <P>On the radio this morning I heard Susan McHugh, who organised the public meeting held in Trinity last night, say that the politicians have sat idly by for long enough.  That is a dreadful indictment on all of us.  She is obviously talking about politicians in this part of the country as well as those in the North and in Britain. We have to ask ourselves, how long will we sit idly by?  Are we making any long-term plans, or have we any long-term solutions to the problems in Northern Ireland?</P>
    <P>Senator Lee spoke earlier about the possibility of a joint authority.  The problems in Northern Ireland are urgent and serious and they need drastic solutions. We must be brave and make tough decision in this part of the country. Senator O'Kennedy spoke about our hopes, expectations and principles.  We should ask ourselves, what are our hopes?  What are our realistic expectations? What principles are we talking about?  Senator Lydon spoke about a debate on Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution and said it caused more heat than light.  I would feel as strongly as he does but probably in the opposite direction. There is a great challenge for us all here.</P>
    <P>As the Leader of the House said this morning, it is eight years since Northern Ireland was debated in the Seanad.  What progress has been made in the intervening period?  The Tánaiste quoted the late Seán MacEntee.  He said:</P>
    <P>We elders have failed to find a solution for the problem and after 50 <Col N="993" /> years we may be forgiven for thinking that perhaps we went the wrong way about it.  Maybe we were too rigid in our approach, too tenacious of our own point of view, too proud to temporise or placate.  Whatever may have been the reason, we have made no headway; so our successors must start from &ldquo;square one&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That was said 23 years ago.  All that has happened in Northern Ireland since is that the violence has continued.  I know the Tánaiste is firmly committed to trying to bring a solution.  All of us must give support to our politicians and leaders but we must also let them know what we want to happen.  All of us must have courage. I support the proposal made this morning by Senator Wilson to have an all-party Seanad committee.  I also support the idea of visiting Northern Ireland.  I made my first visit to Northern Ireland four years ago; I have been there four times since.  As has been said we are terrified of the North.  We think we should not be there or go there.  Irish people live there, people like us who live in dangerous times and have atrocities committed on them because of the problems in the North.  We owe it to Senator Wilson and all the people in the North to try to find a solution.  I wish the Tánaiste well in his endeavours.  He is very committed and is well fitted to the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to the House.  I hope his deep personal interest in the problems of Northern Ireland will bear fruit.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay a tribute to Senator Wilson.  It was said he is naive because of his suggestion to speak to the men of violence.  When Christopher Columbus set off on his voyage, the world said he too was naïve.  Naïveté might bring fresh thinking to the intransigence of politicians, North, South and in Westminster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once more a callous, cowardly act of violence has been carried out in the name of Irish nationalism.  Within a few days a reprisal killing will take place to defend <Col N="994" /> the Unionists of Ulster.  The people of Ireland on both sides of the so-called political divide have said time and again they condemn and deplore these atrocities and the men of violence who perpetrate these crimes, yet they continue. People on this island want to live a normal life, to go about their business and their daily chores, but they have been conditioned by politics, propaganda and fear.</P>
    <P>We have a great deal in common: we speak the same language and our customs are the same, except on one or two days in the year when people march to show and to convince themselves there are differences. If we look at what we have in common, our differences fade into the background.  In an imaginary exercise and using the scales outside a courthouse in Belfast, if I place a pebble on the right side for every thing we have in common and another pebble on the left for things we do not have in common, the scales would tip in favour of what we have in common.  The proof of this is that the paramilitaries continue to kill to convince people there are differences.</P>
    <P>If we look at the economic implications of a closer unity of the two peoples in Northern Ireland and the people of North and South, we will see that there is no reason we cannot integrate economically. I say to the Tánaiste and the people in politics in Northern Ireland that we must strive to lay emphasis on our similarities and our differences will wane.  Tourism was mentioned by Senator Quinn and Senator Henry.  Several speakers on this side of the House have brought up the issue of economic integration.  In this part of the island we must convince the people of Northern Ireland, Unionists and Nationalists, that we all have a role to play.  Borders are imaginery if people believe they are united.</P>
    <P>Articles 2 and 3 have been mentioned. The Tánaiste said they were not cast in bronze.  Articles 2 and 3 are not sacred; human life is.  As a Fianna Fáil Member, I am willing to put Articles 2 and 3 up for negotiation if that would contribute to a peaceful solution to Northern Ireland.  I am a Nationalist.  My aim is peace.  My <Col N="995" /> aspiration is a united Ireland.  We must be willing to give a certain amount.</P>
    <P>The political stalemate in Northern Ireland frightens me, because the ordinary person in Northern Ireland is not represented by those who portray themselves as defenders of the United Kingdom or defenders of nationalism.  I also have no problem in saying that Sinn Féin should be brought into the peace process.  This would weaken the men of violence.  As long as they are kept from the negotiating table they will claim a right to use violence because they are not listened to democratically.</P>
    <P>Mention was also made of integrated schools and integrating people in the workplace.  Sadly, this is impracticable because of the ethnic cleansing effect the men of violence have had in Belfast and other major urban areas in the North.  I had the horrific &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; of driving through Belfast on several occasions.  On one side, the population may be 100 per cent Catholic and across a wire divide in the same parish, it is 100 per cent Protestant.  The longer the political stalemate and the longer people are seen to be intransigent in the South and in the North, the more difficulties will be caused because a whole generation has been separated and divided.  Senator Henry rightly said Catholics and Protestants had never met each other until they were brought together on cross-Border community trips.  This is a sad reality.  Public representatives in Northern Ireland must bring the two traditions together and must stand aside or get up to represent what the people of Northern Ireland really believe.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Tánaiste and encourage him to make every effort to arrive at a peaceful solution.  He has the full support of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Today the sun is shining in Dublin; it is shining in Warrington and it is shining in Belfast.  It is vital that we make every effort to reduce violence and bring it to an end.  The only way that can come about is through peaceful political solutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I welcome the opportunity this debate affords us to discuss the issue of Northern Ireland and the direction we are taking on this island.  In his contribution, the leader of the Fine Gael group in the House spoke about how bleak things look at this moment.  He said no real talks were taking place.  He indicated the lack of any new initiative depressed him.  He spoke about the lack of progress on the political front and decried the withdrawal of young politicians from what passes as political life in Northern Ireland, people who not long ago seemed to have a great deal to contribute.  He spoke of those politicians having grown bone weary of the sterility of the political process there.</P>
      <P>On a day like this when one child has just been buried in a quiet English cemetery as a result of the bombing outrage in Warrington and another child has lost his brave struggle for life after receiving horrific injuries in the same outrage carried out in our name we hear of three more murders in Derry.  It would be easy to despair, but if we give up hope either here or in the Six Counties, if politicians give up the fight and withdraw from the scene then we who believe that a solution agreed among all people on this island is the best and indeed the only way to achieve peace and prosperity would be guilty of the ultimate betrayal.</P>
      <P>We cannot afford to despair at this time.  I am not suggesting Senator Manning was counselling despair; he chronicled the facts and said how difficult it was to maintain a positive outlook in the light of events.  To despair or to withdraw from the political process would be the ultimate betrayal and would consign the people of this island to the bigots, the demi-gods and the perpetrators of violence on each side of this quarrel.  As painstakingly slow as progress has been it is infinitely better than no progress at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste in his speech rightly dealt with what has been, and what is being achieved.  Even if we cannot solve the constitutional issues in the short term, we can, as he suggested, resolve other issues <Col N="997" /> to all our benefit.  I have spoke before of the futility of the all-or-nothing approach which suggests that Articles 2 and 3 must be abandoned by the Nationalists or certain aspirations abandoned by the Unionists before meaningful deliberations or co-operation may begin.  That approach, intentionally or otherwise, seems to shunt the destiny of the people of this island into a cul-de-sac.</P>
    <P>There is no reason politicians of North and South cannot sit down together to resolve issues on which there are no fundamental differences.  Issues such as infrastructure, access transport, common energy needs, employment creation, tourism and our response to European Community policy are not limited by orange or green considerations.  Political differences on constitutional issues should not prevent political leaders North and South from establishing structures and processes through which joint responses to our common economic ills can be worked out.</P>
    <P>Co-operation should not be confined to economic areas.  Degrees of co-operation in education and health have been developed and should be built upon.  Colleges and universities in both parts of the island are developing joint programmes with their counterparts in Europe through schemes such as the Erasmus programme.  There is no excuse whatsoever for the relative lack of development of co-operation on joint programmes between educational institutions on this island.</P>
    <P>Matters of health must surely offer major scope for co-operation.  On a small island we face common health problems and there is no reason not to tackle these problems together.  Why is there no Thirty-Two County AIDS programme, blood donor service or organ donor service? When bombs threatened the lives of Irish men and women in Belfast in the 1940s, Border and constitutional issues did not prevent the Dublin fire brigade travelling North to assist.  Why then should those issues prevent progress in the 1990s, when common sense and co-operation is vital?</P>
    <P>We have many more common interests <Col N="998" /> with the North than we sometimes acknowledge.  Common economic, social, cultural and welfare interests can and must be jointly addressed.  In Ireland and elsewhere, the debate on Northern Ireland understandably focuses on political security and constitutional matters. The importance of these matters should not deter us from achieving progress in other areas mentioned.  I have no doubt if over the last 50 years we had devoted a modicum of our national ingenuity to identifying and resolving non-contentious common problems we would now have made considerable progress on the contentious issues also.  At a minimum, we would have established a common foundation of trust and co-operation. Perhaps this approach is not what Seán MacEntee had in mind when he said &ldquo;we elders have failed to find a solution&rdquo;, but it may have been at the back of his mind.  We have focused for so long on issues on which we cannot give an inch, that we have failed to identify the matters on which we could make miles of progress. Trust and co-operation spring from dialogue, debate and sustained contact; progress is unlikely to be made while parties are isolated.</P>
    <P>I applaud the initiative taken by Senator Wilson who says that he has made contact with IRA leadership with a view to talks.  Like the Senator, I discern some signs of a struggle in that organisation between its political and armed wings.  Would it not be logical to offer encouragement to IRA members who propose to move towards political and democratic structures when others members remain locked in the sterility of violence?</P>
    <P>Senator Wilson's initiative shows great courage, considering his own experience at the hands of the IRA.  Even if his chances of success are slim, all people of goodwill will wish him well.</P>
    <P>Even if Senator Wilson achieves nothing with the leadership of the IRA, he may have already achieved a great deal.  His speech here today will help to break the tyranny of political correctness that has surrounded this debate in the South.  For too long, self-appointed political <Col N="999" /> commentators have defined what is and what is not politically correct.  By so doing, they have, particularly on this side of the Border, set artificial parameters to political debate and have inhibited reasoned debate on the continuing usefulness, for example, of the section 31 ban on broadcasting appearances by members of prescribed organisations. They have also attempted to stigmatise those who express concern at the operation of the judicial system in Northern Ireland and in Britain.  I recall an incident in London a few years ago when, after the failure of the Birmingham Six appeal, in the company of other campaigners, I was described by a senior political commentator as a &ldquo;crypto-Provo&rdquo; because I espoused the cause of those six men. Interestingly, that commentator was to the fore with his eulogies when the six were finally freed a few years later.  This attitude is, all too often, part and parcel of what passes for informed comment on issues such as extradition.</P>
    <P>The stultification of political debate on Northern Ireland is intolerable.  On the one hand, it prevents the full exploration of issues and on the other hand, it presents the world with a caricature of the range and diversity of the political views on the question.  For that if for nothing else, I applaud Senator Wilson on his courage in striking a blow against the arbiters of political fashion and the tyranny of political correctness.  The honest elaboration of ideas and views can do nothing but good.  The development of contacts has a great deal to recommend it.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have talked about Articles 2 and 3.  These Articles are continually moved to the centre of the debate and to my mind, are used to distract attention from what we might do.  We all have different views on Articles 2 and 3 and mine are well known.  They are an important expression of the legitimate wish for unity among the Nationalist population but I accept as a democrat that there are other views also.  I suggest, therefore, that we should have more logical debate on these issues.  I omitted to <Col N="1000" /> do so at the outset, but I wish the Tánaiste well in the task ahead of him.</P>
    <P>It is important that we on this side of the island continously keep the issue of the Northern Ireland problem before us. I was struck when the Leader of the House mentioned that it was eight years since there had been a discussion on the Northern Ireland issue here.  That is an appalling reflection on us all.</P>
    <P>I was also struck by suggestions that there should be some ongoing system where we can keep in contact in this House and in the other House with developments in the North.  There is clearly a need for some form of parliamentary committee, some form of Oireachtas joint committee which would allow not just individual issues to be debated and discussed from time to time but would put us in direct contact with political leaders in the North.  I wish to see, for example, political, parliamentary or Oireachtas committees going to the North, sitting down to discuss the diverse range of political views that exist there to try to establish where progress can be made.</P>
    <P>Far too much time in this debate is spent establishing the lines that cannot be crossed.  It would be more fruitful and beneficial and we would serve the people better if we spent more time exploring where progress can be made.</P>

      <P>Everybody will welcome today's debate.  Last year I was in Belfast when the Irish Congress of Trade Unions organised a major demonstration as a response to the slaughter of the Protestant workers at the Teebane Cross massacres.  Today we have a similiar situation on the other side of the divide.  The present situation in the North is nothing short of a civil war.  There are no armies facing each other across a battle field, but we have become used to the killings, the maiming, the slaughter and the constant dread.  In the last two or three years the situation has worsened and for the first time there has been terrorism of the type seen in South and Central America.  We have seen the indiscriminate murder and maiming of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> In the North we have institutionalised the divisions created by the religious divide; now a person's name, school, hospital or address are elements of what eventually becomes a death warrant for people on either side of the divide.  The reality is that people are born in Catholic or Protestant hospitals.  A Catholic born in a Catholic hospital will live in a Catholic housing estate, will attend a Catholic school to be taught by a Catholic teacher who has also attended a Catholic school. The child will leave school to work in a predominantly Catholic place of employment, will live in a Catholic housing estate or in a Catholic area.  This division in the communities has continued for generations and it is essential that steps be taken to heal it.</P>
    <P>Whatever ideas one might have about the future of this island as a political entity, it is obvious that there must be intervention in the vicious circle of segregation and division which is institutionalised in the North.  That must be done at various levels.  Education is one area a start can be made.  We need to ensure that people at least learn together and learn about each other.</P>
    <P>I am in an unusual position because I am probably the only person in the House who has an office in Belfast as well as in Dublin, and I have 5,000 members in the North.  I live with the day-to-day situation in Northern Ireland.  I live with the difficulties of bombs being dropped on the doorsteps of schools, where schools are used as hostages by vested interests.  I visited St. Anthony's school in Craigavon, two weeks ago.  This school was destroyed by an IRA bomb in December 1991 and, to the credit of the parents, teachers, education authorites, etc., it was replaced with a semi-permanent building within five weeks, and the school was reopened after Christmas.  I asked the children what they remembered of the day the school was destroyed and one child said that all she could think of was what happened to the fish in the aquarium in the school.  It shows that children are sensitive to what is happening around them.  However, there is a danger that we are becoming desensitised to the horrific <Col N="1002" /> developments in the North.  In my experience there is more tension in the city of Belfast today than ever.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of isolationism. People who travel from North to South or from South to North are very careful about what they say.  I have a very simple rule when I meet strangers in the North.  I will discuss anything except the weather, sport or television.  I would prefer to discuss politics, religion or whatever causes problems in the local community.  People spend their time being nice to each other.  When people from the Republic visit the North and speak to people from Belfast about how they should be doing their business they are told they could not understand because they do not live in Belfast. People should not be put off by that kind of comment.  I lecture people from Belfast as I lecture people from Cork or Kerry, whatever my views.  It is important to challenge ingrained ideas, beliefs and relationships.</P>
    <P>It gave me great pleasure about six years ago to organise a seminar in Belfast.  I invited, on a confidental basis people from all parts of the community &mdash; Catholics, Unionists, Republicans, Sinn Féin, the UDA &mdash; people from different backgrounds, those in favour of a united Ireland, those in favour of the Union, those in favour of the Republic, and those in favour of a unilateral declaration of independence &mdash; about which I have not heard much in recent times.  I asked the questions that are not supposed to be asked: for instance, growing up as a Protestant in the North, what did you think about Catholics?  How did you perceive Catholicism?  One Protestant woman said that when she was growing up, trying to understand the Catholic faith and the sacrament of the Eucharist thought Catholics were cannibals who ate their own God.  This is an interesting concept.</P>
    <P>A very good Catholic friend of mind from the Glens of Antrim &mdash; he died last year &mdash; grew up knowing that the Protestants were better off than the Catholics and that everything worked out better for them.  He knew that when there was a problem with the water supply, it <Col N="1003" /> was the Protestants and Presbyterians in Ballymena who turned off the taps.  It took him 20 years to realise that the Protestant poor were no better off than the Catholic poor.  However, neither side was told this and they were always kept apart. It is my belief that if people went to school together and lived together they would be forced to come to terms with each other.</P>
    <P>All my life I have been opposed to this herd approach to football hooliganism where one group of supporters was left on one side of the pitch and the others on the opposite side.  I believe in the concept of places like Craigavon where there is a determined effort to bring communities together.  The problem is one of education and lack of understanding. People have to be confronted with each other's differences.  It is about contrasting the beliefs, background and the strongly held principles of different groups and explaining them to each other.  Sometimes, out of politeness, we dare not ask a question we dearly want to ask of somebody with a different point of view.</P>
    <P>Another concept of the North which is very prevalent in the South is that it is a unit; you can refer to it as the Province, the Six Counties or Northern Ireland, it does not matter what you call it; it is not a unit.  Senator Wilson from Enniskillen would agree when I say that people from Derry, west Belfast or Enniskillen are completely different and have as much in common as people from Dublin or Dundalk; Dundalk is as close to Belfast and Derry and these people have different attitudes.  There is a view that Northern Ireland people are all one; that there is a homongenous North of Ireland person.  They are individuals with different views which we need to explore.</P>
    <P>Today, three more workers have been shot by people from one side of the divide.  They do not care about workers and, apparently, they believe that taking another life, whether it is that of a three year old or a 12-year old child in Warrington, or intimidating shoppers in London, will bring people closer to the Union or to a united Ireland.  I believe <Col N="1004" /> we need to challenge traditional views, put aside our polite ways and try to appreciate the views of the other side.</P>
    <P>Where do the Churches stand in relation to integrated education?  How can we justify people living in separate communities if we want them to live together harmoniously later?  Surely we can meet the needs of the churches and all the institutions by bringing young people together.  In a society where we expect a pluralistic approach, in a Republic that stands for the acceptance of differences and where its strengths and unity comes from such acceptance, and in a democracy that is judged on how it deals with its minorities, surely it should be possible to use all those elements to achieve a better kind of community.</P>
    <P>Education is the key factor in all of this.  In the last century Cardinal Newman said that tolerance was the first quality of an educated person.  If the quality of tolerance is lacking in Irish society today, North and South, we have failed.  As an educationalist I am appalled that we have done so; I believe that if people learn to know and love each other and understand each other's differences, it would be more difficult to shoot them.  It would also be more difficult for the godfathers of crime, assassination and death to present people who have been baptised in a different church or reared with different values as evil monsters and to insist that political objectives can be attained by killing, slaughtering and assassinating people.  We need more interaction.  I would like to see Dublin children spending a week in schools in the North, teachers from the North exchanging places with teachers in the South and communities in the North and South mixing on common issues.</P>
    <P>There is a wish for peace but we are fighting against generations of ingrained feelings and views.  We are fighting against the deterioration of the word nationalism, which was an acceptable word a century ago but which is now being demeaned.  It has become like every other &ldquo;ism&rdquo;, imposing the views of one people on another.  We need to intervene in that vicious circle of intolerance, <Col N="1005" /> crime, death and assassination.  We should seek tolerance and try to develop a greater understanding of the people, North and South.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four aspects to the Northern problem &mdash; the Northern Nationalists, the Northern Unionists, the British and ourselves.  We could, perhaps, tell the Northern Unionists, the Northern Nationalists and the British what we would like them to do but, effectively, we can only organise one of these groups to do something positive and that is ourselves.  It is wrong to think that problems in the North do not affect our lives.</P>
      <P>People in the South have turned their backs on Northern Ireland.  We could and should have become more involved in the day-to-day events in the North.  I am as guilty as the next person and I am ashamed to say that I have only been in Northern Ireland once, on my way to Donegal.  However, I am not alone on this.  Mary McAleese, on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;, highlighted that problem.  She said that any time she mentioned the Northern problems to people in the South she saw them switch-off; they did not want to hear; they believed those problems were outside their control.  We have allowed the complex political problem in the North to interfere with what we, as individuals, can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators mentioned trade as a means by which we can become more involved in Northern Ireland.  Senator O'Toole spoke of the role of education and Senator Quinn spoke of trade and tourist links; we have outlined today several ways in which we can involve ourselves in day-to-day life in Northern Ireland. We should encourage people in the South to take a greater interest in what is happening in the North because as Senator Kelleher said, partition or the Border means nothing if people have the will to be as one.  Unless we start reaching out to the people of Northern Ireland we will foster a mental partition.  The partition of Ireland was not of our doing, <Col N="1006" /> our opinion was not asked but mentally we have enforced partition.</P>
    <P>We have in the past considered ourselves different from the people of the North.  Our 1937 Constitution tried as far as possible to separate us.  It is an insular and narrowly based constitution which now constitutes a barrier to mutual understanding.  Calls for a revision of the 1937 Constitution are met with howls of protest from the South.  We are clinging to the wreckage of that Constitution.  Several times in the Seanad we have spoken of its outdatedness with respect to other aspects of Irish life.  Surely we should now take a look at the Constitution to see how it reflects Irish society today and how it is regarded by people abroad. What do outsiders who look at our Constitution make of us?  Does it really reflect the Ireland of today?</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste in his speech said: &ldquo;I believe a new generation wants to escape from the shackles of the past and establish a new basis for our relationships on this island.&rdquo;  If we believe this to be true, our actions should be geared towards enabling us to escape from those shackles. Mentally, we must rid ourselves of them.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe there is still in this part of Ireland an undercurrent of tacit support for the IRA.  One meets few people who say they support the IRA, yet at the end of a night spend celebrating a match, rebel songs will be belted out with great pride and gusto.  One will hear &lsquo;the lads&rdquo; or &ldquo;the boys&rdquo; spoken of, half-proudly, in whispers.</P>
    <P>In the South there are still families who cling to the ideology of the 1920s, who believe that Seán South was right in what he did in the fifties and who cannot be shaken from that view.  What is worse is that there are innumerable safe houses in the South to which the IRA can go for support.  Until we begin to discontinue that support, tacit though it may be, there will always be a problem.</P>
    <P>If we encouraged some form of North-South dialogue in our own lives and involved ourselves somehow in the day to day lives of northeners it would go some way towards solving the problem. <Col N="1007" /> If we give good example others in the North and in Britain may follow.  We, as Senator Honan said, are the ones moving from a position of strength so let us take the first step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great privilege for me to speak on this debate.  I listened to the debate all day and it is one of the few times I have heard knowledgeable and informed opinion on the Northern conflict. I wish to be associated with the remarks of those who condemned violence.  A solution is not possible without a just peace, bringing justice for all.</P>
      <P>People who know me will be aware that I come from a republican background of which I am proud.  My republicanism, however, does not lead me to condone the shooting or killing of innocent people; it is based on tolerance of other points of view and a plea for tolerance should be issued by the House today.  I was deeply moved by Senator Wilson's contribution.  If anybody possesses the qualities needed to solve the horrific situation in Northern Ireland it is somebody of Senator Wilson's calibre, with his message of reconciliation and forgiveness. We must all forgive and be reconciled with one another.</P>
      <P>I was slightly disturbed by some of the attacks on the Constitution.  The Irish Constitution of 1937 was enacted at a time of uncertainty regarding the final constitutional position of North and South.  Mr. de Valera and the members of the constitutional commission which drafted that Constitution after much thought inserted a number of articles to accommodate the Unionist point of view on Northern Ireland.  Anybody who reads the Constitution can see although Articles 2 and 3 state that the national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland that they are aspirational and are based on a peaceful reunification of the country.  No supporter of violence can say that the Irish Constitution endorses violence; nowhere does the Constitution state that violence is justifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Articles of the Constitution provide for the setting up of subsidiary parliaments. <Col N="1008" /> This was a very enlightened idea in 1937 enabling a subsidiary parliament to be established in Belfast, Cork, or Galway for instance with another parliament meeting elsewhere for the whole of Ireland.  I would not be as quick as some others to advocate setting aside the present Constitution and framing a new one.</P>
    <P>However, if it would enable us to resolve the conflict, I would favour the drafting of a new Constitution on which citizens of the Thirty-two Counties would vote.  A new Constitution should include a Bill of Rights which would protect the rights of all minorities, not only on ethnic grounds but also on religious and other grounds.  Such a solution would focus on the divergence within the community, from which we could all gain strength.</P>
    <P>Certain unionist politicians are saying they will talk if Articles 2 and 3 are removed.  If these Articles are removed, a whole group of people in Northern Ireland will be left nationless or stateless; they will become the Palestinians of Europe.  We have a duty to protect that minority, without alienating the majority.  If the point is put forcibly enough that the Irish Government and people do not condone violence and that the legal system and Constitution do not allow violence, then we can change attitudes.</P>
    <P>Many speakers mentioned integration in education.  As a disabled person, I have encountered certain kinds of prejudice.  I am not saying the prejudice I might face would be of the same magnitude as that faced by other people, especially those in Northern Ireland.  I believe that children are not guilty of prejudice; that comes from adults.  Integration at every level, from the beginning of a child's education, would help to break down many of the barriers and prejudices which are reinforced by adults from both sides of the community.</P>
    <P>Senator Wilson in his speech mentioned a very poignant prayer by St. Francis of Assisi.  Solving this problem will require a huge spiritual renewal among all people on this island and in Britain.  They must resolve to come to <Col N="1009" /> some peaceful arrangement which will help us live together</P>
    <P>This is a small island and the people living in the North and in the South suffer from the same kind of problems: unemployment, emigration and lack of housing. The major difference is that in Northern Ireland when you go to work you might get shot, or when you go out for a drink the pub might be blown up. However, people's difficulties are generally due to economics.  It is ludicrous that the British Government is subsidising Northern Ireland to the tune of £2,000 million a year and the Irish Government is spending another £1,000 million maintaining a Border which it does not want.</P>
    <P>Dr. Brian Feeney on RTE radio yesterday said that when the British army wanted to build a new checkpoint on the Border in Fermanagh, the Irish Army had to protect the builders from the Irish side of the Border.  It cost 76,000 manhours to protect people building a British army checkpoint which the local people on both sides of the Border, the Irish Government and the Irish people did not want.  If that money could be spent on renewing our national and cultural spirit, promoting reconciliation and bringing people closer together, much more could be achieved than the building of a checkpoint. It is quite apparent in certain segments of the media in Ireland and Britain that there is a general apathy in searching for a solution.  I am an optimist and I think we have to keep striving to find a solution.  I firmly believe that at some stage there will be a solution, but it will not be achieved unless we can all come together and decide what is best for the country as a whole, not just for individual groups.</P>
    <P>I commend the Tánaiste and the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs on their work in building bridges among the communities North and South.  There also seems to be a desire on the part of the British Government to solve the problem.  There is a tremendous amount of goodwill which can be harnessed.  It is the duty of us all to harness that good will for the betterment of humankind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> Violence only breeds violence.  If I kill somebody today, his brother will kill me tomorrow.  The tragedy is that it is continuing without an end.  Somebody has to call stop.  If the voice is loud enough from people of reason in Ireland &mdash; North and South &mdash; and in Britain, then the violence will stop.  I fully commend Senator Wilson on what he is trying to do.  I will be quite happy to give him whatever support I can, however small.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the Tánaiste has come to the Seanad today to discuss Northern Ireland and his remarks are very welcome.  I come from west Cork, the home place of Michael Collins, the place of his death by tragic means. Memorials at Crossbarry and Kilmichael testify to our fight for freedom and the civil war which wrecked this nation.  Many of the people who took part in those events in west Cork in the fight for freedom would be ashamed of what happened in Warrington recently.</P>
      <P>My message is for those who may be contemplating, and I hope that it does not go any further, planting bombs in the future and for those who give the orders. I would say to them to hold a photograph, like the one in the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, then they are planning these actions and say that such a child could be killed by the bomb they are ordering to be planted.  I would say to the people who claim they are acting under orders in planting bombs to look at that photograph and listen to the taped message of Mr. Parry, the father who spoke when his son's life support machine was switched off.  I ask the people who might detonate the bombs to do the same thing and think of the damage they have done, the lives they have taken and the heartbreak, they have caused to families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to get that message across to those people.  I know that politicians, North and South, and in Britain can work to bring about unity and peace in our country.  The politicians should be left to do this work and there should be an end to the planting of bombs and shootings such as occurred in the North today where three workmen were gunned down <Col N="1011" /> in their workplace.  The people of Ireland want peace, North and South, and the sooner the bombers realise that the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members of the House for their contributions to this debate and for their welcome to me to the Seanad.  I compliment the Leader of the House for providing time for this debate.  I am very glad to have had the opportunity to address the Seanad and listen to the remarks which have been made.</P>
      <P>I have listened with interest to the contributions. They have been very solid and, in the main, very helpful.  The message that came across very strongly is that there is deep concern among all political parties in the South in relation to the work that has to be done to find a solution and a lasting settlement to the conflict which affects this island.  We have been discussing this in the shadow of the terrible atrocity committed in Warrington some days ago.  This had a profound effect on all people on this island and across the water.  Within hours of today's discussion another atrocity was committed at Castlerock, County Derry.  The horror of these events underlines the urgency of finding ways to eradicate this evil and to build a future which will ensure lasting peace and prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of suggestions were made in the course of today's debate.  The Opsahl Commission has finished its work, other than to write its report, and it was suggested that the report should be debated. I would welcome such a debate at the earliest opportunity.  The Commission went about its work in a very diligent and efficient manner and it is important to show our appreciation for their work.  It can only help in our deliberations and thinking.  Senator Wilson also informed us that he is to meet the Provisional IRA and obviously he is doing that in his personal capacity.  I hope that they will learn from him, a man from whom we all have learned in the last number of years.  I hope the humanity that he has shown <Col N="1012" /> us will show those men of violence that nothing will be achieved by violence.  I wish more of us had the strength that Senator Wilson has shown in recent years.</P>
    <P>There have to be changes, both North and South.  This Government is committed as an overriding priority to meet the challenge confronting us.  Senator Manning in his contribution said that things are bleak.  Yes, things are bleak and there is a shadow over our proceedings, but we have to rise to the challenge. There has to be goodwill, tolerance, a respect for diversity and for traditions.  If we can show those qualities and have a constructive input from all concerned, we will reach our objective.</P>
    <P>It struck me during this debate that there are very different political views in this House, among the various parties and the Independents, but there was certainly a commonality of purpose.  Nobody could object to anything said in the House.  It is heartwarming from my point of view to realise there is understanding and determination on the part of all parties regarding the seriousness of the problems in Northern Ireland and of what those problems have been doing on this island, in Britian and in other parts of the world in recent years.</P>
    <P>We have to tackle those problems and be prepared to shake off the shackles of history.  That does not mean any disrespect for history.  We all know our historical background and the different historical background of the people with whom we seek dialogue and reconciliation. If we are inhibited by history as others are, we will achieve nothing. Reconciliation will require tolerance and it will mean our going a long way down the road.  Many people said today that we are in a position of strength and we have to show that.  More is expected of people coming from a position of strength than of those who are in a position of weakness.  We have to ensure that this is understood.</P>
    <P>The Government's position will be an active one.  I have said, from the day I assumed office, that Northern Ireland is a priority.  We cannot continue with the <Col N="1013" /> horrors of the last number of days and we cannot be other than active in our approach.  We cannot afford the luxury of standing back, stating our position and allowing events to take their course. There is an obligation on all politicians on this island, North and South, to reach out, to discuss the problems and to test fully any possibilities for agreement.</P>
    <P>In a short number of weeks, I have had three meetings with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  I believe there is determination on the part of both Governments to face up to the challenge and to work together to bring about the necessary solutions.</P>
    <P>Many comments were made here today in relation to exchanges between politicians North and South.  I am a firm believer in the work of the British-Irish Parliamentary tier.  Some people said, when it was set up, that it would be a talking shop.  Even if it is only a talking shop, it is a very necessary one.  People are now talking to one another who never spoke to each other in the past.  They are beginning to understand differences of view and different opinions.  It is very pleasing that Irish and British politicians who less than two years ago only talked across the television screens, with little diplomacy, are now able to sit in conference rooms in London, Dublin and Edinburgh &mdash; they will meet in Cork later this year &mdash; to discuss their differences. Let us break down the mutual incomprehension that has existed both on this island and between the islands.  If we can do that in a constructive manner and in a spirit of openness, then things will be achieved.  It will be difficult and we will all have to change if we are to achieve our objective.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the Government will be proactive in relation to these problems. It is extremely important that there is contact between political representatives and between all people on these islands.  Strong points were made today about the inadvisability of trying to impose a solution from the top.  I accept that.  It is important that at community and group levels, in sport, at the arts and cultural level and in business, <Col N="1014" /> that we forget about the Border and get on with living on this island.  If we succeed in doing that, it will make the political solution easier.</P>
    <P>This discussion has been constructive. There is an obvious desire among the Members of this House to contribute to the debate needed on this island.  I hope that all politicians, North and South, show the willingness that has been shown here.  It was said in the course of remarks that this is the first time in eight years there has been a discussion on the subject of Northern Ireland in the Seanad.  At times there has been some inhibition in opening up the debate on Northern Ireland but if today's healthy and constructive discussion established anything, it showed that politicians in the South take a very serious and concerned view of the difficulties on this island.  Since this discussion started, the Whips in the Dáil have agreed to a debate on Northern Ireland.  That will be helpful also.</P>
    <P>We have differences in terms of politics in the South, but today showed that because of the seriousness of the situation that confronts us, we all intend to work towards a solution.  It showed that we can overcome differences in our points of view.  Despite the gloom of recent days I am heartened by this debate and I shall continue my work, to which I am completely committed, because I do not believe any politician can do other than give a 100 per cent effort to bring about peace and reconciliation on this island.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.&mdash;In any case where a sentence has been imposed by the Court consisting of imprisonment or a fine or Community Service Order any decision made by the Minister pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, to commute or remit such sentence or any decision to release any person from custody pursuant to the law for the time being relating to temporary release orders made under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, shall be notified to the public by a notice published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> stating the following matters:</P>
      <P>(a)  the name of the person in respect of whom the decision is made;</P>
      <P>(b)  the sentence imposed on such person;</P>
      <P>(c)  the offence or offences in respect of which such sentence was imposed; and</P>
      <P>(d)  the extent by which the sentence was commuted or remitted, or in relation to a temporary release order the duration of any term of imprisonment actually served by the person prior to the commencement of such order.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill today has been introduced because of lenient sentences handed down by the courts and over the past number of weeks we have expressed our concern about this matter.  Under the present system the Minister for Justice can commute or reduce fines and sentences imposed by judges if they are seen <Col N="1016" /> to be too severe.  While there was a public outcry about recent cases, there will always be a public outcry against reducing certain sentences.  Judges impose sentences in open court and if they are seen to be too lenient they will be criticised.</P>
    <P>Since any sentence imposed by the courts is public knowledge, I cannot see how it would interfere with the privacy of the person if my amendment was accepted.  Many judges and lawyers and the Garda are annoyed that sentences can be reduced without the public being aware of it.  Many people, including Deputies and Senators make representations to the Minister.  I am not suggesting that this power should be taken from the Minister but, if a sentence is reduced it should be known to the public.  That is why I put down this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment in the name of Senator Honan refers to sentences of imprisonment or fines or community service orders, any decision to commute or remit those being published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  Members will be aware that Senators, like Deputies, county councillors and, other public representatives, get constant representations to apply to the Minister for Justice to petition to have a fine reduced. This happens in many cases.  Many of my constituents would be in prison if that power did not exist and was not exercised in a humane manner by the Minister.  If we were to use <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> to publish details of every fine, sentence and community service order that was remitted, we would require a separate issue to cover the multifarious details that would be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe it would serve any practical purpose.  That is the bottom line.  Even if there were not practical, logistical problems, I believe there is a general duty to preserve, as far as we can, the privacy of people once committed to custody.  These people already suffer a high degree of deprivation and stigmatisation and it would be contrary to all accepted international practice to add to <Col N="1017" /> that deprivation and stigmatisation by publishing lists on a monthly basis in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  I do not believe it would be just, as it would be an addition to the sentence imposed.  I do not see that any good objective could be achieved by publishing the list and, in any event, it would be impractical.</P>
    <P>I am disinclined to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister has said on what appears to be a lack of purpose with regard to this amendment.  Senator Honan has said its purpose is to address lenient sentencing. I would remind Senator Honan of the separation of powers; it is the function of the Judiciary to decide on sentencing and it is not something that we should interfere with.</P>
      <P>I object to the proposed amendment on the basis that it blacklists people.  It would publish a person's name, and that would be on the official records for life. People have a right to their good name. On conviction, they serve their sentence and that should be the end of the matter.</P>
      <P>The amendment suggests that there is a need to control the discretion of the Minister in areas where he may decide to commute or remit a sentence, but there is no evidence of this.  Therefore, this proposal is unnecessary.  In addition, it would add an administrative burden at great cost.  I believe it is impractical and unhelpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand to some extent why this amendment has been moved.  On a recent chat show somebody spoke about interference by Ministers in judicial decisions.  Over the years Members from all parties have made representations to various Ministers for Justice; I believe the decisions arrived at on foot of my representations were fair.  The only comment I would make is that on most occasions the Minister was not lenient enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people, particularly from the poorer sections of our community, who have been fined and have had a conviction recorded against them in court, <Col N="1018" /> have been through a traumatic experience. Some of them do not have the financial resources to appeal their case. Since they do not have the finances to have a barrister or a solicitor pursue an appeal in a higher court they take the option of asking their local public representative to petition the Minister for Justice to have the fine mitigated.</P>
    <P>With regard to petitioning the Minister for Justice, my understanding of the procedure is as follows: if a conviction has been recorded and an appeal made to the Minister for Justice, the Minister arranges that consultation takes place with the judge who made the decision. The District Court Clerk and the relevant garda are also contacted.  Each of these people report back to the Minister who then makes a decision with the advice of his staff.  That is how I understood the procedure to work and I think it has worked well.  The one complaint I would have with it is the length of time it takes. There are some experienced Department of Justice officials here who can advise the Minister of State on this aspect.  It takes a minimum of 12 to 15 months to pursue many of these procedures.</P>
    <P>I see a problem, however, with Senator Honan's amendment.  Somebody may be convicted of being drunk and disorderly and fined £200 and the details of the case are published in the local papers for all to see.  That person might give up drink and make an effort to rehabilitate himself, and then 12 or 15 months later the Minister's decision and the details of the case appear in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  Senator Gallagher made the point that the trauma of the conviction is suffering enough, and this is added to 12 or 15 months later with the publication of the Minister's decision, for example, to reduce the fine from £200 to £175, and extend the time for payment by three months.</P>
    <P>Although I understand the point of Senator Honan's amendment I would have reservations about it and I would ask her not to press the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>While the intention of the amendment is good, if it were accepted it would harm the families of <Col N="1019" /> people found guilty of offences and not necessarily the person who had been found guilty.  As Senator Enright said, there is usually some publicity in the wake of a conviction that may die down shortly afterwards.  However, with the subsequent publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> there might be further sensationalising of the case.  These cases may involve fines of perhaps £100 to £500 for offences relating to dog licences or TV licences.  For various reasons people fail to attend at court, and they, or their public representatives, end up petitioning the Minister. While it is the intention that a record would be kept of what exactly is happening in our justice system, if this amendment were accepted it might serve to stigmatise the family more than the person who had been found guilty.  Cases may be seized on again by the media and dealt with in the same way as inclusions in <i>Stubbs Gazette.</i></P>
      <P>We have legislation before us to deal with too lenient sentencing.  The focus of the debate in this House in previous weeks, and indeed yesterday, concerned sentences that are seen to be so lenient as to be an insult to the community at large and an insult to the victim of the crime.  I do not think this amendment is in keeping with the tone of the legislation we discussed recently.  The net effect of the amendment would be damaging for the families of people who have been convicted of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Gallagher talked about the independence of the Judiciary. I do not think that aspect is being called into question here.  These are decisions handed down by the Judiciary which are being appealed to the Minister.  I do not think that this power should be removed from the Minister but many gardaí and judges feel some disquiet that this could happen.  Many politicians have been critical recently, both in these Houses and in public, of decisions taken by the Judiciary.  At the same time, however, they are petitioning the Minister for Justice to have sentences or fines reduced without it being public knowledge.  Until <Col N="1020" /> this week I did not know that one could petition the Minister to have sentences commuted or to have fines reduced.</P>
      <P>I accept that embarrassment can be caused to families but these matters are public knowledge and if people were concerned about them they would pay their fines and would not appeal them.  There may be some people who just decide as a matter of form to petition the Minister simply because they can take that action. They go to their local TD or public representative and petition the Minister.</P>
      <P>Senator Enright talked about waiting 12 months to have a fine of £200 reduced to £175 and getting an extra three months to pay.  If somebody is going to pay £175, surely they would pay £200 rather than go through this process and have the result published.  We must be consistent.  If we decide we can be critical of judges when they impose lenient sentences, we must be aware that they may equally be critical of us for trying to have sentences reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand and support the spirit of what Senator Honan is saying.  She wants to have more openness and transparency in the operation of the criminal justice system.  I have problems with the publication of court cases in the local press; in most cases this is of more concern to the people involved than the fine or the sentence itself.  While I agree with transparency, that everything should be open to the public, to be seen to be fair, I have problems with the way the local press sometimes publish cases. I do not know if this can be examined or controlled in any way.  Nobody wants to be accused of curbing the freedom of the press, but the publicity sometimes given to small fines is disproportionate to the offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our justice system must be seen to operate fairly.  Senator Honan is saying there is a procedure whereby fines or sentences are changed which is not transparent or open to scrutiny by the public; the thinking behind the amendment is worthwhile in that respect.  Whether this process should be published in the press is another matter, but there is no reason <Col N="1021" /> it should not be available for inspection by the public, if they so wish.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand anybody saying the amendment proposes to limit the discretion of the Minister to reduce fines or sentences.  In my view, the amendment, expressly wants to lend transparency to the whole area of changing sentences or fines and in that respect it is worthwhile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Neville has put his finger on the main point.  I do not think there is any need to have a greater degree of transparency in the system.  It is quite transparent already to a degree that makes Senator Neville and, at times, myself unhappy.  I understand there is no way we can control how these matters are reported in the local press.  If an article is published to the embarrassment of the accused and a fine or prison sentence is later imposed which the Minister decides subsequently to commute, no great purpose is served by a further publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Honan raised a question in relation to Senator Enright's example of a £200 fine which was reduced to £175. She asked quite reasonably why one would go through a rigmarole to have a fine reduced to £175 a year later when one could have paid £200 in the first instance.  A person petitioning the Minister does not know what the ultimate outcome will be.  A significant reduction could be made.  More importantly, in my own constituency people come to me to petition a fine in order to delay collection. We have to face the fact that 300,000 people are unemployed.  A large number of people depend on social welfare payments and to such persons £200 or even £20 is a great deal of money to pay at one time.  When people come to ask me about petition procedure, I say that I will petition the Minister for Justice who may reduce the fine but I advise them to put some money aside each week in case of a refusal.  Without a petition procedure a fine would be collected immediately and a person who could not come up with the money would be imprisoned.  Prisons would overflow; we would have to build <Col N="1022" /> new ones.  The situation would be quite ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Enright about the length of time that petitions can take.  A couple of years ago it took an enormous length of time.  The advantage there is that people have longer to put the money together.  However, there is a down side also.  I recall, in the mid-1980s, petitioning a case to the Minister for Justice in relation to a £100 fine imposed on somebody in 1985 and getting a letter in 1987 saying that the fine had been reduced to £90.  It came as a great shock to the person who approached me in the first place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why the Minister did so well in the 1987 election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The period has been reduced.  I want to clarify one point. When somebody approaches me, I am in the same position as any other Senator or TD.  I have to send my petition to the Minister for Justice as well.  I have had some results from petitions to the present Minister for Justice, as have some of my colleagues on the backbenches and she has been in office only a couple of months.  That would indicate that the time period has been reduced considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It also shows that there must be a big increase in the staff in the Minister's office.  Take the example of a married man with a family, serving a two year prison sentence who has already served about 12 months.  His wife goes to a Senator, a TD or a Minister and asks for her husband to be released for three days over the Christmas period &mdash; until St. Stephen's Day.  I am not speaking about people who were sentenced for crimes such as armed robbery, malicious injury, assaults or serious crimes because normally the Minister would not even consider a petition in those circumstances and most public representatives would not make representations on their behalf. I am referring to people who were found guilty of petty crime.  In most instances the Department and the Minister have <Col N="1023" /> allowed those people home for Christmas.  Because of the number of representations made it would be impractical to publish all the names in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
      <P>I referred to fines being reduced from £200 to £175 but I have seen instances where the fine was written off.  The existing system has worked reasonably well and is fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he advises many of the people who come to him to appeal in order to extend the time to pay the fine.  There must be some other procedure, especially in the District Court, where people could pay the fine over a period or by instalment.  People should not have to go to their local representative to petition the Minister. There must be some other method that could be arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>We have asked on numerous occasions for the examination of the payment of fines by instalment or by other methods.  That would overcome many of the difficulties.  It must be accepted that within the criminal justice system the courts and their decisions are open to public scrutiny.  The subsequent decision of the Minister is private, and unknown.  This amendment proposes to allow the public to scrutinise such decisions because they are closely related to and follow on from the decision of the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with Senator Honan's point.  I would favour an instalment arrangement.  It would make my life and public representatives' lives generally a lot easier.  The reason the demands from all sides of the political divide for an instalment arrangement have been resisted is that a great deal of Garda time and effort go into collecting fines.  If instalment arrangements were allowed, the administrative burden on the Garda, who should not be doing this type of work, would be increased out of proportion.  The gardaí in Limerick have told me they put many man hours into collecting fines <i>per se</i> when the time for <Col N="1024" /> payment ultimately comes.  They could not imagine the horror of collection if an instalment arrangement was introduced. A person will pay their instalments for two or three weeks, then if an instalment is missed the Garda would have to chase them for the next instalment, and this could be repeated a number of times. That would make the collection of fines administratively very difficult.</P>
      <P>I will put the suggestion to the Minister for Justice again and I hope we will have a better system where people can pay over a period rather than the informal instalment arrangement we have at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;the Act of 1981&rsquo; means the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 reads as follows:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6.&mdash;(1)  On conviction of any person of an offence to which section 5 applies, in addition to dealing with him in any other way, the court may prohibit such person at any future date from attending at or near to or entering any place in which the person in respect of whom such offence was committed resides or is in employment and from using or threatening to use violence against, molesting or putting in fear the person in respect of whom such <Col N="1025" /> offence was committed or any member of such persons family.</P>
    <P>(2)  An order made pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall be treated as if it were a barring order made under the Act of 1981 and section 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Act of 1981 shall apply to such order.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that victims of sexual or violent offences are protected from revenge attack when the offender has completed his sentence.  Too many victims are afraid to bring such matters to the attention of the gardaí and to give evidence in court. The offender is, in most cases, a family member, a power figure in the victim's life.  The victim in the Kilkenny incest case, a person who has suffered dreadfully, is in fear of her life when her father is released from prison.  She believes that both she and her mother will be subjected to further violence.</P>
    <P>The objective of this amendment is to give the court discretion when sentencing the perpetrator of such vile offences to place a barring order on the convicted person, thus preventing contact with the victim in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter will be examined and if feasible will be included in the next criminal justice legislation to be brought forward.  I sympathise with the object of this amendment.  Victims of sexual or physical abuse are often concerned that when the person convicted of the crime is released from prison he or she may look for revenge.  They live in constant fear of this.  If the convicted person assaults the victim or threatens to do so he can be charged with the appropriate offence.  However, the offender's mere presence in the neighbourhood may be sufficient to intimidate a victim.  This is particularly so when the perpetrator of the crime and the victim live in the same area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the offender is released from prison, the victim may encounter him every day and this can be stressful.  The proposed amendment recommends that the court, when passing sentence, could <Col N="1026" /> in addition to any prison sentence impose the equivalent of a barring order.  On the prisoner's release he would be barred from coming into contact with the victim in her place of employment or residence. If he breached the order he could be arrested immediately by the gardaí and charged with an offence.  This proposal has some attractions and is worth exploring further.  However, there are a number of practical problems which must be worked out.</P>
    <P>Care must be taken to ensure that the person who has served his sentence and reformed is not subject to further constraints on his freedom.  If a person is sentenced to seven years' imprisonment it would seem odd for the sentencing court to impose a barring order which would not come into effect until a time when circumstances may have changed. By the time the prisoner has been released he may pose no threat to the victim and the victim may no longer feel in jeopardy.  How will the court know where the victim will be living in seven years' time?  A blanket order would be unjust as the prisoner might, unwittingly, bump into the victim and thereby be liable to arrest.  These are some of the points that will have to be considered before any definite decisions can be made.</P>
    <P>Officials at the Department of Justice have been asked to examine this matter in detail and, if appropriate, suitable statutory provision will be introduced in the next criminal justice legislation to be introduced.  I cannot justify delaying the passage of the Bill until this work has been completed and I am not accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the intention behind this amendment.  Senator Neville wants an injunction or some other protection to be included in this legislation so that the victim will be protected from further interference by the offender.  This is worth while and necessary, in many instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the wording of this amendment.  This is not the area in which it should be included and it warrants further <Col N="1027" /> discussion.  The High Court has this power under the Judicature Act, 1877, although it is limited.</P>
    <P>The amendment imposes civil punishment in criminal proceedings.  That is a serious matter.  After the court has convicted and sentenced the offender, a civil punishment is imposed.  This amendment is broadly phrased and wide-ranging but I wonder if it is practical?  I agree with the Minister regarding what would happen when the offender is released.</P>
    <P>I agree with the intent of this amendment but I have difficulty with the wording. It needs further consideration.  This is not the time to include such a provision in our legislation and for that reason, I ask Senator Neville to withdraw the proposed amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the sentiments behind Senator Neville's amendment but it would be difficult to implement.  If a person is sentenced to seven years, how will the court know where the victim will be living when the offender is released?  If the victim was a member of the itinerant community, how would this provision be enforced?  The Minister pointed out that if the perpetrator of the crime accidentally bumped into the victim he would be liable for prosecution.  This amendment is not practicable and I hope it will not be pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister accepts the spirit of this amendment. However, he claims it would be unworkable. Too many people who are subjected to sexual and violent abuse are afraid to bring that information to the notice of the Garda.  The law should be seen to protect them.  If they are aware that they can be protected, indefinitely, from this violence they will be more inclined to come forward with information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand the problem in relation to where the victim resides.  The barring order would apply wherever the victim resided or was employed.  If circumstances change there is a facility to <Col N="1028" /> apply to have barring orders lifted.  That would overcome such a problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said he will bring this forward in the next piece of legislation. The experience of this House is that such promises are usually delayed.  We must deal with sexual abuse and ensure that people feel fully protected when they come forward to give information to gardaí or give evidence in court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Neville's amendment.  This Criminal Justice Bill was initatied as a result of public outrage at the lenient sentences handed down by the courts.  The victim in the Kilkenny incest case fears her father's release from prison.  The desire to protect such victims lies behind this amendment.</P>
      <P>We talked about our outrage and rushed through legislation because we felt it should be available if needed.  I welcome the commitment of the Minister for Justice in her speech yesterday that this is one of an envisaged series of proposals for the criminal justice system.  We are prepared to go so far, but we are not prepared to do all that we should.  We rant and rave and then, when we have an opportunity to go as far as many of us feel is necessary, we do not take that course.</P>
      <P>The public are of the opinion that we will rush legislation through when an outrage occurs but then we leave more to be done and it will be years before it is looked at again.  I would fail the women of Ireland if I did not support this amendment.</P>

The amendment refers to the place where a person resides or is in employment, but that only takes into account a small part of a person's life.  It does not include a place of entertainment where a person would regularly socialise and could be intimidated.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that the wording of the amendment is probably not correct and it does not achieve the objective I spoke about yesterday.  I would be surprised if there were not some Members in the House who would consider the amendment unconstitutional and an infringement of civil liberties.  In order to achieve the objective referred to by Members we must be sure that an amendment to legislation will be effective. This provision probably could not be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the last two and a half lines of the amendment which state: &ldquo;...from using or threatening to use violence against, molesting or putting in fear the person in respect of whom such offence was committed.&rdquo;  I presume people who are exposed to that can immediately seek recourse under existing <Col N="1030" /> legislation.  It does not require going through the court procedure all over again.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) refers specifically to victim impact.  Is there not a provision that when the report on victim impact is given to the judge the prosecution would ask that what this amendment seeks to achieve would be imposed?  The wording would not get us what we want.</P>

      <P>Although it is obvious that there is support for the intent of this amendment, it should be emphasised that it is imposing a civil punishment in criminal proceedings.  It would not stand up in court and would be open to challenge. On that basis alone the wording of the amendment is impracticable.  While the intention is worthy of full consideration at a later stage, I object to its being thrown in, in this fashion, at this point. On that basis I ask Senator Neville to withdraw the amendment.</P>

Far be it from me to tell the Minister how to conduct business, but if the Government agrees with the intention of an amendment but believes that the phrasing is incorrect there is a noble tradition that the Minister, on Report Stage, introduces an appropriate amendment to effect the required changes.  That solves the problem.</P>
      <P>The Government cannot have it everyway; it agrees with the amendment and supports it, or agrees with it but changes the wording and then supports it, or it votes against it.  Even though I have not moved the amendment, I intend to call for a vote on it.</P>

      <P>They were words to that effect.  This House has an opportunity to amend legislation.  If the amendment is carried, the legislation returns to the Lower House to be approved.</P>
      <P>On close examination of section 5 I believe that the amendment is essential. Section 5 states:</P>
      <P>In determining the sentence to be imposed on a person for an offence to which this section applies, a court shall taken into account, and may, where necessary, receive evidence or submissions concerning, any effect (whether long term or otherwise) of the offence on the person in respect of whom the offence was committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat the words: &ldquo;any effect whether long term or otherwise&rdquo;.  One effect the offence can have on the injured party is trauma and worry that the offender will return on release from prison and commit the offence again.  That fear was evident in the victim of the Kilkenny incest case. The girl had her fingers smashed with a lump hammer; her ribs driven in with a steel bar and a leather strap with metal studs was used on her body.  In that type of offence, no matter where the girl goes, there will be a genuine fear that this abuse may recur.  Any person who commits that type of offence has an underlying mental <Col N="1032" /> problem.  I cannot see how seven years in prison or any sort of treatment would change such an individual or how he could be rehabilitated.  The only thing bullies fear is retribution and the only retribution society can impose at present is prison.</P>
    <P>Under this section, a judge can commit a person to prison for between seven and 20 years.  I see no difficulty in incorporating in the judge's order a stipulation that the person be prevented from going near or entering the residence or the place of employment of the victim.</P>
    <P>In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> last week it was said that some of this legislation is piecemeal.  There has been too much piecemeal legislation in codifying our criminal law procedures.  In this instance I accept the goodwill of Members on the other side of the House and I think they would be anxious to see if Senator Neville's amendment could be changed and perhaps improved.  I would be happy if that could be done.  If somebody wishes to propose an amendment we will certainly consider it.  The Bill has gone through this House in a great spirit of goodwill on all sides and we are anxious to ensure it would incorporate the spirit of what Senator Neville has in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Kelly was concerned that we were talking about a person who was innocent.  We are talking about this section being applied to somebody on conviction.  They would be sentence to a period in prison and the barring order would come into effect after their release.  This could be decided in court when the case is being heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said yesterday that this Bill was victim-oriented.  We all agree that for too long the victim was the last person to get priority.  I think this amendment is victim-oriented.  Senators on the other side of the House have talked about imposing on the civil liberties of the defendant.  Again, we all said that for too long it seemed the only person we were concerned about was the defendant.  The victims in these cases felt they had been forgotten.  I thought this Bill was to help <Col N="1033" /> victims.  This section would be of great benefit to victims.  As Senator O'Toole said, if the Government have a problem with this they can come back on Report Stage and have it changed to something they believe is workable.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment.  It is hypocritical to say you support various measures, as was said on Second Stage, and then vote against this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Gallagher, I dislike the idea of mixing civil and criminal law.  There are no precedents for it and I think it will inevitably get us into trouble, although when we consider this situation, we may have to do that to some extent.</P>
      <P>Basically, the amendment proposes to allow a judge discretion to decide now what a person's conduct will be in seven, ten or 12 years.  There have to be logical objections to that.  The present barring order legislation, barring a person from his home, is a serious sanction.  Let nobody doubt that, even though it comes from civil law.  A barring order is based on a person's conduct at the time.  If a person is violent or showing violent tendencies and his wife takes him to the District Court.  The court will look at his conduct in the immediate past and decide that person should be put out of the house.  This amendment would give judges the right to decide what this person's conduct is likely to be in seven or ten years' time.  Barring a person from his house in seven or ten years' time is a considerable sanction.  Instinctively I dislike that.</P>
      <P>This amendment is proposing a new form of criminal sentence, that is the mixing of the civil and criminal law.  In addition to allowing a judge to impose the usual type of sentence by way of fine, community service order or prison sentence, this would allow a judge with criminal jurisdiction to apply another sentence, namely, a future barring order which will come into effect when the person leaves prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission produced a very detailed consultation paper on sentencing this morning.  One definitive <Col N="1034" /> proposal made was that there be no new form of sentencing introduced, particularly a form of sanction which has its origin in the civil law.  The father of the unfortunate victim in the Kilkenny case is now in prison and she fears for her life and her safety when he comes out.  It is said that if we do not change the law on the lines suggested in this amendment, such people will remain fearful even while their relatives are in prison.  It is also said that if we do not accept this amendment, that fear will be dissipated.  That is not reality.</P>
    <P>If a person comes out of prison, such as the father in the Kilkenny case, and he wants to perpetrate violence against the victim or take his revenge, a change in the law to apply an extra sanction, apart from this criminal sanction there already, is not going to stop him.  Take, for example, the person convicted in the Kilkenny case.  He is now languishing in prison and if, as he lies in his bunk, he is plotting some terrible revenge on his unfortunate daughter when he comes out, is he going to say that if he carries out this revenge he will probably be sent back to prison for the rest of his days?  If we accept this amendment he is going to say tomorrow night that he can now be barred from the house, that the judge can issue a barring order against him and that he is going to stop me, therefore I cannot do it anymore?  If a person breaks a barring order they can be arrested without warrant.  If a person breaks the criminal law they can be arrested, tried and put in prison.  An extra sanction is not going to stop him.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole said that if Government Senators find something wrong in the wording, they should change it and accept it on Report Stage.  I prefer to simplify things but there is no point in reducing something to the simplistic, and that is what is being done here.  It is not a question of difficulty with the wording, but of a number of logistical difficulties which I will mention.</P>
    <P>We have to decide on our approach to this amendment.  The suggestion was first made by Deputy Shatter in a Dáil amendment. It would represent a fundamental <Col N="1035" /> change in our legal system.  We have had a fortnight to consider it, but I am afraid it will require more time.  Drawing from my experience, there are many ways in which we could tackle it. One would be to introduce a modified form of this proposal, even though it would involve mixing civil and criminal law.  Some provision will have to be written in to the effect that it can be applied only in very exceptional cases.  Maybe we would have to specify the circumstances.  It would impose a sanction at some time in the future.  We will have to lay out the parameters within which that sanction can be applied if we are to follow this route.</P>
    <P>An alternative would be to extend the barring order legislation of 1981, to allow a victim or a potential victim to apply for a barring order just before the person is released from prison.  The decision would be based on his likely conduct at the time the barring order is applied for.  If we take that approach, we have a number of logistical problems.  What should the procedure be in telling the victim when the person is coming out of prison?  What kind of notice should be given to the court?</P>
    <P>Another possible approach I suggested in the Dáil debate is to create a separate offence of molestation or annoying of the victim.  Senator McGennis asked if a person who is molested in a public place can have immediate recourse to the law. The answer is no.  As the law stands, it will have to be reported to the gardaí, who will decide whether an assault has taken place.  This difficulty should be overcome if we had a separate offence of molesting the victim.</P>
    <P>One can support the spirit of reforming legislation but we have to find the most logical and practical way of framing it. We also have to overcome the many difficulties I can foresee.  I hope Senators will accept my word that I am committed to doing something in this area.  I am not convinced from what I have heard so far that this amendment as drafted, is necessarily the best way of dealing with this difficult and delicate problem.</P>

      <P>We are putting this amendment forward sincerely and we believe in the contents and the wording. We did not just throw it in.  It is a genuine effort by the Opposition to improve the legislation.  In the previous Seanad, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Independents successfully amended legislation. It is the role of the Opposition to try to improve legislation.  The suggestion that we just throw in amendments is disingenuous, to say the least.  We are sincere about this and I would like to allay Senator Kelly's problems in this regard.</P>
      <P>It is not practicable to have a barring order blocking a person from anywhere because the two individuals concerned could meet in any social setting by accident. It would apply to the home and the place of employment and prevent the offender from using, or theatening to use any violence against, molesting or scaring the person in respect of whom the offence was committed.  This covers areas outside of their employment and home.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the threat of imprisonment is the best deterrent.  They would know that after committing an offence, they could be prevented in law from entering their home for up to 20 years after release from prison.  These offences are of such magnitude that it is mind-boggling. In rural Ireland, if this was done to an animal, local people would take their own measures against the perpetrator. In the past, people would not tolerate cruelty to any sort of life.  We in these Houses have the power to change the law and we should use it.  If a person is sentenced to seven years' imprisonment and is then able to return to the home, the family members could be put in jeopardy. We should try to ensure that this does not happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 31 and 32, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) This Act may apply to sentences imposed on persons convicted since 1st January, 1993.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During the course of discussion on the Kilkenny case last month people wanted to know why the State could not reflect their wishes and appeal against the sentence. The reason was that the legislation had been put on hold during the election process and, unfortunately, the Government decided that the Dáil would not sit during January.  Consequently, this legislation did not come before the Dáil until a later date.  It is now before this House, but it is too late to apply to that case.  We should change this legislation so that the State can deal effectively with cases such as the Kilkenny case, or others which might arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment states that this legislation may apply to persons convicted since 1 January, 1993.  I recognise that another section of the Bill requires that an application be made within 28 days from the day on which the sentence is imposed.  We should change the legislation so that it will apply from the current year.  The amendment reflects what <Col N="1039" /> everybody said was necessary when we were discussing it a month ago.  It is a simple amendment which does not create any conflict or difficulty and I hope the Minister will be pleased to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Roche on this point.  Senator O'Toole is seeking to apply a law retrospectively. There are constitutional constraints which would jeopardise the Bill.  A convicted person has the right to know that procedures are in place and are not open to question.  While I sympathise with the reason for its introduction, namely, to deal with cases like the Kilkenny case, I believe it cannot be implemented because it applies retrospectively and would be unconstitutional.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>One would have to look at the case law and the Fundamental Rights Articles in the Constitution.  A good reference book is <i>Fundamental Rights in the Irish Law and Constitution</i> by the late John M. Kelly.  When Senator O'Toole indicated his intention yesterday on Second Stage to table this amendment, the Government sought advice from the Attorney General, who advises the Government on the constitutionality of legislation.  He advised that it is almost certainly unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>Article 15.5 of the Constitution provides that &ldquo;the Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission&rdquo;.  While this amendment does not conflict directly with that provision in the Constitution, it does conflict with the generally accepted legal principle that penal legislation should not apply retrospectively.  The effect of the amendment would be unfair.  It would cause injustice and would be open to the challenge that it is in conflict with the rights of the accused as provided for in other Articles of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Legislation must not conflict with the exact provisions of the Fundamental Rights Articles of the Constitution. There is a large body of natural rights derived from the interpretation of the courts of the Fundamental Rights Articles 40 to 44.  Looking at case law and the rights that have been developed, the Attorney General feels, as I do, that we would be in severe constitutional difficulties if we were to accept this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such a right, which caused much controversy in practice, arose from the case of the <i>People v. O'Callaghan,</i> in 1966 where the Supreme Court decided that a person would have to be granted bail in certain circumstances.  The entitlement to bail was based on a natural right which the Supreme Court deduced <Col N="1041" /> O'Callaghan had from Articles 40 to 44, even though the specific point is not dealt with in the Constitution.  The Constitution cannot cover every situation.</P>
    <P>Another example of how this amendment would operate relates to a person convicted on, say, 2 January and sentenced to two months' imprisonment.  If this amendment were accepted, the DPP could bring that person back before the courts on the basis that the sentence was inadequate, even though it would have been completed.  I do not think that would be fair, right or constitutional.</P>

      <P>Although the person would have served his sentence, the DPP could bring him back before the court seeking a sentence.  That would be unfair and unconstitutional.  It conflicts directly with natural justice and the civil rights of citizens which have been deduced from the interpretation by the Supreme Court of Articles 40 to 44 of the Constitution. Criminal law legislation must be made victim-oriented and although we were all shocked and horrified by high profile cases, like the two Kilkenny cases, we must maintain a certain balance.  We cannot trample on civil liberties or constitutional rights in our efforts to redress the balance, in other words, we cannot go too far in the other direction.  Our advice is that that would be unconstitutional and I cannot take the responsibility of having legislation passed which would, ultimately, be found to be unconstitutional, particularly when I have been clearly advised that would be the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refute some of the arguments that have been made on this issue.  For the Minister to use the words &ldquo;almost certainly&rdquo; is as useful as saying &ldquo;completely empty&rdquo;.  There is no such thing as &ldquo;almost certainly&rdquo;.  The Minister began by saying &ldquo;almost certainly&rdquo;<Col N="1042" /> and ended by saying it was unconstitutional. It is my view, on advice I have taken that it may be challenged.  Under the Constitution legislation may be challenged. If the Attorney General's advice was that the amendment is unconstitutional, the Minister would have stated this in his first sentence, but he did not do so.  He said and I quote, &ldquo;almost certainly&rdquo; and &ldquo;it may be in conflict&rdquo;.  I know it may be in conflict.  It cost me £3 million in a village in west Cork to find out that the words in the Constitution and the operation of the law do not have to match precisely.  So I am very well aware of the difficulties that can arise.</P>
      <P>I can cite examples of retrospective legislation which have been approved in this House.  A few months ago the Minister introduced retrospective legislation to copperfasten the legality of sentences passed by a member of the Judiciary who was incorrectly appointed.  Section 9 of the Companies Act, was enacted as separate legislation to deal with the Goodman case in retrospect.  The purpose of last years Pensions Act was to deal in retrospect with the problem of orders which had not been made by Ministers.</P>
      <P>In relation to this Bill the Minister spoke of somebody having to be dragged through the courts after having served their sentence.  I would advise him to read the Bill again.  The Bill says that a review of sentences should take place within 28 days of the sentence being imposed by the court.  It is possible that someone could be on remand for nine months, receive a sentence of ten months or a year, be given remission and not have to serve any time and within 28 days &mdash; in the Minister's words &mdash; they would have to be dragged through the court all over again.  Let us call a spade a spade.  These things happen.  There is a case in front of the Minister and a proposal to deal with it.  As in the case of the last amendment, the Minister may oppose it for specific reasons but it is not in contravention of natural justice.  If there is any principle or rule of natural justice or a point of common law to which the Minister is referring, let us hear what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Article of <Col N="1043" /> the Constitution under which, I freely concede, it could well be challenged, just as any legislation passed in this House might be challenged under an appropriate part of the Constitution.  That is the purpose of the Constitution.  This amendment is not unconstitutional.  It may be tested in the Supreme Court, or it would be open to the President to refer it to the Supreme Court for decision as to whether it is constitutional.  This is a valid amendment, it allows the will of the people to be reflected in legislation and I commend it to the House.  I ask the Minister to support it.</P>

      <P>On a point of information, I am talking about somebody who may be held on remand for, say, six or seven months and is given a sentence of, say six months.  If the State considers the sentence to be too lenient, the State <Col N="1044" /> has 28 days to appeal it.  However, the sentence may be completed and the person released because the time on remand will be taken into consideration. If the sentence is reviewed, the whole procedure will have to be gone through again.</P>

      <P>There is a difference which the Senator might not accept but which I can see.  None of the examples of retrospective legislation the Senator mentioned, such as the Companies Bill and the appointment of a judge, dealt with criminal legislation; it is unconstitutional to pass retrospective criminal legislation. The Senator quoted me as saying that the amendment was &ldquo;almost certainly&rdquo; unconstitutional.  I used the word &ldquo;almost&rdquo; because nothing is certain in law, nothing is unconstitutional until the Supreme Court says it is.  Law is not an exact science.</P>
      <P>I want to clarify for the House the advice I have received from the Attorney General is that the Supreme Court would strike this down as being unconstitutional, if it were challenged, whether you use the words &ldquo;almost certainly&rdquo;, &ldquo;certainly&rdquo; or whatever.</P>

    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Notwithstanding any rule of law or practice to the contrary, it shall be lawful for the prosecutor or Counsel for the prosecutor to address any court which is about to impose sentence, on the nature and severity of such sentence.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When a verdict has been given in a case it is normal for a defence counsel to address the judge as to what sentence he or she feels should be imposed or whether some mitigating circumstances should be taken into account.  It is usual practice for people to give references in the case of the defendant.  There is no provision for the DPP, for counsel for the DPP or for counsel for the victim to address the court before sentence is imposed.  It was said yesterday that the purpose of this Bill is to allow an appeal by the DPP if it was felt that the sentence was too lenient.  This amendment should be accepted because it would allow the judge to hear from the DPP what sentence he or she felt should be imposed.  It would give the judge an indication if certain circumstances should be taken into account or that if a short sentence was imposed there was the likelihood that it would be appealed.  It would reduce the number of appeals under this Bill.  For that reason I propose the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two problems with this amendment.  First, it would give the prosecution yet another chance to present their case before the court.  They already have had the opportunity to do so and the judge would have given a verdict of guilty or not guilty at this stage. It is supposed to relate to the severity of the sentence only.  Acceptance of the amendment would give the prosecution a second bite of the cherry to which they are not entitled.  I object to it on that account.</P>
      <P>Secondly and more importantly, the code of conduct of the Bar allows for counsel for the prosecution to address the court in this fashion; it is simply a matter of practice or procedure that the Bar does not do so at the moment.  It would merely be a matter for the Bar Council to revise their rules in light of this legislation if they felt it was necessary.  In other words, this right already exists in law.  The Bar has simply decided not to practice it.  It is a rule of code and a change of code is all that is required to provide what Senator Honan seeks to introduce in this area.  Therefore, the amendment is unnecessary; it is already lawful and it is simply a matter for the Bar Council to rectify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Gallagher said that this amendment would give the prosecution a second bite of the cherry.  Does she not accept that there is a provision that the defence counsel can address the judge?  Are they not getting a second bite of the cherry?  Surely what is acceptable for one side should be acceptable for the other.  I understand that plea bargaining already takes place.  The judge is aware that this happens in many cases and this might be the reason some sentences appear lenient.  It was said earlier that one might not be aware of all the facts of <Col N="1047" /> a case and that having gone through a case the judge would be aware that in certain cases plea bargaining had taken place.  It was suggested that this is the reason some lenient sentences are given. If the prosecution or counsel for the DPP were allowed to address the court, all of this would come out into the open and our system of justice would be transparent. One of the problems in this country is that the public is not aware of certain procedures that take place and, as a result, reacts in a certain way.  If defence counsel is permitted to do this I cannot understand why the prosecution cannot adopt the same course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Gallagher has stated that to accept this amendment would present the prosecution with a second bite of the cherry.  She then said that it is legal to do so and that it is merely a matter of practice in the Bar that this course is not taken.  My amendment provides that a representative of the victim should have an opportunity to give the other side of the case when submissions are made for lenient sentencing.  I have no problem with challenging the code of conduct of the Bar on this issue; as, indeed, the Minister does not have any problem with wigs and gowns being worn by members of the Bar.  I was glad to hear him say yesterday that he will look at that matter again.  In fact, the Bar has a dress committee organised to examine this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between the code of practice here and the dress code.  I accept that at present it is not general practice for prosecuting counsel to address the judge on the question of sentencing.  However, there is no rule of law against it.  The advice I have received from the Attorney General is that there is certainly no constitutional objection to it.  At this stage, therefore, there is no need to write it into law if it is the law already.  As Senator Gallagher said, it is the code of practice of the Bar not to avail of this.  To my knowledge it has been availed of in one or two exceptional cases but, generally speaking, is <Col N="1048" /> not and probably there are good reasons for that.</P>
      <P>I consider the most prudent course of action is to see how the matter evolves in practice once the Bill comes into force. It may transpire in the light of the provisions of this Bill that the courts themselves will address the matter and issue general guidelines as to when it would be helpful for the prosecuting counsel to intervene on the question of sentencing, or in particular cases the judge might ask the prosecuting counsel to give his or her views on the issue of sentencing.</P>
      <P>It should also be borne in mind that any need for an input by the prosecuting counsel would be reduced by two of the provisions in this Bill.  First, the sentencing judge will now have to take into account the effect the offences had on the victim.  This will undoubtedly influence the judge's decision on the sentence to be imposed and balance any plea for mitigation made by defence counsel.  Secondly, the sentencing judge will be aware that the DPP may appeal any sentence imposed and he or she will have to take that into account when passing sentence. Anybody with experience of the courts knows that judges do not like being overruled by a higher court.  These two measures will act as a counterweight to any intervention by the defence on the question of sentencing.  In practice it may happen that there will be no need to involve the prosecuting counsel.</P>
      <P>May I say to Senator Neville that when this Bill becomes law, the victim or any representative the victim wishes to bring in will be able to make representations and will be able to address the court directly on the question of sentencing in view of the effect of the crime on the victim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also conscious that the Law Reform Commission today published a consultation paper on sentencing policy. Their final recommendation could have a major impact on the role of the prosecuting counsel in sentencing policy and I prefer to await their final recommendation before addressing this issue. I make the point that it is regrettable, through no fault of our own, that we did <Col N="1049" /> not have this very detailed consultation paper on sentencing policy before we introduced this legislation as it was published only this morning.  I quote for Senator Honan's benefit from page 380 of the Law Reform Commission's consultation paper on sentencing:</P>
    <P>We provisionally recommend that prosecution counsel be permitted at the sentencing stage to make submissions to the court not just on the facts of the case, but also on relevant legal principles and precedents.  We do not recommend that he or she make specific submissions on the appropriateness of a particular sentence.</P>
    <P>In the light of that and of other provisions in the Bill, I prefer to leave this issue for the moment.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (2), line 14, to delete &ldquo;28&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;60&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have been advised that 28 days would not be sufficient in all cases to bring forward a claim under the Bill for increasing lenient sentences.  I would like the Minister to comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the proposed amendment, 28 days is sufficient to allow certainty of the law on the one hand and justice for the convicted person on the other hand.  Twenty eight days is sufficient time for the paperwork to go through in order to allow the DPP time to decide as to whether the sentence should be reviewed.  At the same time, it gives the convicted person certainty as to their sentence and that is only fair.  There is another point to be made in relation to this.  The period of 28 days is in line with the general right to appeal in all criminal cases.  I believe there is no reason in this legislation to introduce a 60 days right where 28 days is the norm.  On that basis <Col N="1050" /> I ask Senator Neville to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The 28 day period corresponds with the period in the British legislation.  I refer Senator Neville to paragraph 1 of Schedule 3 of the UK Criminal Justice Act, 1988.  That does not necessarily make it right and I take the point the Senator is making.  We felt that any shorter period would not be adequate to enable all the necessary facts to be gathered.  On the other hand, we felt that any significantly longer period would potentially be unfair to the accused.  It is a difficult question of balance.  There are many situations, and they arise every day, where somebody gets a suspended sentence or somebody receives a non-custodial sentence.  We do not want these people waiting indefinitely to see whether they are going to draw a custodial sentence or the DPP is going to bring them before a higher court with a view to giving them a custodial sentence.</P>
      <P>I think the Senator's main problem is that the DPP might not be able to operate effectively within the 28 day period.  We were aware of this and it is the real question at issue.  The Senator will be pleased to hear that we spoke to the DPP and consulted him extensively on this; we also consulted the Attorney General's Office. The DPP has assured us that he will be able to operate these provisions effectively within the 28 day period laid down.</P>

      <P>In page 5, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In any trial on indictment before any jury no reference shall be made in the course of such trial to the power of the court to award compensation under the provisions of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This Bill allows compensation to be paid to a victim.  In a rape trial if the jury knows compensation is offered by defence councel, this might influence its decision whether to find the defendant guilty.  I believe no reference should be made to the fact that compensation is going to be paid, is being offered or is being considered, until after a verdict has been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I see what Senator Honan is trying to achieve.  First, the jury will probably know that compensation can be awarded because it will be public knowledge. Second, in relation to the question of compensation arising during the trial, that will not happen.  The function of the trial, and of the jury, is to determine whether the accused is guilty or innocent. The question of whether compensation can be given if the accused is going to be guilty will be irrelevant, and therefore totally inadmissible in evidence.  The only evidence admissible will be the evidence for the prosecution and the evidence for the defence.  The issue of compensation will not arise.  While I understand the Senator's fears, I think they are unfounded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  I understand the Minister's point regarding inadmissibility and that a jury would be aware beforehand that compensation could be awarded.  However, there are trials where the defence does not plead guilty but they realise the distress that has been caused to the victim and without <Col N="1052" /> admitting guilt, they may say they are willing to compensate the victim to a certain extent.  Does the Minister not believe that this can affect the jury whose sympathy may then move from the victim to the person who offered the compensation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Honan has said.  Not only is it unfair to the victim that the jury might be influenced by compensation being paid to the victim, but it is also unfair to the accused. An accused who has money will be in a stronger position than an accused who is poor and cannot offer compensation. Senator Honan has raised an important point here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment relates to the power we are giving the court to order compensation.  Putting into legislation the requirement that no reference shall be made to that power during the course of the trial will not serve any purpose for two reasons.  First, it is public knowledge that the court now has power to give compensation.  Not to refer to what is public knowledge does not make a great deal of sense in practice.  Second, it will not arise during the trial.  The trial will determine the guilt or innocence of the accused.  Why would the accused offer to pay compensation if he is pleading not guilty?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (5) (a), line 34, to delete &ldquo;means&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;financial circumstances and capital assets&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest the word &ldquo;means&rdquo; is woolly; the phrase &ldquo;financial circumstances and capital assets&rdquo; would give greater clarity. <Col N="1053" />&ldquo;Financial circumstances&rdquo; would mean money in a financial institution etc., &ldquo;capital assets&rdquo; would mean any assets a person had, be it a business, a farm etc. I consider the word &ldquo;means&rdquo; to cover income.  One can have many assets without any income.  For example, a wealthy person could have substantial assets but very little income from them.  Would that person be asked to liquidate some of his assets to compensate the victim?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>From my knowledge of the law, the definition of &ldquo;means&rdquo; is used in a standard way in legislation.  It is nitpicking to decide in this legislation to change a definition commonly referred to and commonly understood, namely &ldquo;financial circumstances and capital assets&rdquo;.  That is confusing and unhelpful. The courts already have ample power to inquire into the assets of a person before them.  I do not believe the necessity to put an affidavit before the court regarding financial circumstances is necessary in this case and it does not require legislation. The court can direct themselves as to what is necessary.  A person before a court can be asked any questions regarding his assets and financial circumstances. All kinds of information can be disclosed in an affidavit.  I have seen information given to courts with regard to maintenance orders etc.  I do not believe that this measure will prevent that happening. Apart from that, there is a certain privilege against self-incrimination and people should not be obliged to disclose all their information to the court.  For those reasons I ask Senator Neville to withdraw his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the word &ldquo;means&rdquo; appears eight times in section 6 of the Bill whereas the new term proposed by Senator Neville to replace it would apply in two places only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Senator's wish to have the word &ldquo;means&rdquo; replaced by the words &ldquo;financial circumstances and capital assets&rdquo; so as to leave no room for doubt if capital assets are taken into account. On Report Stage in the Dáil I undertook to examine the adequacy of the word in <Col N="1054" /> this context and, having examined the matter in full, I am now satisfied that the word &ldquo;means&rdquo; does include capital assets.  That is the ordinary, literal meaning of the word.  It has been used in numerous statutes over the years and, to the best of my knowledge, has never given rise to difficulty in practice.</P>
    <P>If it will allay the Senator's fears further, I will refer to the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962 where the term appears.  One of the criteria for the grant of a free legal aid certificate is that the means of the person are insufficient to enable him to obtain legal aid.  By section 9 of the Act the applicant may be required to furnish a written statement regarding his means.  The Second Schedule to the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Regulations, 1965 provides the form of the statement of means of an applicant for free legal aid where a written statement is required.  That form, in addition to requiring information about the applicant's financial commitments for example, rent mortgages, dependent relatives etc., also inquires whether the applicant has capital assets in the form of a house or any other assets.</P>
    <P>There is no great difference between the context in which the term &ldquo;means&rdquo; is used in this Bill and the context in which it was used in the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962.  There is no need to change the term because, having taken advice on the matter and having looked at previous legislation and how it has been interpreted, we are convinced beyond a shadow of doubt that the term includes capital assets and not just income.</P>

      <P>On Report Stage in the Dáil I inserted an amendment in section 6 (5) so as to make it clear that when assessing a person's means for the purpose of determining the amount of a compensation order for that purpose the <Col N="1055" /> court could require the convicted person, or his parent or guardian as the case may be, to give evidence as to his means and financial commitments.  I added the words &ldquo;financial commitments&rdquo; to ensure that in case there was any doubt &mdash; which we do not think there is &mdash; the liability side of the balance sheet as well as the assets would be taken into account. That amendment adequately meets the point raised by the Senator's amendment.</P>
      <P>The amendment I made in the Dáil is in slightly different terms to Senator Neville's amendment, but the only change of any substance is that the disclosure need not be made in all cases by affidavit.  We feel there are some cases where that procedure would be unduly bureaucratic and might delay proceedings. We are giving the judge the discretion to have the defendant produce evidence of means by whatever way the judge wishes.  We are giving total discretion to the judge.  If the judge feels that an affidavit is absolutely necessary he will so order; if he thinks that a less bureaucratic way will achieve the same result he can act accordingly.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister. The series of motions put down at annual general meetings of the Library Association of Ireland over the last few years has culminated in a number of associate motions being brought together on this year's agenda.  There is great concern in the public library service at the serious depletion and deterioration in the quality of the book stock.  The Library Association are as aware as any other concerned group of the economic realities facing this Government in its attempt to satisfy the needs of all sections of society.  Notwithstanding that awareness, as a representative of the Library Association in this House, I feel that the Government, and especially the Minister for the Environment, should be made aware of the great concern expressed by the Library Association at the continuing deterioration in the service to the public.</P>
      <P>The public library service is an essential element in the fabric of every community in Ireland.  It provides easy access to information for every man, woman and child.  We are all aware of how important information is in our daily lives.  We cannot function properly without correct and comprehensible information. The public library service has served this country well for over 100 years.  It has provided recreational reading for our leisure time, support for our studies and facts and figures for our businesses. Its value was recognised by successive Governments who provided capital to support a building programme which facilitated the provision of new libraries in many towns and in the suburbs of our larger cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the involvement and intervention of Governments over the past six years and their acknowledgment of the <Col N="1057" /> contribution the public library service has made to the fabric of our society.  From 1989 to 1990 the then Ministers for Education and the Environment, Deputy O'Rourke and Mr. Flynn met with numerous delegations from the Library Association who were attempting to increase funding.  In an innovative and imaginative action, a sum of money was set aside from the national lottery to improve book funds throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It is the local authorities, in the main, who fund the public library service.  I wish to pay tribute to local authorities who in the most straitened economic circumstances have continued to take this responsibility seriously and who attempt to maintain the standard of the public library service.  The benefits of this valuable investment have been undermined over the past 15 years by cuts in library book funds throughout the country.  It is all very well to have excellent buildings and provide books in the initial phase, but it is necessary to provide back-up in succeeding years.</P>
    <P>Despite increases in the cost of books, the aggregate book fund provision for 1992 was over £100,000 less than it was in 1986.  During the mid-eighties a number of public libraries had no funding at all for book purchase.  Public library users in those communities were denied access to new information in those periods. On the basis of the 1992 Estimates 14.7p per head per week was being spent on the public library service in the Republic of Ireland.  In Britain, where the library service at present is described as being in &ldquo;crisis&rdquo;, the expenditure per head was 23p per week.  In 1992, we spent 94p per head of population on books for our public library service while Scotland, a country of similar size, spent £2.78 sterling per head of population &mdash; almost three times as much.  This puts Irish book funds into perspective.  They are insufficient to purchase important new materials and to fill the gaps resulting from underfunding throughout the previous decade.</P>
    <P>Books are the life blood of the public library service.  Good libraries are built up painstakingly by librarians who select the best books of a genre or a particular <Col N="1058" /> topic as these materials are published. Over time collections are developed which provide authoritative, in depth information to support our interests and concerns, information which is essential if we are to develop our local communities and this country as we would wish.  The value of our local and national collection has been undermined seriously by the reduced buying power of library book funds over the past decade.</P>
    <P>Important texts are no longer available. Special collections are incomplete and will remain so unless library book funds are properly financed on an ongoing basis and unless a special grant is made available.  This grant would be made available countrywide to help librarians to restore gaps in library collections built up as a resource for us all. An important book is wonderful when it is published.  Over time and in its place within a library collection it becomes an irreplacable treasure.</P>
    <P>There will be no realistic opportunity for this Government in the short or medium term to provide the necessary finance by way of block grant to local authorities or to increase the book fund to any appreciable degree.  It is in the context of today's economic realities which this Government is committed to improving that I am asking the Minister to give serious consideration to following the precedent created by his predecessors in the late 1980s, by allocating a sum of money.  In this instance I am requesting that £1 million be set aside from the national lottery.  It is not a lot to ask.  The impact of the previous £1 million on our book funds and on the quality and quantity of books throughout the public library service was immediate and had far reaching effects.  It was in a sense a fire brigade action but I believe that there would be great public support and sympathy for it.</P>
    <P>The Library Association are requesting £6 million over three years.  If they received it all at once they would not have enough staff to spend it wisely within a 12-month period.  Being a politician, I am tailoring my needs in a realistic fashion. I know the Minister is someone who appreciates good books.  I hope he will respond sympathetically and give some <Col N="1059" /> hope to the committed public servants who are librarians in our public library service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. N. Treacy) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. N. Treacy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to speak on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, who is unavoidably away on Government business, on the important subject of the book stock in our library service.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the funding of the library service generally.  Local authorities must meet the cost of operating public libraries from their own resources.  The main operational costs include staff costs, payment of loan and leasing charges, maintenance and operation of buildings, purchase of equipment and normal stocking of libraries.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Environment's main function in relation to the public library service, is the provision of capital grants for branch libraries, both new and reconstructed, mobile libraries, and the computerisation of library services.  Capital grants of up to 100 per cent of approved costs are payable to finance library construction, and 50 per cent of the cost of book stock for new libraries is also payable.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the initiation of library projects, rests with each local authority.  Proposals are considered by the Department of the Environment in consultation with An Chomhairle Leabharlanna.  All State funding for the library service, comes from the national lottery.  Self-evidently book stock is the most fundamental and essential element of a library service and should be so regarded by library authorities, in determining their spending priorities on the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A high standard of book stock is essential to get maximum value from the resources which have been, and are being, expended by both local authorities and the Exchequer on the public library service.  It is not unreasonable to expect local authorities to fund the cost of providing an adequate book stock for the libraries themselves.  However, we recognise that for many local authorities, the <Col N="1060" /> once-off expenditure involved in stocking new library buildings can create some difficulties.</P>
    <P>For this reason the Minister for the Environment ensures that new and improved libraries benefit from the available funds for book stock, by way of the 50 per cent grant assistance, which is available for stocking new libraries in addition to 100 per cent funding for the buildings.  The State has spent a considerable amount of money on these grants over the years.</P>
    <P>Lest anybody think from Senator Mooney's contribution that local authorities, have been cutting back on book-stocking, I point out that the Public Library Estimates of Expenditure show that expenditure on book funds has risen steadily since 1988.  Expenditure on book funds in 1988 was estimated at £1.99 million and is expected to rise to £3.436 million this year, which represents a 73 per cent increase over the period.</P>
    <P>This year a total of £1.85 million is being provided by the Department of the Environment to assist the funding of the library service.  This includes £1.2 million for new capital projects and books and £650,000 in respect of subsidy to local authorities on their loan and leasing charges.  Unfortunately, given the difficult economic circumstances which currently prevail, it is not possible to make available the further £1 million, which is being sought by Senator Mooney as a special allocation to boost local authority book stock funds.</P>
    <P>Curtailment of expenditure, throughout the public sector, is unavoidable.  This fact is almost universally accepted.  In this context the public library service is no different from any other public service. Local authorities who finance operational costs must ensure prudent management and effective use of the resources available to them from all sources.  It is their function in allocating these resources to determine priorities for different services and to establish a balanced programme which has regard to the competing needs of the different services.  The local authority is in the best position to make these decisions since it is fully aware of local needs, demands and priorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> It is the policy of the Department of the Environment to pursue a well-balanced programme of library development throughout the country.  Quality and cost-effectiveness are key objectives in the library programme.  A rigorous standard of project appraisal and control is in place, to ensure that these aims are achieved.  Despite the difficult economic circumstances which prevail, the allocation provided this year will ensure that progress will be maintained on the development of the library service including the stocking of new and refurbished libraries.</P>
    <P>As a frequent user of the public library service I have seen immense improvements take place in recent years.  I would like to pay special tribute to Senator Mooney for putting this motion before the House and for the fine representation which he gives the Library Association of Ireland, who have nominated him consistently for selection as a Member of this House.  I hope the information before us puts the situation in context because scarity of resources makes it a matter for the local authorities in the first instance to ensure that the priorities they decide upon are funded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive and considered reply.  However, I am disappointed that he did not respond more positively to the specific elements of the motion.  A point which deserves to be highlighted is that since the early 1990s as a result of changes in legislation all moneys for capital funding of libraries, for new buildings and for book stocks in new libraries has been coming exclusively from the national lottery.  Public libraries receive no money from the Exchequer. The public would appreciate a small sum of money being devoted to the ongoing development of the library service, specifically in the area of funds for books.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his kind courteous comments to me personally. I will continue to battle hard on behalf of the Library Association of Ireland to find some light at the end of what is a very difficult economic tunnel.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I thank him for coming to the House to deal with the matters raised by Senator Mooney and myself.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the matter of the reservoir at Castletroy, County Limerick which is leaking over 1.3 million gallons of costly treated water per day.  The local authority is seriously concerned not only about the cost but also about the risk of serious flooding and the possible cutting off of the water supply to 100,000 people in Limerick city.</P>
      <P>The city manager undertook to send divers into the reservoir to identify the source of the problem to see if it could be dealt with in that way.  Apparently, the reservoir is porous and is leaking in so many different places that it would be impossible to patch it up.  The only way to solve the problem is to build a new reservoir.</P>
      <P>The reservoir leaks cost the corporation approximately £120,000 annually and in these straitened financial times we can ill afford this expenditure. Remedial action has been attempted but it is not possible.  The corporation is so concerned the reservoir may collapse that they are preparing an emergency plan.</P>
      <P>The matter has already been brought to the attention of the Department of the Environment.  The Minister, Deputy Smith, visited the city council last year and listened attentively to our problems and was particularly responsive to our concern about the reservoir.</P>
      <P>The reservoir problem cannot be solved without funding from the Department. Approximately £3.5 million is required but half of this amount should come from EC Structural Funds, because of the nature of the project.  Application has been made to the Department and our serious concern has been brought to the attention of the Department on a number of occasions and I wish to restate that concern here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to respond positively <Col N="1063" /> by giving permission to Limerick County Council to approve the commencement of the contract to erect a new reservoir and water tower at Castletroy, County Limerick.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate Senator O'Sullivan on her election to the Seanad and I wish her well in her term as Senator.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment is fully aware of the serious problems at Limerick city reservoir.  He is anxious to approve a scheme for a new covered reservoir and water tower to serve Limerick city and its environs as early as possible.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the environment action programme in 1990 over £100 million has been provided to local authorities to ensure the provision of adequate supplies of good quality drinking water to consumers.  The Programme for a Partnership Government reiterates the Government's commitment to the action programme and promises to hasten its implementation.</P>
      <P>A high level of investment is required to ensure the exacting drinking water quality standards set by the European Community are met.  Local authorities have made a significant contribution towards achieving the requirements of the drinking water directive.  They are to be congratulated on the success which they have achieved and which is borne out in both the 1989 and 1990 reports on the quality of drinking water in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we returned to Government in 1987 we have invested over £16 million in the provision of water and sanitary services in the Limerick area.  Major sewerage schemes at Rathkeale and Castletroy are scheduled to be completed in 1993 at a cost of £13.7 million.  The problems with the existing reservoir, <Col N="1064" /> which have been well documented, provide adequate justification for the provision of a new reservoir to serve Limerick city.  The proposal has been included, therefore, in the water and sanitary services programme.</P>
    <P>The existing reservoir, which has a capacity of 26,000 cubic metres, was constructed at the end of the last century and has inadequate capacity to cater for present demand.  Water losses, through leakage of over one million gallons a day, are unsatisfactory and are a serious drain on Limerick Corporation's resources.</P>
    <P>A tender recommendation has been submitted to the Department of the Environment by Limerick Corporation for the construction of a 50,000 cubic metre reservoir and a 900 cubic metre water tower to cater for consumers in the more elevated parts of the city.  This proposal will involve an investment in excess of £4 million and will take two years to complete.</P>
    <P>The provision of the new reservoir is a priority and has been included in the Department of the Environment's list of schemes for European Community funding. The Minister for the Environment has asked me to assure the House and the people of Limerick that everything possible is being done to secure early financing of this scheme.  I will, of course, advise him of the important concerns expressed here this evening and I will bring Senator O'Sullivan's comments to his attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and I am pleased the reservoir is included in the list of schemes to be funded through the Structural Fund.  I hope the funding will be available before our worst fears are realised.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 6.45 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 30 March 1993.</P>
