      <P>I have notice from Senator Neville that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to outline the progress to date in implementing the recommendations of the Sixth Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies, Fifth Report, on Bord na gCon.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator O'Kennedy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction the establishment of the proposed Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute, as essential for the development and expansion of agricultural and rural enterprise throughout the country and as a major stimulant to employment in County Tipperary and adjoining counties.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Cotter of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to take action to protect the jobs of 75 people who are employed in the manufacture <Col N="490" /> of hamburgers at a factory in the Castleblayney area of County Monaghan.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Doyle of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to urgently provide funding for the building of a multi-denominational school at Ranelagh, Dublin 6.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to allocate more funding to Co-operation North.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Burke of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to upgrade to national primary status the routes from Swinford to Ballina and Castlebar to Westport, County Mayo, as a continuation of the N5.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Neville's and Senator O'Kennedy's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.  May I say to Senator O'Kennedy and Senator Neville that they have ten minutes on the Adjournment tonight and they will not get a second more, for obvious reasons.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Items 1 and 26.  By agreement of the House Item 26 will be taken from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.; I would like to thank my colleagues on the other side of the House for their agreement on this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the developments on Northern Ireland &mdash; the meeting between the <Col N="491" /> Tánaiste and President Clinton, and the statement by the Taoiseach in the Dáil &mdash; would the Leader confirm that a debate will take place next week, as promised, in the presence of the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, to allow him the opportunity to inform the House of his views on the developing situation?</P>
    <P>Would the Leader allow time for a debate on crime within the next month? Concern has been growing about this issue over a number of months and, while there are many motions about crime on the Order Paper, a broader discussion on crime, the granting of bail, the courts, sentencing and the custodial system may be more suitable.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay special tribute to Senator McGennis who spoke last week on the Adoption Bill.  Her contribution was very moving and very brave.  I also congratulate her for her performance on the <i>Gay Byrne Show.</i></P>

      <P>I would be happy to support the Order of Business in order to allow public representatives join the rest of the population this evening.</P>
      <P>May I raise the fact that this morning's <i>Belfast Newsletter</i> and <i>Irish News</i> carried the same feature supporting the action for peace tomorrow.  I note that in the other House it is proposed to observe that.  Tomorrow my members all over Ireland will be observing a day of peace in classrooms.  Solidarity is also being shown by workers in the North.  It would be most appropriate for us to observe two minutes' silence tomorrow, either at 11 o'clock when the schools are doing it, or at 1 o'clock when other workers are doing it, in order to show solidarity on an issue that has crossed community boundaries. This morning at the executive council meeting of the ICTU, which was discussing many matters, that issue received the support of workers everywhere, as well as support from the Confederation of British Industry and, as far as I know, from Irish industry also.  It would be appropriate for us as public representatives to be a part of that movement tomorrow.</P>

      <P>May I draw the attention of the House to the serious statement made by the Wellcome Trust regarding the withdrawal of research funds to Ireland because of the very high level of VAT, 21 per cent, that has to be paid on research equipment here?  This fund has given an enormous amount of money to Ireland over the past 30 years.  I would like the Leader to express our concern to the Minister for Finance to see if anything could be done.  Irish research receives more money from this fund than from the Government.  It will be extremely serious for research workers in this country if the Wellcome Trust withdraws from activities in the Republic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader if he has any news of a specific date for a debate on the drug problem in the cities.  I also support the call for a debate on the North of Ireland.  There has been some good-humoured reference to the football match this evening.  I would like to say that I find it an extraordinarily sad comment that the Irish flag will, apparently, not be visible at that match.  It is a strange and sad comment on the situation in the North of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have not discussed with Senator Henry the question she raised but it is very important and I strongly support her on the question of VAT on research equipment and materials.  Coincidently, I have received a very strong letter from a constituent in California on this subject. This matter should be discussed in this House.</P>

      <P>Would the Leader consent to a general debate on arts and culture? Perhaps the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht would come to the House.  I am sure Members elected from the Education and Cultural Panel would be delighted to speak in this debate.  I am prompted to make this request by being privileged last night to watch Senator Norris perform in such a professional manner in <i>Side by Side</i> by Sondheim.  I advise all Members to see this show.  It is wonderful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether Senator Lydon had the National Monuments Bill in mind when he spoke about the Minister coming to the House for a debate on the arts.  I am pleased to inform the House this Bill will be published tomorrow and dealt with in this House in the coming weeks, probably next week if possible.  We will have a debate or statements on Northern Ireland as soon as possible, depending on the Tánaiste's schedule.  The Public Order Bill will be in the House shortly.  This legislation is wide ranging and will allow Senators to give their views on the present state of law and order in our capital city and country.  With regard to Senator O'Toole's request, it is proposed that the House will observe a one minute's silence for peace at 1 p.m. tomorrow.  In relation to Senator Henry's question I will inform the Minister for Finance of the feelings of the House on the implications of imposing VAT on research funding.  In relation to the health services, the Minister for Health made statements yesterday <Col N="494" /> during Question Time in the Dail and I am sure he would welcome an opportunity to come to the House for a debate on the health services.</P>

    <Title>Irish Aviation Authority Bill, 1993: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 38 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a query for the Minister of State and I think we should have another look at this section.  I am concerned at what is proposed to be done in relation to the first chief executive. That post is apparently as good as filled at the moment, by somebody in the Department.  The appointment will be made for a period of seven years and thereafter the board will be involved. Subsection (4) states:</P>
      <P>Each subsequent Chief Executive shall be appointed and may be removed from office by the directors of the company after consultation with the Minister.</P>
      <P>I would regard that as a proper function of the board.  I regret that the Minister does not consider it possible to enable the board to discharge that function in relation to the first appointee to the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand the argument about continuity because this section of the Department would be moving under the control of the new Irish Aviation Authority. However, I do not think it is necessary for us to provide for a period of seven years to ensure that continuity and the easy transfer of personnel, duties, obligations and so on.  A period of one to two years would be adequate.  I am reluctant to deprive the board of their rightful involvement in the appointment of the chief executive.  However, I am swayed by the argument of continuity.  I believe the time span of seven years is far too long and that one to two years would <Col N="495" /> suffice.  Thereafter, the board could discharge its function of appointing the next chief executive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>You will forgive me, a Chathaoirligh, if I am repetitious but it is only because I cannot remember what was covered the last day and I doubt if you can either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Senator suggesting that I am not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that perhaps you do not pay the due attention to my words you should, a Chathaoirligh.  That is all, I am not suggesting anything else. I have slight worries about this seven year period and I do not know what is the basis for it.  I would like the Minister of State to explain why it is for such a long period.</P>
      <P>I have also worries about the procedures. I wonder why the Minister of State has to appoint the chief executive the first time around, and after that he or she is appointed by the board.  In other words, the Minister appoints the first chief executive but when that appointee resigns, dies or leaves office, their replacement is appointed by the board. Is this because the board will not be appointed the first time and there are simultaneous appointments to the board and of the chief executive, or is it because the Minister wishes to have control over the chief executive this time round?  I cannot see why the board should not appoint the chief executive on this occasion as well.  I cannot see the reason for the inconsistency of one appointment being made by the Minister and the second being made by the board.  Perhaps, there is a good chronological reason, otherwise I do not see any reason for it.</P>
      <P>My second point relates to subsection (6) which states that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chief Executive shall hold office upon and subject to such terms and conditions (including terms and conditions relating to remuneration and <Col N="496" /> allowances) as may be determined by the directors of the company after consultation with the Minister and with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister of State tell us what the salary and remuneration of the chief executive will be, his allowances and payments? Could he also indicate whether this is comparable with others in the semi-State sector?  How does he think it compares with the private sector?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>It used to be said that the most effective system of government was dictatorship tempered by assassination. The seven year term is to some extent a little long but it is tempered by the Minister's ability to remove the person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not reassurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not reassure Senator Ross but who can?  I never remember anybody satisfying Senator Ross, including the leader of his own party, so we do not know what satisfies Senator Ross.</P>
      <P>The subsequent appointment will be made in consultation with the Minister. This raises a serious point which is often mentioned by Senator Ross, that is, the line between the paymaster and those who carry out the instructions.  The chief executive has a vital function in terms of making that company effective and profitable.  Therefore, the paymaster should have some control over who heads the operation.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross would not dream of saying that Tony O'Reilly, in Pittsburgh, should not control the appointment of the editor of <i>The Irish Independent</i> because Mr. O'Reilly pays his wages.  In this case the Minister, on our behalf, pays the wages and must have a say.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to what has been said on this section both on the last occasion and this afternoon. We have to look at the history of the situation.  Since the early 1940s we have <Col N="497" /> been operating successful professional aviation services in this country.  ANSO has been there to regulate, guide, professionalise and give that service on behalf of the nation.</P>
      <P>We are now commercialising the Civil Service ANSO organisation.  It is important in the interest of the taxpayer and the safety of the travelling public that there is continuity in the progression from the Civil Service organisation to the commercial organisation.  A board of directors has not been appointed as yet.  It is, therefore, vitally important that leadership of the highest calibre is available to head the commercial organisation, preserve continuity and ensure that we can deliver the services.  That is why it is provided in the Bill that the chief executive should be appointed by the Minister. The salary of the new chief executive will be commensurate with that of an assistant secretary in a Civil Service Department, which is <i>circa</i> £45,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>Senator Howard made a point about the seven year period.  Until some years ago, a person appointed to head a Department, a semi-State body or a local authority was appointed for life.  The business world is a tough environment and it is important that people bring fresh thinking to the office.  The Government decided that all important national positions should have a maximum seven year period of appointment with the right of reappointment.</P>
      <P>This Bill is consistent with what has been decided in the past.  We have provided for a seven year period to ensure that if it is necessary to introduce fresh thinking, the facility is there.  Somebody cannot now take total control of an organisation for their entire life as if they were the only important person in the organisation.</P>
      <P>The point was made that the board of directors does not have a say at the start. There is no board of directors in position. They would not have the experience in dealing with aviation matters that is available within ANSO today.  It is vitally important to be able to maximise the opportunity for using experience in the new commercial organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> Continuity is enabled through the new chief executive.  A board of directors will serve with that chief executive for up to seven years and will become proficient, professional people in the area of aviation and aviation policy and will thereafter have a say in the appointment.  That is an excellent way of making progress, maintaining the continuity and ensuring that this organisation maintains its regulatory and professional standards.  The level of service given in the traditional Civil Service organisation will be incorporated into the new commercial ethos in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put the question as soon as possible if the Senator wishes to make a further observation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a fresh observation. I accept what the Minister has said. However, when he says the board when appointed will not have the experience to appoint the chief executive, I worry for two reasons.  First, does that mean that the board will not be appropriately experienced in the aviation sector to make this appointment?  Second, what will happen if the Minister establishes this principle?  If, for example, the chief executive lasts only a week or two weeks in office, who will then make the appointment? Will the board, despite its inexperience, make the appointment or will the Minister make the appointment? That is an important question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross has gone from one extreme to the other.  We are maintaining continuity.  We have the utmost confidence in the aviation expertise, intellectual capacity and health of the existing staff in ANSO to serve the nation <Col N="499" /> in this regard.  They are fine people in their areas of expertise and we do not anticipate difficulties in any aspects of their lives which would render them unable to serve the new organisation.</P>
      <P>The new board could not be expected to have the necessary experience of aviation matters to make the appointment. We must all serve, for example, in the Dáil or the Seanad to learn the system and to be informed of how the Oireachtas works.  That takes time.  We are only human.  Consequently, it will be the same in this organisation.  After a few months the board will, of course, be <i>au fait</i> with the exigencies of the aviation world and will be well able to make decisions. However, it is not fair to ask its members to make its decisions immediately.  They must find their way under the leadership of a chief executive who maintains continuity from the old system to the new.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Restraints are imposed on the capacity and freedom of the Authority to operate as it thinks fit in certain circumstances.  On Second Stage, the Minister went to considerable lengths to explain the advantages the Authority would enjoy in its new role.  I remember commenting on the phrase that they were &ldquo;freed from the shackles of the Civil Service&rdquo; and because of that they would be able to operate more effectively. While it might appear, having listened to the Minister on Second Stage, that they were going to be outside the Civil Service, on reading the conditions of the remuneration of the staff in section 39, it becomes obvious that they are not. The same guidelines which apply within the Civil Service apply to the Authority. This Authority must &ldquo;have regard&rdquo;, according to this section, to</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government or nationally agreed guidelines which are for the time being extant or to Government policy concerning remuneration and conditions of employment....  The company shall comply with any directives with regard to such remuneration, allowances, terms and conditions which the Minister <Col N="502" /> may give to the company with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The new found freedom which this body was to have had has now been effectively shackled.  Everything is linked back to the terms and conditions of employment which preceded its establishment.  The control which we were led to believe would no longer affect the freedom of this organisation to do what was beneficial is restored within the terms of this section.</P>
    <P>There will be a further impediment to the operation of the Authority.  The restrictions imposed in section 39, because of the level of remuneration the board could offer with the consent of the Minister, could inhibit the recruitment of specialist staff whose expertise would be of value to the Authority in developing the responsibilities which have now been handed on to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I get the impression that Senator Howard is confusing a fully privatised company with a semi-State body. All semi-State companies &mdash; which this will be, it will not be a fully privatised company &mdash; must have regard to the guidelines set down by the Government of the day in relation to pay and conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>An important debate is going on here which underlines the contradictions in the Bill.  The Minister talks about the company being commercial, about managerial autonomy &mdash; they were the words he used &mdash; and other indications of independence, when suddenly the company is subject to Government guidelines.  The Minister has already said that the chief executive's remuneration is £45,000 per annum.  That is not a commercial salary in terms of the private sector.  People who might be capable of doing this job will not be attracted to it because they would be paid more in the private sector.  That may or may not be a good thing, but it is a problem which all semi-State bodies have because they do not pay the sort of salary which is commensurate with responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="503" /> What does the phrase in section 39 mean &mdash;&ldquo;the company... shall have regard to Government or nationally agreed guidelines which are for the time being extant...&rdquo;?  Does it mean that they shall be compelled to keep within those guidelines or that they shall bear them in mind?  This is important.  Does it mean they will remain within Government guidelines rigidly or that they shall consider the guidelines as a factor and then make their own decision anyway?  I do not quite understand that phrase.</P>

      <P>We are talking about two clearly different things.  We are talking about a semi-State organisation with a commercial ethos which must perform commercially in the interests of delivering a service and a profitable contribution to its own existence at no burden to the taxpayer.  In this section we are also talking about the conditions under which it shall operate when it comes to pay and conditions.  The provisions of section 39 are generally in line with the conditions applicable to all semi-State bodies and within those guidelines there will be ample flexibility to fashion current pay rates to the special conditions of the Authority.  The Board, the chief executive and the management team will have certain flexibility with regard to the staff they will require and the remuneration they will be paid.  We must have stability within the whole pay sector in the public area.  It is important that we do not have a situation where one semi-State body &ldquo;ups the ante&rdquo;, is doing well and is able to attract several people from other semi-State bodies to the detriment of the other organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a consensus at national level on pay, how to manage it and the industrial situation that has evolved successfully. Everybody adheres to a consensus and to achieving it and in that <Col N="504" /> light we want to maintain that consensus in line with other semi-State organisations. There will be ample flexibility which will be in the interests of the country to ensure that the consensus agreed under the control of the Minister for Finance who has responsibility for semi-State organisations will be satisfactory to managing this company in a way that will give ample opportunity for its staff to be properly remunerated within the flexibility that is required for success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will quote from a recent publication from IMPACT:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Aviation Authority Bill published on June 28, 1993, gave rise <Col N="505" /> to the possibility of a major industrial dispute with IMPACT members at Irish Airports.  All the Unions in Air Navigation Services Office had indicated to the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications that unless the new Bill contained a similar guarantee on the security of tenure for staff transferring to the new semi-State company as that held by staff who had transferred to An Post, Coillte and Telecom, they would embark on a joint campaign of industrial action.</P>
    <P>Air Traffic Controllers, Aero Inspectors and Radio Officers, who make up two thirds of staff transferring to the new company, were prepared to take strike action from July 8 onwards in order to secure the necessary amendments to the Bill.  The need for industrial action arose because the Government apparently was only prepared to guarantee security and conditions for only as long as transferred staff remained on the same pay rates and within the same grade as they had occupied in the Civil Service.  This, in reality, was no guarantee and was a clawback on the conditions offered to staff in other semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>Despite numerous meetings with Air Navigation Services Office Management [including a meeting with the Minister of State himself]... and an intensive lobbying compaign of the political parties, it took the threat of industrial action to bring about the required response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not anxious to comment on that.  The position is clear. The Bill was published and somebody got nervous and there was a number of meetings.  I attended one of them and I allayed the fears of the staff on behalf of the Government.  The big question was the security of tenure, namely, whether the staff would be guaranteed positions in the new company equal to those they have at the moment they transfer?  We gave an absolute guarantee that nobody would be disadvantaged or reduced in position or salary and everybody was satisfied.  It must be remembered that <Col N="506" /> there are several unions representing staff in all of these organisations.  The same will obtain in the new company.  All these unions are members of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  They are part of the national consensus and they have several avenues open to them in achieving the consensus we all desire in the interests of industrial relations and industrial peace, which has helped this economy in recent years and which we all deeply appreciate. I am confident that all those fears have been allayed.  We can go forward in the knowledge that there is absolute commitment by the staff in co-operation with our Department, working on behalf of the nation to make this a thriving commercial body.</P>

      <P>This deals with the transfer of staff from one company to another.

The consensus may well exist between the Minister and his new found friend, Senator Magner.</P>

God help us if we get similar consensus in which the unemployed, with whom the Minister is so concerned and Senator Magner affects concern, are again left out in the cold.</P>
      <P>One of the problems about Government guidelines on the transfer and treatment of staff is that the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; in society, who include the Minister, Senator Magner and to a lesser extent myself, gain so greatly from those who have not, namely the unemployed.  There is a classic example of this in section 40 where civil servants, who are the most privileged employees in the country and for whom extraordinarily beneficial wage agreements have been negotiated in the last few years under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, are getting another benefit under this Bill.</P>
      <P>I have difficulties with legislation enacted specifically for 580 to 600 people who are employed by ANSO and whom it is envisaged will be transferred.  When there is specific legislation of that kind it is nearly always bad legislation because it only applies to one company.  In other words, it is makeshift legislation introduced specifically to address one problem but not establishing any principles, because that would be dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a question on section 40 (1). That subsection says every person who on the day immediately before the vesting <Col N="508" /> day is a member of the staff of the Air Navigation Services Office of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and is designated by the Minister for employment by the company shall on the vesting day be transferred. Does this mean the Minister will pick and choose or will he transfer everyone already employed by ANSO?  Will the Minister be able to take certain people and leave others behind?  Who is going and who is not?</P>
    <P>I also have a question on section 40 (2) because I have difficulties with people being guaranteed jobs for life.  The subsection says that people will be given the same benefits in their new jobs as in their old ones and certainly not lesser benefits. This applies specifically to tenure, the time for which they will be guaranteed service.  Could the Minister say exactly what those benefits are and if there are any additions?  If something is said to be not less than an existing arrangement and is also being left to negotiation with the unions, it seems the people being transferred cannot lose.  They cannot receive fewer benefits and since the agreement is subject to negotiation the unions will make a deal for something better.  What are the specific terms which have to be negotiated, since the workers will not be worse off no matter what happens?</P>

      <P>The contributions from the other side are causing me immense difficulties.  I understand Senator Howard's position.  He is enunciating Fine Gael policy and it is consistent.  It is when the independent research unit headed by Senator Ross intervenes that confusion arises.  He has the unique gymnastic ability to face both ways on one issue.  A few minutes ago he said the chief executive's salary of <i>circa</i> £45,000, equivalent to an assistant secretary's salary, is not enough.  He asked what sort of fool would do the job.  The answer is the same sort of fool who has run semi-State bodies and the Civil Service since the foundation of the State &mdash; dedicated, talented public servants.  On the other hand Senator Ross also complains about jobs for life at great wages.  He should <Col N="509" /> make up his mind.  Either we are ripping off the people who work for us or we are not.</P>

      <P>As to what staff will be transferred, almost all will be transferred on vesting day.  That means the staff employed as civil servants, working in the special division of ANSO as part of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications on the day before vesting day, will be automatically transferred on the following day to the new company, save where the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications wishes to retain a specialist unit to advise him on aviation matters, to investigate accidents and to carry out various other regulatory and advisory functions.  Only a small segment of specialist people will be retained.  The Minister will decide who they are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 30, subsection (12), line 2, to delete &ldquo;7&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;2&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Having read the Bill, listened to the Minister and read the discussion of the select committee and the Report Stages of the Bill, both I and the members of the staff have not been reassured that the superannuation fund coming into existence will be adequate or will cater for the likely demands that may arise on it during the early years of the Authority's functioning.</P>
      <P>In one of the papers last Sunday week, I was concerned to read a statement from the organisation representing the air traffic controllers.  One part of it especially concerned me, which indicated that because of the age profile of those transferring from the Civil Service to the new Authority, a minimum of 10 per cent would reach retirement age during the early years of the Authority's operation. There was serious concern about this because section 41 of this Bill requires the Minister to make a contribution to the fund not later than seven years after the vesting day.</P>
      <P>It may well be &mdash; I know it has been alluded to in discussions elsewhere &mdash; that there will be a number of stage payments or instalments over that period, but there is no requirement in the Bill for such instalments.  The only requirement on the State or the Minister for Finance would be to make a payment to the fund not later than seven years after the vesting day.  I put down this amendment to make sure that this percentage of transferring staff, who will reach retirement age in the earlier years of the Authority's existence, will have a pension fund that will be adequately funded.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's response to my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I reassure Senator Magner that there is no gulf in the presentation of views from this side.  The responsibility of the Opposition is to <Col N="511" /> examine legislation in detail.  Because we are trying to fulfil our duty, we&mdash;&mdash;</P>

On Second Stage, I indicated that the amount of time devoted to this measure in the other House and in the select committee was not provided here.  We were not given the opportunity for the same detailed examination.  We are fulfilling a useful role on behalf of the State and of those who will be employed in this body in subjecting the legislation and the Minister's presentation of it to this examination. We are doing nothing more than fulfilling our duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes that the Minister for Finance will have two rather than seven years to pay the authority's pension fund an amount to cover the accrued pension entitlements of civil servants transferred to the authority. I refer the House to subsection (12) which explicitly states that payments under subsection (10) or (11) shall be made not later than seven years after the vesting day.  It is binding on the Minister for Finance to make his contribution not later than seven years.  The sum involved will be determined by an actuarial valuation to be carried out after vesting day. It is estimated to be approximately £60 million.  For Exchequer financing reasons the Government has decided that seven years is an appropriate term within which this payment must be made.  I do not accept that the section should be changed to require that payment to be made earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we consider how long ANSO has served the country, the requirement to pay these superannuation contributions has built up over a number of years.  The Minister for Finance, the Department of Finance and the Government accept that the contributions should be made.  If it took so many years to build up the contributions, <Col N="512" /> it is only fair, in a financial mechanism or funding arrangement, that a flexible period of time should be given to the Minister for Finance to discharge his obligations on behalf of the State and the staff for whom the contributions will be made.  Therefore the Government has agreed on a ceiling of seven years, which is a maximum period to transfer and dispose of the financial responsibility which has accrued over a long period of time. This is reasonable.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance will pay interest from vesting day on any unpaid balance of the amount due.  In other words, if it is decided to pay seven equal tranches over seven years, then once the first payment is made the interest due on the other six tranches must be discharged also.  This creates an imposition on the Minister for Finance and the Exchequer. It guarantees the fund and the maximisation of the value of the fund by paying the interest thereon and it creates an option for the Minister for Finance to discharge it in total, in different tranches, in greater amounts or in one single amount.  This is also important.  It will be an advantage to the Exchequer for payment to be made in full as soon as it is practicable.  It also means that the delay in payment will not involve the pension fund in any loss of income.  This copperfastens and protects the fund.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard asked how the authority will finance the pensions of staff who retire.  He mentioned the age profile and that approximately 10 per cent of the staff may retire in the first few years of the Authority.  The user charges and fees which the Authority receives include a superannuation element which will meet the pensions due in this period.  It is important to note that at the end of each year Eurocontrol will make the balance of its contribution available for user charges to ANSO.  The new Authority will consider this in a positive manner and it will allocate some of these funds to the pension fund so as to ensure that the fund can be established, trustees can be appointed and, through the Minister for Finance, moneys will be lodged in that fund to keep it in position.  This will <Col N="513" /> mean that ample money will be available at all times to pay pensions for those who retire between now and the seven year conclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not reject the point I made that the legislation obliges the Minister to pay the contribution of £60 million not later than seven years from the vesting day.  Am I being fair to the Minister if I say he has not denied that the Minister for Finance may not pay the £60 million until seven years after the vesting day?  My interpretation of what the Minister has said is that there are circumstances where not one penny of the £60 million will be paid before that date.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that once the first tranche is paid interest will arise on the remaining money, if a decision is taken to pay the £60 million in six or seven tranches over that period.  This could be open to the interpretation that unless a payment was made the requirement to pay interest on the balance would not arise.  If that was the position, by not making any payment there would be no obligation to pay interest.</P>
      <P>There is another matter I want explained.  If no payment is made by the Minister for Finance there seems to be an acceptance that the resources to pay the pensions of the 10 per cent of staff who may retire in the earlier years could be made up through the superannuation segment of the user charges.  I dispute that and I want to be satisfied that in the absence of payment from the Minister for Finance the sources the Minister indicated would be adequate to meet the requirements in that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Howard is correct. That would also be my interpretation of what the Minister said.  Section 41 (45) (10) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance shall determine an appropriate contribution, related to reckonable service given before the vesting day, towards the superannuation benefits which may be granted to or in respect of persons who <Col N="514" /> are transferred to the staff of the company under section 40 and shall, subject to subsection (12), pay such contribution to the trustees appointed under subsection (9) at such times and in such manner as he shall determine.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows the situation regarding an announcement by the previous Government in relation to PRSI contributions by farmers.  A farmer is legally bound to pay PRSI at age 56 but the contributions he will pay in the ten years from age 56 to his 66th birthday are of no benefit to him.  I hope for that reason alone that this section has been well thought out and that the workers in this company will be at no loss.  Senator Howard has expressed fear about the section and I agree with him.  The Minister must be well aware what happened in relation to farmers between the ages of 56 and 66.  The money they are paying in PRSI contributions will be of no benefit to them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Howard is partially correct if one takes it in the narrowest legal context possible.  The Minister for Finance could decide not to make a contribution until the seventh year, when he would then be liable to pay £60 million plus the accruing interest thereon.  That would be foolish. He has to pay accrued interest from the vesting day.  Subsection (11) states: &ldquo;Where any part of the contribution under subsection (10) remains unpaid for any period after the vesting day, interest shall be payable by the Minister for Finance to the trustees...&rdquo;  That is clear.  He is obliged and accepts that.  We have had discussions with the Minister for Finance <Col N="516" /> and the Department of Finance and I have examined this matter in detail.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that Eurocontrol are making their regular contributions in a very professional manner, that we are using those contributions wisely in ANSO, and that ANSO is making the relevant arrangements to ensure that it discharges its obligations within the new company.  Regarding the trustees, until vesting day the provisions of this legislation cannot come into force.  After vesting day there are legal obligations on management, in consultation with the Minister, to take appropriate action.  I am also confident that when the Book of Estimates is published for 1994, which shall not be too far away, it will take account of an obligation on the Minister for Finance to make his first discharge under this Bill to the superannuation fund.  We are leaving nothing to chance. We are acting in the interests of the nation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The section is designed to create flexibility for the Minister.  It would allow the Minister to transfer a surplus to the fund in a situation where a surplus from a semi-State body is transferred to the Exchequer.  It ensures flexibility on both sides and it is important for careful and prudent financial management of Exchequer affairs.</P>

      <P>I would like confirmation of one minor point which could become a major one if the worst scenario arises where the Minister does not make a contribution of £60 million until the end of the seventh year from vesting day.  As this legislation stands this is possible.  I ask the Minister for an assurance that a requirement will be included in the legislation to ensure accrued interest is paid in instalments.  A situation could arise where the capital sum and the accrued interest would not be paid until the end of the seventh year.  In such a situation, one would be dealing with an under-funded pension fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Howard raised an important point.  He pointed out the possibility that under this legislation interest might not be paid until the end of the seventh year.  That is not an abnormal commercial transaction.  In financial slang it is known as a bullet payment, one simply defers interest until the last day. This often suits people particularly in commercial life where they do not have the money to pay interest, although they anticipated having it.  It also suits governments and this is what worries me; this is no reflection on the Minister so I do not want him to get defensive.  Governments, regardless of hue or political shade, may defer payments until some other poor unfortunate must find £60 million plus accrued interest further down the road.  I accept the Minister's assurance that there will be a provision of £12 million in the next budget for this &mdash; at least he has made representations in this regard.  I notice the Minister is waving his hands&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am worried that only one payment might be made and that no payment will made for the next six years. Senator Howard was right when he made this important point.  There is too much flexibility on the Government side, but there is none on the other side.  The temptation is there for any Minister for Finance or anyone else to postpone payments so as to remove an immediate worry.  In two or three years time in a politically dangerous situation, or in five years time when another Government is in power, there is a danger that a Minister or Government will decide to defer the payment of £60 million for another four or five years.  That would be a saving of £36 million.</P>
      <P>Another point relevant to this amendment relates to the rate of interest to be charged.  Whatever about payments which will be made eventually &mdash; there is a commitment in the legislation that it will be made &mdash; section 41 (11) states:</P>
      <P>Where any part of the contribution under subsection (10) remains unpaid for any period after the vesting day, interest shall be payable by the Minister for Finance to the trustees appointed under subsection (9) at such a rate as the Minister for Finance may determine in respect of the period on the amount so unpaid.  It is unacceptable to give such a power to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should the Minister for Finance, the borrower of this money, decide the rate of interest to be paid?  It is outrageous. A formula where the rate of interest is related to the Central Bank's short term facility rate, the cost of living index or something outside the arbitrary power of the Minister for Finance should be included in this legislation.  I reserve the right to put down an amendment to this effect on Report Stage.  I do not know whether such a provision is included in other legislation.  I am sure the Minister will tell me this is normal in legislation relating to semi-State bodies.  However, it is unacceptable that the Minister for Finance should determine the rate of interest in this regard.  It should be calculated <Col N="520" /> on a less partisan basis, such as the STF rate or the cost of living index.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross's contribution reminds me of a Kerryman's definition of the parliamentary opposition making a short story long.  Section 41 (11) obliges the Minister to pay interest.  Under subsection (12) the Minister is obliged to make payments not later than seven years after the vesting day. That closes the matter.  Senator Ross said flexibility was on the Government side but with that flexibility comes the obligatory action which it must take in paying the interest and the amount due in the vested period.  The matter should rest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unwise for the Minister for Finance to allow a situation where he would be liable to pay the new company £60 million plus accumulating interest to drift for seven years.  This would put a burden on the Exchequer in the seventh year totalling approximately £100 million.  Normal financial management of the Exchequer would not allow that situation to arise.  It could not sustain that situation as it would put considerable pressure on the Exchequer.  Consequently, this is what we have put into the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am surprised by the way the House has approached the issue.  The Minister for Finance will discharge his liability over seven years.  In contrast, where this has happened in other bodies, for example, An Post and Telecom Éireann, no finite period is imposed on the Minister for Finance to discharge comparable liabilities.  In regard to the two comparable bodies established under the Telecommunications Act, 1983, the onus is on the Minister for Finance to discharge the liabilities as they become due for people retiring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the legislation, we have made a positive step forward.  A figure is owed and a maximum period is laid down.  We negotiated the payment of this figure over a certain period and we are confident it will be shown in the Book of Estimates.  There is an interest penalty for not discharging in totality and the <Col N="521" /> residue will be discharged by agreement over the period.  When a corporate organisation is set up consultants, advisers and actuaries will advise it on liabilities owed. The Minister for Finance has the Central Bank, the National Treasury Management Agency and the Department of Finance to advise him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving my reasons and at the conclusion of my remarks I will inform the Chair of the position.  I invite the Minister to consider the difficulties we have pointed out.  The amendment seeks to oblige the Minister to pay the sum of £60 million within a two-year period rather than seven years. I am concerned that the legislation will be the means by which any enforcement can be effected.  As the Minister has freely admitted, the option is there should the Minister for Finance so decide not to make the payment until the end of the seventh year.  Unfortunately, as emerged in the discussion, that option is also available to the Minister in relation to interest.  Therefore, in view of the fact that my amendment does not cover the situation with regard to subsection (11) and the payment of interest, there is no obligation to pay the interest before the end of the seventh year.  It may well be done over a shorter period.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross raised the question of the rate of interest.  There are three distinct problems arising in relation to this superannuation fund.  There is the £60 million, the interest &mdash; which may or may not be paid and which does not have to be paid, should the Minister so decide, until the end of the seventh year, and the rate of interest.  That has been the value of having a good debate on this measure.</P>
      <P>I am always conscious of the usual fate of Opposition amendments, no matter how effective the argument may be in their favour.  We have identified a potentially serious weakness and I would invite the Minister to take the necessary steps to rectify the situation on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want anyone in this House to be looked upon as neglecting the vital interests of what could be a vulnerable group of people, those coming up to early retirement.  I am withdrawing my amendment because it is too narrow and does not cover the issues raised.  I will consider moving another amendment on Report Stage to cover the issue about which I am <Col N="523" /> concerned.  In the meantime, I hope the Minister can see his way towards eliminating the reasons for my concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister failed, I gather, to answer the important point in subsection (11) about the rate of interest. This is vital.  There may be a formula which is worked out and always used in semi-State bodies but I am not aware of it.  I did ask the Minister specifically to answer the question whether he would link the rate of interest to the short term facility rate of the Central Bank, the one month money market rates or any of the standard rates that are used because subsection (11) is so extraordinarily loose now.</P>
      <P>As I read it, it allows the Minister to pay back the £60 million, plus accrued interest in seven years, at any date in that period to be determined by him and at any rate of interest to be determined by him.  With the best will in the world, if he was acting in the interests of the taxpayer, any Minister would pay the lowest possible rate of interest.  If not, he will be in a dilemma because of a conflict of interests.  In addition, he may, out of self-interest, pay it back at the last possible date.  I am not particularly reassured by the Minister's statement that he will have the NTMA, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance to advise him, because their record of advice to the Exchequer this year has not been particularly good, a point already covered in this debate.</P>

      <P>They cost the State £900 million because of bad advice over devaluation.  Maybe they have a lot of savings.  They have a lot of ground to make up, and maybe they will make it in this area but it will only be in the region of £30 million or £40 million; it will not be the £900 million they have cost the State already.  Maybe the Minister should look elsewhere for advice on matters of this sort because their record so far has been disastrous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as the question of interest, I would also like to ask the Minister about <Col N="525" /> trustees.  The company establishing this fund is to be administered by trustees. How will these trustees be appointed? Who are they likely to be?  What qualifications will the trustees of the pension fund normally have?  Will they be covered and passed by the pensions board, or will they simply be appointed by the company?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had covered the point about the Minister for Finance's obligations in total.  I thought I had made it clear that there is absolute commitment. This is a new step forward and was never covered in legislation before. There is a formula where we have agreed, the total obligation of the Minister for Finance is £60 million.  There is a mechanism where the rates of interest and method of payment can be operated.  It is a matter of negotiation on the formula that is already there.  With his constitutional obligations as the custodian of the finances of the nation in law, the Minister for Finance is responsible for determining these matters.  He will take the final decision based on what has been agreed.  That is the fundamental legal and political discharge of his duty.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross asked about trustees. Trustees will be members of the staff and will be appointed under the Pensions Act.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Recalcitrant&rdquo;.  The Minister may not have been in the House that day.  I am worried that he referred to an existing mechanism for setting the interest rate.  What is this mechanism? He said there will be negotiation of that formula.  Who will conduct this negotiation? My understanding is that it is <Col N="526" /> the Minister for Finance's obligation, on behalf of the taxpayer, to pay the lowest possible interest rate because taxpayers' money will pay the interest on this fund. The Minister will pay as little as possible. He will fix a very low interest rate which will not be in the interests of pensioners who are paid from the superannuation fund.  There is a direct conflict of interest here.  If the Minister fixes a rate which is in the interest of the superannuation fund it will be too high for the taxpayer.  If he fixes a rate which is in the interests of the taxpayer it will be too low for the superannuation fund.  I do not understand how this formula will be devised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to reflect on the Minister for Finance's responsibilities.  Of course he discharges his obligations on behalf of taxpayers and is obliged to obtain the best deal on their behalf.  He will not confine himself to any fixed positions.  The Minister's decision will be based on the information available to him, the agreement which is reached and the finding of a professional, actuarial assessment that £60 million is required.  Negotiations will take place between officials from ANSO and subsequently from the Irish Aviation Authority and Department of Finance officials.  A recommendation will be made to the Minister and his decision will be based on this.  It will be a matter for him whether he agrees with this recommendation in its entirety.</P>
      <P>If there is a subsequent difficulty it will be the responsibility of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, to ensure a decision is made.  Such interaction and collaboration is part of the normal political process by which Governments make decisions.  I have no doubt the Minister for Finance will discharge his obligations equitably and fairly, taking into account his constitutional responsibilities, his financial responsibilities to the taxpayer and his responsibilities to the staff of ANSO and, subsequently, the staff of the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>

      <P>I have a worry in relation to section 41 (14).  This states that &ldquo;a scheme under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made...&rdquo;.  Various Bills passed by this House, in particular the Companies Bill, specify that reports and schemes are to be laid before the House as soon as may be after they are available or made.  Such wording is too vague.  I refer specifically to the report which the Stock Exchange must give to the Department of Finance.  It takes an extraordinarily long time for this report to be laid before the Oireachtas and reach the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is the wording so vague?  Is there any time limit by which this scheme should be laid before the House?  Can it be delayed for years?  A reasonable time limit for such a scheme should be three or four weeks.  It takes years for some schemes, papers and reports to be laid before the House.  Could the Minister <Col N="528" /> assure us that, once this legislation is passed and the scheme agreed, it will be laid before the House within a reasonable time limit such as one, two or three months?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 41 (14) is similar to subsections of previous Bills.  There must be a scheme in position to facilitate somebody who wishes to retire from the company, particularly when they have reached their retirement date, otherwise the person could not be paid, would be discriminated against and would have a very strong legal case against the authority and the State.  We must proceed with the scheme.  As of now ANSO is working on it.  We are confident it will be positive, flexible, and solid and will confer the proper benefits on the staff of the company.  When it is agreed and put in position, it will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It will operate thereafter unless a resolution annulling it is passed by the Oireachtas within 21 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered my question.  I would like an assurance, not about its operation, flexibility or other positive aspects &mdash; I am sure the Minister's assurances on these will come to pass &mdash; but about the time limit in which it will be laid before the House.  The wording &ldquo;as soon as may be after it is made&rdquo; is clumsy and all embracing.  Some of the flexibility of this legislation is absolutely unacceptable and totally lax.  It provides for ministerial power which is unacceptable and far too vague and wide.  The time limit is far too long; it is open ended.  Could the Minister introduce some time limit, even three months, in which we know the scheme will be laid before the House?  This time limit is infinite and could take 20 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The assurance is we will deliver this <i>quam celerime</i>.  In legislation the words &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; mean without delay.  First, this scheme is dependent on vesting day.  Secondly, it is dependent on agreement being reached between the employer, which is the authority, <Col N="529" /> and the staff organisations and unions representing the staff.  I cannot foretell when vesting day will be until this Bill is passed or how long the negotiations will take.  It would be unfair to the staff and the authority to set a date by which negotiations should be completed.  The Senator can be certain we want to establish the scheme rapidly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording states &ldquo;as soon as may be after it is made&rdquo;.  I am not talking about vesting day or anything else.  I am saying once the scheme is agreed &mdash; the Minister is outlining the preparatory problems in agreeing it &mdash; we should specify a date.  This has nothing to do with the difficulties in negotiating the scheme or its features.  Once it is agreed can we not get an assurance on the date on which it will be laid before the House?  I am trying to point out the danger that, once it is agreed, five years could elapse before it is laid before the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the House that it is not my purpose, or that of Senator Ross, to filibuster.  We are examining legislation which took six days to go through the other House.  I think the Minister of State has accepted that from us and he has let us intervene there. I want clarification of section 42 which states:</P>
      <P>Whenever the company requests the Minister to acquire land or a right of impounding, diverting or abstracting water, the Minister, if he is satisfied that such land or right is required by the company for the purpose of the performance of its functions, shall acquire the land or right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what is intended here.  The terms used conjure up all sorts of images of extraordinary happenings.  With the proliferation of certain groups, the imagination of people could know no bounds if one talks about &ldquo;impounding, diverting or abstracting water&rdquo;.  That could involve the draining of a lake, the creation of a new lake or the filling in of a bay.  I want to know what is intended or to what these terms refer in the context of this legislation.  Finally, I assume &mdash; and I simply want the Minister of State to confirm &mdash; that in any of these operations <Col N="532" /> of impounding, diverting or abstracting water, the terms of the planning Acts apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to maintain uniformity and conformity with the 1936 Act.  The terms used were originally used in the 1936 Act and we want the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to have the same powers.  Of course, he or she has to conform in any of their decisions with the planning laws.  The normal procedure is that powers such as this are left with the Minister, rather than handing on other powers to the Authority which would have major legislative and constitutional effects pertaining to the rights of the individual, property rights so on.  The Minister for Defence has similar powers in relation to property of the Department of Defence.  In this situation we are retaining the powers of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about this section because I assume it just refers to the Minister's power to make a compulsory purchase order of land or in regard to water.  I know the Minister said that this provision is in legislation enacted since 1936 but I find it difficult to reconcile this with the ministerial statement and the purpose of this Bill which is that this body should be commercially operating. We are seeing again the operation of a monopoly.  Section 42, on the acquisition of land, basically gives ANSO, through the Minister, the power to ride roughshod over anybody at any time because the Minister will have the power to acquire land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the commercial aspects worry me more.  The price of the acquisition will be decided by the Minister.  In effect, what is being called a commercial company will decide itself, through the Minister, the price of several of its purchases. Could the Minister of State give any assurances about the acquisition of land, the price which will be paid, whether public inquiries will be allowed and if it will go through the normal procedures <Col N="533" /> of compulsory acquisition?  Is that what is intended?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we reflect again on the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, and a similar Act in 1950 when these powers were conferred on the Minister of the day.  They have served the nation well and we believe it is prudent on this occasion to leave the powers with the Minister, to enshrine that in the Act and to make it crystal clear that the powers are with the Minister rather than the Authority.  The effect of this section is to provide that the Minister may use his compulsory acquisition powers to acquire land for the company if he is satisfied that the company needs the land to carry out its functions.</P>
      <P>Section 36 of the Principal Act &mdash; the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936 &mdash; sets out the purposes for which the Minister may acquire land compulsorily. These are to ensure that land near an aerodrome is not so used as to be a danger to aircraft and public safety and that trees and buildings on land adjacent to an aerodrome are demolished if necessary in the interests of public safety and &mdash; added by section 6 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1950 &mdash; for any purpose related to the development of civil aviation where such development affects an aerodrome or any land adjacent to an aerodrome.</P>
      <P>It was decided that the Minister should be enabled to use his compulsory acquisition powers on behalf of the company rather than giving such powers directly to the company on the grounds that it is preferable not to extend the number of bodies which can exercise such rights in relation to other people's property. While requiring that the Minister must be satisfied that the company needs the land concerned for the performance of its functions, we intend to keep the use of this power to a minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, there will be negotiation and arbitration and a consensus will be arrived at in most cases, but we are leaving the power with the Minister rather than giving it to the Authority, which will have the right to discharge it in totality <Col N="534" /> without reference to the Minister.  In this case, it cannot do it without consultation with the Minister who will take the final decision.  That is a safety valve in the interests of people's rights and in the best interests of public safety.</P>

      <P>I would be uneasy if exemption could be granted by the Minister for anything outside rescue services.

    <P>I have an uneasy feeling about this Bill because the explanatory memorandum <Col N="536" /> claims there will not be any cost to the Exchequer.

I would like an assurance that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications does not have a blanket permission to waive flight charges.  Although the Minister has been very helpful and has detailed the categories which must be exempted from charges under international rules, he has not given a reassurance that the Minister, with the permission of the Minister for Finance, may not exempt anybody he pleases.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I take exception to three words in line 43 of page 34.  These three words are &ldquo;are not new&rdquo;.  This refers to:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons employed by Eurocontrol in the State shall be entitled to exemption <Col N="538" /> from customs duties and charges, other than those in respect of services rendered, in the case of the importation of their personal effects, movable property and other household effects which are not new and which they bring into the State on first taking up residence in the State...</P>
    <P>I do not know why it was necessary to include these three words but I can visualise a situation in which they will inflict an unnecessary hardship.  For example, a person coming in from Eurocontrol who is recently married and was not previously the owner of a residence may seek to establish a home within the State for the period of the residence of that new family.  It is permissible to bring second hand goods with them but they cannot bring new goods.  This is unnecessary, unreasonable and unfair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Senator Howard would accept that the world is becoming a more mobile place and people can move around much more easily.  Where a person is asked to discharge their obligations under Eurocontrol and asked to move from one country to another, they may have to dispose of their private property and they will have personal effects they want to take with them.  Their residential property may have to be disposed of, and that is a matter for the people who are moving.</P>
      <P>However, they may have acquired personal effects which they wish to bring with them to their new place of residence. In order to give them the maximum opportunity to move, they are allowed to bring their personal effects.  Obviously if they were bringing in new goods and were given this special facility, it could lend itself to abuse.  This is provided for under the Eurocontrol convention and we are enshrining that condition here as part of our obligation under the Eurocontrol convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that this section puts the provisions of the Eurocontrol convention into the legislation.  Some of <Col N="539" /> them are news to me.  What is the tax status of Eurocontrol?  Under the Bill it will be accorded the same relief from taxes as a foreign sovereign state.  That is an extraordinary blanket status for Eurocontrol. I am at a loss why quite such blanket privileges are given to the staff of Eurocontrol in avoiding customs duties and charges in respect of a large number of items and in avoiding the inspection of their official papers.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the director of Eurocontrol is given super diplomatic immunity when in this country.  I cannot see the reason for this.  The Minister may correct me but I understand that he will only be prosecuted if he commits a road traffic offence.  However, if he commits any other offence he is immune from prosecution.  If that is true, what is its basis?  The man is not, as I understand it, a diplomat in the normal sense of the word.  He is director of a European interstate agency and I cannot see why he has this extraordinary blanket immunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can readily understand it.  Looking at the situation in other parts of the world and at the functions of various international organisations like the United Nations, we find that when there is conflict it is difficult for their staff to impose certain international regulations and laws which are agreed by most of the nations in the world.  If they cannot impose them they cannot succeed in achieving their effect.  We must acknowledge that this international organisation has major international responsibilities which were agreed by the contracting States to the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person who holds this position is basically an aviation ambassador.  As such he must have the facility to move through any territories governed by the convention so that he can satisfy himself, his staff and his organisation that international aviation rules are obeyed.  It is important that nobody is permitted to impede the mobility or the rights of this person in seeking the information and, in some cases, the documentation that is so vital to public safety both nationally <Col N="540" /> and internationally.  That is very important.</P>
    <P>Article 22 of the Eurocontrol Protocol states:</P>
    <P>The staff of the organisation:</P>
    <P>(a)  shall be granted exemption from customs duties and charges, other than those in respect of services rendered, in the case of the importation of their personal effects, movable property and other household effects which are not new, which they bring from abroad on first taking up residence in the territory in question, and in the case of the reexportation of those same effects and movable property, when they relinquish their duties;</P>
    <P>(b)  may, on taking up their duties in the territory of any one of the contracting parties, import their personal motor car temporarily with exemption from duty, and subsequently, but not later than on termination of their period of service, re-export that vehicle with exemption from duty, subject, however, in either event, to any conditions deemed to be necessary in each individual case by the Government of the contracting party concerned;</P>
    <P>Those facilities are to ensure that staff can move quickly, bring their personal effects and motor car and rapidly discharge their obligations and duties on behalf of Eurocontrol in any contracting State and have no excuses for not doing so.</P>
    <P>We all know people, whether they be friends or citizens of this country, who have emigrated and returned.  They usually bring their personal effects from the UK, Europe or the US with them.  In a normal family where a person wishes to bring their personal effects, this facility is available to do so and it is a good idea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two points. One relates to subsection (4) (a) which relates to inspection and access to premises &ldquo;by a member of the Garda Síochána <Col N="541" /> or other person&rdquo; and subsection (4) (b) &ldquo;by any person investigating an accident or other incident&rdquo;.  Legislation was passed in the last couple of years which gave additional powers to Customs and Excise for direct access when following alleged criminals or those who were in breach of the Customs and Excise laws. Why is there a specific reference to the Garda Síochána and not to Customs and Excise officers?  In the absence of a specific reference to customs officers in this part of the Bill, would the term &ldquo;any person &ldquo;apply?  If not, to whom does it apply?</P>
      <P>In relation to &ldquo;any person investigating an accident&rdquo;, the power to appoint people vests with the Minister.  Are they, in effect, being given an elevated status? Usually the people who investigate accidents are technical experts rather than people with expertise in criminal law.  Is the Minister giving legislative effect to extra powers for a member of the public who, in the pursuit of his or her brief under this Act to investigate accidents, will be able to invade people's privacy, in other words, gain access to private property which is a constitutional matter? I am sorry to sound so obtuse but I hope the Minister understands my question.</P>
      <P>Eurocontrol, as Senator Ross said, is being given extraordinary powers because we are signatories to the Final Act.  The Final Act was agreed and what the Minister quoted comes from a document that was agreed by Governments in 1981.  The Single European Act was passed in 1987 and the Single Market came into existence on 1 January this year.  Obviously, matters which affected member states in 1981 in relation to exemption from taxes and importation of goods would now be redundant in light of the Single European Act and the Single Market.  Did the parliamentary draftsman, when he lifted the Eurocontrol Final Act as read by the Minister and placed it in section 48, take cognisance of the significantly changed position in relation to taxes and other duties in member states?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eurocontrol which was set up by member states.  Is Eurocontrol confined <Col N="542" /> to the European Community &mdash; or European Union as it is now &mdash; or is it a Europe wide body which includes non-EC states?  If the latter is true, there could be a conflict between the obligations and privileges of member states of the European Community and those who are not members.  In that regard we are giving extensive legal powers to Eurocontrol.  I would be grateful if the Minister could address those questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>First I will give a list of the member states of Eurocontrol as it has more members than the European Community.  They are: Germany, Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Greece, Turkey, Malta, Cyprus, Hungary, Switzerland and Austria. Members will note that Spain is not a member of Eurocontrol.  Consequently the European Community laws and regulations would not be appropriate because it is a broader base than that.</P>
      <P>Article 26 of Eurocontrol states:</P>
      <P>1.  (a)  The installations of the Organisation shall be inviolable.  The property and assets of the Organisation shall be exempt from any measure of requisition, expropriation or confiscation.</P>
      <P>(b)  The archives or the Organisation and all official papers and documents belonging to it shall be inviolable, wherever located.</P>
      <P>2.  The property and assets of the Organisation may not be seized, nor may execution be levied upon them, except by a judicial decision.  The installations of the Organisation shall not, however, be seized nor shall execution be levied upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.  Nevertheless, in order to enable judicial inquiries to be carried out and to ensure the execution of judicial decisions in their respective territories, the competent authorities of the State in which the Organisation has its headquarters and of the other States in which installations and archives of the Organisation are located shall, after <Col N="543" /> having informed the Director General of the Agency, have access to such installations and archives.</P>
    <P>In response to what Senator Mooney spoke about, the Minister appoints the person to investigate aviation accidents under the Acts.  Under section 48.3, the authority will appoint persons who investigate incidents under this Act.  The section covers a situation which might arise if Eurocontrol were to operate air traffic control in the State.  Persons investigating an air accident would need access to any air traffic control records in any location at any given time.</P>
    <P>Section 48.4 (a) states:</P>
    <P>...by a member of the Garda Síochána or any other person acting in the execution of a warrant or other legal process...</P>
    <P>This would mean any person in the employment of the State.  It could be a representative of the Department of Justice.  Another section of the Bill, Members will remember, referred to similar situations pertaining to a member of the Garda Síochána, a member of the Army or member of the Customs and Excise or people nominated by the Minister. In investigating an accident or anything like that the Minister may have to appoint medical people who would not be in the employment of the State, or other people, to ensure that there was a totality of information available on the accident report.  He must have the facility to appoint these people to assist in carrying out the investigation into the accident. This flexibility gives the Minister the right to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  The more we hear about Eurocontrol the more we learn and the more alarmed we become. The Minister did not reply to a couple of my questions.  Is the director general of Eurocontrol some sort of super safety supremo for the countries which the Minister has just listed?  I wish to know the date of the legislation which he has just cited.  Am I correct in saying that <Col N="544" /> if this director general is guilty of, say, negligence, in a situation where he is dealing with safety, he is totally immune from prosecution in this country?  He will have responsibility for all those countries involved.</P>
      <P>My understanding from this legislation and from what the Minister read is that he is only liable for prosecution for traffic offences.  This is extraordinary and I do not understand the rationale behind it. The Minister goes on to say that the director general is not liable for words spoken or written.  I presume we are talking about libel and slander.  I am alarmed to learn that he is immune from prosecution in everything except traffic offences.  Does this include negligence in regard to safety?  Would this include fraud or criminal offences?  Are we talking about a blanket immunity?  If so, we are why are we giving such immunity?  It is extraordinary that someone should be raised to such a status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between the organisation by which he is employed and the functions and rights which he has while he is the administrative head of that organisation in any of the member states.  The President of the European Commission, M. Jacques Delors, would be in a similar situation in any of the member states of the European Community in that as head of an organisation, carrying out his duties, he has similar facilities.  Obviously there are certain conditions attaching to the employment of the director general as a member of Eurocontrol which cover the points made by Senator Ross.  Article 22, section 7 of Eurocontrol states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>7.  In addition to the privileges, exemptions and facilities granted to the staff of the Organisation, the Director General of the Agency shall enjoy immunity from jurisdiction in respect of acts, including words spoken and written, done by him in the exercise of his functions; this immunity shall not apply in the case of a motor traffic offence or in the case of damage caused <Col N="545" /> by a motor vehicle belonging to or driven by him.</P>
    <P>In other words, while discharging his functions he has this protection in the various States.  He is an administrative head.  He is not the air traffic controller of Europe.  He is administering a system which is internationally binding on the member States who are signatories to Eurocontrol.  This is normal.  He has a very important role and it is important that his mobility, his accessibility to any particular document, place or person is not impeded at any time.  That is the idea behind it.</P>

      <P>That, Senator Ross will be pleased to hear, is somewhat different from those who enjoy full diplomatic immunity in that they are not liable for car parking fines.  I am curious to know how many other international agencies to which this country is a signatory enjoy similar privileges and status apart from Eurocontrol.  How many staff we are talking about, how many people will actually enjoy these privileges and this tax free status?  I am not talking about the director general, but the staff of Eurocontrol.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that because of our increasing legal obligations at international level, if the privileges and status extended to Eurocontrol in this Bill are similarly extended to other international agencies, then a substantial number of people in Europe and elsewhere will enjoy what might be referred to as life in the fast lane at the expense of the ordinary taxpayer.  I am curious as to whether this is an aspect which is increasing.  If so, perhaps we are all in the wrong jobs.</P>

We have to include it here to protect our position in the international aviation system.  The person who has this exemption is the director general.  I presume that, in an emergency, he may delegate functions to a member of his staff but the facilities here are not conferred on other members of Eurocontrol in an open manner.

      <P>I want to return to the question of licensed and unlicensed aerodromes. We had a discussion on this on Second Stage and the clarification we got then did allay my fears.  It would appear there are three licensed aerodromes, namely, Shannon, Dublin and Cork. What is the status of the regional airports? What is the status of flying clubs? What is the status of landing strips?  I want to distinguish between landing strips and flying clubs &mdash; flying clubs have buildings and a landing strip but the landing strip is just that.  What is the function of this Authority in relation to each of these categories?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the State airports first which have to conform to international laws and standards and they are owned by the State.  Second, we have the regional airports.  They are in private ownership but we are obliged to license them when they satisfy the proper criteria. We must ensure that they meet those criteria before they are licensed and they are subject to constant inspections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">

      <P>No, they are licensed. They cannot operate without a licence. Nobody may operate commercially without a proper aviation licence from this Authority acting on behalf of the State, and in conformity with all the international conventions to which we are signatories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third, there are the smaller airports. Where there are regular flights they also <Col N="548" /> have to be licensed.  Then there are the private aerodromes where a person owning a private plane, operating on their own property, would not be licensed.  They would have their private plane and their own aerodrome.  They need to have a licence to navigate into the airspace and their plane would have to conform to specific standards but where they would be landing would not be a licensed area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the costs and the payments for membership of various international aviation organisations. Perhaps the Minister of State could explain why these payments are made by the Minister to these organisations and he is then reimbursed by the company for those payments.  What are they not paid directly by the company to these organisations?  The answer may be that the State is a member of these organisations and not the company.  If so, that is satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Second, would the Minister of State tell me what the cost of membership of all those organisations and the European Civil Aviation Conference would be to the Exchequer?  Third, perhaps the Minister of State would answer the question I have already asked.  It appears that this Bill, and this section in particular, will cost the Exchequer and the establishment of this semi-State organisation will cost the Exchequer, and not just the semi-State body.  How is that statement reconciled with the statement in the explanatory memorandum that it will not cost the Exchequer?  It says: &ldquo;The impact on the Exchequer of the establishment of the company as provided for in this Bill is expected to be neutral at worst...&rdquo; Does that mean on balance or does it mean that in effect it is just the establishment that will be Exchequer neutral?</P>

An organisation or a body within that country cannot be given membership.  The total monetary annual cost to this country is about £2 million and as the Irish Aviation Authority will be the regulatory body managing the aviation affairs of the county in a commercial manner in the years ahead, it would be mandatory on them to refund these costs to the Minister after he had discharged them on behalf of Ireland.</P>

      <P>That is, balancing the costs and recouping the costs expended by the State from the Authority.  The only permanent costs impinging on the Exchequer will be the retention of the special unit in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications advising the Minister on aviation matters and carrying out accident investigation.  The Minister will still be responsible for carrying these costs through the national Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney referred to the conflict as he perceives it between accident investigation and rescue. There is a marked difference. We have a national obligation, and we have an obligation under international law, to provide proper rescue services and to carry out those services, such as recovering people, personnel, equipment and so on, irrespective of cost.</P>
      <P>The investigation of accidents is a different matter, and very costly in certain cases.  An example is the Air India disaster off the south coast of Ireland some years ago.  The investigation of that disaster continued for a long time and was very costly.  The purpose of this section is basically to deal with such situations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, in light of the fact that the bulk of new jobs in the future will be created in the services sector, recognises the need for a determined national effort to develop the services sector to its fullest potential.</P>
      <P>The aim of this motion is not to score points off anyone on either side of the House.  Its aim is to build consensus around a fundamental step, a fundamental shift in attitudes that this country urgently needs to take.  It is the hope of the Independent Senators, Senator Henry and myself, in putting forward this motion to kick start a national debate that has barely begun but is long overdue. In that consensual mood I wish to acknowledge contributions to this issue that have already been made by both the Government and Opposition.  I wish to praise the swift response of the Taoiseach in April when he established a committee to examine the potential for jobs in services following the landmark speech by the chairman of the Irish Management Institute in Killarney.  I look forward to the findings of that committee.  Perhaps we will hear more from the Minister on the progress of the committee in the course of the debate.</P>
      <P>On the other side of the House I wish to commend the initiative of the Fine Gael Party in publishing their recent white paper on jobs through services prepared under the direction of Deputy Richard Bruton.  I understand that Senator Doyle will be speaking on this paper.  It is an excellent study which sets out clearly the strategic issues and the relevant facts and also goes on to make a series of concrete proposals which merit close consideration by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Government will take an open and generous approach to both these proposals and will not be tempted into the sterility of a &ldquo;not invented here&rdquo; policy.  This issue is far too critical for the future of our country to be allowed to become a matter of political point scoring. <Col N="552" /> As I mentioned at the outset, the aim should be to create consensus.</P>
    <P>What is the issue that this motion seeks to highlight and why is it important?  The issue is that we are witnessing the dramatic shift in where jobs are.  Just as a century ago a great shift began when jobs in agriculture shrank and jobs in manufacturing took their place, we are now seeing an equally historic shift.  This time it is away from manufacturing and towards services.  In the future, which is quickly becoming the present, the overwhelming majority of jobs in every developed economy will be in services. According to the most recent forecast, made last week by two British economists, we are heading towards a future where fewer than one job in ten will be in manufacturing.  This is in line with many other forecasts from a variety of sources and, more to the point, it is fully in line with what has already started to happen across the world and here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Since 1982, the number of jobs in manufacturing in this country has decreased by 21,000, while the number of jobs in services has increased by 78,000. During the same period manufacturing employment in the USA, the UK and in most European countries showed a sharp drop and is continuing to fall.  Despite this historic shift, a shift that we can do nothing about, we still have a mind set in this country that leads us to believe that what we should be doing is stimulating growth in manufacture and growth in manufacturing jobs alone.</P>
    <P>When the broad lines of our development strategy was first laid down 35 years ago under Seán Lemass and Kenneth Whitaker it was correct to focus on manufacturing as the main pillar of our growth. It is not correct to do so now in a world that has totally changed.  It made sense 35 years ago to create a tax regime that was skewed quite deliberately in favour of manufacturing companies and to reserve to them and to them alone the expensive battery of State incentives that were being put together to stimulate growth.  It is not correct to do so now in a world that has totally changed.  It made <Col N="553" /> sense 35 years ago to create a stable of State development agencies, such as the IDA, An Bord Trachtála, Eolas and so on that, in contrast to what other countries did, concentrated entirely on nurturing manufacturing companies.  It is not correct to do so now in a world that has totally changed.  That is the situation.</P>
    <P>Even though some of the State agencies have now broadened their scope to include a narrow range of internationally traded service, these agencies, and the State as a whole, regard services as nothing more than a poor relation, a minor side-show that they do not know very much about and, worse still, whose importance they clearly do not understand. It is vital that we understand what is going on here.  We are quite literally living in the past.  We are providing a very expensive response to a world that no longer exists.  That is why we must change.  We must make a leap in our attitudes so that our response is to the world of today and the world of tomorrow and not to the world of yesterday.</P>
    <P>We can make that change if we put our minds to it.  I am optimistic because of the national consensus that now exists about the seriousness of our jobs problem and the national determination to tackle that problem effectively.  If we are serious about jobs it cannot be long before we realise that we must concentrate our efforts on where those jobs are going to materialise.  If we do not do that it only takes a further moments thought to realise that the jobs growth we want is going to come from services.</P>
    <P>At present we are putting 80 per cent of our effort and resources into 20 per cent of the job opportunities.  What we should be doing is putting 80 per cent of our resources into the sectors where there are 80 per cent of the job opportunities. I do not exaggerate, rather I believe that I understate how upside down we have managed to become in our priorities.  We spend £600 million a year seeking to stimulate manufacturing growth where there is no prospect of significant job growth.  In contrast we spend less than £50 million a year, that is one twelfth as much, on stimulating growth in services, <Col N="554" /> the sector where virtually all of the new jobs are going to derive.  In fact most of that £50 million goes on tourism which I have no problem with, but it means that State encouragement for all the rest of the services sector is much less than those other figures would suggest.</P>
    <P>What we are doing is rather like as if we stood at the beginning of the twentieth century when agriculture was on the decline and industry was at the beginning of its massive growth and we decided to forget about industry and put all our resources into creating jobs in agriculture. If we had done that at the beginning of the century it would have been madness.  From an historical perspective that is exactly how stupid our present situation looks.  Unless we change our attitudes now, future generations will condemn our monumental short-sightedness. They will condemn our inability to adapt to a world that was changing in front of our eyes while we refused to acknowledge or to face up to that change.</P>
    <P>This shift towards services is a challenge all countries are now facing. However it is a greater challenge for Ireland than for other countries.  We alone of all the EC partners have chosen to skew our approach towards manufacturing, singling it out and giving it exclusive privileges.  We alone have massively discriminated against our services sector, creating a battery of disincentives and barriers for those operating in the services.</P>
    <P>Therefore we have more chickens coming home to roost.  At a time when we need a healthy, vibrant services sector to take the brunt of our job creation, that sector is stunted by comparison with other countries.  It is smaller and growing more slowly than in other countries, and that is not happening by chance.  It is happening because of policy decisions in the past which we continue to follow.</P>
    <P>Two negative points are often made to downgrade the contribution of the services sector.  First is the notion that services do not bring extra wealth into the economy, while manufacturing does.  The truth is the scope for service exports from Ireland is at least as great as that for <Col N="555" /> manufacturing products.  We have not fully caught up with the great trend of services becoming more international and more freely traded across borders.  It is remarkable that we have not seized that opportunity.</P>
    <P>The portable nature of services compared to products means we are not as disadvantaged by our geographical position. Putting more emphasis on services is the best strategy for coping with our much discussed peripheral position. Many services are now entirely driven by telecommunications and geographical location is almost irrelevant.</P>
    <P>It is also remarkable that we have not put more emphasis on exporting services. We run a deficit to the rest of the world on services of the order of £800 million per year, if tourism is left out of the equation.  I think it should be because it is a special case.  Given that we import that many services, other countries obviously have no difficulty exporting them.  If we apply the principle of import substitution to the services sector and look for opportunities there, we would create the potential for several thousand extra jobs.</P>
    <P>The second negative comment often made is that an economy can only support a limited amount of services and that amount is directly related to how much manufacturing industry is in the economy. I am not opposed to manufacturing in any sense and it is clearly needed.  We need to attract more foreign manufacturing firms to stimulate Irish firms. However the notion that we cannot have more services without more manufacturing is quite wrong.</P>
    <P>There is slack in our economy which could be taken up by the service industry. One can prove this by looking at the level of services in other countries in comparison with ours, making the necessary adjustments for population, earning capacity, etc.  One homely example is that people often complain they cannot find anyone to clean their windows.  That market is not being fully exploited.  It is limited because not enough people are <Col N="556" /> offering that service, not because people do not want to buy it.</P>
    <P>In the past decade in Ireland we have seen service businesses come into existence which were never dreamed of previously. Ten years ago few Irish people had eaten pizza.  It is now a big business. We even export pizzas.  One offshoot has been a new service of home delivery of pizzas.  Similarly there has been a tremendous growth in fast food restaurants because of a lifestyle change which has seen people eat out more than ever before.  The economy seems able to support this development, which creates massive numbers of jobs.</P>
    <P>Just as new service businesses are springing up all the time, the potential future growth from existing concerns can be as great.  Bray, County Wicklow, has one home pizza delivery service.  Some may think that about right for a town with a population of 25,000.  However a similar sized town in the USA would typically support no less than 19 pizza delivery companies.  That gives an idea of the dynamics buried in services and the potential they offer for extra jobs.  I am not suggesting anyone goes into the pizza delivery business in Bray because I know the person running the existing operation and she hopes no one enters that market.  The point is our mind set does not encourage it.</P>
    <P>I harp on about jobs because that is the core issue.  Some 300,000 people are unemployed, yet we put almost all of our job creation effort into manufacturing industry.  That sector contains only 200,000 jobs now and will be put to the pin of its collar to hold on to those.  At the same time the service sector is ignored, although it already employs twice as many people and has the sole potential to make a real dent in our unemployment problem.  We need a change of attitude and that is what this debate is about.</P>
    <P>I am most concerned about the risk of paying only lip service to this challenge. People say this is being taken on board and services are now part of our strategy. Yet the underlying mind set remains the same.  Services are thought of as one more sector instead of being seen as the <Col N="557" /> critical area from where most of our extra jobs will come.  Service companies are not thought as valuable as manufacturing companies, although the impact on the Irish economy of service companies is pound for pound much higher.  That is because they spend more of their revenue on wages and salaries and source more of their inputs in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Most dangerously, services are still thought to be parasitical on manufacturing growth.  The idea is that growth in services can only come after growth in manufacturing and the downstream effect will flow automatically even if it is not stimulated or in fact actively discouraged. These attitudes may have been well founded at one time but they are now misconceptions.</P>
    <P>These misconceptions seem to inform most of our recent job creation initiatives. How much mention is made of services in the Culliton or Moriarty reports? How much mention of them is there in the Government document <i>Employment and Enterprise</i> or in the National Plan debated here some weeks ago?  In all cases the answer is virtually no mention. As long as that is the approach the need for a radical change in our attitudes will remain.</P>
    <P>Services are where the jobs and job opportunities now exist and it is where we must concentrate.  We must put the main thrust of our efforts and resources there.  That is why Senator Henry and I have put down this motion.  It is essential it be debated and attention be drawn to it.  This House must be used to change the attitudes of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I should make clear that Senator Quinn and I did not put down this motion because both our day jobs are in the service sector.  It was done entirely with the good of the country at heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Senator has explained, our perception is that the main area of growth here, as in other parts of the western world, will be in the services sector.  We feel this idea has been largely neglected. The sector is perceived as offering low-paid, <Col N="558" /> low status, part-time and often temporary jobs of limited value to the economy. This idea probably stems from poor employment practices in the past.  Matters have improved enormously in recent years and more progress can be made by putting emphasis on the quality of the service in these jobs.</P>
    <P>Many of the jobs are hard to categorise. It should not be a problem that many are part-time.  For example, Denmark, a rich member of the EC, has a high number of part-time jobs.  In the future it is likely many more jobs will be part-time, perhaps even seasonal, at Christmas or in the summer.  We must be more flexible in our outlook.</P>
    <P>Because we recognise that some jobs in the service sector are part-time and may be solely contract based, it is important to integrate the tax and social welfare systems.  I welcome the card introduced by the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton. It will be much easier for people to get in and out of employment and back on to social welfare benefits.  People are often hesitant to take a job for two weeks because while they will receive their social welfare payments it may take weeks to reacquire the fringe benefits. However, a job for two weeks can lead to one for a longer period, perhaps year round.  Anything which makes the system more simple and efficient is urgently needed.  That is why I welcome the introduction of the social security card.</P>
    <P>We are highly suspicious; if people say they have been working for six weeks, we are inclined to think they have been working for three months.  Having a more generous attitude towards people with regard to the tax and social welfare systems would be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with the public service &mdash; civil servants, nurses, gardaí, the medical profession, teachers etc. These jobs are created by the State, but since people in the public service use the services of others, the value of their being in employment must not be dismissed as though their money will not go into the private sector.  However, it is the private sector on which I wish to concentrate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> It is amazing that the private services sector is there at all, never mind flourishing, because it has been given little encouragement.  It is heartening to see that the county enterprise boards are now encouraging service industries.  That much maligned organisation, FÁS, can be praised for promoting training courses which help people get into these industries. These schemes are important because if people do not have the necessary training, it is difficult for them to project a good image of the job and to produce good jobs.  We have only recently become aware of the value of training.  It must also be remembered that when we run training courses we are providing jobs for the teachers.</P>
    <P>Many high quality jobs will produce higher quality services and existing services are greatly increased by in-service training schemes.  Established industries here are slow to introduce these schemes. I will not refer to the retail sector in the presence of the master, who recently won the John Sainsbury Award for the best supermarket in the British Isles, but retraining in the retail area, which experiences constant changes in practice, is often essential and there are only some stores in this country &mdash; which I will not name &mdash; where this is carried out.</P>
    <P>We are beginning to expect a higher quality of service.  Last weekend, many newspapers ran a half-page advertisement on the Register of Electrical Contractors of Ireland &mdash; RECI &mdash; and the slogan, &ldquo;You are in safe hands with RECI&rdquo;.  This shows that quality of service is important and the acceptance of getting an electric shock is a thing of the past. Now whoever does our electrical work must be well qualified.  This is good because it raises the status of service jobs.</P>
    <P>We should also look at areas in which we have been successful and see what we can learn from them.  Too often we have been afraid to set up services for the fear that they may close others down.  For example, when courier businesses began, many said they would shut down An Post. There are many motorcycle couriers all over Dublin &mdash; there are eight pages of <Col N="560" /> them in the Golden Pages &mdash; and An Post is still operating.  The courier services have become a popular business and while I cannot see people staying employed as couriers into old age, the setting up of these services, as Senator Quinn said when he referred to pizza deliveries, made us think more about the opportunities that are out there.  Indeed, what about the Golden Pages?  It has been so successful that it has now sponsored the Dublin City Marathon for the past two years.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the subject of advertising. If we have better quality goods, it is essential that we have better quality advertising to market them not only at home but abroad.  Small businesses can find advertising extremely expensive and the promotion of advertising for them would be worthwhile.  We are adept at distribution and organising services.  For example, Aer Rianta set up duty-free shops in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in the old Soviet Union.  We lack the imagination, however, to go into other areas.  Distribution is a problem for small firms exporting abroad.  Do we make enough effort to help them?  A lack in the areas of advertising and distribution can be important reasons for the failure of businesses.</P>
    <P>We have done well in other areas abroad.  Our music industry has produced successful acts &mdash; U2, Mary Black, Chris de Burgh, John O'Connor, etc.&mdash; and I was delighted to hear that there will be a concert of Irish performers and musicians in the National Concert Hall within the next few nights.  We are the only country in Europe that has held the Eurovision Song Contest three times.  This is not only important for the music industry but also for employment in the backup services. Our burgeoning film industry only recently received help.</P>
    <P>Another recent export is the public house.  Not only has it given employment but it has also enhanced our image abroad.  The Irish pub is a good place to go to have a good evening when one is in Munich, Paris or Copenhagen and it has introduced our products to markets abroad.  We are also doing well in art and <Col N="561" /> design.  Design has improved many of our small towns.  Our shops have better designed small fronts and art is bought by those working here and by people visiting Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have an international track record in language skills and have good summer language schools.  There are some English language schools going on all year round but could they not be promoted to a greater degree?  In-service training is necessary if we are to be more successful in selling on the international markets. The need for information is also important. It is difficult to get information here and no one knows more than Senators how important this can be.  Public relations is also a vital area.</P>
    <P>I know a great deal of money is being spent in the tourism area but so much of it seems to be going into golf courses.  I wonder if people are going to arrive at Rosslare and travel all around the country to play golf.  We should aim at improving the roads for cycling, and investigate the possibility of providing cookery and walking holidays, etc.  Financial services do not consist only of tower blocks; they are made up of accountants working with secretaries.</P>
    <P>We should also look more at recycling. The Rehabilitation Institute and travellers organisations have had to show us the way in this regard.  A throw-away society is no longer acceptable.  Older skills should be utilised.  We should concentrate on the sectors in which we have expertise and raise the quality of those domestic skills that are under-emphasised. When I go to work, I see a laundrette in Lesson Street &mdash; The Press Gang &mdash; doing great business.  There are similar laundrettes &mdash; the Iron Maid in Blackrock &mdash; with evocative names.  More emphasis should be given to these basic skills and this in turn could create more jobs.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>After &ldquo;potential&rdquo; to add the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;and notes that the Task Force established by the Taoiseach to <Col N="562" /> identify the measures which can best be implemented to develop this potential will be reporting shortly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I welcome this non-contentious motion put down by Senator Quinn and Senator Henry, and the consensual approach Senator Quinn advocates on jobs in the services sector.  It is good to see there is common ground across the House in the employment area because it is the most pressing economic, social and political problem we face.</P>
    <P>The sectoral changes to which Senator Quinn referred on the composition of the labour force is borne out here, as it is elsewhere.  For example, in the 20 years from 1971 to 1991, the numbers employed in agriculture dropped by nearly 44 per cent.  In manufacturing, the figures were approximately the same, but there was a growth of over 41 per cent in the services sector in the same period. We are well in line with other countries in terms of the labour force composition. In fact, it is worth mentioning that over the last two decades, this same shift has occurred in all western economies and some statistics are enlightening in this regard.</P>
    <P>There were 59 per cent of people working in the services sector in 1968; in 1991, that figure had jumped to 72 per cent.  In the EC, 44 per cent were involved in services; in 1991 that figure increased to 62 per cent.  In 1968 42 per cent of jobs in Ireland were in the services sector and that has now increased to 57 per cent. This trend proves that the future for new jobs is in the services sector.  The figures in the United States are even more interesting.  Over the past 20 years 34 million new services jobs were created of which 30 million were for women.  The services industry has provided a major outlet for the increasing number of women seeking jobs in the labour force. Since 1988 there has been a net increase of 33,000 in the number of services jobs in this country, of which 30,000 are for women.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a few general points about the job situation and the National Development Plan.  The plan provides <Col N="563" /> the greatest investment programme and opportunity in the history of the State and jobs are not created without investment. Over recent years we have had respectable economic growth compared to our European partners.  However, it is still not good enough, given the 25,000 new entrants each year into the labour force. Our labour force is growing at almost three times the EC average.  This means we must run fast to stand still.</P>
    <P>We need a sharper focus.  I hope the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> negotiations will focus on job intensity and economic growth in the years ahead, because this has been disappointing in the past.  We need a more active and innovative labour market intervention régime which is designed &mdash; I know this will be close to Senator Quinn's heart &mdash; to complement an enterprise culture as opposed to a dependency culture.</P>
    <P>Services are vital for the future of the Irish economy, but our services sector is under-developed by international standards. On a positive note, I congratulate the Taoiseach for establishing the task force on services.  Like everyone else, I await with interest the outcome of that study.  Services will be the engine for future net gains in job creation.  A recent study by FÁS and the ESRI for the period 1990-96 shows that services are expected to increase by 58,000 as opposed to a decrease of 29,000 in the agriculture sector.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that I must agree with the thrust of what Senator Quinn said.  We need to review our policy.  I do not want to go overboard in relation to the manufacturing area but manufacturing jobs are important in terms of added value and so on. However, what we need is a better balance across sectors in terms of industrial and Government policy.  For many years the main thrust of industrial policy has been predominantly towards the manufacturing and agriculture industries.  We need a change in emphasis and balance and I think we will get that.  In terms of the Taoiseach's task force I would like <Col N="564" /> to think measures will emerge giving a better balance in relation to policy.</P>
    <P>We are in the dark when it comes to the services sector because there is a shortage of data for a number of reasons. We need a national study which will give us the hard facts about the services sector.  It is difficult to get hard data not least because there is such a variety of service industries that are difficult to classify. In addition, it is fair to say that a range of services provided in the services area are in the grey or black economy &mdash; and this may include the window cleaning to which Senator Quinn referred.</P>
    <P>It is desirable to move from the grey or black economy into the white economy and I do not say this in a negative sense. The agenda for the development of the services sector should be like the manufacturing one, in other words, there should be a reward for enterprise, endeavour and risk taking.  In this context, it is vital for start-up service industries, particularly the smaller types, to enjoy the same incentives as the manufacturing sector.  In other words, a service which is sold should attract the same incentives as a product which is sold by a manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to some of the barriers which exist.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, is aware of these barriers, administrative and otherwise, and he has set up a task force to deal with them.  Nonetheless, it is worth repeating that they are in the control of the administrative and political machine.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to seed capital or venture capital.  Last year, when I had the honour to Chair the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment, the first difficulty we identified for small enterprises and entrepreneurs was a shortage of venture capital, particularly for women entrepreneurs.  It is important that a person starting a business should have to fill in as few forms as possible and these forms must be straightforward.  Furthermore, there is the ongoing difficulty of having a sufficient capital base or support to get over the first few critical years and to make progress thereafter.  Perhaps the Minister would consider financial <Col N="565" /> support for entrepreneurs, including those in the services sector.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quinn that there must be support for policy initiatives in the services area, but not at the expense of manufacturing.  However, priority must be given to services because there is potential for future jobs in this area. We must also support policy initiatives which are labour-intensive.  I agree with the point already made that there is a lot of scope for greater activity in the services sector, especially in international trade services.</P>
    <P>One must acknowledge that accountability is necessary in the operation of public service machinery.  There is no doubt that the burden of bureaucracy is weighing down those who are trying to do business.  Red tape is the traditional enemy of enterprise.  In this context, it is worth noting that a recent study by the chambers of commerce identified 39 pieces of off-putting legislation which had to be complied with.  In addition, each piece of legislation is subdivided into extra regulations.  It is a network of rules and regulations.  There are now 85 further regulations associated with the Factories Act, 1955, which must be complied with.</P>
    <P>Accountability is necessary and one needs a set of rules and regulations to adhere to.  However, the present system is crazy.  It is excessive and forms a disincentive. It was against this background that the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, set-up his small business task force which includes business people who are aware of the practical problems.  I would like to hear how this task force is progressing and I hope it will report its findings in the near future.  What appeals to me, and frustrates me, is the fact that our administrative systems are within our control.  It is one thing to talk about the vagaries of international trade, recession and so on, but we have structures and systems within our control which are preventing job creation and frustrating entrepreneurs.  It is in that context that I appeal for immediate action on our administrative systems to facilitate job creation which is the most urgent problem facing us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with Senator Hillery I welcome the motion before the House.  Senator Quinn kindly remarked that my party recently produced a White Paper on jobs through services.  The creation of a jobs economy is Fine Gael's top priority.  The policy paper &ldquo;Towards a Jobs Economy&rdquo; set out the broad quality approach to achieve this.  If we are to tackle the job crisis we must adopt a radically different strategy at every level. We need to encourage enterprise, open up opportunity, strip away unnecessary regulation, build on our strength and competitive advantage, reward excellence, and experiment and tolerate the occasional failures that will occur.</P>
      <P>At the outset it must be said that fine tuning existing economic policies will offer no hope of producing major advances on the jobs front.  Irish unemployment is simply too large and the prospective entrants to the labour force are too numerous.  During the last 20 years the services sector alone has achieved substantial growth in employment.  In the period 1981 to 1992 there was a decline in industrial employment of 21,000 but the services sector achieved growth of 76,000.</P>
      <P>As Senator Quinn said, despite this our employment strategy has relied almost exclusively on the industrial sector.  Total support for the industrial sector runs at more than £600 million per year.  In contrast the total public expenditure on support for the services sector, including tourism, comes to less than £50 million per year.  The services sector in Ireland is still not achieving its potential. Employment growth in Irish services has been slower than in any other European country.  It must be stated that the sector itself remains small compared to other European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Services are far more labour intensive than manufacturing.  The proportion of output devoted to wages and salaries is 35 per cent in the services industry and twice that in the manufacturing sector. The services sector alone sources a significantly higher proportion of its purchases of materials and services in Ireland than the manufacturing sector.  In that <Col N="567" /> sector, despite the IDA's best efforts, the job losses continue to outstrip employment creation by a big margin.  The £13 million investment in AST research, an American owned company, will provide 350 jobs within six months and 600 jobs over a three year period.  However, it would require 40 similar type manufacturing plants, providing 24,000 jobs every year, to make any lasting impact on the deteriorating unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>The best estimate is that the IDA will barely match its 1992 performance when it secured 12,000 new jobs.  That has not been helped by the decisions of Telecom Éireann and Irish Steel in recently revealed plans to reduce their workforces by 2,500.  Other job casualties include 1,280 in Aer Lingus, 250 in Amdahl in Swords and yesterday's sad announcement that Neodata propose to relocate 450 jobs in the US.  My colleague, Senator Neville, will comment on the effects that will have in County Limerick and County Kerry.</P>
    <P>In the last three years, the IDA has created 38,000 jobs but there were over 48,000 redundancies, not counting those leaving agriculture.  In contrast the services sector does not experience the same pattern of rapid change and redundancy. As I said earlier, structural changes are needed in key areas and thorough structural reform of the tax system is now urgently required.  Taxes on work are too high while taxes on leisure are too low.</P>
    <P>My party believes that the first priority is to make tax changes that ensure adequate reward for enterprise in the services area and to remove tax distortions that hamper development of those services.  We have proposed that the corporation tax rate for services should be gradually reduced from the present 40 per cent to 27 per cent, the standard rate of income tax.  We have also proposed that a personal tax allowance will be introduced on a phased basis for labour intensive home delivered services, such as child care, home nursing and home help.  VAT rates should also be realigned in order to reduce VAT payable on labour intensive services.  In <Col N="568" /> order to relieve the compliance costs for many small and start-up businesses, the threshold exemption for registration for VAT should be raised by £10,000 to £25,000 and £42,000 in two respective categories.</P>
    <P>We also propose, in line with the Culliton report, that business development services provided by the State will be made equally available to the services sector as to the manufacturing sector. The services sector should have equal access to assistance to assess the feasibility of projects, to support their marketing efforts, to improve design and innovation, to get the assistance of a business mentor and to technical advice and assistance.  Small businesses should also be assisted with meeting the requirements of new legislation on the tax and welfare system to make it easier for them to understand these changes.</P>
    <P>Tourism has a major role to play in job creation and could be important in reducing unemployment in our capital city.  I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy S. Brennan, is here and I hope he will bear my remarks in mind. Between 1987 and 1992 employment increased in Dublin by 16,000 while unemployment increased by 54,000. There are now 345,000 people at work in Dublin and 95,000 people out of work. In certain areas of the city the unemployment rate is running at 70 per cent. It would require 10,000 new jobs a year until the end of the century to meet Dublin's requirements and the main source of growth can be through tourism and the services industry.</P>
    <P>Tourism must be vigorously promoted and we must make use of Dublin's all year round attractions.  Above all, we need a national convention centre that would hold 2,000 people.  I spoke about this when we were debating the National Development Plan and I hope the Minister will give this requirement his special attention and pass on my remarks to the Government.  It would have a galvanising effect on tourism development.</P>
    <P>Birmingham has made such an investment. In common with other cities which fought their way back to economic <Col N="569" /> growth through tourism, it is now finding that the convention centre is its core investment.  It spawned 22 hotels and airport and retail development totalling £2.5 million new investment.  Tourism related jobs in Birmingham have increased from 10,000 in 1975 to 100,000 last year.  The conference centre itself has led to the creation of 15,000 additional new jobs.  If Dublin was given this facility it would go a long way to help reduce unemployment there.</P>
    <P>Given the necessary changes to our tax system and with support for the services industry, this sector can provide jobs for the future.  For that reason I am pleased to support the motion before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the motion.  This has been a very useful debate so far and I will support the motion and the amendment.  Tonight of all nights one sector of the services industry will be extremely busy, and that is the pub industry.  It is an appropriate night for us to debate the services sector.</P>
      <P>As Senator Henry said, it is more difficult to categorise this sector than the agriculture or industrial sectors.  Therefore, it was timely that a task force was set up recently to investigate the entire area.  One of the reasons we have not concentrated on this sector is that it is so diverse.  Sometimes it grows in spite of Government policy rather than because of it.  Many aspects of this sector are market-led rather than controlled or organised in a particular way.  That is a good reason we should debate the services sector and investigate how we can encourage further growth and jobs in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members on all sides of the House referred to statistics which show this has been a growth area over the past number of years.  Senator Hillery referred to predictions from FÁS and the ESRI which suggest this sector will develop in the future.  As Senator Quinn said, we must face the fact that the area of job creation is changing dramatically.  Technology and agricultural methods have developed to such an extent that we can produce what we need in terms of agricultural products <Col N="570" /> and manufactured goods with fewer people than we needed in the past.  That is the problem in these sectors.  We no longer need the same number of people to produce food and manufactured goods.  Consequently those sectors are finding it difficult to maintain employment. This is especially obvious in the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>We are now focusing on an area where there is potential for growth, the services sector.  In the past 30 years the total number at work has grown by only 60,000, yet the population has increased by almost one million.  Over that period approximately 0.25 million people have emigrated and unemployment has increased fivefold.  We must look at the potential for future growth in the services industry.</P>
    <P>OECD figures suggest that while there has been growth in the services sector as opposed to other sectors, it has not been high in percentage terms in comparison with other OECD countries.  According to my figures, the sector grew by 1.7 per cent annually between 1973 and 1990. We are fourteenth on a list of sixteen countries in this regard.  Growth has been steady but slow in areas like distribution and finance.  Although there has been growth in transport and communications, it has been in output and activity rather than jobs because it depended on the semi-State sector.  Economic factors and a lack of money meant that jobs were not created in that particular area.  As Senator Hillery said, many jobs in the services sector are on the edge of the white economy.  Other jobs are in the black economy, particularly in the area of domestic services like window cleaning, house painting, child care and other services to householders.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn referred to pizzas and the food industry.  There is room for growth in that area, but I am not sure what Government intervention can do in this regard as this relates to culture. Americans eat a lot of pizza, we are now eating more than we used to.  The average French family eats out once a week while the average Irish does not.  I do know how Government policy can influence cultural <Col N="571" /> aspects like this.  On the other hand, we go to public houses more frequently than other nationalities.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senators' comments in relation to exports and tourism, which brings people to this country to spend money.  We must study this area and provide funding and direct backing in the area of marketing.  The marketing of goods and services has been referred to in this House on a number of occasions. We need to sell our goods and services. This Government has a strong policy on developing markets, networks and contacts in other countries.  Given our small population, hopes for expansion must be in the area of exports because the home market is so small.  Our only hope for growth is to sell to other countries by developing marketing and trading links.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle referred to Neodata and I accept his concerns in that regard.  Jobs will not be lost before March 1994.  There is still time for the company, which employs 5,000 people world-wide, to seek alternative employment for these people in the areas they deal in.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment indicated the need to intervene and help the company to find alternatives as soon as possible if the current work is to be relocated to Boulder, Colorado.</P>
    <P>We must concentrate on companies based and run by people in this country rather than be dependent as we have been in the past on companies run by people from outside.  I agree with Senator Henry's comments that the county enterprise partnership boards should play a positive role in this area as they are closer to the coal face and the community.  In the past people who came to me with job ideas believed there was no niche for them because they were providing a service rather than manufacturing a product. These people have now received a welcome from the county enterprise partnership boards and officers.  I believe the boards have a role to play in the development of the services sector and I hope they are in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery gave statistics which highlighted the strong role of women in <Col N="572" /> the services sector.  The county enterprise partnership boards should provide an important link in this regard.  A section encouraging women to set up enterprises has be established under the NOW programme in the Plassey centre in Limerick. I presume it is available to people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I support the motion and the task force which has been set up.  I hope we return to this subject in the future.  While a lot of research has been done and action has been taken in regard to the agriculture and manufacturing sectors, this sector is the Cinderella of policy making.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief contribution and will not be taking the time allocated.  The services industry accounts for a very high percentage of employment in Ireland and consequently there is an urgent need to develop the sector to its full potential.  That is what is being sought in this motion.  Up to now, in any discussion on the question of industrial development involving the IDA, the question of grant aiding the services sector was ruled out immediately. It would not be entertained.  I understand that the enterprise boards will now grant aid the services industry and, consequently, the position must be clarified as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The decline in the number of jobs in the manufacturing industry gives this issue an air of urgency.  One was always complementary to the other but the main emphasis was on manufacturing and on some jobs in the services sector.  At home and abroad, maintenance and catering were defined as manufacturing jobs but now that they are being contracted out, they are defined as service jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force referred to in the Government amendment should address this matter.  It should also do something to convince the Irish people that a 5 per cent swing towards purchasing our own manufactured goods would make a significant difference to the economy and the creation of jobs.  If the £13 billion import bill could be reduced by a quarter, it would impact on the 300,000 who are <Col N="573" /> unemployed.  Clothing, accessories, textiles, fruit and vegetables, animal feeding stuffs and cereal preparations account for a high percentage of our imports.  Recent figures indicate that over £54 million is being spent on imported biscuits and £23 million on imported toilet paper.  Beer and alcohol imports amount to £45 million and £39 million is spent on imported lemonade.  With 300,000 people unemployed, is it not outrageous to spend that kind of money on imports?  That is why it is urgent to tackle this whole question. We must have a policy to cater for the services industry and the task force must identify sectors that can be targeted to give results as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The entire taxation structure must be looked at, as well as the VAT increase on clothing in the last budget.  There is widespread evidence of job losses as a result of that increase because, with VAT at 21 per cent, it is cheaper to import.  A personal tax rate of over 40 per cent and PRSI imposes a great handicap on the services sector.  If the development of that sector, for the purpose of job creation, means investing and spending Structural Funds then it would be money well spent.  I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and the addendum to it.  I compliment the Independent Senators who moved this motion.  It is relevant to highlight the potential of the services sector.  For a long time I have felt that the potential of manufacturing industry, as opposed to other sectors in the economy, has been given far greater emphasis than it deserves.  It is quite clear that there are several sectors within the services area which could produce significant economic growth and increased employment if those sectors received the kind of support and encouragement they deserve.  I would like to mention a couple of areas where I feel such potential exists and where cognisance of this motion would be of great assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, there is the tourism and leisure area.  If any major investment, foreign or Irish, is proposed, we do not have any agency to examine it.  For instance, a <Col N="574" /> few years ago Centre Parks, the largest leisure agency in Europe, proposed to invest £50 million in a tropical water facility in this country.  We lost the facility for the simple reason that the IDA could not consider it because it was not a manufacturing industry.  We did not have any agency with the ability to put a package together which would have brought Centre Parks here and created 200 jobs. We did not consider that those 200 jobs were worthwhile.  The IDA still does not have the ability to put forward a package for a service company like Centre Parks that would be prepared to invest in this country.  A significant amount of international, mobile investment is going to other countries and passing us by because we do not have a mechanism to put a package on the table for such companies. That is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>Second, not too long ago a proposal was put to the IDA and the Government by a medical facility in the United States to set up a major hospital here for the treatment of patients from the US.  I am satisfied the reason we did not get it was that we were not able to put a package together and did not think the jobs which would be created in that facility would be worthwhile.  That new hospital is being built in Scotland with an investment of £150 million and 1,500 jobs.  We let that project pass us by.</P>
    <P>Third, another area where the service sector has much to offer is the field of communications, particularly tele and data communications.  The IDA is certainly very much to the forefront in doing significant work in this area.  The Government, however, is not providing sufficient support.  Sufficient importance is not being attached to the need to set up, for instance, an international tele-centre. Such a centre could attract companies to establish their marketing headquarters here.  They could avail of worldwide tele, data and network communications at a more competitive cost than in other European countries.  Dell in Bray is an example of a company creating prestigious jobs.  We must have the structures and facilities as well as being able to provide those companies with telecommunication <Col N="575" /> links at the right price, if they are to locate here.  Those are just three areas where we are not serious about wishing to develop the services sector.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt our economic future lies in our ability to make Ireland the most prestigious destination in Europe for foreign visitors, yet we treat tourism as our Cinderella industry.  In recent years we have made considerable strides in the development of Ireland as a major visitor centre.  However, we would search the world for a company to develop a manufacturing plant which would provide 100 jobs, whereas if the expected establishment of a hotel or other service enterprise did not materialise, we would not consider it a significant loss.</P>
    <P>The greatest example of how our Government ignores the potential of tourism is our treatment of car rental. Our car rental costs are the most expensive in Europe.  We insist on charging the same high levels of import duties and taxation on cars for hire as we do on other cars.  We insist on ensuring every foreign tourist is screwed &mdash; I use that word advisedly &mdash; when hiring a car.  The Minister and Department of Finance should apply the law of diminishing returns and reduce the cost of car hire. This would make Ireland far more attractive as a tourist destination.  I ask the Minister for Finance, through the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, to look seriously at aspects of our taxation policy which make it impossible to develop the services sector.</P>
    <P>About two years ago a German travel operator asked the Department of Finance if he could pay reduced excise duties on camper vans he was bringing to this country.  He started operating four years ago with around 50 vans.  He increased this to 100.  He wished to increase this further to 200 to attract Germans to Ireland from April to October.  He paid £8,000 in excise duties when he brought in the additional camper vans.  He was prepared to take them out of the country in October or to agree with the Department <Col N="576" /> of Finance to pay £3,000 rather than £8,000 in excise duties.  The Department's response was that he was to pay the larger amount even if he was to remove the vans from Ireland at the end of the summer.  As a result of the Government's response to his efforts to attract tourists, his company, Ireland Tours Individual, did not go ahead with this plan to develop the camper van industry. The company still attracts several thousand tourists to Ireland each year.  The Department's attitude is typical of that which exists towards the services sector.</P>
    <P>I compliment Senator Quinn on this motion.  I hope the Minister takes on board what he has heard during this debate and that it will be the commencement of a debate on the potential for job creation and economic growth throughout the services sector.  This is the way to create the jobs we so desperately need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the motion but warn against polarising manufacturing and services as if they were mutually exclusive.  There is a great deal of overlap and blurring between them.  It is not a question of one or the other. I appreciate the relative importance of manufacturing as an employer is declining throughout the industrial world. However, the proportion of our labour force in manufacturing is still extremely low by the standard of the industrial world.  We have nowhere come close to the peaks from which others are declining. We need not follow precisely the same chronology of decline of other more industrialised countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of our problem in manufacturing is we have not identified the fundamental issue which dogs our efforts to sustain economic growth in that area, which is we put a great deal of emphasis on starting new firms and also on attracting multinationals.  Our biggest problem has <Col N="577" /> not been starting firms or the lack of the so called enterprise culture.  International statistics are cited which suggest we do relatively poorly in that area but, on looking at them more closely, they seem to me to be based on false analogies.  Our real problem is developing small firms into medium-sized ones and medium-sized firms into bigger ones.  This is the biggest single challenge confronting us in terms of sustained job creation.  In the manufacturing sector more emphasis should be placed on coping with that challenge.  It is an extremely difficult one. I do not want to underrate its importance but we have not focused sufficiently on it. It is not necessarily a question of capital, grants, subsidies and so on.  Having said that, and keeping in mind the potential that still remains in the manufacturing sector for more focused and sustained growth, I welcome the emphasis on the services sector.  The most important contribution Senator Quinn's and Senator Henry's motion can make is to change our mindset about the potential of that sector.</P>
    <P>It is very striking, when one looks at the Culliton report, that although international services are part of its terms of reference and it contains interesting comments on the services sector, its main thrust concerns the manufacturing sector.  In particular, there is an emphasis on engineering, engineering education and engineers as virtually the sole source of wealth creation.  I am a great admirer of the contribution of engineering education and recognise fully the importance attached to engineers in our economic development but it is very striking that the Culliton report largely dismisses the marketing and languages functions and business management education.  These are held to be peripheral and marginal because the main thrust deals with the engineer, technology and manufacturing. Important though these are, it is the wrong strategic concept to bring to the future of Irish economic development.</P>
    <P>This has implications for educating for the services sector.  The Green Paper on education has a useful chapter, although I have criticisms of it, on enterprise and <Col N="578" /> enterprise culture.  It takes on board a large part of the Culliton rationale that the main thrust of job creation will be in the manufacturing sector.  The type of education it seems to envisage is education for technicians, in many respects low level ones.  There is a role for such education but if we are to further the development of the services sector as we ought, we must take on board the implications of that objective for our education system at all levels.</P>
    <P>While the services sector, of course, employs high technology and is being revolutionised by technology in a number of areas, nevertheless it seems to depend to a greater extent than the manufacturing sector on human and personal qualities.  Therefore, the type of graduate of the educational system &mdash; whether at second or third level &mdash; which one is disproportionately looking for is the type of person who is capable of coping with rapidly changing circumstances and effective personal presentation and has a good general education.  It is on that basis that success in the service sector, in general, is based.</P>
    <P>I deplore the type of mentality which tries to polarise specialist technical education versus general education.  It is unnecessary to have that polarisation, but a good general education is a prerequisite for sustained growth of the service sector.  I hope those who are thinking about education &mdash; and I know that Senator Quinn, wearing another hat, is deeply concerned about educational change at the higher levels of second level &mdash; will keep that in mind.  When one talks about the relationship between education and economic development &mdash; and I believe there has to be such a relationship, education has to be for personal and also national development &mdash; one should have in mind a concept of where the economy is going.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senator Lee for sharing his time with me. I welcome and support this motion.  As a country, we are losing our attractiveness as a manufacturing base because we face stiff competition from eastern Europe <Col N="579" /> and also South America.  We have to look to the service industry to provide the jobs for which we heretofore looked to the manufacturing industry.  We had a bias over the years towards manufacturing. Obviously, such a bias no longer makes any sense.</P>
      <P>As a member of a county enterprise board, I welcome the fact that we are enabled to provide assistance to both manufacturing and service industries. Any enterprise which will create jobs in the county can be supported by the county enterprise board.  This is a welcome development because the brief of the IDA to aid only manufacturing industry has hampered the development of the services sector over the years.</P>
      <P>As a woman, I welcome the growth of the services sector because in countries such as the United States, where this has occurred it has been shown to be an area which is particularly attractive to women. If women can be involved from the beginning as an area begins to grow, they can then get to the top and prosper.  Ireland has a low rate of participation by women in the workforce, although this is improving. The type of women who are now participating in the workforce may have resigned to rear their families and may have now decided that they have the experience and the desire to get involved in the workforce.  The services sector provides an ideal opportunity for them. Therefore, I welcome the growth in this sector.</P>
      <P>The National Plan listed the potential of the international services sector as a growth area for jobs.  Employment in that sector now stands at over 11,000.  This has shown an increase of over 50 per cent in the past five years.  I welcome the commitment in the National Plan to the promotion of the international services sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government must have a commitment to the manufacturing, service and other sectors.  All Government policies must be pro job creation.  Under the National Plan the Government intends to spend £20 billion over the next four to five years which will create 200,000 jobs, <Col N="580" /> but the loss of up to 130,000 is a great tragedy.  Much of our effort must be concentrated on maintaining existing jobs. The difficulties and costs of creating new jobs are so great that all Government policies must be addressed to maintaining existing employment.  I ask the Minister of State to remind his Cabinet colleagues that our policies in relation to taxation and the integration of social welfare and the taxation system are vital in encouraging people to create jobs, to think as employers rather than employees expecting the State to provide jobs for them. We can no longer look forward to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the motion on the development of the service sector.  That sector needs support. Senator Quinn stated that there is a significant shift away from manufacturing to services and that there is an increase in jobs in this area.  Senator Fahey gave examples of enterprises which were lost because we did not have a proper Government agency to look after the services sector.  This is a pity and the Government should place more emphasis on it.  We in the Oireachtas could all consider that our jobs are in the service sector, in that we provide a service for constituents in our representations to Government and so on.  Every profession &mdash; medicine, business and so on &mdash; could be considered to provide services.</P>
      <P>I would like to see service companies protected, not exploited.  I was told recently that when companies which supply supermarket chains, such as L&amp;N, Superquinn, Quinnsworth and Dunnes Stores are renewing their contract, they are told that if they sold a certain amount of products to these supermarkets the previous year, a condition of the renewal of their contract is that they pay back a percentage of what they were paid last year.  This is disturbing and I know of cases where it caused job losses.  I was told that this is a condition of renewing contracts.  I hope that this practice is not widespread and is confined to one supermarket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supermarkets give a great service for which we are thankful and while we often <Col N="581" /> speak in terms of CAP reform, GATT reform and protecting food suppliers, we must also think of the consumer.  I would like to see the consumer protected, especially in the services area.  This sector covers a wide area and services will be needed even more in the future.  I welcome this motion to ensure that companies in the services sector are better looked after.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention job losses.  We had good news in Limerick recently with the announcement of the creation of 600 extra jobs but we had news yesterday about Neodata which was not too good. It was mentioned by Senator Doyle and Senator O'Sullivan and I am sure it will be mentioned again.</P>
    <P>I live ten miles from Newcastlewest and 14 miles from Kilmallock.  Both areas will experience job losses.  It is a pity to see people I know worried about their employment prospects following yesterday's announcement of the transfer of these jobs to the United States.  Maybe with the co-operation of the Minister and Government agencies, other employment will be provided or the company may be persuaded to change its mind and remain in Ireland.  I welcome the motion.</P>

      <P>I welcome the motion. The services sector is very important for employment and is, as many speakers have said, under utilised.  Like Senator Kiely, we are concerned that 400 jobs in the services sector are being terminated next March in the mid west region in Listowel, Newcastlewest, Kilmallock and in Limerick.  This is of extreme concern to the area and I urge the Government that this company be replaced as quickly as possible with a similar industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people involved in this industry have specific skills such as secretarial and typing skills which are readily available. There is an abundance of them throughout <Col N="582" /> the country and many people find it difficult to obtain employment.  It is devastating for these families.  I know several of them, as does Senator Kiely. Most of the workers are women whose husbands are unemployed.</P>
    <P>The company was considered very stable and had been there for a long time. It has provided excellent jobs and many people have made financial commitments on the basis of long-term employment with Neodata.  I urge the Government to ensure a similar replacement industry. The announcement followed on that of redundancies in Alcan in west Limerick and also in De Beers.  Many Limerick people are employed in De Beers.</P>
    <P>The pessimism in the Limerick area is tangible at the moment and we hope this is the last of the losses, although we fear that it is not.  We should not be surprised at this development following the change in Shannon's status.  It was predicted by the Envision report compiled by Envision Marketing Consultants and University College Galway.  When talking about the impact of a change in Shannon's status on industries other than manufacturing industries they said:</P>
    <P>A survey of the largest employers in Galway/Shannon/Limerick region indicated that a reduction in the frequency of US flights at Shannon would result in inefficiencies and increased costs for these companies.</P>
    <P>Data processing companies surveyed in the region (Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Clare and Galway) display a very high dependency on a daily flight service to the US.  Seven such companies &mdash; employing 850 people &mdash; indicated that a change in the present US air service at Shannon would lead to inefficiencies, increased costs and a need to review their siting in Ireland.  The potential to attract other such companies would be greatly diminished by a change in Shannon's status.</P>
    <P>It was predicted by the Envision report that the change would have this effect. We should not be pessimistic but what else does the future hold as a result of this?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> I urge the Government, if it can, to head off such closures.  The impact is very serious for the people in the area.  When one talks about the loss of 400 jobs in Neodata, one is talking about 200 more in firms which supply services to that company.  It is accepted throughout industry that for every job in such a company, 0.6 of a job is created in the economy servicing it.</P>
    <P>If we are to tackle the job crisis we must adopt radically different strategies towards employment.  We must ensure that the services sector which has great employment potential is encouraged.  We must ensure that this sector is viable in comparison to our international competitors.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has produced a White Paper on jobs in the service area which highlights the deficiencies and lack of efficiency in comparison to our neighbours in the area of taxation and so on. I would like to highlight some of the proposals which this party has proposed to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has proposed that the tax distortions that hamper the development of the services should be removed and adequate rewards to encourage enterprise be ensured.  It wants to strengthen the capabilities of Irish service businesses, promote trading opportunity for existing service businesses and identify potential new areas of service where Ireland could develop a skill base.  Fine Gael seeks the removal of the restrictive practices which limit entry to certain service areas and keep costs excessive.</P>
    <P>The high compliance costs for small businesses in dealing with the growing number of State regulations should be reduced and a package of measures should be developed that could attract mobile international service operations to locate in Ireland.  I will leave the remainder of my time to my colleagues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Neville.  I wish to continue the point he was making about the services sector.  We have to ask where we are going in this area.  The Minister is very conscious of what can be <Col N="584" /> created in the small business sector.  He has been speaking about it in the last few months and I have read it with interest. Whether or not it is enough is questionable.</P>
      <P>There is a tendency in this country to eliminate rather than create employment. Jobs are being lost every day and we have not provided the answers.  I have always believed that we must create an atmosphere of motivation and incentive to create.</P>
      <P>Enterprising people with ideas who wish to make progress are unsure of the direction in which they should go.  They are worried because of a general impression that the State asks too much of them from a legal and taxation point of view when they wish to employ somebody. This is why I say that we tend to eliminate rather than create jobs.  It is very serious.</P>
      <P>One example is what is happening in the west of Ireland.  As a Cork man I am particularly aware of the situation in the Limerick and Shannon regions.  If one drives from Gort to Ennis and from there to Limerick one sees that the area depends totally on the Shannon region. This is evident to anybody who takes an interest in the region.  It is obvious that what happened in Limerick over the last few days is relevant to Shannon because of the transport structure.</P>
      <P>I would go further and mention places of which I am particularly proud.  The services sector in the Killarney region does very well but we are now downgrading an airport 50 miles from there and saying another airport should be built in the area.  Are our priorities right?</P>
      <P>It is obvious that Cork airport will suffer if there is an airport in the Kerry region and if the certain other airports in the region are downgraded.  This will result in jobs being lost in areas which have opportunities other regions do not have.  I say that with good will for Kerry because it is an area that attracts many people.  However I wonder about the priorities of Governments.  That issue must be looked at and we should get our priorities right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Neville for sharing his time and I welcome the motion.  There are some areas on which the Minister should concentrate.  Senator Henry mentioned the music and fashion industries which may be more relevant to the manufacturing and export sectors. The Minister should look at those industries because at present we are discriminating against our fashion industry. When a shopkeeper buys from the manufacturer he must pay VAT on the spot whereas VAT at the point of entry has been eliminated.  The Minister should look at that and give our manufacturers in the fashion industry a break, especially this year when John Rocha won the prestigious British Designer of the Year award.</P>
      <P>I am involved in the services sector and I know there is a great burden placed on the small business person.  Somebody once said that people from 14 different agencies call to a small business person, regardless of the sector in which he is involved.  They include the rate collector, people concerned with refuse and water, food hygiene inspectors from the Department of Health, people from IRMO regarding music rights, the factory safety officer, VAT inspector, income tax inspector, PRSI inspector, insurance officer, fire officer, accountants and union representatives.  This puts a great burden on the small business person.  The Minister should look at that problem.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for an interesting and useful debate.  In particular I thank Senator Quinn and Senator Henry for initiating it.  I wish to comment on some of the points made but first I will make some general points.  I will not detain the House as I know the Members have heavy international commitments within the hour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I estimate that there are over 100,000 small firms in Ireland employing fewer than ten people &mdash; the <Col N="586" /> vast majority of whom are in the service industry.  No other figure is necessary to demonstrate that we ignore the services sector at our peril.</P>
      <P>There are many reasons for this increasing trend and it is important for policy makers to be aware of these underlying changes before we commit ourselves to policy changes.  Some of the change in Ireland can be attributed to the decline in agricultural employment.  In 1961 agricultural employment accounted for about 37 per cent of total employment; this had reduced to 13 per cent by 1992.</P>
      <P>The trend in manufacturing must also be considered.  Whereas manufacturing jobs as a percentage of total jobs grew from 24 per cent to 28 per cent from 1961 to 1992, these figures mask some significant developments during that time.  We performed very strongly in terms of output during this period which traditional theory would say should have been translated into thousands of extra jobs.  However, that has not been the case.  We also considerably improved our technological capability and our productivity levels so that the jobs did not necessarily flow from increased output.</P>
      <P>An equally important fact is that many of the traditional jobs that we counted as manufacturing in the 1960s and 1970s are now &ldquo;outsourced&rdquo; to the developing services sector.  As manufacturing companies concentrate more and more on their core activities, many functions, such as cleaning and maintenance, security, payroll and other traditional in-house service activities, have been contracted out to the services sector.  There is a reclassification of jobs between services and manufacturing so it is not fair to take the figures on face value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, we have many demographic and social changes within society, particularly in the developed economies, which are driving the development of the services sector.  The increasingly ageing population in the western economies is driving demand for additional health care facilities and has seen a boom in private nursing homes.  The increased spending power of consumers is considerably driving <Col N="587" /> demand in the tourism sector, for example, for second holidays and for additional leisure activities and facilities. The trend for both partners to work outside the home is driving demand for more retail and home related services.  In this area we have seen only the tip of the iceberg in the increased emphasis on convenience foods and other products.  We have not yet even started to see the vastly under-developed potential for the software and telecom industry as the increased use of and access to data bases become the norm leading to more spinoff jobs.</P>
    <P>The growth in services and the changing pattern of work is vividly demonstrated in the retail sector, a sector in which Senator Quinn is expert.  Employment in the retail sector has grown by almost 5,000 in the four years from 1988 to 1991.  There are two striking features in the statistics for 1988: employment is mainly female and about half of the jobs are full time.  These reflect the trend towards two income families but they also indicate a change in work patterns and habits.  The work patterns give rise to new services particularly in the retail area.</P>
    <P>It is important to admit that the services sector has not been subject to the same analysis as the manufacturing or agricultural sectors.  It is time we changed that.  Whereas in manufacturing we have had a multitude of reports in the past two decades, including Telesis, NESC, Culliton and Moriarity, we have had no in depth analysis of the services sector. We must do more in that area.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach moved to fill this vacuum by setting up a task force on services last year.  I understand that its report will shortly be completed and I hope it will form a useful foundation as to how we should exploit this job creating sector.  The small business task force which I chair has also looked at this sector.  The task force comprises 14 owner managers who are at the coalface of small business and who do not dodge the issues.  I found the task force to be very useful.  We should be in a position to report progress in that area within a <Col N="588" /> few weeks.  We believe that many of the problems associated with starting up or expanding a business, whether manufacturing or service, are common and we are addressing these problems.</P>
    <P>The United States has always, from a policy viewpoint, worked from the notion that &ldquo;a job is a job&rdquo; whether it is in manufacturing or services.  Their support for small business does not distinguish between various sectors.  In fact, they do not support the business as such but regard themselves as supporting the entrepreneur.  During my recent visit to the US on behalf of small business, I was impressed by this philosophy and their candour in admitting that the State cannot pick winners or what type of industry will succeed.  They have decided &mdash; and I believe they are correct particularly in the small business sector &mdash; to support the entrepreneur rather than the sector in which the entrepreneur is involved.</P>
    <P>The task force has been looking at four areas: regulations, finance, advice and markets.  It has looked at the problem of filling forms, to which Senator Hillery referred, and will recommend a long list of forms for abolition in its report.  It will also recommend a significant step forward in the use of computerised data to minimise paperwork and it will make specific proposals in the area of removing regulatory burdens.  We are looking at the question of thresholds, to see whether below a certain number of employees or below a certain turnover or asset, we can eliminate a whole raft of State regulations and European regulations for small firms.</P>
    <P>The key issue the task force identified was the question of access to low cost money.  They are very clear about that. They are not saying they want venture capital, although that is important, they are not saying they want grants, what small businesses particularly in the services sector are saying to me and this task force is that they want low cost finance, fixed for a period.  They tell me that if they know they can have £50,000 at 7 or 8 per cent for a definite three, four or five year period, they can get on with their work.  I was surprised by that finding. <Col N="589" /> I went into the task force thinking that these people wanted venture capital and grants.  These owner-managers of small companies told me they do not really want either.  They want access to low cost finance.  We will have to take that on board.  The Bank of Ireland &mdash; I thank them for this &mdash; responded to my request and that of the task force and introduced a £25 million scheme to make funds available for small companies in amounts of £20,000 to £100,000, and they will give considerable emphasis to small service companies.  That will help considerably.</P>
    <P>There are other matters which I will not go into at this stage because I know the proposers of the motion have to speak again.  We are looking at the areas of public procurement and how to make sure that Irish service companies can get a bigger slice of State contracts and Brussels contracts.  We are looking more at the question of linkage between large and small firms.</P>
    <P>I was very taken by the statistic in Senator Quinn's introduction that we spend more than £800 million per year importing services from other countries and will look into it very carefully.  The question of portability and of import substitution of services has not really been driven home.  When Senator Quinn produced that figure it showed that the argument about the usefulness of services and how services live off manufacturing is not accurate.  If we import £800 million worth of services, then we can provide those services here which prevents us having to import them.  If those other countries can export them, we can do so also.  It is time to put paid to that particular argument.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Lee for his comments about the need not to polarise, and I agree with him about the role of education, particularly to underpin the service industry.  I have also found that start-ups are not as much of a problem as the need to develop existing firms.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Fahey for his point about there not being an agency to attract inward tourism investment.  I attempted to address that problem when I was Minister of State at the Department of Tourism <Col N="590" /> and Trade but I will now take it up with the IDA in particular.  The Senator is right; there is a gap in the attraction market there and I will talk to the IDA about it.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Hillery also for the request he made to produce more hard data.  Senator Doyle's call for a convention centre is taken up in the National Plan, and that is the intention.  Intentions have to be made into reality and that is where the operational programmes come in.  He should keep a close eye on them when they are published.  I share the Senator's concern about the unemployment in Dublin.  The Government has set up various programmes to address this.</P>
    <P>My thanks to Senator O'Sullivan; the county enterprise boards will have to play a key role.  What is exciting about those enterprise boards is that up to now the managers of small service company went to see the TD, Senator or councillor when they needed help.  We did not know where to send people, so we sent them to the IDA, who did not want to talk to them.  There is now a home for them. They can now talk to the county enterprise boards who have funds, expertise and a brief to help small service companies. I look forward to real progress in this area.</P>
    <P>I do not want to detain Members any longer because of our international commitments. Thank you very much.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the national mind is set on Windsor Park, I will be brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We put down this motion to change the national mind so that we would be more versatile and that the establishment and policy makers of the nation would look at this area.  From what the Minister <Col N="591" /> has said tonight, we hope we have changed the attitude of the policy makers.</P>
    <P>I deliberately did not mention women when I spoke.  I was interested to hear Senator Hillery and Senator O'Sullivan say that the quality of the jobs of this large group within the services sector must be raised.  We need in particular to look again at the areas of child care and care of the elderly.  We talked earlier about administrative difficulties and Senator Hillery talked about services that would be the engine of the creation of jobs in the future.</P>
    <P>How many jobs could be created in those areas if tax relief was given?  While we have control over the administration of various regulations, only the Minister for Finance has control over that area and I hope he will look into it.  Red tape has been described as the enemy of enterprise and has had a stultifying effect on the start-up and development of many service industries.  Senator Hillery has a nice way of expressing things.  He said we were in the dark about the number of people who could be described as in the service industry.  Maybe we would get many people from the black economy if we were better organised.  Senator O'Sullivan stressed how useful NOW has been for setting up small organisations which may have service industries behind them. I was struck by what Senator Fahey said. It is disastrous that there is no agency to deal with starting up businesses in the services sector.</P>
    <P>I must point out that on the day we were making such a fuss about the four-chette and what had happened with the President of the European Commission, M. Delors, we were losing the European Drugs Advisory Agency, which would have employed an enormous number of people.  I am not saying it is our fault. The British had to be given something for the loss of the European Bank, but, we were out front during the summer.  I hope we had enough advice and information on how to make these international bids because that organisation <Col N="592" /> would have created about 2,000 highly paid jobs here.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee was right in stressing the situation regarding the Culliton report. I, too, found it very depressing.  All the emphasis was on technology and research and development were relegated.  Basic research is an international commodity; it can be sold anywhere.  Obviously we will continue to rely on research which can be applied to manufacturing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House but I am disappointed that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, who is responsible for Bord na gCon did not see fit to come to the House.  I accept that the Minister here is not responsible; he is representing the Government.  I hope it is not an indication of the Government's interest in Bord na gCon.</P>
      <P>The board was established 34 years ago and the legislation reflected the philosophy of the time and the approach by semi-State companies to administration, etc.  That has now changed and the greyhound industry is an entertainment industry leaving the board with few administrative purposes.  Bord na gCon is now managing an entertainment industry more than carrying out an administrative function.  However, the board has not adapted to the changes, although it may be that existing legislation did not permit or facilitate it to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" /> The growth in attendances and the associated revenue over a number of years masked the inadequacies of the board but now with lower attendances these inadequacies are exposed.  I ask the Minister of State to inform the House about developments on the recommendations of the Sixth Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies which reported in 1992.  I was on that committee and Senator Lanigan and I took a special interest in this.  I come from Limerick where the headquarters of Bord na gCon is situated and the greyhound industry is particularly important to Munster, as the Minister of State is aware.  I would like an update on where the recommendations now stand.</P>
    <P>The first recommendation dealt with the control function of the industry.  The committee felt that the board had a semi-judicial control over the activities of its own members.  It was controlling itself; in effect, the policeman was policing himself. The report recommended that the control function should be hived off to an independent control authority which would be comprised of seven members, five of whom would have knowledge and experience in all aspects of the industry, including breeding, owning, track ownership and bookmaking, while the other two would be from outside the industry. Its task would be to ensure that the highest standards would be observed in greyhound racing and it would also be responsible for implementing a code of practice for bookmakers.  What developments have taken place in that area?</P>
    <P>The report also wanted the track management to be more commercially orientated and it recommended that an organisation constituted like Bord na gCon could not compete effectively in a fast moving entertainment business.  It recognised the difficulties involved in disposing of all the tracks but it said that a single track company should be formed, a subsidiary of Bord na gCon with its own board of directors who would be recruited from outside the industry but who would have relevant commercial experience.  This was to bring a commercial orientation to the track management. <Col N="594" /> What developments have taken place in that regard?</P>
    <P>The committee also looked at the disposal of tracks and recommended the disposal of some of them.  Has anything developed in that regard?  The committee noted that some tracks would not find buyers as they were not efficient.  The report also recommended that the tote should be assigned to the track company and if it could not make a reasonable contribution to the company's activities, it should be disposed of by sale or franchise to outside groups.  Has that been considered?</P>
    <P>The levy is relatively costly to administer and is uncertain in its impact.  Many of the tracks pay out a similar amount in prize money as they collect in levy and there is an administrative procedure surrounding that.  Is that being looked at? The joint committee urged that alternative methods be investigated for collecting the levy.  There is no reason one should collect a lot of money in levy and then give much of it back in prize money. There must be a more administratively effective way of collecting the surplus from the levy over the prize money.</P>
    <P>The committee also looked at the composition of Bord na gCon and felt that the board should include members drawn from the main interests in the industry, such as breeders, owners, bookmakers and private track operators.  It also recommended that there should be three independent members chosen for their commercial expertise.  It would require legislation to change the composition of the board and I wonder if legislation is proposed.  It is not included in the new Greyhound Industry (Amendment) Bill, 1993, which has been published.  That would have been an opportunity to implement many of these proposals, most of which require legislation and an amendment to the 1954 Act.</P>
    <P>With regard to the regulation of horse and greyhound racing fixtures I welcome the proposal in the new Bill that there should be greyhound racing on a Sunday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I note from the Bill that this recommendation is included. There was a great deal of concern about relationships with bookmakers and it was felt that the control authority, which I have already mentioned, should be empowered to introduce a code of practice. I ask the Minister of State if such a code of practice had been compiled.  I understand that it has not.  Does the Minister of State have any information when it will be compiled?  Bookmakers pitch fees should be freely negotiated depending on the commercial circumstances at individual tracks and should be constrained as at present under the 1958 Act.</P>
      <P>With regard to recruitment to the board it was felt that open recruitment should be used for all senior positions. The committee recognised that one such position was openly advertised in early 1992 and I ask the Minister of State if it is now standard practice that all senior positions are open to public advertisement as should be the case with all State and semi-State agencies.</P>
      <P>It was noted at the time that one in three of those who attend greyhound racing meetings had free entrance and that this was a big financial drain on the board.  Has that been looked at?  What is the view of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the executives of Bord na gCon in the matter?  Over a number of months I have asked for a full debate on this report and it was promised on a number of occasions.  I know the Cathaoirleach is interested in this.</P>

      <P>I want to commend the Sixth Joint Oireachtas Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies for its comprehensive report on Bord na gCon. As Senator Neville pointed out, he was one of the Members who took part in the work of that committee.</P>
      <P>The committee completed its report in June, 1992.  In July 1992, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy J. Walsh, appointed a task force comprising representatives of Bord na gCon and officials of his Department to examine the industry and its structures, including those relating to coursing.  While the Oireachtas Joint Committee's report was a useful one, the Minister felt that many of the matters dealt with related to the day to day management of the industry and as such fell to be considered by Bord na gCon rather than by the Minister. Furthermore, the whole question of coursing and how it should be controlled was not dealt with in great detail in the report, although I understand that the Oireachtas Joint Committee considered this subject at some length.  It is a subject which has, of course, recently become a rather sensitive one.  The task force to which I referred earlier concentrated its efforts on the structures in the industry and in particular on how the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, needs to be amended to enable the industry to achieve its full potential.  Of course the task force did have regard to the contents of the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee in its deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year the Department officials involved made a full report to the Minister Deputy Walsh, and myself. Following our consideration of this report, proposals for the amendment of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, were drawn up and in June 1992 they were put before the Government.  Given the substantive nature of the legislative changes proposed and the need to deal with some of the issues urgently, the Government <Col N="597" /> agreed to the drafting of two Bills to amend the 1958 Act.  The first of these Bills has already been approved by the Cabinet and published.  This Bill has already been referred to by Senator Neville and Senators will be familiar with its contents.  As stated, it provides for the removal of the ban on Sunday greyhound racing and drops the statutory requirement that three of the members of the board must be drawn from the executive committee of the ICC.  Both steps were recommended in the Oireachtas Joint Committee report.</P>
    <P>Regarding the composition of the board, the Oireachtas Joint Committee recommended that the main interests in the industry be represented on the board. This will be borne in mind when appointments are being made later this year.</P>
    <P>The drafting of a second comprehensive Bill to further amend the Greyhound Industry Act is already in preparation in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I can assure the House that the Joint Oireachtas Committee report will be given careful consideration when drawing up this draft amending legislation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Given the international <Col N="598" /> night that it is, I know that Senator O'Kennedy will not keep the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to discuss this motion tonight and I thank the Minister for attending the Seanad to respond to this motion.</P>
      <P>I believe the issue raised by this motion is a matter of national importance.  Were it not, I would not have brought it before the Seanad this evening when everyones attention is focused on what will happen shortly in Windsor Park.  I hope that I will be able to have this important issue presented to the House at this point and that the Minister, as far as she can, will be able to give me an update on the current position.</P>
      <P>The Minister is familiar with the issue itself, especially as a consequence of her visit to Thurles in July which I believe gave recognition to the committee and the public in the region because they are strongly united behind this project.  The Minister's visit gave recognition to their efforts and that was appreciated.  I wish to put that on the record.  I was there to meet and greet the Minister.  Because she is familiar with this issue I will not have to go through the detail of that report.</P>
      <P>In the meantime some issues have emerged which demonstrate that this issue is a matter of major national importance. The location of a rural and business development institute and the need to establish one has become crucial to the development and expansion of our most important national resource, the indigenous agri-food sector.</P>
      <P>The decline of the rural population, which is not confined to Ireland, is becoming a cause for alarm.  For that reason every possible action that can be taken at Government and official level must be directed and co-ordinated in the national interest of maintaining employment in the rural economy, which is not confined to the countryside.  It embraces all our towns and cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Minister I have had the privilege and responsibility over a number of years to take measures to arrest this rural decline.  Among the measures undertaken <Col N="599" /> was the designation of disadvantaged areas, from which I am glad to report my home county did rather well, provision of major grants for processing and the added value for employment, a vitally important employment priority in the whole range of sectors, be it the pig meat sector, the dairy sector or the beef sector.  The days of the guarantee funding and subsidies from the EC will not continue indefinitely, if they are not already over, and all our efforts &mdash; and this is where this institute becomes important &mdash; must focus on the added value of knowledge and the capacity and technology to develop that essential resource. That was why I, as Minister for Agriculture, suggested that this should be the theme of this institute, that it should not simply be another third level college but one that would be significant in the national list of priorities.</P>
    <P>I am saying this in the context of continuing rural depopulation where there are now only approximately 60,000 full time farmers, and perhaps 100,000 to 120,000 farmers in total.  That is a serious picture not only for farmers but for the country.  We need an urgent revitalised and re-energised national policy and at the centre of this is the need for education in management and development of rural business and enterprise.  The downstream processing and the marketing that will follow from that are essential.  In addition, the concept of self-reliance is an essential degree of economic development at a time when we will be trading and competing even more vigorously in the context of the GATT.  We must ensure by our self reliance, especially in education, that we have the capacity to meet this challenge.</P>
    <P>Even from my short period as Minister for Labour, the Minister will be aware that I believe strongly that the Department's and the Minister's role are crucial to this and the proposed Tipperary rural and business development institute is an essential component of this plan.  The European-based consultancy group, which has strong links with the universities here, came out in favour of this <Col N="600" /> institute for the reasons I have given. That report was presented to the Minister in July.</P>
    <P>This project will have many unique features.  Those who will be involved as teachers will be contracting 30 to 40 per cent of their time for community development. This is a new concept.  The institute will not be confined to the lecture room but will help develop business and community in the rural environment.</P>
    <P>Another feature will be the outreach centres which could be set up in Clonmel, Nenagh, Tipperary town, Roscrea or other contiguous areas.  These will be like spokes from the centre of the wheel, feeding and energising rural Ireland and the business and development programmes which will be taking place.</P>
    <P>It will respond to the needs of the community, especially the marketing and management of existing business ventures. We know we cannot be dependent on mobile multinationals to do what we would like them to do, on our terms.  We have the example today by Neodata and there are many others.  We cannot blame them for having their priorities.  They are mobile and in the new free enterprise area to be established under GATT they will be even more so.  Therefore we must have stronger security for our indigenous industries.  We must equip and educate our people at home in institutes such as this to guarantee employment for them and others in their area.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken on board the concept of continuous education.  It will be an essential feature of her policy-driven approach.  We should have this capacity not just in such an institute but in all the areas associated with it so that education can be continually renewed.</P>
    <P>At the same time it must be a mainstream third level institute and under the plan as delivered to the Minister it will be.  It cannot be divorced from the overall scheme and must be included.  It must also respond directly to the EC directives on rural development, the Leader programme and a range of schemes we are meant to establish.  It is essential to have this institute to do that effectively.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> Because it must be a matter of continuing development, marketing is essential. This concept in itself must be promoted to persuade everyone of its importance.  There must be marketing of the Irish image and product to help rurally-based enterprise.  We should acknowledge our deplorable weakness in that area and the great scope for improvement.</P>
    <P>The Danes are engaged in the marketing and the added value of their products throughout the world.  Our marketing does no justice to the quality of our products.  We have much leeway to make up in that area.  It is not just a matter for a Government Department. It must be driven by a young educated workforce which has developed capacity in language, marketing skills and food processing in an institute of this kind.</P>
    <P>This will become hugely important in the free trade area which will be introduced by the GATT agreement.  There will also be a reduction in EC supports and subsidies and a decline in rural population. Will we sit and observe this happening or will we place our confidence in our young people and their educational capacity, as we must?  They must be helped to develop through third level to the advantage of themselves and the country.</P>
    <P>Tipperary is a county associated with rural enterprise in its culture, its productivity and its very essence.  All of its towns are dependent on agri-industry. The main employment in towns such as Roscrea, Thurles, Nenagh and Clonmel and in towns in contiguous countries is agriculture-based.</P>
    <P>We need a decentralisation policy. Governments I have been part of and the current Administration have vigorously pursued this.  Thurles is about 85 miles from Dublin, 60 miles from Cork, 60 miles from Waterford and 70 miles from Galway.  It is on a main railway line and I can testify from my experience today it is 1 hour 25 minutes from Dublin by train. A third level institute could not have a better service.  A serviced site of up to 20 acres is available for the institute.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the presence of the Minister to listen to my restatement of the <Col N="602" /> urgency to establish this institute.  I am concerned, not about the institute but about the overall amount of capital available to the Minister under the National Development Plan recently sanctioned in Brussels.  The provision in the plan for appropriately funded support from the EC for third level education was for £120 million in capital over six years.  The total allocation was for £191 million over the same period.  As a vigorous supporter of the Minister's programme and of the priority of education I wish the figure could be higher and perhaps the amount to other Departments lower.  The amount allocated may not be enough to fund all the deserving capital programmes.  In response to the national need, I hope the Minister will ensure the proposed Tipperary rural and business development institute will feature prominently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for the customary welcome I receive in this House.  I am glad the Senator has given me the opportunity to clarify this matter. I visited Thurles on 2 July 1993, and had a meeting with the Committee for the Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute.  I had a look at the site, purchased in 1987 for the regional technical college which was planned at the time.</P>
      <P>I was briefed on the TRBDI, the concept of a third level institute with a mission to promote business and rural development, operating from a main campus in Thurles as well as at Clonmel and distributed campuses throughout Tipperary.  The unique emphasis of the TRBDI on action in small businesses, technological transfer, mainstream courses with emphasis on rural and business development, adult education and stimulation of enterprise, innovation and applied research was outlined to me.  The projected cost of the TRBDI was estimated at £8-£10 million for buildings and an annual cost of approximately £4 million for staff.  Non-pay costs could be expected to be approximately £1 million per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My visit to Thurles was one of a number of visits, meetings and discussions <Col N="603" /> with interested parties in relation to plans for developments in post-secondary provision in various parts of the country.  I found these visits most useful and informative.  They followed on from a commitment made by me in responding to a Dáil Private Members' motion on the provision of additional places in the higher education sector earlier this year.  In the course of that response, I outlined the dramatic changes which had taken place in higher education over the past generation and I referred to the large expenditure on third level education, which now accounts for approximately 22 per cent of the education budget, as compared to 6 per cent in 1966.  I stated that higher education requires a large investment by the State and by individuals and that there was therefore, a heavy responsibility to ensure that this investment was maximised. Proper planning for the sector was essential.</P>
    <P>Decisions on investment must have regard to: (1) priorities in educational provision, with special regard to the disadvantaged; (2) the most effective use of scarce resources; (3) additional places required overall; (4) the viability of establishing new centres, as against the expansion of existing institutions; (5) local and regional participation rates; (6) the contribution such investment will make to regional development and overall economic welfare; and (7) the type and level of courses needed, bearing in mind their contribution to productive enterprise.</P>
    <P>I proposed, therefore, an examination of the needs of different regions, socio-economic groups and the overall needs of society with a view to developing an integrated plan in the context of third level education generally and the White Paper on education.  A steering committee has now been established under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority to advise me on the future development of the higher education sector in Ireland.  The steering committee will prepare projections of the total potential enrolments in higher education to the <Col N="604" /> year 2015 and the corresponding needs of the sector to facilitate these enrolments.</P>
    <P>The committee will carry out a comprehensive needs analysis of higher education requirements.  Its remit includes the overall needs of society and the economy, as well as regional, socio-economic and equality considerations, together with the needs of students and the world of work.  The committee will also focus on the appropriate provision for mature students, as well as the need to provide access to third level education for disadvantaged students.  As indicated by me in the Dáil, the work of the committee will have to be informed by, and take account of, budgetary and financial considerations. The committee will commence its work immediately and will report not later than 30 June 1994.</P>
    <P>On 11 October last, I announced that the sum of £120 million had been included in the education element of the National Development Plan in respect of improved and developed facilities at third level over the same period.  My Department is at present in the process of identifying the individual capital projects which might be funded under the European Regional Development Fund Programme, 1994-99.  These projects will be incorporated into operational programmes, which to date have not been approved by the EC.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, in advance of the outcome of the examination of needs at third level or of approval of projects to be funded under the European Regional Development Fund Programme 1994-99, it is not possible to give commitments on individual projects at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister for her statement.  I hope that when the group the Minister has referred to examine the issue, it will take into account both the new elements I mentioned and the recommendations the TRBDI committee will bring before it. The national need for such an institute is the strength of this case, although it would also be of major benefit to County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18 November 1993.</P>
