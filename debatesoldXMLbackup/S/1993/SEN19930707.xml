      <P>I have notice from Senator Fahey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to approve an increased capital allocation for University College Hospital, Galway; if he is aware that conditions for nursing staff are less than satisfactory, that the hospital building is in need of overhaul and that a major capital injection must be made immediately for new theatres, diagnostic facilities, casualty department and extra beds.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Cregan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to outline the reason for such vast differences between payments made to women under the equal treatment arrears provisions, and the reason women on behalf of whom legal proceedings were taken have received payments substantially over and above the provisions of the regulations.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Maloney of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> The need for the Minister for the Environment to extend the urban renewal scheme to Buncrana and Letterkenny, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Farrelly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to outline the reasons for the delay in allocating national lottery funds to local authorities for distribution in 1993.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to extend the time given for the consultative process in relation to the interpretative centre in Luggala, County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senator Fahey, Cregan, Maloney, Farrelly and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Fahey's and Cregan's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Maloney, Farrelly and Ross may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I know I speak on behalf of all the House, Members and staff, in welcoming you back to your Chair.  I hope you are well on the way to recovery and am pleased to see you back.</P>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Item 1 until 4 p.m., Item 2 from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m., Item 26 from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and Item 3 from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m.</P>

      <P>May I join with Senator Wright is saying how pleased we are to see you back and to wish you every success for a complete recovery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Order of Business, I would like the Leader of the House to make time available today for a full discussion on the Aer Lingus crisis.  It is one of the most serious matters which has arisen in Irish public life for a long time and I think it would be wrong if this House, which has <Col N="631" /> so many Members from areas which will be seriously affected by what is happening in Aer Lingus, did not have a debate on the matter.  I ask the Leader to make time available today and we will co-operate to get the rest of the business through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>May I join with the other Members in welcoming you back?  It is good to see you restored to our midst; the place was not the same without you.</P>
      <P>May I also join in asking the Leader to make time available to discuss Aer Lingus and aviation policy?  The issue is extremely important and I think this House should be afforded the opportunity of discussing it in detail.  It appears that increasingly decisions are taken by executive action without reference to the Houses of the Oireachtas, which is one of the reasons I think it is important that we discuss this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader of the House give time for the Minister of Justice to comment on last night's television programme, &ldquo;First Tuesday&rdquo;, on the Dublin bombings which took place 19 years ago in view of the disquiet felt by the relatives of the victims and the country in general?</P>
      <P>I also support the calls for a debate on Aer Lingus and the opportunity to express our concern at the change in status of Shannon &mdash; the only effective instrument of regional policy and the only instrument to correct the regional economic imbalance.  In view of the fact that 2,300 jobs are likely to be lost in tourism and airport business in Shannon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would the Leader allow time to debate the matter?  We are extremely concerned that it is almost certain that the pre-inspection facility will be removed from Shannon.  I think it is important that we would have the opportunity to express our concerns to both <Col N="632" /> Government parties about what they have done to the mid-west and west.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the good wishes to you, a Chathaoirligh; I am glad to see you here.</P>
      <P>I support the call on the Leader of the House to provide time today for a discussion on Aer Lingus.  I do not mean to show any disrespect for the other matters the Leader has proposed for discussion but I believe the situation that has arisen because of the Government's decision on Aer Lingus has a higher priority.  It is important that the Upper House be given an opportunity today to debate this matter which is being discussed throughout the country, and has already been debated in the other House. I will reserve my other comments until the opportunity is provided for a debate.</P>
      <P>I will be surprised if the Leader does not respond positively to our request, bearing in mind the implications of yesterday's decision for people in many parts of the country; not just in my own area but also in the Leader's.  There is a compelling argument for a debate on the state of Aer Lingus taking priority over other items on the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, it is good to see you back and I am glad you did not let the medical profession get you down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House if time has been made available to discuss the Opsahl report as we all hoped?  I do not see Senator Wilson here today but I know he was most anxious that we should discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I join with the Leader of the House and other Senators in giving you a very warm welcome back to your usual good form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the <Col N="633" /> importance and urgency of having a debate on the Aer Lingus plan because of its major implications for the workforce and the regions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome you back, a Chathaoirligh.  Would the Leader of the House &mdash; and I have asked this several times before &mdash; consider having a debate on the enlargement of the EC?  It is a matter which is both imminent and important and the Taoiseach has spoken on it recently.  If the Leader is speaking to the Minister for Justice, would he raise the question of young Mr. Matthews who is being excluded from England because he happened to evade British injustice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past week two major employers in Dublin have announced that they are seeking 2,000 redundancies.  Dublin has the highest level of unemployment and the loss of another 2,000 jobs will cause an economic crisis.  I ask the Leader of the House to provide time to debate the level of unemployment in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome you back. As a matter of urgency, I ask that time be provided to discuss the &ldquo;First Tuesday&rdquo; programme broadcast last night.  That programme raises three specific questions which underline the urgency of discussing it.  First, were the British authorities or their agents directly involved in the worst terrorist atrocity that has been committed in 21 years? Second, were the RUC involved in destroying or interfering with a Garda inquiry into these bombings?  Third, did elements within any Irish Government know of these features?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, like many other people, have had my suspicions for 19 years about the atrocities that were perpetrated in this city and County Monaghan on 17 May 1974 in which 32 people died.  There has always been a suspicion that it was state terrorism and not simply unionist or paramilitary terrorism.  There should be a review of all the facts and I suggest there should be a select committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas to review this <Col N="634" /> case to see what further action is taken. I have always believed we are dealing with a judicial cesspool in the North of Ireland, and it is time all the facts were brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I would like to be associated with the good wishes already expressed.  I support Senator Roche's call arising from last night's programme.  I would also like the opportunity to discuss another programme &mdash;&ldquo;Tuesday File&rdquo;&mdash; on Network 2 last night.  That programme dealt with national lottery funds for sport.  It is important to discuss this because the programme contained startling revelations.</P>
      <P>I also ask for a debate on Aer Lingus. It was interesting to hear the Minister for Employment and Enterprise telling the nation that the election promises were made in good faith.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we are looking for time on the Order of Business.  Before the general election all the Members of the other House had an opportunity to find out exactly what was happening in Aer Lingus at a presentation in the Shel-bourne Hotel.  The Minister was denying that last night and misinforming the people with untruths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too join with the other Members in giving you a very warm welcome back.  I agree with the Senators who called for a debate on Aer Lingus as soon as possible.  We had a constructive debate in this House when we first heard how serious were the problems facing the company.  Many points were made at that <Col N="635" /> time, including the need to provide equity, and substantial equity will now be provided by the State.  The time has come when we need to debate the matter again and I support the calls for such a debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I too welcome you back and wish to be associated with the good wishes to you.  Will the Leader ask the relevant Minister about commercial interest rates?  We have not seen any decline in commercial interest rates in line with Central Bank reductions and reductions in mortgage interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Burke on that point.  People are selling very low mortgage rates and the Government is giving the general impression that it is important to get the country moving.  The banks, however, are not reducing interest rates despite the Central Bank's recommendation. When will they be reduced? I ask the Leader to have the Minister responsible reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I join with my fellow Senators in welcoming you back.  I am glad to see the vacuum that was in the House in your absence being filled by your return.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I support Senator Roche and Senator Neville in calling for a discussion on the loyalist bombings in Dublin.  I also support Senator Lydon's call for the Minister for Justice to come to this House to discuss the case of Mr. John Matthews.  This is the second recent case where somebody has apparently been stitched up by the authorities in England.  Following the recent publication by the Royal Commission on Reform of the Legal System in England, and given that we are proposing to reform the law on extradition here, I believe it is vitally important that this area be looked at.  I call on the Leader to make time available for such a discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obviously as interested in the state of Aer Lingus as <Col N="636" /> my fellow Senators and would welcome a debate to air Members' views.  Will the leaders of the Opposition parties meet me after the Order of Business to arrange time for a debate tomorrow?  I spoke to the Minister today and he would like to have this opportunity to come into the House to give his views on the situation. There may be another occasion when we can debate the wider issue of unemployment in Dublin, the Guinness layoffs and so on.  I would welcome such a debate.</P>
      <P>The debate on the Opsahl report will take place next Tuesday.  I would like to put on the record that, although Senator Wilson will unfortunately not be in the House, because of the level of interest in the report I am sure it will be on the agenda for further debate in the autumn.</P>
      <P>I will pass on to the Minister and the Taoiseach the views of the House about last night's television programme on the Dublin bombings.  I understand the Taoiseach has made it clear if an inquiry is necessary, he would facilitate it.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Lydon's request for a discussion on the enlargement of the EC, that may have to wait for another day.  The last issue raised was commercial interest rates.  The Minister for Finance will be in the House all day tomorrow and during the debate on the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Bill, Senators may have a chance to make the points outlined today.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <P>Before calling Item 1, I thank Senators for their messages of goodwill both today and while I was in hospital.  I also thank those who helped me on the night I took ill.  It was a frightening night for me and for others.  Deputy McDaid was most helpful.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Naughten, for his work while I was in hospital. The result, I am told, is that I will have an extra 20 heartbeats per minute, so I will be livelier and keener.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 82, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purport of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  The only matter, therefore, that may be discussed is the amendments made by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>For the convenience of Senators I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments.  As Members are aware, they may speak only once.</P>

I am disturbed to hear you will be livelier with 20 extra heartbeats per minute.  I hope it does not mean you will be running around the consituency but I am sure your duties as Cathaoirleach will not allow that.  We are genuinely glad to see you back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Seanad will recall that in early May of this year I introduced the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill, 1993, to this House.  I was glad to introduce it in the Seanad, I listened to a variety of <Col N="638" /> proposals and amendments from Senators aimed at improving the provisions of the Bill.  I was pleased to accept some of those proposals in amendments put forward by Senators and by myself. Similarly, further proposals were put forward by Deputies during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil.  As in this House a few weeks earlier, I was happy to accommodate Deputies where possible.  I now wish to report to this House the amendments made in the Dáil and to explain briefly why each one was made.</P>
    <P>I proposed amendment No. 1 in the Dáil after listening to the concerns of several Deputies regarding a practice of some employers.  This practice relates to what I would term ordinary open-ended contracts of employment being terminated after, say, 11 months followed shortly afterwards by the offer by the same employer to the same employee of a new open-ended contract of employment which, in turn, is terminated after the expiry of another period of 11 months.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall that section 3 of the Bill as initiated in this House aimed to prevent abuse of fixed term and fixed purpose contracts by employers who use such contracts, wholly or in part, to avoid liability under unfair dismissals legislation. Having listened to Deputies I considered a similar provision was necessary for ordinary open-ended contracts of employment so as to prevent their misuse by a small number of employers.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment, therefore, is to provide that a Rights Commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal will have the discretion to consider whether the dismissal of an employee by an employer followed by the re-employment of the employee within 26 weeks of the dismissal was used for the purpose of avoiding obligations under unfair dismissals legislation and where it is so decided, will not operate to break the continuity of service of the employee.</P>
    <P>This amendment will help provide a remedy for certain employees who find their employer persistently breaks their service by their dismissal after 11 or 11½ months of successive contracts so as to <Col N="639" /> prevent them gaining the 12 months' service necessary to qualify for protection and rights under the original Unfair Dismissals Act.  Henceforth it will be possible for such cases to be brought before a Rights Commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill as originally drafted extended the scope of unfair dismissals legislation to include persons employed through employment agencies. For the purposes of the legislation the party hiring the individual from the employment agency was deemed to be the employer.  This provision was drafted so that the extension of the protection of the 1977 Unfair Dismissals Act to workers placed by employment agencies would apply only to contracts entered into after the legislation comes into effect, i.e., after 1 October 1993.  On that basis, therefore, an agency worker working for a user firm at the time the new Act comes into operation would not be covered until a new placement contract is made.</P>
    <P>On reflection, I considered this would be discriminatory.  Amendment No. 5 therefore clarifies that on the coming into operation of the new Act existing agency workers will be placed on a par with future such workers in that as and from that date their service will begin to count towards the calculation of the one year's service requirement necessary to obtain the protection of the Act.</P>
    <P>I think the House will agree they are two useful amendments.  In this House I had an open mind in accepting amendment as far as I could.  I applied the same in the Dáil with the same fruitful effects.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 is a technical amendment to an amendment which I accepted in this House from Senator Joe O'Toole, the effect of which is to include in the list of automatically unfair reasons for dismissal the employee's membership of the travelling community.  The wording of the amendment passed in this House was subsequently found to be at variance with the rest of the list in the Bill and in the principal Act in that it makes no specific reference to the <Col N="640" /> employee.  I am, therefore, proposing this technical amendment specifying the employee's membership of the travelling community as being an automatically unfair reason for dismissal.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 is similar to an amendment made in this House.  It is a technical amendment and arises from the enactment of the Social Welfare Act, 1993.  Accordingly the reference in the Bill to the Social Welfare Acts, 1981 to 1992, at this part of the Bill requires to be amended to read the &ldquo;Social Welfare Acts, 1981 to 1993&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 arose from representations that were made to me by the Employment Appeals Tribunal in the period between the passage of the Bill through the Seanad and its passage through the Dáil.  The purpose of the amendment is to remove the rigidity of the time limit provided to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for notifying the other party of an appeal to the tribunal from a Rights Commissioner recommendation. This amendment will give to the tribunal the same flexibility in the matter of notification of an appeal as is provided to it in respect of notification of a claim at section 7 (2) of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these amendments will not affect the balance which I sought to achieve in preparing this legislation between the needs of employers and employees.  Naturally I believe these amendments will enhance the provisions of the Bill and I trust this House will have no difficulty in accepting them.  I commend the Bill as amended by Dáil Éireann to Seanad Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendments and I commend the Minister for accepting amendments from both Houses.  I appreciate that amendment No. 1 tidies up the problem of 11 month contracts.  Section 3 (b) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>each of a series of contracts the term of the last of which expired not more than 3 months before the commencement of that of the prior contract and the term of the other or of each of the other contracts in the series expired <Col N="641" /> not more than 3 months before the commencement of that of the other, or the next, contract in the series...</P>
    <P>I thought this adequately covered the situation but from what the Minister said, although I have not studied it in detail&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>

      <P>Amendment No. 3 is an update of the present position.  One cannot but accept that this amendment has been brought forward, and rightly so, because the situation has changed with the passage of time, even since the introduction of the Bill.  Amendment No. 5, which arose from representations made to the Minister by the Employment Appeals Tribunal, gives more flexibility to the tribunal's officials in doing their work and I do not think there is any harm in this.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 deals with agencies. By this amendment the Minister is making the legislation retrospective for people operating through employment agencies.  There has been debate within the employment bodies on this and they had decided that under the original Bill it was operative from the date it was passed.  There was a query about the constitutionality of making such legislation retrospective, that such legislation would only become operative from the date the Bill was passed into law.  I ask the Minister to comment on the approach to making such legislation retrospective.</P>

      <P>I do not see this as being retrospective but, nonetheless, it does seem to apply to an existing contract for the purposes of dating the service from the date of the Act.  To that extent, in the case of contracts which have been entered into, one wonders whether this change will satisfy the legal requirements, but I expect that the Department and the Minister have considered this.</P>

      <P>I welcome amendments Nos. 1 and 2 which deal with open ended contracts and employment agencies. These were being used by very reputable firms and institutions to dismiss employees.  When I looked into this I was astonished to learn the names of these firms and institutions.</P>
      <P>No provisions has been introduced in relation to officers of health boards.  I was one of those who pointed out that employees and officers could often be in similar working situations and I am sorry to see that they are still in different categories. I cannot find any reference to pregnant women.  Some of us made objections to the fact that they were not covered by the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>They come under the scope of the original 1977 Act.  This Act contains provisions relating to workers who are pregnant.  There was a strong debate in the Dáil on this matter and it is a matter for the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, to ensure its implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister explained that.  I am sorry, and the Minister probably is too, that a year will pass before the enactment of that legislation under the EC directive and during that period women could technically be dismissed because of pregnancy.  However, I realise, as the Minister explained the last time she was here, that she could not do anything about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am extremely glad about amendments Nos. 1 and 2.  The others are technical. I was one of those who supported the travelling community.  I wish that something could be done about the situation <Col N="643" /> of officers of a health board who can be in very similar situations to employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their comments on the amendments made in the Dáil.  Senator Neville said I was making legislation retrospective.  I am not doing so.  In my speech I stated that:</P>
      <P>The provision was drafted so that the extension of the protection of the 1977 Unfair Dismissals Act to workers placed by employment agencies would apply only to contracts entered into after the legislation comes into effect, i.e., after 1 October 1993.  On that basis, therefore, an agency worker working for a user firm at the time the new Act comes into operation would not be covered until a new placement contract is made.</P>
      <P>On reflection [and following discussion] I considered that this would be discriminatory.  Amendment No. 5 [which results from suggestions made in the Dáil by several Deputies and has been slightly altered to ensure it is legally correct] therefore clarifies that on the coming into operation of the new Act [i.e., 1 October next] existing agency workers will be placed on a par with future such workers in that as and from that date their service will begin to count towards the calculation of the one year's service requirement necessary to obtain the protection of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again thank Senators for their contributions to the debates on this Bill.  The Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, was enacted by the Oireachtas in April 1977.  This Bill, which I introduced in this House, brought forward to the Dáil and have now returned here, contained the following changes to the 1977 Act: extension of the coverage of the Act to include persons employed through employment agencies; access to protection under the Act in the case of the termination of certain second or subsequent fixed term and fixed purpose contracts; a new basic <Col N="644" /> award of up to four weeks pay; extension of the list of grounds for dismissal to include the sexual orientation of the employee; improved claims and appeals procedures with the Employment Appeals Tribunal and clarification of the role of the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>In the course of the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas the following further important changes were added: extension of the list of grounds for dismissal which are deemed to be automatically unfair to include the age of the employee and the employee's membership of the travelling community &mdash; this change was proposed in this House; the placing of existing agency workers on a par with future such workers so that as and from the commencement date of the new Act, the services of such workers shall begin to count towards the calculation of the one year service requirement &mdash; this change was proposed in the Dáil; and the provision of a remedy for certain employees who find themselves in a situation where their employer persistently breaks their service by a dismissal after, say, 11 to 11½ months.</P>
    <P>The last change I mentioned was referred to by Senator Neville.  He thought, as we did too, that section 3 of the original Bill I introduced here covered this situation, but having thought about and discussed it and having consulted on it, we decided there might be occasions where this might not be the case so we sought to clarify the situation and to make it crystal clear.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to two matters.  Apart from the very useful amendments which were put down here and in the Dáil, issues came up during the debate in both Houses which will be of interest and which I intend to pursue.  Reference was made to the desirability of various employment laws being better explained and understood.  In this connection, I am glad to be able to say that a revised guide to labour law is near completion.  This new booklet, which I hope will be available shortly, will provide in a comprehensive but non-technical manner a quick guide to the range of labour laws. It will, I hope, help to ensure that such <Col N="645" /> laws are more accessible and better understood.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate in both Houses, Deputies and Senators referred to aspects of the activities of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  The tribunal exists to provide a relatively quick and inexpensive method for individuals to seek remedies for alleged infringements of their rights under various legislation. The annual report of the tribunal will be published shortly and will provide a useful description of the range of activities undertaken by that body.  I remain convinced that there must be greater operational efficiency and attention to detail in the running of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>Our excessive legalism was quoted extensively in this House.  Growing statistical evidence shows that both employers and employees are using the legal system with regard to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  The establishment of the tribunal allowed for that to happen.  I am sure the legal people will not mind if I briefly discuss this matter. The tribunal was meant to provide a fair, fast and inexpensive route for the consideration of certain cases.  I am satisfied that it is fair in the justice sense, but I am not satisfied that it is fast and inexpensive. The increasing use of legal representatives in cases is hindering matters. A date has been fixed to meet everyone involved in the tribunal and I will address this issue at that time.  I hope exhortation will have an effect.  I feel strongly about this matter and I will deal with it.</P>
    <P>I emphasise again my view that fair practices and procedures in the workplace, particularly in relation to dismissal, are an essential part of any civilised economic system.  I am annoyed, as I am sure are others, with those who say that labour legislation is hindering employment.  Labour legislation is not hindering employment.  It is a proper civilised umbrella under which people can get their rights in an employment situation. There is clear evidence that the passage of properly debated and executed labour legislation has the effect <Col N="646" /> of diluting causes of dissent in workplaces and it allows workers to work in an environment where they feel motivated and can make a contribution.</P>
    <P>Too often, labour legislation is used as a scapegoat by certain bodies and people who blame it for the ills of the marketplace. The ills of the marketplace do not rest in the realms of labour legislation and, least of all, on the shoulders of employees.  I would encourage a greater understanding of labour law, a measure to look at it and a greater reliance on the balance of forces between the employer and the employee.  Gains can be made by both the employer and the employee in the proper review, perusal and execution of labour legislation in the workplace.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, for coming to the House and sharing her views.  We outlined our views on the growing presence of legal people in the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the extra expense it creates for people, especially employees, who, although they are not in a position to do so, are obliged to pay in order to obtain justice.  I welcome any measures which will counteract this.</P>
      <P>I concur with the Minister of State's remark about the operational efficiency of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  Like everything in the Civil Service, one of the restrictions is the amount of money supplied to the tribunal to carry out its work.  We would like the Minister of State to consider this carefully in the context of this year's budget to see if some money can be provided.  We are talking about small amounts of money &mdash; in the region of £30,000.  Funding for the tribunal has been further reduced this year.  A large backlog of cases await a hearing and funding is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of the tribunal has become more expensive because of what happened at the last appointments to the tribunal, but I do not wish to discuss this <Col N="647" /> now.  The Minister should recognise this fact and allocate funding to the staff of the tribunal, who do excellent work, in order to ensure that it is seen and continues to be seen as an efficient arm of labour relations throughout the State.</P>

I hope sufficient support is given so that the tribunal can continue the good work it has been doing over the past few years.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister of State mentioned labour relations and the arguments that our labour laws have caused problems for the creation of employment.  The opposite is the case. Before the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, was enacted, there was no protection for people who were employed individually. It is right that people now have that protection. I do not see the provision of protection for the employee being against creating employment.  It is a necessary part of good employment that, under the law, we provide protection for employees.</P>

No opportunity should be lost at ministerial level to express views, as the Minister of State has done, on the perception that protective legislation is a disincentive to employment. In that context, perhaps I could make a suggestion, although it may not be feasible, I am delighted the revised guide to labour law is almost complete.  Perhaps the Minister of State could use what is on the record here in a foreword to the new revised guide, which will have a wide circulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that amendment No. 1 is not considered in order and I would dispute the issue of the cost to the Exchequer.  However, there are a couple of points on section 3 I would like to raise with the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point relates to section 3(2) (a) (v) which refers to the representation of the different persons on the consultative <Col N="649" /> committee, and who they would be.  This provision states that:</P>
    <P>one or more organisations prescribed, for the time being, for the purpose of this subparagraph which, in the opinion of the Minister, are representative of persons whose profession or occupation relates to livestock farming or the keeping or rearing of animals...</P>
    <P>I assume that the prescribed organisations would be the IFA, the ICMSA or bodies of that nature.  For An Bord Glas, the bodies involved were designated in the relevant Bill whereas in this case they are not.  Can the Minister of State give an assurance that it would be a body such as the IFA or the ICMSA, a national body, he would have in mind for this consultative committee?</P>
    <P>There is one other body he might consider, and that is, the Irish Livestock Exporters' and Traders' Association, which would be adequately qualified for the purpose of the consultative committee. Perhaps the Minister of State would give some indication of the types of bodies he has in mind for this committee, not just in the farming area but some of the other bodies representing consumers for instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to the point made by Senator Dardis with regard to specifying the different organisations which should serve on the consultative committee.  Another sector the Minister of State has not specified are the meat processors, the factories and the slaughterhouses.  These people are in possession of more facts than anyone else, a point I made on Second Stage, because nearly 90 per cent of all animals slaughtered are slaughtered by this sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From talking to butchers in particular, I have been given reason to believe they will be able to tell which animals are fed angel dust.  As they have that type of information it would be beneficial to specifically appoint these people to any committee the Minister would consult and not just leave their appointment to <Col N="650" /> the whim of the Minister.  The Minister of State should consider this point and give us an undertaking that this sector would be represented on the consultative committee because they know what the cattle have been fed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned on Second Stage that he wanted the co-operation of all farming organisations, and especially those which will be represented on this consultative committee.  It is important that he would have the co-operation of the farming organisations, and that the farming organisations approve of this legislation. I mentioned on Second Stage that there was one farming organisation which seemed to be silent about condemning the use of illegal drugs on cattle.  Other organisations recommended introducing legislation while this organisation, the IFA, is conspicuous by not condemning the use of illegal drugs and not supporting this legislation which is of benefit to the livestock trade and the beef industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to thank Senator Dardis for tabling the amendments, although one of his amendments has been ruled out of order because of financial implications.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the advisory committee is to advise the Minister in relation to the making of regulations under the provisions of the Bill.  That is the sole purpose and function of the advisory committee.  It will make available to the Minister expertise and knowledge that might not be available in the Department itself.  There are many qualified people in various sectors of the industry who would have strong and positive views and who could advise the Minister in relation to the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the importance of that committee I agreed in the Dáil to increase the level of representation from five to nine members, and I did that on the basis of a strong case made by the Deputies that I should endeavour to take in the broadest level of representation from the <Col N="651" /> various sectors in the industry.  Provision has been made by amendments made in the Dáil to allow for nine members.  To assist Senator Dardis with regard to how that committee will be constituted we have endeavoured to divide the various constituencies which would be representative of the agricultural and food industries.</P>
    <P>There are nine members on the committee. The Minister for Health will have one representative because of the health aspects.  There will be one person nominated by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland representing the pharmacists. One person will also be nominated by Veterinary Council who will be broadly representative of the veterinary surgeons. One person will be nominated by bodies who are representative of persons engaged in the manufacture, distribution or sale of animal remedies &mdash; examples would be the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, Irish pharmaceutical manufacturers, the sellers of animal remedies and ICOS.  In addition, there will be one person nominated by representatives of persons engaged in farming or livestock production.  I want to assure Senator Dardis that the IFA, the ICMSA and the United Farmers' Association are entitled to apply for representation on the consultative committee.</P>
    <P>It is our intention to put an announcement in the papers requesting interested organisations to seek representation on the committee and I hope that each constituency grouping would themselves decide on their nominee to the consultative committee.  I would prefer that they would do that rather than submit a number of names from which I would have to choose.  There is sufficient unity within the various constituency sectors to be able to achieve that objective and I hope that will be the outcome.  In addition, there will be one representative from the food industry, which includes organisations such as CBF, An Bord Bainne and the co-operative movement. Again, such organisations would be requested to forward one nominee. There will also be a nominee from the <Col N="652" /> Consumers' Association of Ireland Limited representing the broad area of consumers in the country.  I believe consumers should have a strong voice regarding the control of animal remedies, especially in relation to the food chain.</P>
    <P>This broadly represents the number of constituency areas that I propose to deal with in terms of nominating bodies to the consultative committee.  There are also the additional two members which I will nominate.  I have already assured the Dáil that I will be taking an objective approach to this.  For example, I will see the people nominated by the various organisations I have outlined to this House today.  If it becomes apparent that others would be in a position to give sound, professional advice and to make a contribution to the consultative committee, then I would consider my two nominees on this objective basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it is reasonable that the number of people on the consultative committee should be restricted to nine.  However, if other organisations, such as the Irish Cattle Traders and Stockowners Association, wished to have a nominee on this committee will they be excluded?  Presumably the Minister is not going to designate particular organisations as being most appropriate for inclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the case.  An advertisement will be placed in the newspapers advising the public and the various interested organisations of the opportunity for the organisations to nominate representatives to the consultative committee. However, as advised, I hope that, because of the constituency structure that has been established in the first instance to ensure the best possible agreed representation, the various interested organisations within each constituency, for example the agri-sector with which Senator Dardis is concerned, would come together and agree their nominee.  That would be the preferable way to deal with what I believe to be an important matter.</P>

      <P>There is a related matter. Under the terms of the Bill, the Minister makes an appointment on the nomination of the particular bodies.  Does this mean the Minister does not have discretion? In other words, if the bodies, between them, agree to one particular person and that person is nominated, does the Minister not have discretion to accept or reject that person?  It appears from the way the Bill is phrased that the Minister would not have this discretion. Perhaps he could clarify this point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provision in the Bill the Minister does not have discretion. However, with regard to ensuring the success of the consultative committee, I believe it would be better for the individual constituency organisations to select or nominate a person to the Minister for appointment to the committee.  I believe that is the more desirable, effective and transparent way of proceeding.  I do not have to remind the Senator that if I were to become involved in the selection process I would leave myself open, despite my intention, to accusations of political interference.  I assure the Senators in this House today that this is not my intention, and I also gave that assurance in the Dáil.  I believe it is preferable to allow the organisations to nominate their own representatives and I am confident they will nominate those who are best qualified to serve on this important committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister's advice on the construction of the consultative committee, notwithstanding the comments made by Senator Dardis, I have no difficulty with the various organisations proposing their own nominees.  If the Minister interfered in any way I believe he would be immediately accused of political interference, especially as there would have to be good reason for interfering in the nominations to most committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not deal with my comments about food processors, factories and slaughterhouses.  I note that the pharmaceutical <Col N="654" /> industry, veterinarians and the chemical industry have been included.  I accept that the pharmaceutical industry and the veterinary profession must be represented but will the inclusion of the chemical and pharmaceutical industries not lead to a certain amount of duplication?</P>
    <P>Any consultative body must incorporate the entire industry it serves and in this case, there is nothing more important than the slaughterhouses and the meat factories, yet they have not been mentioned by the Minister who has retained to himself the nomination of two members to the consultative committee. This is acceptable, but I ask the Minister to consider ensuring that the meat industry is represented on the committee because it has plenty of information which will be useful to the committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate that it is important to have people on the consultative committee who will communicate with the people involved in the meat industry.  There were suggestions in both Houses on numerous occasions that some of them were encouraging the use of growth promoters in order to raise the standard of cattle.  It is important therefore, that these factories are represented on the consultative committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Minister mentioned six interested bodies and the nominee from the Department of Health and the Minister's two nominees. There is one nominee to represent the farming interests but there are many farming organisations and, as I understand it, each will submit a nominee to the Minister.  Is that the case?  If so, will the Minister then decide which nominee will serve on the consultative committee? Could the Minister also clarify the nature of the organisations to be represented on this committee?  Will there be somebody to represent the consumers interests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I apologise to Senator D'Arcy.  I overlooked responding to an important point he made regarding representation from the meat <Col N="655" /> industry itself.  I agree with him that people in our meat factories may be in a better position than any other sector to identify, almost at grass root level, animals that would appear to have been treated with illegal substances.  It is my wish that this sector of the agri-industry would be represented on the consultative committee but it will fall within the ambit of the food sector generally.</P>
      <P>As I explained, various constituencies for the purposes of nominations were created, grouping various organisations together.  I regard the meat industry as falling within the constituency of the food industry.  For this reason I believe the views of the meat industry will be considered at that level.  Since as I am sure the Senator is aware the food industry has an umbrella organisation dealing with the meat industry, it will receive communications from my Department and it will also, I presume, respond to our public notices in the newspapers, etc. I take the Senator's point that I will have the opportunity to nominate two people and I will use that flexibility to take an overview of the situation when all the other people have been nominated.  I want to reassure Senators that I will use these two nominees for the purpose of filling any obvious vacuum which may arise as a result of one particular sector not being represented.  Two members is not many but I will have flexibility in relation to their nomination and I will keep the Senator's view in mind.</P>

      <P>I have a query which relates to the amendment which has been ruled out of order and to section 3 (5) where it states that the consultative committee shall meet whenever summoned by the Minister.  I do not see this as a major difficulty but it might be the case &mdash; I know that it would not be the case with this particular Minister &mdash; where the Minister of the day would not want these people to meet to suit his own purposes. It seems the committee do not have discretion to regulate their own affairs.  Subparagraph (6) states that they may <Col N="656" /> regulate their procedure but they do not have discretion as to when they will meet. According to the wording in the Bill they will do so at the will of the Minister and, from my point of view, that it unsatisfactory. If the committee was an embarrassment or if the Minister of the day did not want to co-operate, he could decide that there will be no meetings and a situation could result where there is a consultative committee, which has been established by the Legislature, but it never meets.</P>

      <P>I understand the point the Senator is making but the House must keep in mind that the Minister cannot make any regulation without first consulting with the consultative committee. If the need for the introduction of or the making of a new regulation arises, no matter how well intentioned or how important that regulation might be in the Minister's mind, he cannot bring it in without first consulting with and getting the advice of the consultative committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations and the effectiveness of the new regulations which are now being brought in will be the subject of ongoing review and almost daily monitoring by the officials within the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  They obviously will be in a position to bring to the attention of the Minister at an early stage if there was a weakness in any of the regulations which may eventually be introduced in terms of the application of the requirements of this Bill.  The Minister in turn would immediately call together his consultative committee for the purpose of seeking its advice and getting its guidance in relation to the structure of any new regulation which might be required under this legislation. While I understand the circumstances Senator Dardis is identifying, there is no danger of any Minister being able to ignore the existence of the consultative committee because if he were to do that he would be closing the door in relation to his own powers to make regulations which are provided for in this Bill. <Col N="657" /> Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>My comments relate to compound feeds which may have a feed additive of the nature of some of these substances we are discussing.  Is there an onus on the manufacturer of the feed compound to state on the label the animal remedies which are included?  One can think of things like Romensin which is used in beef cattle production.  Anywhere I have seen a compound with Romensin in it, it is stated on the label.  Is there a statutory obligation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad the Senator is giving me the answer but I would prefer the Minister to tell me on the record.  I appreciate the Senator's assistance but it is important to get this information on the record of the House.  Where there is an animal feed compound which has an animal remedy included, I want to ensure that all that information would be on the label of the feed compound bag so that everybody knows what is included.</P>

      <P>I take the Senator's point. This Bill makes very specific provision in relation to the labelling of all of these products, from the limited requirements with regard to the bulk identification of imported products through to the small product purchased by farmers.  It is required that on each label at consumer level there will have to be a full, accurate and detailed description of all of the active ingredients contained within that package, container or bottle or whatever the container might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With specific reference to additives within the overall compound business, the existing regulations require that these items be specified on the outer wrapper or outer container of the remedy.  If one looks at any label on the proprietary <Col N="658" /> animal food product, it does refer to these additives if they are contained in the product.  Existing legislation requires that that be the case.</P>

      <P>Section 16 states: &ldquo;A person shall not obstruct or impede an authorised officer, member of the Garda Síochána or officer of Customs and Excise ...&rdquo;  I think the Minister should make that stronger and request that the farmer should co-operate with these officers.  This is very important.  In the initial stages of TB and brucellosis testing there were serious problems with farmers not co-operating with the officers.  A great deal of pressure and effort went into that trying to condition farmers to bring them around to thinking they had to get this job done and that it was in their own interest to do so.  In this situation a very small number of people are involved and I believe there should be something in the Bill where, if a farmer is suspected of abusing the system, so to speak, he should be made to co-operate with the officers concerned whether they be gardaí or customs officers.  I read this section this morning and I feel it is not strong enough.  It just states that a person shall not obstruct; obstruction is one matter, co-operation is another.  Can this be amended on Report Stage by inserting a paragraph or even a sentence requesting a farmer to co-operate with the officers concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator D'Arcy. Particularly in relation to this legislation, it would be most desirable that there would be a very high level of co-operation between the farmers and the various <Col N="659" /> agencies of State, including the Garda Síochána and the customs officials.</P>
      <P>I am sure the House would wish to identify with a word of thanks and tribute to the State agencies, the Garda Síochána, the Customs and Excise officials and the officials in our Department who have been involved in trying to eliminate all the remedies which have threatened our basic food industry and which have also threatened the agricultural industry and the income of individual farmers.</P>
      <P>Sometimes there is an impression when one is introducing legislation like this that we are all anti farmer.  That is not the case and I want to make that point very positively.  In the earlier debate here and in the Dáil, the point was made that only a small number of farmers are abusing this aspect of the food industry.  It is also important to say that only a small percentage of our overall meat production is in any way affected by it and that the bulk of beef products in Ireland are of an extremely high quality.  Consumers need not be worried and concerned, whether they are Irish consumers or consumers in one of our international markets on which we depend so much.</P>
      <P>I agree that co-operation is most essential but in the absence of co-operation, there is a positive provision in the Bill under section 2 where it will be an offence &mdash; and indeed a very serious offence which will carry the full rigours of the law in terms of the provisions contained in this Bill &mdash; if a farmer or someone involved in the trading of these illegal substances does not co-operate with the various agencies or representatives of State agencies.  It will be a very serious offence and they will be subject to the substantial fines which have been imposed as a result of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to the issuing <Col N="660" /> of identity documents to persons who are appointed by the Minister or acting on the Minister's behalf.  I realise there is an earlier section which deals with the type of people involved.  What type of official in the Department will be responsible on the ground for implementing this legislation?  Will they be agricultural officers or are there people already in a position to implement this legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that there is sufficient flexibility in the staff structure of the Department to enable officers to be authorised to act on behalf of the Department and involve themselves in investigating the illegal use of any of the substances referred to in this legislation.  The Department's veterinary staff are also involved on an ongoing basis in our meat facilities.  Senators will be aware that the agricultural officers throughout the country have been involved, and will continue to be involved, as will the agricultural inspectors and other officers of the Department who may be authorised by the Department to involve themselves in the implementation of the regulations.</P>
      <P>The Bill also makes provision for the proper and correct identification of all of these officers.  The officers will have a composite identity card which they will be required to present when they approach farmers or visit farms.  We have taken strong action to provide the level of authority that is needed.  In the past perhaps that level of authority was not always available but it will be available in future under these new regulations and also in the area of the identification of the officers involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's point is a reasonable one.  Nobody would like a situation where people could come into farms willy nilly.  As it is, many people living in the country are worried about strangers around their property, particularly elderly farmers who are living alone.  We are all aware of some unfortunate incidents that have happened, so it is important that the officers should be in a position to produce some formal <Col N="661" /> identification.  I note that under section 10, dealing with the appointment in writing, a warrant of appointment is issued to authorised officers.</P>
      <P>At this stage the farming community have taken their responsibility on board. All responsible farmers know the damage they can do to their industry by using these substances, and the damage that has been done by some people.  There is no point making good law unless the law is implemented and I think the Minister accepts that point.  I appeal to him to ensure that the resources are made available within the Department so that when we enact this legislation, the Department has the teeth to carry out its remit in fulfilling its obligations under the legislation, otherwise we are wasting our time.  People will just carry on unless there is a proper monitoring procedure. We can introduce all the penalties we like but we have to uncover the crime in order to make the penalties fit the crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Dardis.  One can have consultative committees and law but if not implemented, it is of very little use.  Practically 95 per cent of farmers want the use of all steroids eliminated from the system.  The markets grow year after year and our green image gets better but these people are damaging us now.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that officers will be active on the ground and that people will know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made the point previously about the small percentage of farmers &mdash; just 2 per cent &mdash; who are securing U grades for 40 per cent of their cattle.  I am not just saying this, I checked it with the factories and they know exactly who these people are.  The Minister should have a list of these names in his office and it should also be given to the Garda Síochána; I know there is a list available at the moment.  This is a clear indication that some farmers are abusing steroids &mdash; this 2 per cent.  That is why I make the point about the factories being involved in the initial stages on the consultative committee. The Minister must be able to tell them what he thinks and they must be <Col N="662" /> able to tell him what is happening in their factories.</P>
    <P>The question of identification and having officers on the ground is important to ensure that these people will be brought to justice quickly if they continue to use this illegal substance.  There should be no dragging of feet on this matter.  On a number of occasions the Department has identified areas where these people are caught but I have seen few people prosecuted.  I do not understand that. There were a couple of cases in my own county but nobody was prosecuted.  I understand the cattle were confiscated but that is not enough.  An example has to be made of these people because they are ruthless and they are damaging our good name and the beef trade.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Dardis, I would like to hear the Minister's assurance that sufficient officers will be made available so that they they will be able to identify in the factory these people who are securing U grades for 40 per cent of their animals because it is physically impossible to obtain that level of standard in respect of grading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reassure both the House and the Senators that there will be a sufficient number of officers to implement the provisions in this Bill.  At present, there are more than 500 officers of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, now duly authorised to carry out investigations in relation to the provisions in the Bill.  We are positively moving into a new era of control as a result of these provisions and it is my wish that there would be the level of co-operation, to which Senator D'Arcy referred earlier, with our officers in terms of finding those who are involved in this illicit trade and we propose to deal with it under a number of specific headings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, we want to tackle the source of the importation of the product and we will get from the Garda, the Customs officials and the officials in the Department, the level of co-operation we need to identify the sources of this product. This information will be vigorously pursued. <Col N="663" /> Second, we have the distribution chain, which is difficult to cope with and identify, but if we get the co-operation, which I expect, in relation to the distribution chain, we would go a long way towards removing the source from individual farms.  From a farmer's point of view, it is a question of levelling the playing pitch.  The vast majority of farmers, who are complying with the food requirements and the use of substances in terms of treating animals, would positively wish and expect us to level the playing pitch for them because they are being put at a strong production disadvantage by a small number who are using these illegal growth promoters.</P>
    <P>In fairness, the pharmaceutical industry has generally behaved in a responsible way.  Many of the products and drugs to which we are referring, even in relation to illegal growth promotion, were developed and produced by this industry for credible and genuine reasons to support the agriculture industry in the treatment of farm animals; it it the abuse of these substances that is the problem.  It would be wrong to give the impression that somehow, the pharmaceutical industry is contributing to this menace.  I have examined their work &mdash; the amount of money they are investing in research, for example, is commendable &mdash; and would like to remove the taint of guilt that may appear to be attached to this industry because it is not they but those who have devised illegal uses for some of these important substances who are to blame, especially foreigners who are involved in organised crime to the extent of importing these substances which eventually find their way into the distribution chain and on to some of our farms, although in a limited way.</P>
    <P>In relation to the points Senator Dardis, Senator D'Arcy and Senator R. Kiely make on the implementation of the regulations, it is my intention and determination to ensure that they are fully implemented for the purposes of controlling this illicit area and, as I said, I hope we will get the level of co-operation needed.  It is my intention to have discussions <Col N="664" /> with the farming organisations, the meat industry and those involved in both the food chain and agricultural production for the purpose of assisting me in protecting our farming industry.</P>
    <P>We are not condemning farmers but talking about the importance of the agriculture industry to our economy and the dependence of individual farmers and their families on the livestock sector for their income and livelihood.  That is the purpose of this legislation.  We also wish to reassure the consumers because, at the end of the day, they will decide what they will purchase or reject and unless they see we are implementing regulations which will eliminate the abuse of animal substances, they will not be happy with our food product.  I can assure consumers that the amount of abuse has been minimal and the regulations we are now introducing will eliminate once and for all this serious threat to the agriculture industry and to the consumer, because we have to acknowledge the importance of the consumer and the need to supply them with healthy beef of the highest quality.</P>
    <P>It may not be in order to refer to the Civil Service and the departmental officials, but I must say that, from my association with those who administer this scheme within the Department, there is a total commitment to introducing these kinds of regulations and in protecting the industry and the consumer, and I would like to pay tribute to them and to their colleagues, who are out in the field doing what can be a difficult job <i>vis-a-vis</i> the application of various regulations not only in this area but in others as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 31, subsection (2) (b) (i), line 6, to delete &ldquo;£25,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£50,000&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="665" /> I welcome the fact that in the Dáil, the penalties in section 23 (1) were doubled, and the same should be done under subsection (2).  The distinction is that while the first half has penalties of up to £100,000 for selling these substances or for obstruction of officials or gardaí and so on, the penalties in subsection (2) in the Bill as passed by the Dáil, are £25,000 and £50,000.  These penalties are imposed on those personating Department officials, for possession of the drug rather than selling it and the condition of licence &mdash; referred to in section 20 (1)(c), &ldquo;a term of condition of any licence or authorisation or any direction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment supports some of the points the Minister of State made earlier. There is the potential here to do great damage to our most important national industry and the penalties should reflect that.  One could argue that the penalties for tax amnesties should operate within this Bill and that some of the penalties in this Bill would be more appropriate to the tax amnesty legislation but that is to be discussed tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The users of these substances are both anti-farmer and anti-industry.  Because of their ethical approach to business, there are people who refused to use these substances, went to the livestock marts and were put at competitive disadvantage, almost to the extent that some of them were forced out of businesss.  I know a fairly large producer in the midlands who got to the stage that he could not compete with these gangsters when he went to buy the cattle he was over-wintering because he was not prepared to use these substances. We have a duty to defend those who operate their businesses within the law and we must ensure that those who operate outside the law do not get away with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to his officials and I accept their determination to root out this ill in society and in the agriculture industry.  However, it is unreasonable to expect them, or the Garda, to uphold the law while being subjected to abuse and in some cases, assault when only minor fines are imposed.  A fine of £25,000 or £100,000 may seem large, but in relation <Col N="666" /> to the value of the products we are dealing with, it is a fairly small sum.  For example, a large beef producer may have cattle worth £0.5 million in a feed lot.  By using these substances, perhaps £50,000 per annum could be added to the output &mdash; I am not saying profit &mdash; of that feed lot.  This puts these penalties into context. Since the fines in subsection (1) were doubled to £100,000 and to £250,000, the fines in subsection (2) should also be doubled to £50,000 and to £100,000.  That is why I tabled these amendments.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the pharmaceutical industry.  He correctly said that this industry is, by and large, responsible and has produced products of value in terms of animal welfare.  Apart from helping farm profitability, these products have alleviated suffering in animals, and this is to be welcomed.  There are circumstances in which clenbuterol may be used legally.  As far as I am aware, it may, and has been, used for horses over the years.  A responsible chemical company may produce a product which will be beneficial to certain groups of animals but when administered to other animals it may have a deleterious effect.  This issue must be dealt with in this legislation.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the terms and conditions of licence, covered by fines of £25,000 and £50,000, we must remember that we are dealing with large operators. that is why penalties should reflect the seriousness of the crime.  If sufficient penalties do not exist, illegal operators will gain.  Furthermore, we must support officials in their work and penalties must reflect their efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Senator Dardis and although I do not agree with everything he said, I accept that many large farmers use these substances. However, a number of farmers with medium sized farms also use these substances. I believe the penalty should fit the crime.  This is a serious crime, but £25,000 for a first offence is a hefty fine and if increased to £50,000, it will be much more difficult for them to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week a case relating to a betting fine was brought before the court in my <Col N="667" /> town.  A bookmaker refused to add tax to a docket and received a £60,000 fine, mitigated to £30,000 which he will be unable to pay.  The amount of money involved, as far as the State was concerned, totalled £42.  Perhaps he has been committing this offence for a number of years and that was why the court imposed such a large fine for one offence.</P>
    <P>Fifty thousand pounds is a substantial fine and will be a deterrent.  One has a better chance of getting £25,000 than £50,000 from a farmer.  A prison sentence is also a great deterrent, although I know a number of farmers who served prison sentences to avoid paying fines.  I understand if one serves a prison sentence, one need not pay the fine.  I do not know how this will operate under this legislation.  A £25,000 fine is adequate; a farmer can afford to pay such a fine but if it is increased to £50,000, only 4 per cent of farmers could pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">

      <P>The punishment must fit the crime and farmers using illegal substances are committing a serious offence.  Such farmers are doing untold damage to the beef industry and to their fellow farmers.  Furthermore, our beef industry will lose credibility.  Senator D'Arcy referred to a farmer in his locality who used these substances and who was unable to pay the fine imposed.  Substantial fines must be imposed to deter those using these illegal substances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing I am proposing is at variance with Senator D'Arcy's position. This legislation states that on summary conviction a fine not exceeding £1,000 will be imposed.  On conviction on indictment, a more serious matter, a fine not exceeding £50,000 will be imposed. The words used are &ldquo;not exceeding £50,000&rdquo;, it does not say that someone should not be fined £5,000 or £10,000, according to the judge's discretion taking into account their means or the scale of the crime.  This legislation also provides for imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, a serious penalty with which I would not quibble.  A fine of <Col N="668" /> £25,000 relative to a five year prison sentence seems small.  We should increase the fine to £10,000 for each year of imprisonment. Those guilty of a second offence and who have been twice convicted on indictment must face severe penalties.</P>

      <P>Senators will be aware that since it was first circulated, a number of amendments have been made to the Bill in the Dáil.  I accepted a number of appropriate amendments and as a result of the debate in the other House, this Bill has been improved.  I accepted an amendment from Senator Dardis's party which sought to increase the fines.  As Senator Dardis said, we have doubled the fines in relation to indictable offences.  I have no problem with Senator Dardis's point and I am not opposed to it in principle.</P>
      <P>However, I am anxious to enact this legislation as soon as possible, particularly at this time.  I ask the Senator to consider withdrawing the amendment on the basis that I accept the principle of what he is saying and that the aspect of the amendment which he is moving here today could be dealt with by the Minister by way of regulation.  I appeal to the House since we have had such a high degree of co-operation both in the Dáil and the Seanad to give me the opportunity to bring this Bill to a successful conclusion, have it signed by the President and brought into law as quickly as possible.</P>

It is in everybody's interest to do so speedily because we must deal with the problem of the use of illegal growth promoters.  I understand the technical difficulty involved and that were the Minister to accept an amendment today, the Bill would have to go back to the other House.  Perhaps we need to look at our procedures in that context, but that is a discussion for another day and perhaps it is not within the Minister's remit. I urge him to do whatever can be done, perhaps through other legislation, to <Col N="669" /> ensure that these penalties are increased.

      <P>I give that assurance to Senator Dardis, and I thank him for his constructive approach.  He made the point that the fines should be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence, but the possession of a drug or a drugged animal is a serious offence and will therefore come into the category which makes provision for the maximum level of fine and prison sentence.  To that extent, he can take some consolation in relation to this point.  He also pointed out that clenbuterol is a legal drug which is administered to horses.  However the dosage administered for the treatment of animal diseases is approximately one-tenth the strength needed for growth promotion. I also understand that it is a very expensive drug and one which would not be used extensively by the veterinary profession.</P>

      <P>One of the matters we discussed on Second Stage was the problem of analytical procedures.  If we are <Col N="670" /> bringing a case to court, we must produce empirical evidence that these particular substances have been present in the carcase, and their presence must be verifiable by analytical procedures.  How confident are we of the ability of science to show that these particular substances are present in the carcase?  I made the point on Second Stage that any person working in the boning hall of a meat factory can tell when they put the knife into the carcase whether it has been treated with these substances but that is no good when we come to court.  It may be that the boning hall expert knows, but we have to produce more substantial evidence.  How confident are we that if we have a carcase to which these drugs have been administered, we can say within ten or 15 days of administration, that that particular carcase was implanted with clenbuterol?  Can science tell us that?</P>

I hold the view, however, that it is more effective to deal with the use of illegal growth promoters at field level.  Senator Dardis and Senator D'Arcy made a point in regard to the butcher in the factory who can say with a fair degree of certainty that an animal has been treated.  We use visual indentification of the carcase in the factory as a means of doing field checks where we can be even more positive in identifying the use of the illegal substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are approaching this matter under a number of headings.  We are tackling the problem on the factory floor as well as on the farm and in relation to the administration of the drugs outside the factory.  This has been the situation within the Department for a considerable length of time, but perhaps the technology was not as advanced as it is today, <Col N="671" /> nor were the problems at European level as serious as it is today.  However we are benefiting from the development of technology and applying that technology to Irish industry.</P>
    <P>We are using a practical method, the observation of the carcase in the factory, as a means of alerting us to the possible use of the illegal product at farm level.  By a combination of improved technology, identifying the carcase in the factory and following up with a field investigation, together with the level of co-operation that Senator D'Arcy spoke about, and the continuing support of the agencies of State in preventing the importation of clenbuterol in the first instance &mdash; because that is where we will make a major breakthrough &mdash; Members can take it from me that under all these headings a positive job is being done by the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that those who are using this substance are cunning, and his Department has had great difficulty identifying any of them. The Minister used the phrase, &ldquo;a specified period&rdquo; in relation to the withdrawal period, which is 21 days.  The substance is withdrawn from the feed and then the cattle are sent for slaughter.  Is the test so sophisticated it can identify that the illegal substance has been used, is the Bill good enough to secure a conviction based on tests in the factory after a withdrawal period of 20 or 30 days?  This is the system that has been used over the years.  When the substances were legal in the 1970s they were withdrawn for 21 days or 30 days, and the same thing is happening with clenbuterol.  I would like to know how sophisticated equipment can cope with the withdrawal period.</P>

      <P>Identifying cattle that have been treated with this illegal substance is a useful exercise central to the successful implementation of this legislation. The greatest heartbreak for a farmer is to discover that cattle from a disease-free herd have been identified at the factory as being infected with TB. <Col N="672" /> Farmers do not deliberately infect their herds with TB but the use of illegal growth promoters is deliberate and illegal.  If it can be identified on the factory floor and if prosecutions can be brought, it would be the greatest deterrent to farmers or cattle dealers against using illegal growth promoters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been established that there is no definitive withdrawal period in relation to the use of these illegal substances.  There are, of course, specified withdrawal periods in relation to the legal use of many veterinary products. You can take it from me that advanced technology will be able to identify the use of an illegal growth promoter far beyond what some farmers might recognise as being a satisfactory withdrawal period.  With improvements in advanced technology, even minute quantities of products used for growth promotion can be identified in carcases.  That line is being vigorously pursued along with on-field identification which I regard as being the more effective way of obtaining positive evidence on the use of these substances.  Section 9 of the Bill, for example, allows the results to be dealt with in cases where there is evidence of the use of these substances in other words, it gives us the power to deal with such cases.</P>

      <P>I am encouraged by the Minster of State's reply because I do not think it would be very helpful if the suggestion went out from this House that after 20 or 30 days anyone was safe.  I would like to see a constant improvement in scientific detection so that no one would be under the impression that because they have administered this substance 20 or 30 days before slaughter they are going to get away with it.  I know from dealing with plant chemicals that parts per billion can now be unquestionably detected quite easily.  That has led to other implications because people now get worried about one part per billion in a material which would otherwise be safe. It is important that nobody should have the impression that their crime will not <Col N="673" /> be detected, and I am glad the Minister of State has given that reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Members of this House for their co-operation in dealing with this Bill.  The debate has been characterised by a positive appreciation of the matters we are seeking to address and there has been unanimous support for the principles and policies which the Bill seeks to establish as part of our statute law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must put on record my appreciation of the positive, constructive and non-contentious manner in which the Bill was debated by this House and, in particular, the fact that the Members are as anxious as I am to bring the Bill into law at the earliest possible opportunity.  I do not <Col N="675" /> wish to imply that the expeditious passage of this Bill suggests any element of rubber stamping or lack of consideration of the serious matters it deals with by the Members of this House.</P>
    <P>It was clear from the quality of the debate that the Members had done their homework and were fully aware of what this legislation sets out to achieve.  It is a measure of the attention they paid to it that the basic purpose of providing a comprehensive basis to ensure the safe and responsible use of animal remedies and the protection of the integrity and safety of the food chain was fully appreciated and supported by all Members, regardless of political affiliations.  It is clear that on these matters the Legislature and the Executive are of a single mind and that should send a clear message to would be offenders that they will find little sympathy for their cause amongst the Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The passage of this Bill is indeed timely.  At present, new proposals from Commissioner Steichen to tighten up controls and enforcement of the law in relation to the use of illegal growth promoters are under consideration.  Some of the measures which the Commissioner wishes to introduce are already law in Ireland and many more are contained in this Bill.  The passage of this Bill is also a clear signal of support for the Commissioner in his efforts to restore quality and confidence to the European meat industry.  More importantly, it is a very clear message to consumers of Irish meat that unilaterally we are prepared to apply the strictest measures to ensure the quality and safety of the food we produce.</P>
    <P>Encouraged by the solidarity which I have found in the Houses of the Oireachtas I can go forward to the Agriculture Council and insist that the problem of illegal growth promoters be addressed as we are doing by imposing strict controls and severe penalties rather than by crude measures, such as carcase weight limitations which penalise the good law abiding farmer as well as the offender and do nothing to address the <Col N="676" /> problems of dealers and traffickers in such substances.</P>
    <P>Finally, a lot of attention has been focused on the problem of illegal use of animal remedies.  This is not unusual in view of the attention which this topic has received in recent times and consequently dealing with these problems is one of the principal functions of the Bill. However, it is not the only one.  It must be remembered that the aim of this legislation is the protection of all consumers and of the livestock and food industries and it should create an environment in which these interests will prosper.  I assure all those who supported its passage to date that the legislation when enacted will be vigorously enforced in all our interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <P>On behalf of my party I thank the Minister for the way he has conducted this Bill.  It is important legislation which must be enacted quickly.  I hope it will have the desired effect of assuring consumers, at home and abroad, that they can rely on the quality of Irish food.  The Minister will have our support when he goes to the Commission in Brussels and outlines, in no uncertain terms, the responsibilities of other countries in this matter.  The issue of carcase weights is of lesser importance than this problem.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the manner in which he has answered our questions.  I also thank his officials for their expertise. There is a refreshing absence of the term &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; in the Bill.  I only found it once in the first page of the Bill.  The &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; disease is not so manifest in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry as it is in some other Departments.</P>

I am glad scientific methods have improved to <Col N="677" /> the extent that they can be used to identify the use of these substances.  That had previously been a problem.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Education to review the School Transport Scheme.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. Her presence here indicates her recognition of the importance of school transport. I am pleased we can have a debate on this particular aspect of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is about 27 years since the late Donogh O'Malley introduced school transport and the structures have evolved substantially since then.  In County Donegal few people received third level education 27 years ago; today, few families <Col N="678" /> do not aspire to providing third level education for their children.  The situation has completely altered since the introduction of school transport and I believe it is now necessary to review the system, which is the purpose of my motion this evening.</P>
    <P>I understand that a sum in excess of £34 million is provided by the Minister and the Government to CIE for school transport.  Approximately 60 per cent of that sum is spent on the transport of grant aided students to second and third level education and the remaining 40 per cent goes to small contractors who provide school transport for CIE.  This is not an easy business to manage as it involves the Minister and Department of Education, CIE and different contractors.  I do not think that making the chain longer makes it any stronger.</P>
    <P>I have been associated with trying to improve school school transport for a long time and I saw the need for a review of the system long before now.  I am not blaming any particular Minister, Government or Department or CIE.  We must take a hard look at how the money is spent and ask if the State or the taxpayer can afford to give more money.  It is a growing problem and the ever increasing cost of school transport must be examined. I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the fact that is now more costly to insure, maintain, repair and replace vehicles.  I am sure that our experience in Donegal is no different to that of Kerry, Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim or any part of rural Ireland today.</P>
    <P>I examined my file on the many times I have written to different Ministers for Education over the years about different schools and I brought two letters with me to cover two different periods.  I will give the Minister examples of how serious the problem is in my county.  Children from the St. Johnson area, which is one of the problem areas in County Donegal, must get up at 6 a.m. to be transported by car to a site where they are picked up by a bus which takes them to a second bus. This means they arrive much too early for school in Raphoe or Letterkenny. They spend at least two hours travelling <Col N="679" /> the nine miles from their homes to Raphoe.  That is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>We have another situation in Donegal where a bus collects children in the Ballybofey-Stranorlar area for the prior and comprehensive school in Raphoe.  That bus &mdash; which is referred to locally as the bus for the Protestant children &mdash; cannot collect Catholic children who want to travel from the Ballybofey-Stranorlar area to Raphoe vocational school.  Some people have asked if they have to change their religion to get school transport. Those are the kind of problems we have.</P>
    <P>Many schools were closed down in the rationalisation programme over the years and the Department of Education has given an undertaking to transport the children from schools which have been closed to the schools which have been designated to take them.  In a number of cases where the school bus is full or overloaded, the Department said it had a contractual obligation to take, for example, the two children who were attending a school at Meencariagh, which is near Barnesmore, but had no contract or obligation to take an additional two children who were not at the primary school when the Department closed it and made the contract.  That too is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I understand Senator Cotter has tabled an amendment to the motion but I do not think that is helpful.  I am serious about this and I do not intend to make political capital out of this and I am delighted the Minister came to the house to deal with this matter.  There are many similar situations in County Donegal and I would like the Minister to look at them.  If necessary, she should review the whole school transport system, a review I believe is long overdue.  I am pleased the Minister has made an announcement about certain disadvantaged schools.  I am most concerned about schools in rural areas.  It is necessary for the maintenance of education in rural areas to take a hard look at these schools.</P>
    <P>On the main road between Ballybofey and Donegal a school bus collects children at a pick up point which has been <Col N="680" /> agreed between CIE and the Department of Education.  The pick up point is less than a mile from where the school children live.  I have written to CIE and the Department of Education asking that the school bus pick up point be changed to where the families live.  I am sorry to say &mdash; and I do not mean it destructively &mdash; that the Department refused, although the route had only to be extended by nearly a mile.  It is unacceptable that on wet winter mornings children have to walk almost a mile on the main Donegal road, with heavy traffic, to be picked up by a bus and taken to another school. The Minister will say she has fought a hard battle at Government for the amount of money she got and that she spends it as wisely as she can having inherited a system she may not like. Nevertheless, I believe a review of the whole system is long overdue and I sincerely ask her to take a positive look at it.</P>
    <P>The safety aspect of school transport must also be looked at.  I was in the United States this year and I took photographs which I want to show the Minister. It is important to note that there are special stop signs on all school buses in America and when the stop sign and the lights are flashing on a school bus it is unlawful to pass out that bus.  It is painted very clearly on the back of the bus that it is unlawful to pass a school bus.  They found, from experience of the number of children who had been killed and injured, that it was necessary to implement stringent safety regulations for school transport.</P>
    <P>I believe safety is an important aspect of the problem here and I ask that it be seriously addressed when the review takes place.  The problems in this area have snowballed to the point where I do not know how the Minister or the Department could continue operating this scheme without a review.  A number of local children have been killed alighting from the back of a bus.  Legislation will be required and a positive attitude must be adopted because of the many people involved &mdash; the Department, CIE and the subcontractors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> The present relationship between CIE and the subcontractors is not satisfactory. There is a tug-of-war going on.  It is believed the private bus operator could do a better job if he was no longer tied to CIE &mdash; I do not believe that personally. CIE has different responsibilities and much bigger overheads, for example, insurance, paying and insuring drivers, holiday pay, etc., and it is making a major contribution to school transport.  The solution will not be easy: we are looking for an in-depth examination and hopefully the Minister will have enough support in Government to undertake a major review which can only lead to improvement.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the safety regulations. The Minister will be aware of the number of children who have lost their lives alighting from school transport vehicles.  I appreciate the Minister taking the time to come to the House.  I hope our motion will bring closer the day when we will have an improved school transport system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion because it promotes the sensible idea that the public sector policy should be reviewed.  Periodic reviews should be part of every public sector policy.</P>
      <P>The free school transport system was introduced many years ago and has served the country well; it has created a new dynamic by allowing people to move freely around the country in search of education.  However, like any good system after many years a number of bureaucratic elements have inevitably crept into it &mdash; and Senator McGowan dealt with some of them.  I supported this motion within my parliamentary group because of those bureaucratic elements.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister will forgive me for being parochial because in constituency matters she is no slouch herself.  She will understand if, in illustrating how bureaucracy can impede the operation of the system, I will obviously pick an example from County Wicklow &mdash; and the Minister is already aware of the example I am going to pick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several deficiencies in the <Col N="682" /> system and one of the major ones is that the school transport liaison officer in each area operates in a direct relationship with the Minister rather than answering to a locally based organisation and it is difficult to get any feedback at local level from school transport liaison officers.  I have long argued that local discussion should be part of the resolution of difficulties in the school transport system.</P>
    <P>I will illustrate this with reference to specific events in north Wicklow with which the Minister is familiar.  Some years ago one of the Minister's predecessors decided a new second level school was to be built there and, as north Wicklow &mdash; the Bray-Greystones area, in particular &mdash; was then growing more rapidly than any other area in the country, it was a sensible decision.  However, good sense and educational planning went out the door when it was decided to build the new second level school in Wicklow town.</P>
    <P>At that time Wicklow town was oversupplied with second level places: there are two excellent secondary schools in the town, the De La Salle college and the Dominican convent; and we also had the growing Abbey community college &mdash; which has since developed remarkably &mdash; run by the vocational education committee. Those three second level institutions are of adequate size to take all the students from their immediate catchment area.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education at the time gave permission to build a new second level school for the Church of Ireland community &mdash; the East Glendalough school &mdash; but it was built in the wrong place &mdash; Wicklow town.  It should have been built in Kilcoole.  All the arguments favoured building a community college &mdash; and not a denominational one &mdash; in Kilcoole to service people of all denominations and none.</P>
    <P>All but a few of the places in second level schools in north Wicklow are spoken for.  Parents from Kilcoole, Newtownmountkennedy, Newcastle and Greystones cannot get their children into the local secondary schools.  Those parents have indicated that they would like <Col N="683" /> to exercise some choice in their children's education.  Many girls' parents want them to go to all girls' schools.  That may be a good or a bad thing, but the point is that the parents should have the right to choose.  Yet, there are no places for their girls in all girls' schools.  Some parents wish to send their boys to all boys' schools but there are no places available.  There are no places available in St. David's, the only second level school in Greystones &mdash; and an excellent school &mdash; irrespective of the choice one would wish to exercise.</P>
    <P>Currently school buses run from Kilmacanogue and Newcastle through Kilcoole with many empty spaces.  They are going to the East Glendalough Church of Ireland school.  Parents have had discussions with the county school transport liaison officer, as has the vocational education committee, but progress has not been made.  Logic and good sense would suggest if the students are in Kilcoole and the school places are in Wicklow town, any school bus going via Kilcoole to Wicklow with spare capacity should pick up those children and bring them to the available secondary level places.</P>
    <P>The people in Kilcoole and Greystones have been most reasonable.  They endorsed the ministerial decision to build a new Church of Ireland second level school.  Now, however, people of the majority religious persuasion have no school for their children.  Seventeen families in Kilcoole are wondering where they will find education for their children in the autumn term.</P>
    <P>To return to the motion, what does this illustrate?  Apart from showing that the people in north Wicklow suffer monumental injustices calmly, have extraordinary patience and are well represented in this House if not elsewhere it illustrates there is a common sense approach to resolving this problem. The Minister and any person, especially a politician, in the area, would accept that.  However, many bureaucratic considerations, such as catchment boundaries are involved in the school transport system and educational considerations are not taken into account.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> Another distressing fact is the feeling among parents and public representatives in north Wicklow that two different stories are being told.  The vocational education committee says recommendations are being made to the Department of Education which will not disappoint local interests; notwithstanding that, parents have been told the Department has been advised the best that can be done for those children is to offer them boundary catchment area transport.  That means they will get spare capacity on buses from Newcastle but there is no public transport from Kilcoole to Newcastle in the early morning.  This means the children will be left high and dry even if this &ldquo;concession&rdquo; is extended. If the school transport system could have more local input and the school transport liaison officers in all counties, not just Wicklow, discussed catchement boundaries with local public representatives in the vocational education committee or wider local education authorities, more sensible public school transport would be provided.</P>
    <P>It might also be a good but hardly a revolutionary idea if children attending the Church of Ireland secondary school in Wicklow town could share buses if not education with children from other denominations or <i>vice versa.</i>  There are special concerns in regard to Church of Ireland schools and the State correctly over-compensates for the minority status of that group.  Even until the Minister decides to build a secondary school in Kilcoole, which is an issue for another day, it would be a good idea to be accomodating and to adopt a more flexible approach.</P>
    <P>I have illustrated a shortcoming in the school transport system by refering to a parochial consideration but the problem of inflexibility and bureaucracy arises across the country.  The Minister is conscious of the need to improve matters and to get value for money.  As part of a review it would be wise to examine how best to link the school transport liaison officer role with local considerations. Perhaps elected members of vocational education committees should be involved <Col N="685" /> because they know the position in local areas and where there is pressure.  They also have to answer for themselves democratically to the parents.  That might be a positive step forward.</P>
    <P>The school transport system has served the country well.  It was a small but dramatic step forward when introduced and will continue to serve us well.  There are needs for adjustments to various aspects of the scheme and I have illustrated one of those.</P>

      <P>I am pressing this amendment and it will be seconded by my colleague Senator McDonagh.</P>
      <P>To some extent we are speaking in a vacuum this evening but consideration of the amendment will lead one to realise the vacuum is unnecessary.  Every Member should have copies of these reports available to them.  They should be able to read and examine them and speak from knowledge of the contents of the reports.  A fine debate could then take place on the school transport issue.  It is an expensive business in that last year it cost £37.5 million to operate and it may cost more this year.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the two reports I mention &mdash; the Deloitte and Touche report and the Bastow Charleton report &mdash; which were commissioned by Deputy Brennan while he was Minister for Education.  Why did the Minister commission two reports?  I believe a small scandal lies in the answer to the question. It should be investigated and the results made known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first report was carried out by the Deloitte and Touche consultancy firm.  It is an internationally renowned firm with considerable experience and expertise in the transport field.  The Minister <Col N="686" /> received, read and for some reason rejected that report.  He decided not to publish it and, because it did not agree with his views, he rejected it.</P>
    <P>Being in control of taxpayers' money he decided he had the luxury to commission a second report in the hope it would agree with his view of what should be done with the transport system.  This was putting the cart neatly before the horse.  He first decided what he wanted to do and then commissioned a report that would agree with him.  He could then say he was not responsible for doing what he wanted but the report had forced him to do so.  I find that unacceptable and I am sure taxpayers would too.</P>
    <P>These questions have to be raised because we want to know why the two reports are not available to all of us by now.  Why does the Minister have access and we do not?  In answer to a question from Deputy Jim Higgins, the then Minister said in the Dáil on 22 October last the Deloitte and Touche report was based on a study including confidential information on cost factors relating to the operations of Bus Éireann and private transport firms.  In my investigations I have discovered everyone in Ireland has access to the report by now.  I do not have a copy in my possession but I know where they can be had.</P>

When Deputy Brennan was Minister for Education he refused to publish it, yet the Senator from Cork has a copy and every person around the country who wants a copy can have one.  The Minister refuses to publish it on the basis that she could be questioned about it in a court, and that it contains certain sensitive information. The Senator has all that sensitive information in his possession at the moment. This is the new Ireland.  Did the Senator get it from the Minister by any chance?</P>

It is not a matter for silly comment in this House that a report, which has not been published, is in the possession of a Senator.  The Senator should explain to the House where and how he got the report and he should apologise to the House for having it because I am sure that, as a Member of this House, he is aware that since this report has not been published he should not have it in his possession.  I do not have a copy of it although I have been informed I can do so.  This must be investigated and I ask the Minister, who moved into the Department recently, to open up that Department and examine what happened with regard to that report and find out how the Senator got a copy of it.  I hope the Minister herself did not give it to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to treat this matter very seriously.  She should find out why the report has not been published and why people all over the country have copies of it.  She should find out the background and let us know how much taxpayers' money was spent and whether it was ill-spent because everybody is saying it was.  The public are certainly of that opinion.  We cannot afford such luxuries at a time when money is in short supply.</P>
      <P>We are trying to reduce the cost of the system yet when one looks at it one sees that approximately 170,000 children are transported to and from school every day.  It is a massive operation.  I know the Minister is aware of the intricacies and the difficulties dealing with it.  I believe that in the interests of open Government the other report should also be made available officially.  Senator Magner could then have this report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make a few comments on the system itself.  I am concerned about the safety aspect.  I am firmly convinced that it is unsafe to have <Col N="689" /> 70 or 80 children travelling to school on a bus in the morning without adult supervision. There is also overcrowding.  Buses which were provided when the scheme was introduced are now outdated and because of their age and condition they are dangerous.  The safety of the children must be considered.</P>
      <P>I suggest, as I have done before, that there is an easy way to provide adult supervision for every bus.  We are all aware that there are 300,000 people without work.  I am sure a few thousand of them could be deployed under the social employment scheme so that every bus would have adult supervision.</P>
      <P>All of us, particularly those of us who are teachers, know that the child who leaves the front door in the morning is not the child who gets on the school bus and is not the child who enters school. Peer pressures see to that.  Parents never understand that their child, who is very good and obedient in its home environment, gets into all sorts of difficulties outside of that environment.  It happens and the school bus is one of the places where we have, and have always had, difficulties with behaviour.</P>
      <P>This is one aspect the Minister should look at immediately.  She has the remedy. A few thousand people taken off the dole and put on the social employment scheme would improve the system greatly.  I am sorry I do not have more time and that I spent too much time talking about a report which should not be in the possession of a Senator&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am proposing that we have a properly informed debate on the basis that the Minister will issue the two reports officially so we can read them. Why can we not get them?  Taxpayers' money has been used to pay for them. We should have them and at that stage we could have a very good debate.  I ask every Member of this House to support my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. <Col N="690" /> I welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
      <P>I believe the school transport system is not student friendly.  We are told that education and educational facilities should revolve around our students, that students should be the focal point around which the educational system revolves.  This is not the case in my opinion and in the opinion of many people involved in the education sphere.</P>
      <P>The length of the school day causes many students, particularly in rural areas, to be disadvantaged.  The cause in most instances is that school buses have to make two trips.  Many buses in rural Ireland, and students accordingly, are on the road from approximately 6.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m.  Also, there is a great lack of facilities in schools to provide hot meals. It is medically unsound to expect students to perform well academically because they are disadvantaged in the sense of having to be away from home for so long without any proper or substantial meal. We then expect them to pass their examinations and to perform well in the difficult and competitive education system that exists today.</P>
      <P>I understand there is now a grave danger that the double tripping may become triple tripping if an EC directive is implemented by next September.  This directive, as I understand it, states that for those aged 15 and over there should be two students to one seat.  At the moment students up to 19 years of age can occupy a seat with two others &mdash; this makes three students to one seat.  This raises the issues of safety.  We should also keep in mind that in addition to three to a seat there is also luggage carried on seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent survey conducted by &ldquo;The Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; on radio estimated that a student's school bag weighs approximately one stone.  I put the question, be it rhetorical or not, are buses designed for this type of carriage?  I can instance one school in my own area which, for the last nine months, had 72 pupils travelling on a school bus with their luggage and bags.  It must be stated that any review of school transport seems <Col N="691" /> to worsen the facility because the number of those who can travel on buses is lowered and they go from double to triple tripping.  This means that any safety improvements will be a disadvantage for the students because the school day will be lengthened.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that many buses do two journeys to the post-primary school and one journey to the primary school before nine o'clock each morning.  Regrettably, when the Department thinks about cutbacks, the first area to be affected is the school transport system.  Perhaps the reason for this is that students have no one to speak for them. The teachers have their unions, the Department can speak for itself, but the students have no one to speak for them. Accordingly, they are being disadvantaged and it is time students and their problems be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>As a solution I believe a small percentage increase in the transport budget could greatly improve the system and make it student friendly.  Students could achieve more from a good transport system if they had a shorter school day because they would be more alert and could perform better.  As a public representative living in the west, I know that its remoteness causes a major problem for students and school buses.  Long distances must be travelled because of the catchment area.  In Dublin city or the surrounding areas, a catchment area could be confined to a three mile radius while in Connemara, the area I represent, the radius can be up to 16 miles. Accordingly, students are subjected to hardship and are disadvantaged.  Perhaps the Minister could tell me if such areas ae entitled to special assistance from European funds for the transport system which operates in these areas.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister and the Department to put an end to the double trips which buses have to make.  No student should be asked to leave their homes before 8 o'clock in the morning.  It must also be remembered that in order to get to the school bus, many students must walk two miles because there is no obligation <Col N="692" /> on Bus Éireann to supply school transport to any student living within three miles of their school.  This is an issue of deep concern to parents, boards of management of community schools, vocational educational committees, etc.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will carry out the review, at the end of the day, because the students and their needs should be taken into consideration.  If this happens, there will be a better transport system in operation and no student will have to leave their homes, particularly in winter time, before 8 o'clock in the morning.  If this system is introduced, the Minister will have done a good job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The school transport system is one of the best nationwide services which we have in this State.  Each day 165,000 people are transported on 6,000 routes; 800 of these vehicles are run by Bus Éireann under the yellow bus scheme and many of the remaining vehicles are operated by 1,150 private contractors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Senators have highlighted incidents in their constituencies which have shown the problems that exist in the scheme.  I would like the Senators to stop arguing from the particular to the general <Col N="693" /> and look instead at the overall scheme which has been provided for almost 25 years.  Although problems exist the scheme has been operated in an efficient manner by Bus Éireann and the Labour Party would be slow to change a system which, according to many people, is doing a good job.</P>
    <P>Many small rural companies operate school transport systems on behalf of Bus Éireann.  Without them the system would not work and without the school transport business many of these small bus operators would be out of business. Consequently, many rural transport facilities, for example, buses bringing passengers to and from games and bingo, would not be available.</P>
    <P>The rules and regulations are laid down by the Department of Education.  I agree with Senators who say that no system is so perfect that a review is not necessary. I would remind them that there is more than one school bus scheme.  There are ten separate bus schemes which operate in conjunction with one another or, as a Senator said earlier, against one another. This is one of the problems which exist when a complex nationwide system is in operation.</P>
    <P>We must also remember that these schemes are administered by Bus Éireann on a non-profit basis.  Any savings which Bus Éireann makes revert to the Department of Education.  Bus Éireann has figures which prove that the real cost of providing a school transport system has been reducing since the mid-1980s, if inflation is taken into account. This is due to their ability to operate economies of scale and to ensure that competitive rates apply when they employ private bus contractors to do some of their work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Senator get that information from the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I got it from Bus Eireann.  All moneys are properly spent and accounted for not only by Bus Éireann's auditors, Craig Gardner, but also by the Department's auditor.  The <Col N="694" /> scheme is administered by nine local offices.  Therefore, when one complains about bureaucracy, one is complaining about a local office because it is not a centralised bureaucracy.  If there were more than nine offices, Bus Éireann would not be efficient enough to operate at a competitive rate.  For example, there is a local office in County Limerick and people from County Limerick or County Clare can make representations or inquiries to the Limerick office.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann employs 67 inspectors who ensure that safety standards are maintained on all buses, whether they are buses directly under the control of Bus Éireann or supplied by a subcontractor. These 67 inspectors can arrive unexpectedly and this ensures that safety standards are applied.  Before contractors are employed by Bus Éireann, drivers must ensure that they have the necessary driving skills to safely operate a school bus.  They must also ensure that they and their relief drivers are in good health.  By ensuring that drivers are operating under safety standards.  Bus Éireann guarantees that our children are safely transported to and from school.</P>
      <P>Since Bus Éireann is the biggest transport expert in the country, why should we change from a proven operator which has served this country well?  Have we any guarantee that if we move the system from Bus Éireann the private operator will ensure that the same rigid standards are maintained?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Pilot schemes to transfer the scheme out of Bus Éireann's control have been attempted in Counties Carlow, Laoighis, Cavan and Clare and we have heard no results from them. Perhaps they showed that Bus Éireann was doing the competent job we believed all along.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were more people operating outside of the control of Bus Éireann the per unit cost of administration would rise.  Who would pay for this?  Surely it would be levied on the parents.  This would mean there would be no protection for the smaller rural schools while larger urban schools might be prepared to subsidise numbers on buses to ensure they maintain their service.</P>
      <P>Competition between schools is not only confined to the playing pitches, it also exists as to student numbers particularly in rural areas where there is a general decline in numbers anyway. Therefore, without the control of Bus Éireann one would have a lot of local conflict.  If there were ten children living along a particular road and they were equi-distant between schools, there would be competition between schools and bus operators to get those children on the bus going to their school.  I could see a myriad of headaches looming for politicians.</P>
      <P>If the school transport scheme was removed from Bus Éireann what would happen to Bus Éireann?  The school transport scheme is worth about 40 per cent of Bus Éireann's total revenue and its loss would lead to about 1,100 redundancies. It would also lead to garage closures in places such as Longford town, Athlone, Thurles, Tralee, Cavan and Waterford.</P>
      <P>The school bus system often not only brings children to school but also provides a vital link to scheduled services to larger urban areas, as happens, for example, in the Baltimore area of County Cork.  Without the school bus link this service to the people of west Cork would have to be ended as it would not be feasible or viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review is needed because, as I said, no system is so perfect that we cannot take another look at it.  It often struck me that, for example, the 800 or more yellow buses in operation under Bus Éireann are often lying idle between 10 <Col N="696" /> a.m. and 2 p.m.  Yet, these yellow buses could be put to good use particularly in rural areas to transport elderly people to outpatient clinics, for example.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to ensure that Bus Éireann is fully compensated and paid for its services because Bus Éireann has informed me that there is a slight shortfall every year.  It is not fully recompensed for the money it spends paying private contractors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad I was present to hear Senator Kelly as I have suspected for a long time that a plan was being hatched to privatise school transport. Senator Kelly has confirmed that this evening.  I too have a copy of the Deloitte and Touche report.  I concur with Senator Kelly that the transport system operated by Bus Éireann, as was proved by the Deloitte and Touche consultants, proved to be the most cost effective.  That report was produced and presented but never published.  The report states that the present transportation arrangements are satisfactory and should not be altered unless circumstances significantly change.  It is extraordinary that the Minister then commissioned Bastow Charelton to do another report.  Was that for the purpose of appointing consultants at a high cost to look into the previous report? All we have had are reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While all that was happening, in an area of north Cork &mdash; there were moves toward privatisation and people are now beginning to realise that &mdash; in a place called Araglin, the Department of Education on 19 June 1992 wrote two letters to the same school manager, one saying that because he had not got sufficient eligible children in one area it was withdrawing school transport; the other letter said there were not enough eligible children in the other area &mdash; one area was Lyre and Lyrebarry and the other was Ballinamodock.  You could throw a stone easily between Lyre and Lyrebarry and Ballinamodock and to use the regulation that says that areas must be distinct localities was an abuse of the system and <Col N="697" /> the school transport regulations.  That was done because they were not distinct localities.</P>
    <P>Araglin is the most rural area of Ireland with children attending a national school and on 1 September when the school opened there was no school transport. It was not provided until all the children were withdrawn from that school, with the exception of one family. The Department resurrected a document produced in 1978 which said that children in a close school area, Ballyheafy, were more appropriate to Ballyduff.  That was done despite the fact that in a letter in 1978 the then Minister of State wrote to a public representative in that area and said that the Department had conceded that the children should be going to Araglin school.  Yet, it was resurrected for the purpose of producing figures that were not accurate to show that the locality did not have the required number of eligible children.  I thought that was a mean thing to do.  It has since been conceded that they are part of the Araglin locality.</P>
    <P>I have been in touch with the Ministers and their officials &mdash; and from time to time I have been cross with officials.  I saw the ugly face of bureaucracy in the Department of Education and I will not pull any punches on this issue.  A family who live two miles from the pick up point were told that their child would have transport from the door, but when the school transport was withdrawn, they would not accept, as many other parents would not accept at the time, that their child should have to travel two miles.  The Department of Education have advised time and again that the accepted norm a child must travel is 1.5 miles but in this case it is almost two miles.  This has been checked and double checked and since September 1992 those children have not attended Araglin national school.  This is a disgrace.  These parents are only concerned about the welfare of their children. That child, who is asthmatic, has improved.  The Minister has advised me that school transport is the concern of the Minister of State at the Department of <Col N="698" /> Education, but I ask her to address this case and the position in Araglin.  There are now 20 qualified children in this area; previously it was said there was fewer than ten and when the transport was restored this number increased to 14.</P>
    <P>Finally, I ask the Minister to make a statement of policy on the future of school transport.  While it is accepted that one cannot go up every boreen, what is required is a reasonable system that will provide a service for the children in rural areas.</P>

If it was not for the late Donogh O'Malley we would not be addressing this issue today.  Mr. O'Malley was a man ahead of his time in establishing in the 1960s the school transport system.  It was and remains a great service, especially for those living in rural areas and in towns.</P>
      <P>I want to pay tribute to the bus drivers in Bus Éireann and in the privately owned bus companies.  They display commendable courage driving big buses around narrow country roads.  Very few accidents happen and this is due to their great skill.  Given the material of which the modern bus is made, fibreglass and so on, the drivers must be especially careful. In addition, the condition of some of these buses is appalling, especially those in the Bus Éireann fleet which need urgent replacement.  They are leaking, their life span has expired and because of maintenance costs it is expensive to keep them on the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could ensure that her Department consults with the Minister for the Environment so that he may tell county managers that more attention should be paid to hedge trimming and sign posting of country roads along a school bus route.  In an age where there are large lorries, farm machinery and trucks travelling on those roads I would not drive a school bus for £1,000 per <Col N="699" /> week.  The responsibility of having 60 children on a bus travelling roads is onerous.  While the local council has an obligation to breast the hedges, the rest of the cutting of such hedges is an obligation on the land owners.  I have endeavoured to emphasise this point in my local area of south Tipperary.  Special attention should be paid to school bus routes to ensure that the hedges are properly trimmed twice a year.  Such routes should be signposted to indicate that they are school bus routes.  It would be appalling if there were an accident; there have been many near misses thanks to the skill of the drivers.</P>
    <P>The Bus Éireann offices which assist schools and parents to deal with problems that arise was mentioned by Senator Sherlock.  I am aware of the area of which he spoke and it is regrettable that this difficulty has arisen.  Problems like this have arisen through the years largely because the application of the regulations has been too strict.  The Minister might give power to the inspectors at local level to allow them be more flexible in the application of the regulations.  For example, because of regulations even if there are vacant seats on a bus, the driver has to pass children on the road.  This does not make sense.  Years ago CIE bus drivers passed old age pensioners on the road.  These people had to walk three miles to the bus stop before they could board a bus.  This problem was resolved and I believe the problems with the school transport system can also be resolved.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider delegating more power to people at local level to enable them resolve the teething problems and to get the system to operate more smoothly.  She might also persuade her Cabinet colleague to issue a directive to county managers to tidy school bus routes to ensure there are no tragedies.</P>
    <P>The big buses in use on the school bus routes were not designed for country roads.  The larger mini buses, used by some of the private operators, are safer than big buses, especially on country roads.  Perhaps the Minister would consider <Col N="700" /> this aspect as it is essential to avoid the risk of accidents.  I have every confidence that, with the Minister's experience in this area, all the necessary measures will be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the innumerable subjects on which I attended the House to listen and learn. However, experience has taught me that if one is a listener and learner one is not noticed and tends to become invisible.  In view of this I thought I should take the opportunity to respond to the gracious invitation of the Chair to make one or two comments on the discussion.  However, I do so without access to that now famous report.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty with Ministers rejecting consultants' reports.  There appears to be a fetish about such reports. This may have been justified in earlier years, although even then I believe it would have been doubtful, but not today. Many consultants' reports are scarcely worth the paper they are written on and I have no difficulty with Ministers rejecting them, and even rejecting them contumely. Not knowing the content of this report I am not suggesting that it should be rejected.  However, when Ministers reject reports it would be helpful to debate if they published them and gave their reasons for rejecting them.  This would give an opportunity to evaluate the calibre of ministerial thinking compared with the calibre of consultant thinking.  I have no doubt that in a number of cases the ministerial thinking would be clearly superior.  I am not suggesting that this is the case in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two points have struck me.  There has been an ideological undercurrent in the debate between public transport and private transport, between Bus Éireann and privatisation.  A review is desirable if only on the grounds that periodic reviews are desirable anyway.  I hope that such a review will be conducted without ideological preconceptions simply in terms of trying to evaluate where the best value for money lies but taken in a capacious context and not looking at it purely through the narrowest of accountancy <Col N="701" /> perspectives which tend to be a temptation for reviews.</P>
    <P>The school bus system is part of the warp and weave of the social structure of rural Ireland and any attempt to reduce the evaluation of the school bus system purely to the short term accountancy dimension, even though that cannot be ignored, grossly over-simplifies the role of the system in Irish society.  It is for that reason that I hope any terms of reference for such a review are very carefully thought out, to evaluate it or require its evaluation in a much broader context than the purely financial.</P>
    <P>Many of the issues that were raised by Senator Kelly in terms of the implications for division in communities, which are already rife with potential for division, are unlikely to be taken into account by the type of people who normally conduct reviews.  There have been some extraordinarily inept reviews in different areas of education, not least higher education of which I have some personal knowledge and on which I will not linger here, but they have left me with a very healthy scepticism of the capacity of even the most professional of consultancy groups to conduct effective reviews because their terms of reference simply do not either enable them or compel them to take the variety of variables into account.</P>
    <P>I wish to make one final point which I am sure the Minister does not need me to make as she is such a formidable constituency politician.  There is a perspective in a great deal of public comment &mdash; one gets it in the financial columns of newspapers, from academics and from political scientists &mdash; that a preoccupation with local issues demeans Irish politics, that there is an impurity attached to lingering over local issues which are almost invariably presented as being contrary to some theoretical national interest. Senator Roche began today by almost apologising for his preoccupation with parochial issues.  It seems to me that on an issue of this type it is a great strength of our system that there is such a concern with, a solicitude for and a knowledge of local issues among politicians whether in the Dáil or in the Seanad.  Therefore far <Col N="702" /> from resenting the emphasis on localities that one hears in discussions of this type, that seems to me to be one of the great strengths of our system.  I hope the Minister will take cognisance of the points made by those who are speaking from a position of informed authority on their local issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with one aspect of this issue.  School transport is varied and it appears that there has been some confusion about the role of Bus Éireann on the one hand and the Department of Education on the other.  As I understand it, if the Minister instructed Bus Éireann to pick up everybody with a green jumper, it would simply pick them up and drop them off at the appropriate place.  Bus Éireann does not decide who is selected to go to any particular area. Its job is to transport people.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with that aspect, which was also touched on by Senator Sherlock, but before I do so I wish to address a remark to my colleague Senator Cotter about the Deloitte and Touche report.  It first come to my notice when Deputy J. Higgins stood up in the Dáil and waved it at the former Minister for Education, Deputy S. Brennan and asked him why he would not publish it.  If I am due to be taken to the gallows I will be accompanied no doubt by the Fine Gael spokesperson on Education and, by Senator Sherlock whom I believe also has a copy in his possession, and I would not rule out Senator Kelly either.</P>
      <P>I got the report today not from anybody in the House or anybody connected with the Department of Education, but I am very glad I got it.  I have read many reports that examined State enterprise over the years and this report in my opinion proves that CIE through Bus Éireann is operating probably the best possible school transport system.  Deloitte and Touche, I understand, put people on this report who had specific expertise in transportation and one of their conclusions was that the present scheme is satisfactory and should not be altered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>The report stated that the provision of the school transport scheme by Bus Éireann was, in their opinion, at or near the minimum cost. Supervision and management of the school transport network is carried out efficiently by Bus Éireann and the level of skill and service provided by the company in the management of the scheme is high.  Management and supervision costs represent value for money in that the overall cost of the scheme has fallen.</P>
      <P>Would anybody believe that after a hard nosed team of experts was sent in to examine one of the units of the former CIE, that report would emerge?  I suggest that there is not a private company in the State that would come out of an investigation like that as well as Bus Éireann.</P>
      <P>The safety record of Bus Éireann has been alluded to tonight.  It moves 165,000 children a day throughout the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give it to the Senator when this discussion is concluded. Bus Éireann's safety record is outstanding.  There have been incidents, and there is no doubt about that.  One incident occurred when the school bus was long gone and tragically a child was injured on the road.  That had no connection with the system itself.  When we talk about accidents we should be very careful and specific, and if the transport system is involved, fair enough.  Bus Éireann's record is outstanding and that should be said here.  We owe a great debt of gratitude to the skill and proficiency of the people who drive those buses and control the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that in recent speeches relating to bullying at school, the Minister has placed this matter very high on her agenda.  I have no doubt that the drivers employed by the private contractors and Bus Éireann operate a disciplinary system to ensure that nobody gets hammered on a bus.  That is not the job they <Col N="704" /> are paid for but I am glad they do it. The Minister's believes that people who have responsibility in schools, whether they are teachers or in the ancillary services, have a role to ensure that children are well treated by their peers.  In relation to safety, this House should place on record that the safety record of Bus Éireann has been exemplary and is worthy of commendation.</P>
    <P>An unusual aspect of the school transport system is that it is an operation which joins the private and public sectors.  In effect, the majority of buses are provided by the private sector although Bus Éireann carries the majority of children; it carries 97,000 children and the balance are carried by private contractors.  More importantly, to ensure these private buses comply with Bus Éireann's safety standards they must pass inspection.  We all know the standards CIE and Bus Éireann set, not just for the country buses or the school buses but also in Bus Átha Cliath, or Dublin Bus as it is known. It is a very important provision that it monitors the skills and standards of the drivers, their replacements and the buses.</P>
    <P>Another thing it does is monitor the fact that taxes are paid.  This is essentially an operation for Revenue but it is done by CIE.  One cannot get a contract from CIE or Bus Éireann to transport children in a minibus unless one's taxes have been paid.  There would be a huge potential loss to the State if that supervisory level was gone.  Therefore there is enormous benefit in having this private and public sector involvement in the transportation of children to school.</P>
    <P>In relation to the amendment, that is a matter for the Minister.  As I said, I am glad I got a copy of this report.  I do not want to cast any aspersions, but I do not know why two reports were commissioned. This is the experts' report.  I read it and any objective person would conclude that Bus Éireann is running a first class operation.  It is operating economically and I do not envisage any change in that situation.</P>
    <P>However, that is not to say there are not other areas which should be examined <Col N="705" />&mdash; admittedly these matters will be the responsibility of other Departments &mdash; and they are Health and Social Welfare. We use ambulances which cost about £90,000 to fit out with heart machines, etc., to transport people to get their toenails cut and for X-rays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be here to shed some light on this discussion on the school transport system and the question of a review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that, when the House has heard what I have to say, it will agree <Col N="706" /> that school transport is an area which has been the subject of much review over many years.</P>
    <P>If this ongoing review has not resulted previously in radically new approaches to the conduct of the scheme, it is because the major undertaking to provide daily transport for thousands of pupils countrywide has been running very satisfactorily over the years.  It is also because ongoing review has underlined the fact that we are dealing with a complex system where any new departure must be thought out carefully if it is to be introduced successfully. Ill advised radical change in this area could end up with pupils receiving a much less satisfactory service than at present.</P>
    <P>The major departure in school transport was, of course, the establishment of a nationwide school transport system in 1967, administered by CIE as the Department's agent, following the introduction of Donogh O'Malley's free post-primary education scheme.  Before that, a limited system of grants to individual primary schools had been in operation for many years.  While the 1967 nationwide scheme rapidly developed vastly beyond the limited scope of the earlier primary schools' grant arrangements, these arrangements did point to certain practical principles which were incorporated into the major scheme.</P>
    <P>The earlier primary school arrangements were based on helping pupils who had excessive distances to travel to school.  Excessive distance was defined by reference to the School Attendance Act, 1926, which requires children to attend school who live within two miles if they are under ten years of age or within three miles if they are over that age.  It is, therefore, a basic condition of the school transport scheme that it applies to eligible pupils only, namely, those defined as living beyond the School Attendance Act distances from school.  It has, down the years, become necessary to adhere rigidly to these definitions.  Any departure, by way of reduction of these requirements, would add massively to the cost of school transport.</P>
    <P>A second feature of the earlier primary <Col N="707" /> school arrangements was that grants for a transport service required a minimum of ten eligible pupils.  The minimum of ten pupils has been retained for national schools but was reduced to seven for post-primary pupils who would come from a wider catchment area with longer distances to travel.  In line with this, a lower number than ten is acceptable for national schools where specified numbers of pupils live more than certain distances from schools.  Once again, any reduction in these requirements would cost considerable sums of money.  Where, however, pupils live excessive distances from school but not in numbers warranting the establishment of a school transport service, individual grants may be allowed to enable parents make private arrangements for transport.</P>
    <P>With the establishment of the nationwide school transport scheme in 1967, provision of school transport for post-primary schools was related to catchment areas.  This was, in the first instance, to allow for the orderly development of viable post-primary schools providing as wide a range of subject options as possible. In addition, however, it would also be prohibitively expensive if transport were to be grant aided for pupils coming from outside a catchment area when there was already a transport service for those pupils within their own area.</P>
    <P>Similarly, it was determined that eligibility for primary school transport was related to the pupil's nearest school.  This is also an essential condition.  To have transport provided for pupils to attend schools other than their nearest school would result in an enormously expensive network of transport services crossing over and duplicating one another throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Within these arrangements, the most that it has been possible to do by way of concession to certain ineligible pupils and to certain pupils wanting to attend schools other than their nearest is to allow travel, on payment of a fare, when there are spare seats on the bus and no additional cost to the State is entailed.</P>
    <P>I have set out these basic conditions of <Col N="708" /> the school transport scheme to show the structures within which it is operated by Bus Éireann for my Department.  These conditions are kept under review by the Department but there is no way in which they can be changed significantly without incurring huge costs.</P>
    <P>At this point, I would like to give some broad facts and figures about the school transport scheme.  I hope it has been worth Senator Lee's while to come to the House because I learned a lot when preparing my reply to the motion proposed by my Government colleagues.</P>
    <P>The total number of pupils carried daily is 165,000.  Of these, 66,000 are primary school pupils, 90,000 are post-primary pupils and 9,000 are pupils with disabilities for whom special arrangements are made.  Eleven thousand of the primary and 1,000 of the post-primary pupils are concessionary in the meaning I described a few moments ago, that is, they pay their fare.  The scheme uses 2,400 buses.  Of these, 800 are operated by Bus Éireann and 1,600, the majority of them mini-buses, belong to private operators on contract to Bus Éireann. There are 6,000 routes.</P>
    <P>In 1993, the scheme is estimated to cost £39.354 million.  Some £4.2 million of this is expected to come from fares, leaving a demand of £35.154 million to be met by the Exchequer.  Departmental grants to individual parents, etc., are estimated at £0.684 million and estimated total payments to Bus Éireann are £34.47 million. Payment to Bus Éireann will include operating costs of the 60 per cent of the service directly run by Bus Éireann, payments by Bus Éireann to private operators contracted to Bus Éireann who run 40 per cent of the service, cost for free transport for eligible pupils on scheduled services and administrative costs of the management of the scheme by Bus Éireann.  Operation of the school transport scheme comprises approximately 45 per cent of Bus Éireann's total activity.</P>
    <P>I would now like to move on to the review proper.  The school transport scheme was reviewed by a firm of consultants in 1978.  They did not favour general devolution of the scheme at that <Col N="709" /> time and thought that an annual charge per pupil should be introduced.  A detailed internal review was also carried out jointly by my Department, the Department of Finance and the then Department of the Public Service in 1985. This review suggested ways of reducing costs but, as these would have entailed either reductions in the standards of service or steep increases in charges, they were not proceeded with.</P>
    <P>Later, the questions of cost effectiveness and possible alternative methods of administering the scheme were examined in depth by a second consultancy study in 1990.  This study concluded that the scheme was operated by Bus Éireann in &ldquo;a competent, cost-effective and secure manner&rdquo;.  Certain alternatives were not seen as effective.  Thus, giving vouchers to parents in lieu of running a transport scheme would not give the same service for the same average cost per pupil.  This is because the extensive use of large buses under the present scheme achieves economies of scale. Grant aiding individual schools or even groups of schools would not achieve the economies at present available through the networking of services which the large scale administration of the present scheme allows.</P>
    <P>More recently, a further consultancy study has looked at the practicalities of devolving administration of the scheme to a local agency, such as the vocational education committee.  In accepting Senator Cotter's amendment, I will undertake to have both studies published and so ensure that an informed debate can take place on all aspects of the transport scheme and this promise is given in light of the Government's commitment to an open and transparent administration and I am sure I can get Senator Cotter a copy of the report.</P>

      <P>In general, these <Col N="710" /> reviews have focused on the quality of service and have also referred to the school bus fleet and to costs and administrative arrangements.  There has been comparatively little complaint about the quality of service as such.  Maintenance of buses is the responsibility of Bus Éireann and I am satisfied that they do an excellent job in a competent way.</P>
      <P>There have been complaints from time to time about what is known as double-tripping, where the same vehicle successively brings two groups of children to school and home again.  Again, there is no way this can be avoided without adding considerably to costs and my Department's requirements ensure that those who start on the first run in the morning are those who return home on the first run in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>In regard to the school bus fleet, this is an ageing fleet and there was concern some years ago that the capital cost of replacement would be large.  However, beginning in 1988, Bus Éireann succeeded in getting a number of good quality secondhand buses as a result of market developments in Britain and they have, since then, proceeded with a programme of steady replacement of existing buses. Private operators, of course, use their own vehicles on the services contracted out to them.</P>
      <P>Costs and administrative arrangements, the focus of the reviews of school transport, are linked.  The 1990 review pointed to the high degree of networking which has been possible from the unified Bus Éireann management and the high level of optimum usage of large buses which this has allowed.  This has been a major factor in keeping down their unit costs.  Comparison with the UK market confirms the competitiveness of Bus Éireann operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bus Eireann administration has provided a comprehensive and reliable framework for the management of a complex school transport system over a quarter of a century.  This is not a benefit to be lightly dismissed.  I would like to pay tribute to the immense work performed by Bus Éireann through the years, to the great expertise they have built up in the <Col N="711" /> area of school transport and to the formidable organising capacity they have displayed in organising 6,000 bus routes.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, so major an undertaking as the nationwide school transport system and possible alternative methods of delivery must be kept under periodic review. In this regard, I have already mentioned the objections to devolving school transport to schools locally or to small scale private management.  A more recent review has been looking at the possibility of local agency participation.  As things stand at present, this would mean participation in school transport management by Vocational Education Committees.</P>
    <P>Having studied the matter, I believe it would be premature to endeavour to introduce any new arrangements under present structures.  It is my view, therefore, that consideration of the future of the school transport scheme should be set in the context of the intermediate structures envisaged in the Programme for a Partnership Government and the decisions in the White Paper on Education on these structures.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the competent, cost efficient and secure service provided by Bus Éireann, as established by the consultants' reports.  I, therefore, plan to arrange for Bus Éireann to meet with my officials to plan how their operations of the school bus service may be integrated with the local education structures.  Bus Éireann should not be left in the dark as regards the overall plans in this area. Detailed arrangements will await further clarification of the form of the local structures in the White Paper on Education. However, I plan to initiate preliminary discussions with Bus Éireann on this topic before the publication of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I trust I have shown this House that the school transport scheme, which is a complex scheme upon which many thousands of pupils rely daily, has been and is the subject of ongoing review in great depth in my Department.  Should changes be introduced in the future, the first priority must be to ensure that pupils <Col N="712" /> will continue to receive the high levels of service to which they have been accustomed in the past.</P>
    <P>May I say to those Senators who rightly took the opportunity in this House, where they had my undivided attention, to raise local matters close to their hearts that they will be dealt with by my Department. Finally, as someone who was, I confess, reared across the road from the school I attended, the notion of being driven there was a luxury beyond my comprehension but since taking office, I have left Dublin on early and dark mornings and I hope, before my term of office is completed, that where lights are switched on in houses early in the morning to facilitate the operation of the school transport system, they will be switched on a little later for the children I have seen standing at the sides of our roads.</P>

    <P>I am delighted the Minister has decided to publish the reports.  I was not lucky enough to get one of these famous reports and I consider myself adept at getting documents.  One way or the other I will get a copy.  I am delighted the Minister has decided to publish the reports.  It is appropriate that such documents are published so that people may debate the issues and, in particular, where professional people have been employed to evaluate and analyse a public service.  I compliment the Minister for publishing these documents.  It is in the best interest of debate, discussion and, as Senator McGowan said, review &mdash; I qualify that <Col N="713" /> statement further by saying ongoing review.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly referred to competition and I support her remarks in this regard. It would be wrong to move into a situation where only some schools could provide a bus service because schools in deprived areas, which we have tried to support over the years, could not afford such a service.  We have a responsibility to schools in marginal and deprived areas and to parents of pupils who are not in a position to provide a private bus service.</P>
    <P>My local office in Athlone is the most accommodating public service office I have dealt with.  We have restructured, not at political but at community level, the entire bus service for the pupils in our parish with the co-operation of that office.  They have provided an excellent service and I am delighted.  The report shows it is cost effective.  It is not easy to provide such a service.</P>
    <P>I was unable to avail of the free bus service when at school.  I left school in 1966 before the introduction of this service in 1967.  I remember one hackney car brought all the boys from my village, one third of those attending school, to Summerhill College, County Sligo. Today this service is provided by Bus Éireann and it is a good service.  I do not want to go down a road which may threaten that service without proper review and analysis.  There is no reason to discontinue this service.  Open debate and the publication of documents is the best way to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not know how catchment areas were decided, but I know they were done with a geographic intent.  It would appear a circle was drawn around an area and that was the catchment area for a particular school.  However, some of those decisions do not stand up to scrutiny.  A number of years ago I highlighted an anomaly in my area to the Department of Education.  In order for pupils to attend the designated school, it would have been necessary for them to swim across the River Shannon.  There was no bridge over which they could cross, the nearest bridge was ten miles away at Shannonbridge.  Those who drew the <Col N="714" /> map believed there was a crossing between Athlone and Shannonbridge. There may have been a bridge when Brian Boru crossed the river, but there was no bridge in my time.  We must review catchment areas where anomalies exist.</P>
    <P>A policy with which I disagreed, and which has thankfully eased, was the amalgamation of one and two teacher schools. Where amalgamations took place assurances were given to parents that bus services would be provided.  However, many of these commitments have not been honoured by the Department and unless one is able to produce letters of assurance received at that time, word of mouth will not be accepted.  This happened in Tulsk, County Roscommon, only this week.  We must honour commitments given to local communities and not try to hide behind bureaucracy.  I am not criticising the Minister; this situation has prevailed for some time.  Our credibility is at stake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I have first hand experience of dealing with school transport.  Since 1975 I have been in charge of school transport in a post-primary school of 500 pupils.  I encounter the day to day and operational difficulties which arise from the point of view of the school, the pupils, Bus Éireann and the bus driver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bus drivers deserve respect and credit because they are responsible for both the vehicle and discipline on the bus, and <Col N="715" /> they do an excellent job maintaining discipline. Part-time bus driving jobs are important in rural areas where there is little employment.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that there are sufficient number of buses on each route. Overcrowding on buses may lead to bullying and smoking which is a health hazard and a fire risk.  We should be conscious of the materials used in buses. Good durable materials should be used. I am not talking about comfort on buses because soft seats will be torn, but good durable seats are important.  During the winter months drivers must manoeuvre buses on icy, narrow roads in rural areas and they deserve credit for their skills.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to develop a comprehensive transport scheme for rural areas where houses may be a quarter of a mile or a half a mile apart.  We must take two matters into account when we talk about the school transport service. First, transport to education is the primary function and pupils must be on time for school.  Unless there is a breakdown or the weather is bad, the bus drivers serving the school with which I was dealing get the pupils in on time. They provide a great service.  The second matter I wish to discuss is the health of the pupils.  Pupils leave home early in the morning and often have to travel two or three miles to the pick up point.  If the weather is bad, they get wet and come to school wearing wet clothes, and there are no facilities for drying their clothes when they reach the school.  The teachers do their best but schools do not have the facilities to provide that type of service.</P>
    <P>The bus also picks pupils up very early in the morning.  Some children leave home at 7.30 a.m., they are in school at 8.15 a.m. and then the bus picks up a second group.  The same thing happens in the evening.  Some pupils go home earlier than others who have to wait at the school for three-quarters of an hour. This leads to difficulties with insurance and supervision must be provided for these pupils.  Many matters must be considered, particularly in regard to the bus coming early in the morning.  It would <Col N="716" /> be preferable to have extra buses than running this dual service.  Something will have to be done about it because there is a health hazard, an insurance hazard and there can be an education hazard as well.</P>
    <P>The transport scheme is there for the school, the pupils and education.  Transport itself is secondary but it is very important.  I ask the Minister to take note in the reports and in the proposed review that extra curricular activities often suffer where a transport scheme is provided. Whether it is football, rugby or tennis, pupils using the transport scheme are often unable to participate and we must do something to accommodate them.</P>
    <P>We should be flexible about the rules, I remember the case where an inspector had to examine the distance from a house to a school and he found it to be 2.93 miles.  In a case like that it would be better to let the pupil use the transport than to bring a senior official out to measure the distance.  I look for flexibility in these rules especially in a rural area where there are so many complicated problems.  It would also be of great advantage to give individual grants where people live that extra distance from the pick up points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and I am glad the good sense of the House prevailed.  The intention of the motion was to focus on the school transport system, and I welcome the fact that we will not have to have a vote on the issue. It is obvious that people thought this was an anti-CIE motion.  It was unhelpful for anybody to interpret this as an anti-CIE motion.  I wish to emphasise that this was not the intention of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe in competition.  A couple of years ago a return fare from Donegal to Dublin cost £18; today it costs £10. Nothing could more eloquently prove the value of competition than that.  The Members of this House, all reasonable thinking people, are interested in the success of the school system and in getting good value for money, but some places in rural Ireland have difficulties with the system.  I welcome the Minister's statement that she will travel around to these <Col N="717" /> places and hopefully she will visit some of the areas where there are difficulties. She also said she will respond positively to complaints or to areas where there are difficulties and a case has been made to her.  I welcome that, because it will help remove the problems.</P>
    <P>I will read one paragraph of a reply from the co-ordinator of transport in County Donegal.  There is a transport co-ordinator in every county, there is a CIÉ officer in charge of school transport, there is the private operator and the Minister.  Many different people have responsibility for this area and sometimes it is very difficult to get an effective response to even the most proven case. Most of us should be concerned and I am not pleased that this matter was taken lightly here &mdash; some Senators showed a lack of sincerity but I will not dwell on that.  In the letter I wrote to the transport co-ordinator, Mr Séan Ó Longan, of County Donegal vocational education committee on 8 January 1992, I stated &ldquo;You did not mention the fact that children have to catch a bus at 7.30 a.m. to be at school in Raphoe at 9.30 a.m. which is only a distance of 11 miles.&rdquo;  A child could nearly walk it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have not mentioned anybody who is not a public servant, and a public servant is responsible for spending public money.  I can call him the officer in charge or a transport co-ordinator if that satisfies the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The letter continued that the same children do not get home until 5 o'clock. Surely this is the most unfair and inefficent <Col N="718" /> transport system in the country. This is only one case.  I have ten such cases in County Donegal, and I am sure County Donegal is not unique.  Rural Ireland has many such cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister is satisfied with the performance of CIÉ and the report which Minister Brennan got about good value for money, but this situation is perfect in theory only.  It is like the architect who drew the plans to build a house without inspecting the site and did not realise that there was a boulder 10 foot high on the site.  I hope the Minister will visit some of the problem areas and if she does, I have no doubt she will take seriously the complaints that will be made.  We are in real difficulty if CIÉ as the responsible transport operator on the ground, recognises there is a small problem that could be solved by a reasonable response from the Minister and her Department.  I ask the Minister before she makes a decision in these cases to send somebody to satisfy her and her Department that the complaint has been fully investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a statement to the Seanad on the report of the investigation team which I established to examine the role of the health services in relation to the Kilkenny incest case.  Each and every one of us was appalled and horrified by the brutal and inhuman ill treatment suffered by the tragic victim in this case over a 16 year period.  The awful physical and sexual abuse wrought upon the young woman by her father has sent shock waves throughout the entire country. It is difficult to comprehend that such abuse can take place in our society and one can only begin to imagine the daily horror in which the victim lived.</P>
      <P>I share the widespread concern about this case and I know that Members of this House will join with me in placing on record our sincere sympathy for the young woman who endured so much.  My earnest wish for her now is that she can put these terrible events behind her and that she can have a happy, fulfilling and peaceful future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions have rightly been asked as to how, despite many contacts with a range of statutory services, the abuse continued for such a long time and why there was no effective intervention to protect the victim and to prevent further abuse.  I was concerned with the criticisms levelled against the health services and particularly the suggestions that professionals in the health services had come into contact with the victim but failed to recognise the abuse or to take any action to put an end to it.  I therefore considered it imperative that such question marks <Col N="720" /> over the health services should be addressed immediately.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the investigation was not to find a scapegoat but rather to identify the lessons to be learned from what happened in this case, lessons which must inform the future approach of the health services to the investigation and management of suspected cases of both child abuse and domestic violence generally. In order to ensure a thorough and speedy investigation into the case I instructed the chief executive officer of the South-Eastern Health Board to establish, as a matter of priority, an investigation team to inquire into the activities of the health services in this case and to report back to me as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The team was asked not only to examine the immediate concerns raised in relation to the health services but also to make recommendations for the future investigation and management by the health services of suspected child abuse cases.  In the light of certain comments that have been made since the publication of the report, I would like to underline the fact that the terms of reference given to the team were to carry out an investigation of the case in so far as the health services were concerned. The team had no brief to inquire into the actions of the Garda or any other non-health agency.</P>
    <P>The team was chaired by Ms. Catherine McGuinness, SC, a former Member of this House and a leading authority on family law.  Ms. McGuinness was assisted in this difficult task by Ms. Brid Clarke, head social worker, Eastern Health Board, Dr. Sheelah Ryan, director of community care and medical officer of health, Midland Health Board; and Mr. Martin Hynes, programme manager, South-Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the team for the speed and thoroughness with which they completed their work and for the excellent report which they presented to me on 14 May 1993.  The care, attention and sensitivity of the team in their deliberations, and in particular in preserving the anonymity of the victim, must be commended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> This allowed me to publish the report in its entirety and to circulate it to Deputies, Senators and other interested parties so that there was a full debate on the issues raised.</P>
    <P>I now wish to deal with the report itself and to outline the Government's response to it.  The report is divided into two parts.  The first section examines the details of the Kilkenny case itself.  It also sets out the context in which the case must be viewed, in terms of the organisation of the health services, the legal provisions in relation to child protection and the state of public knowledge and awareness of child abuse in the early 1980s.  In the second part of the report the team makes recommendations in regard to child care, child abuse and domestic violence generally.</P>
    <P>The team's account of the Kilkenny case itself was compiled following detailed interviews with the victim, members of her family, the local community and appropriate persons from the relevant agencies.  The assistance which the team received from all of those who came forward to provide information must be acknowledged.  It should be noted that this was not a statutory inquiry, and the willingness of these people to lend their assistance helped to contribute to the completion of the task given to the team in a very short period and at minimal expense.</P>
    <P>In their analysis, the investigation team reviewed the response of the health services to the victim and her family in the light of the legal situation and professional practices which pertained at the time in question, and their report should be read in that context.  At that time the procedures which are now in place for the detection and investigation of sexual abuse had not been developed.  Indeed, the whole concept of child sexual abuse was only beginning to be acknowledged and accepted as relevant to the health services.</P>
    <P>The report sets out in detail the various contacts which the young women had with the health services over the years. It is clear that the woman, and indeed her family, sought and received services <Col N="722" /> and assistance from different elements of the health services over a long period of time.  Many of these contacts were for routine medical ailments but some were directly related to the abuse which she was receiving.  While the health care personnel responded to the presenting symptoms it is most unfortunate, and indeed regrettable, that the reality of what was actually happening within the family was not fully addressed until early 1992.</P>
    <P>The reasons put forward by the team to explain why action was not taken earlier include the fact that each aspect of the health services dealt with the individual manifestations of the abuse and the various illnesses entirely separately and without inter-disciplinary communication and co-operation.  Each injury was treated separately and the plausible explanations for the injuries which were given by the woman and her family were accepted.  The prevalence and the telltale signs of physical and sexual abuse were not well understood at that time either by the professionals or by the public at large and there were certain weaknesses in the management of the community care services in relation to the investigation of suspected cases of child abuse.</P>
    <P>Despite these considerations, it is still a cause of very great concern to me that this unfortunate woman continued to be subjected to cruel and demeaning treatment over such a long period while the services which could have been expected to help her were so close at hand and yet failed to fully grasp and tackle the abuse that was taking place.  Looking back now, I am sure that all the professionals involved deeply regret the fact that, for whatever reason, action was not taken sooner to prevent and halt the abuse. However, it is far too easy to be wise in retrospect and, as the team themselves state in their report, the investigation had the incalculable benefit of hindsight.</P>
    <P>However, throughout the 1980s a significant change was taking place in society's awareness of child abuse and in particular of child sexual abuse.  There was also, among the health professions, a growing understanding of their role in <Col N="723" /> tackling such abuse.  In early 1992, when the victim was finally persuaded by a friend as well as by her GP and hospital staff to make a formal complaint to the Garda, it is encouraging to note that all the relevant services responded swiftly. Although it may be of little comfort to the victim in this case, it is heartening to read that, having regard to the increased awareness among health professionals and growing public consciousness in relation to child sexual abuse, the investigation team conclude that an early diagnosis of such abuse would be much more likely today.</P>
    <P>While the suffering and misery experienced by the young woman can never be undone, we must try and learn from this tragic case.  In an effort to ensure that cases of this nature should never occur again, the team has put forward over 20 major recommendations in their report. The investigation team has acknowledged that some of their recommendations will require further consideration and elaboration, that additional resources will be required and that changes in policy, attitude and approach would also be necessary.  The team also asked that its recommendations receive early and wide circulation in order to raise public consciousness of the issue of child abuse and hopefully, prevent such suffering from recurring in our society in the future.</P>
    <P>An indication of the concern and urgency with which I and the Government view the question of child care and child abuse can be seen in the fact that the Government considered and released the report within five days of my receiving it.  I will now outline the preliminary response which I and the Government have decided to make to this report.</P>
    <P>By far the most important of the team's recommendations is that the Government provide the necessary resources to implement the remaining sections of the Child Care Act, 1991.  The team was conscious that the public outcry about this case would achieve nothing if steps were not taken to ensure that recurrence of such suffering was prevented as far as <Col N="724" /> is possible.  The implementation of the remaining sections of the Child Care Act was seen as the most effective means to achieve this.  The team states in its report that the willingness of the Government and the community as a whole to provide the necessary resources for this task is a true measure of the degree of real public commitment to the protection of children and the promotion of their welfare.</P>
    <P>Particular priority is afforded by the team to those parts of the Act which deal with the taking of children into care and which strengthen the powers of health boards, the gardaí and the courts in relation to children at risk.  The effect of those parts would be to increase from 16 to 18 years, the age up to which health boards may intervene to protect children at risk.  Health boards and the courts would be given a greater range of options in dealing with children at risk, including supervision orders which would authorise health staff to visit and monitor children at risk in their own homes.</P>
    <P>The Government accepts that the full implementation of the Child Care Act is the single biggest contribution which can be made towards promoting the welfare of children and protecting those who are at risk.  Nothing less than this would provide an adequate response both to the suffering experienced by the young woman in the Kilkenny case and to the report of the investigation team.  I have put a proposal to Government to enable me to address this most significant recommendation of the investigation team.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that the Government has agreed to my proposal to implement all the remaining sections of the Child Care Act over a three year period, that is, by the end of 1996.  With regard to those provisions that relate to the protection of children from abuse and neglect it is the intention that they will be fully operational in 1995.</P>
    <P>While some might feel that this is a significant lead-in time, I am satisfied that the necessary staff, facilities and services cannot be put into place more quickly.  I have asked my officials for the shortest possible time frame.  Existing services are under-developed and they will need to <Col N="725" /> be significantly expanded to be in a position to cater for the increased duties and responsibilities which will be placed on them.  The recruitment of the significant numbers of additional staff necessary will also take some time.  It is important to be realistic in our targets and not to set false and impractical hopes and goals.</P>
    <P>As an indication of its determination in the matter, the Government has decided that in 1993 an additional £5 million will be provided for the child care services, which is equivalent to £10 million in a full year.  An investment of the same scale will be made in each of the next three years.  I assure the House that there have been no delays in getting the development process started.  Detailed discussions have already been held with the health boards regarding the need for improvements in the child care services in their areas and plans for the development of new services funded from the £5 million available this year are now being examined in my Department.  I expect to be in a position to convey the necessary approvals to proceed within a matter of days.  Work has also begun on the associated tasks of recruiting the key personnel, putting the required arrangements in place, providing training and the myriad of other tasks to be undertaken to implement the Act.</P>
    <P>The decision to proceed rapidly with the implementation of the Act represents a milestone in social reform and reflects the concern of the entire community in relation to the protection of children.  I sincerely hope that the full implementation of the Act will help to ensure that no child and no family will ever again have to endure such suffering.</P>
    <P>I have taken immediate steps to ensure that the other recommendations of the investigation team are evaluated and implemented to the maximum extent possible.  The team's recommendations in relation to the child abuse guidelines, written protocols, child abuse registers, the conduct of case conferences and record keeping will require careful consideration by my Department, the statutory agencies and relevant professionals. My Department is already in discussion <Col N="726" /> with the Garda Síochána in relation to a strengthening of the child abuse guidelines. The implementation of the necessary procedures to underpin the new legislation is essential to ensure that it can be fully operational and I will make every effort to ensure that these procedures are put in place as soon as is reasonably practicable.</P>
    <P>The investigation team considered the legal framework in some detail and they believed that the Constitution would contain a specific and overt declaration of the rights of children.  The team is of the view that the very high emphasis on the rights of the family in the Constitution may consciously or unconsciously be interpreted as giving a higher value to the rights of parents than to the rights of children.  The team recommends that the Constitution be amended to include a statement of the constitutional rights of children.</P>
    <P>This recommendation is complex and far-reaching and will require detailed consideration by the Government in consultation with the Attorney General. However, I am conscious that, by its nature, this particular task may take some time to complete.  I am anxious that, while deliberations should proceed, this work must not deflect us from the primary aim of bringing into force the remaining sections of the Child Care Act.</P>
    <P>The team heard evidence and received submissions both for and against the introduction of a mandatory reporting law.  Following consideration of all the issues, it recommended the introduction of mandatory reporting of all forms of child abuse by designated professionals. On balance, I too am in favour of mandatory reporting.</P>
    <P>However, I am anxious to ensure that as much common ground as possible is achieved on this before proceeding with legislation.  I realise that some professional groups may have difficulties with regard to client confidentiality that would need to be resolved before this could be introduced.  Having regard to the sensitive issues involved, it is my intention to initiate broad ranging consultations with all the relevant interest <Col N="727" /> groups with a view to securing the widest possible agreement on the question of mandatory reporting.</P>
    <P>The report makes a series of recommendations in relation to the improvement of services for families and children. These relate to developments in preventive services, family supports, treatment of both the abused and the abuser and staff training.  These measures will be carefully considered as services are expanded and strengthened to implement the provisions of the Child Care Act.  Health boards have been asked to have regard to these recommendations in preparing their implementation plans.</P>
    <P>A significant part of the abuse in the Kilkenny case occurred after the woman had attained adulthood and the team, with my agreement, extended its remit somewhat to include adult abuse and domestic violence generally.  The team felt that victims of adult abuse need to know that violence against them is unacceptable and that there are services available appropriate to their needs.  Their report includes a series of recommendations in relation to domestic violence. Among these are: the provision of more refuge places for victims of family violence; the development of counselling support services for those victims; training for health care staff in identifying cases of family violence and the introduction of appropriate referral procedures to the Garda.</P>
    <P>The team also recommended changes in the legislation governing barring orders to make these orders available in all cases of domestic violence and not just, as at present, in cases of violence between spouses.</P>
    <P>The recommendation to ensure the provision of adequate refuge spaces is being addressed in the context of the additional funding now being made available to me.  I see such refuges as a key component of the network of child care and family support sevices needed to underpin the Act.</P>
    <P>I have instructed my Department to urgently examine the other recommendations which relate to my area of <Col N="728" /> responsibility.  It is also my intention to discuss the recommendations in relation to barring orders with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, who has responsibility for the legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>The report also makes recommendations in relation to specific measures to be taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Department of Justice and the Medical Council.  These agencies have already been contacted by my Department with a view to having the team's recommendations examined and evaluated as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The investigation team in its recommendations emphasise the multi-disciplinary nature of providing an appropriate and effective response in relation to child abuse.  The importance of the establishment of effective working relationships within the health care system and between the health board and other agencies is underlined.</P>
    <P>The team has some telling recommendations in relation to the role of the Garda, teachers and other professionals dealing with children at risk.  Their report suggests the implementation of a process of inter-agency review to ensure full coordination and co-operation between all the relevant services.  I am anxious that there should be minimum delay in this regard and I have already had preliminary discussions with my ministerial colleagues with a view to finding effective and efficient mechanisms to give expression to those particular recommendations.</P>
    <P>In so far as my own Department is concerned, I have decided to create a child care policy unit to ensure the speedy implementation of the Child Care Act, and to follow up on the other recommendations of the investigation team. This unit will have lead responsibility for drafting the necessary sets of regulations governing different aspects of the Child Care Act and for preparing, in consultation with the health boards and professional groups, detailed guidelines on the operation of the new provisions.  The unit will play a key role in developing services in the whole area of child care <Col N="729" /> and family support in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>What I have outlined briefly here tonight is my response to a comprehensive report.  However, I would like to conclude by drawing attention to a statement made by the investigation team that violence and sexual abuse, whether against children or adults, must not be seen solely as the responsibility of the health services.  The responsibility of other agencies, both statutory and voluntary, in this area must also be recognised.</P>
    <P>The obligations on the community as a whole must also be addressed.  In order to ensure the elimination of such abuse and violence in our society the responsibility must be shared by all and must be supported by the public at large.  It is only if all of us, in our homes, in our work and in our community, have the courage and determination to challenge violence, whatever its form, that the evil of child abuse and domestic violence can be eradicated from our society.</P>

      <P>Thank you Minister. Before I call Senator Reynolds I would like to remind the House that on the Order of Business it was agreed that this item would conclude at 10 p.m.  Spokes-persons have 15 minutes and as there are many Senators offering I would appreciate if speakers would be as brief as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Brevity is one of my policies in politics.  As the Minister has outlined, this is a serious crime, and it is important that we have the opportunity to discuss it in the House this evening, for which I would like to thank the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When details of the Kilkenny incest case began to emerge at the trial we, as a nation, were appalled that such barbaric brutality and human suffering could be meted out over a long period without detection.  The fact that this atrocity was carried out against a woman who, over many years, endured pain and suffering from childhood to adolescence to womanhood without any help or sanctuary is something I can never forget.  I <Col N="730" /> believe that we, as public representatives, have a fundamental duty to put in place the necessary legislation to ensure as far as possible the prevention of and punishment for this crime and to ensure that it would never be committed again.</P>
    <P>Over the past ten years we have devoted a great deal of time, energy and resources towards the protection of the unborn while, in my opinion, not affording sufficient protection to our children. That is a fundamental problem which we have not faced up until now.  I hope that the recommendations made in the Kilkenny incest investigation report will be brought forward and put into legislation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It is only proper for me to congratulate first the Minister for putting the investigation team together and to congratulate the investigation team of Catherine McGuinness, Martin Hynes, Brid Clarke, Sheelah Ryan and John Magner for producing such a prompt and excellent report.  Unlike many reports and investigations which have been carried out over many years, I believe this will have far reaching effects on society.</P>
    <P>I was heartened to hear the Minister say that the Government has given priority to introducing the legislation to implement the recommendations in the report as quickly as possible.  With the indulgence of the House, I intend to discuss the majority of the recommendations in the hope of putting on the record the contents of the report and my support, and that of my party, for these recommendations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991, when I was first elected to this House in 1987 I remember a colleague, then Senator Nuala Fennell making speeches about the implementation of child care legislation. However, that legislation was not introduced until 1991 and I hope the same delays will not occur on this occasion.</P>
    <P>With regard to the constitutional amendment, the report recommends that:</P>
    <P>consideration be given by the <Col N="731" /> Government to the amendment of Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution so as to include a statement of the constitutional rights of children.</P>
    <P>I believe this is fundamentally important and should be taken on board by the Government immediately.  The report states with regard to child abuse guidelines that:</P>
    <P>The Minister of Health should prepare revised procedures for the identification, investigation and management of child abuse to replace the current guidelines.  These procedures should be given statutory effect under the provision of sections 68 and 69 of the Child Care Act, 1991...  In addition it is recommended that a regular system of evaluation of the procedures be established... There should be written Protocols for the investigation and management of child abuse within each health board...  There should be clear guidelines for collaboration between hospital and community care staff on matters concerning the identification, notification and follow up of child abuse.</P>
    <P>I always felt quite strongly about the fact that Departments and different State bodies believed that if it was the health board's problem they should deal with it without a unified approach.  I have always thought there should be an attempt in legislation to unify different Departments such as Health, Education and Justice in the matter of child sexual abuse. These Departments have a major role to play and a unified approach is very important.</P>
    <P>We have to be aware of the danger of trial by media.  We know what happened in Mayo after a number of cases had been publicised, but more specifically the two cases in Kilkenny.  A family was effectively tried before all the evidence was available &mdash; a traumatic experience for those involved.  I was glad to hear the Minister say he will introduce legislation to take account of all these aspects.  We <Col N="732" /> have to introduce legislation to make sure that those who commit these crimes have a chance to defend themselves before the courts.  I abhor trial by media and any legislation that can prevent that must be looked at.  I know it is difficult to do that but we must give the defendant as much protection as possible.</P>
    <P>The report has recommended, and I agree: &ldquo;that standardised child abuse registers be maintained by the Director of Community Care in each community care area&rdquo;.  It also recommends that:</P>
    <P>There should be mandatory reporting of all forms of child abuse by designated persons to the Director of Community Care (or other nominated persons within health boards).  These designated personnel should include doctors, nurses, social workers, psychologists, community welfare officers, child care workers, teachers, probation officers and other professionals responsible for the care of children.  (The legal framework within which mandatory reporting would be introduced is outlined.)</P>
    <P>We recommend that the confidentiality of persons who make reports should be protected, if requested, so long as this does not adversely affect the investigation of the case.  The duty to protect the child from abuse must override the duty to respect family privacy or personal freedom.</P>
    <P>Mandatory reporting is important but, as far as possible as the report says, confidentiality of the person should be kept. Many people if they felt something was going on in a neighbour's or a relative's home would find it extremely difficult to report it to the Director of Community Care or another designated person if they could not do so in confidence.  Without reporting it is difficult for crimes to be detected.  The most significant aspect of the problem of child sex abuse is that since people are afraid to report it the detection of a crime that takes place in the home is extremely hard and if a mother, daughter or son is afraid to report it, it could go undetected for many years as in this case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> Under the heading &ldquo;Liaison between Health Boards and Gardaí&rdquo; the guide to the recommendations says:</P>
    <P>The Director of Community Care should notify the Garda Superintendent of all allegations of child abuse.  Each Superintendent should notify the Director of all allegations of child abuse received by gardaí</P>
    <P>This relates back to my earlier point that a unified approach between the Garda and the Department of Health is extremely important.  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the garda who dealt with the Kilkenny incest case.  The way she got the confidence of the victim to report the case and bring it to court showed tremendous ability and commitment.  It is good that gardaí are willing to put themselves at personal risk to gain the confidence of people who have been abused so reprehensibly.  The garda in this case can never be thanked properly for the work she has done.</P>
    <P>Another important point in the recommendations is on links with schools.  It says in the synopsis and I quote:</P>
    <P>We recommend that appropriate training on the identification, investigation and management of child abuse should be developed and introduced at pre-service level for all teachers.  In addition a programme of appropriate inservice training should be provided for all teachers.</P>
    <P>We recommend that child abuse guidelines issued by the Department of Education should be reviewed in consultation with the Department of Health on a regular basis.  All such reviews or changes must be brought to the attention of all teachers, health services and other professionals dealing with child abuse.</P>
    <P>We further recommend that there should be formal liaison between health boards and schools at local level to align respective guidelines on child abuse into a joint Protocol for effective action.</P>
    <P>In anything to do with health, sex and <Col N="734" /> crime we have been slow to put a proper education system in place.  I made the same point on the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill, 1993, and I believe it is important.  If people are made aware when growing up that child sexual abuse can take place in the home it will make the detection of the crime much easier.  I hope the Minister will give priority to the introduction of such a programme in co-operation with the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>I read the section on prevention with interest.  The report recommends the introduction of the Child Abuse Prevention Programme in all classes at primary school level and recommends that a similar programme be devised and introduced into second level schools at the earliest possible date.  The investigation team also endorse the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women on the introduction of age appropriate life skill programmes in primary and second level schools.  These programmes which are very important should cover such issues as relationships, parenting, sex education, nutrition and hygiene.</P>
    <P>Law reform and the other recommendations are meaningless without the necessary resources.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to provide the necessary resources for the implementation of the recommendations in the Kilkenny report.  My only concern is that it will take three years to introduce the necessary legislation.  I take on board the Minister's point that it will take time to train the appropriate staff, but priority should be given to the legislation and the sooner it can be introduced the better.  We, as a society, have to be vigilant to ensure, as far as possible, crimes like this do not happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I pay tribute to him for the speed with which he acted in this case and the efficient way he got this full report before us.  I commend his team for doing their business so well without engaging in a witch-hunt.  They behaved in a fair and honest manner as anyone <Col N="735" /> can see.  We are good at begrudgery and blaming someone, whether they are responsible or not.</P>
      <P>Senator Reynolds mentioned the media and they are at their best when they engage in those areas of activity. They like to find someone they say made a mistake.  This case was not detected but many are.  I pay tribute to the health boards, their staff and social workers.  I do not wish to take from the Garda who broke this case but it was a social worker who first learned about it, and that seems to have been forgotten.  The social workers in my health board area have done trojan work and have prevented many cases like this.  However, we must be careful.  Our health board took a child into care and received much abuse from a member of the board.  The media also condemned the board and accused it of baby snatching and stealing children from parents.  There were alarming headlines in the newspapers but the health board was proved right and the action had been necessary.  Thankfully the family has been reunited and the problem resolved.</P>
      <P>The problems we are discussing began in England.  It probably would not have happened if the family had always lived in this country.  If people come into a rural area and keep to themselves, as this family did, locals are sometimes slow to get involved with them.  The family also seems to have lived in a <i>cul de sac</i> and according to the report, not many people passed their door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will not uncover all these cases no matter how we tighten the law.  I welcome any improvement to the legislation. However we must be careful.  In the UK, social welfare workers faced the brunt of the law for acting too quickly and taking into care children who should have been left with their parents.  A fine line must be drawn, and in such a wide area it is difficult to know where that should be. Some may say doctors should know what is happening but the parents in this case acted cleverly.  They never sent their child to the same doctor more than twice.  They gave detailed explanations of exactly what happened to the child where others <Col N="736" /> would have simply said she fell off a bicycle.  The case was difficult to follow up.</P>
    <P>There is much talk of greater co-operation between gardaí, social workers, health boards and doctors.  That co-operation does exist.  Health boards and gardaí have often worked together, they successfully brought many of these cases to court.  We do not hear of the good deeds, we hear only of those that slipped through the net.</P>
    <P>I read an alarming article in today's <i>Irish Independent:</i>&ldquo;Children in care give rise to new concern&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>A new study has found a disturbing increase in the number of children in care in Ireland because of parental physical, sexual or emotional abuse.  A high proportion of children are also in care because of long term neglect.  In such cases the child was not necessarily abused but was unkempt and/or hungry.</P>
    <P>The article is worth reading and that study might be worth discussing in this House.</P>
    <P>Parents must do their duty.  In all parts of Ireland children are out late at night when they should be at home.  There is not sufficient parental control.  I was sad to read in the article that &ldquo;The study found children of single mothers and broken families were particularly at risk&rdquo;.  If this report is correct that will be a big problem because the number of broken families and single parents is on the increase.</P>
    <P>Our social welfare system is the best in Europe and that is why so many &ldquo;New Age&rdquo; travellers come to this country, yet many children are begging in this city.  I would like to see those children taken off the streets and their parents called to account.  It is not right that they should be begging.  An adult will often take the money the children have collected to buy alcohol.  Alcohol abuse is a major problem. Slot machines and other addictions are often mentioned but why is there an acceptance of alcohol abuse?  This is often <Col N="737" /> the cause of road accidents, broken marriages, broken homes and abused children.  This issue must be tackled.</P>
    <P>I am a graduate of a technical school which taught domestic science.  Boys and girls acquired many practical skills we are not teaching today; we now teach the theory of these subjects.  Many people working do not earn as much as some people get on social welfare.  They say they cannot live on their income.  The reason they cannot is that the money is badly managed.  An employee of the Department of Social Welfare should ask people how they spend their money and, if necessary, give them advice on how to get value for the money.  Often money is spent on gambling, alcohol and drugs. That is the root of our trouble and it should be brought to an end.</P>
    <P>My health board is implementing many recommendations and, as the Minister knows it, is ahead of its time.  I welcome the report and compliment the Minister on how quickly he has acted.  However we must set up a system to help parents.</P>
    <P>Children need care; they also need love.  Anyone who has reared a family or has grandchildren knows if they are loved they will always come to you because they know they will get a hug and will be respected.  In our society children are too often called nuisances.  They are given money to buy sweets or hire videos but they are not given time.  There is no point having a family unless you have time for them.  Parents must be prepared to make sacrifices while they are bringing up a family.</P>
    <P>I have always advocated that no mother should have to work.  If a mother wants to stay at home for four or five years, her job should be kept open. Refresher courses should be available in the intervening years so that she will keep abreast of the job and will be able to return to work.  All the laws in the world will not have an effect unless a better support system for the family is in place, in other words, we should help fathers and mothers especially.  Officers should go to homes to see how they are managing.</P>
    <P>There have been two big losses for <Col N="738" /> Irish society in the last number of years. The first was the loss of our two teacher schools.  In these schools teachers knew all the children and were able to give advice.  Today schools are so big that teachers go from class to class and do not even know the names of the children. The second big loss was the closure of rural Garda stations.  When these stations operated 24 hours a day they acted as rambling houses.  Cards were played there every night and every topic was discussed.  Everybody came to know the garda and had a special relationship with him and information was given to him.  The garda was able to prevent many cases of abuse.</P>
    <P>Society today is very impersonal. There are not many houses today where you can lift the latch and walk in.  All doors are locked for fear of vandalism. To change this situation we need a greater community spirit and people in the community working together.  People often object to others moving into their communities.</P>
    <P>I am delighted there will be more refuge centres but I can guarantee that people will object to such centres in their areas.  They will say drunken husbands will come to the refuge at all hours of the night and will break up the house and disrupt the families.  Unless the community is prepared to accept faults in our society and unless everyone is prepared to play his or her part in tackling such faults, we will not be able to pass laws or encourage civilised behaviour in families to successfully prevent child abuse in all its forms.</P>

      <P>I, too, am very pleased that the Minister set up the task force so urgently and that Ms. McGuinness and her team reported so quickly.  I am also extremely glad there was no witch-hunt. I am ashamed to see anyone describing the report as a whitewash because it was <Col N="739" /> not.  It is important to note that the Convention on Human Rights held in Vienna recently described sexual abuse as being a violation of human rights.  I do not want to see us being brought to the Court of Human Rights again.  I hope we act in this area very quickly.</P>
      <P>When the abuse took place there was very little discussion in Ireland on sexual abuse; indeed, we reckoned it did not exist.  There could not be an examination of it because its existence would have been denied.  There were no discussions on sex and sexuality.  In this report it is pointed out that when the girl began to be abused as a child she did not realise it was sexual activity, she thought it was some form of punishment.  Even when she was a teenager she had no idea that such activity could lead to a pregnancy. We have talked about setting out guidelines and I am sure the Minister will do that.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell talked about the North-Western Health Board, which is an excellent one.  I wish to talk about the South-Eastern Health Board in the 1980s.  The Health Education Bureau produced a book entitled <i>The Book of the Child.</i>  It was to be given to every pregnant woman to help her through her pregnancy and in dealing with her child in the first four years of the child's life. It is an excellent book.  It was distributed all over Ireland, except in the South-Eastern Health Board region where the officials and professionals were recalcitrant about distributing it.  An obstetrician &mdash; I do not know if it was the one in Kilkenny hospital &mdash; who dealt with this girl, objected to this book being distributed to patients because there was a page in it on contraception.  As a result of objections by him and other very senior professionals on the health board at the time the book was not distributed; it was kept in cupboards and under counters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember this so well because a member of the South-Eastern Health Board, Catherine Bulbulia, who was also a Member of this House, fought a battle and was aided by Deputy Ferris, to have <Col N="740" /> the book distributed.  Some of the members of this health board were also reluctant to have it distributed.  When there is difficulty in having a book, called <i>The Book of the Child</i>, distributed to women who are entitled to it &mdash; it was, after all a publication by the Minister for Health &mdash; and for whom it was specifically designed, one can see what an uphill task some of the professionals had.  Eventually Catherine Bulbulia and Deputy Ferris got the health board to agree to distribute the book.  Initially it was only distributed to women who asked for it. The distribution of the book to all pregnant women had to be passed at a second board meeting.</P>
    <P>This was the climate of opinion at the time.  The Pro-Life Campaign was also under way.  There was a moral attitude abroad that if one suggested anything that was slightly deviant, such as that people were going to England for abortions it was virtually denied.  It is easy to be critical of these professionals, such as the health nurses and so forth, but we must look at the background in which they were working.  In this country once authoritarian voices speak on any issue it is very hard to dissent from these views.</P>
    <P>Much has been said in this House in the last few weeks about the position of the family.  As much as any other Member of the House I, too, think the position of the happy family is splendid. However, a very large number of people are not part of nuclear families and they deserve our care as well.  Perhaps we have revered the family too much and I suggest that the amendments to the Constitution suggested by the inquiry team must be considered a matter of priority.  A statement has to be made regarding the constitutional rights of children, otherwise I can see any legislation the Minister may introduce &mdash; and I am sure he has the best interests of children at heart &mdash; failing on constitutional grounds.  No matter how badly abused a child may be, if its parents are married we will not be in a position to do anything.  It would be easier to intervene if the parents are not married.</P>
    <P>I wish to speak about the public health nurse, the social worker, the doctor, the <Col N="741" /> teachers and the neighbours.  None of them had the right to do anything if they suspected a child was being abused. Public health nurses are in an invidious position.  In this case the public health nurse called over and over again but could not get access to the house.  Such nurses must try to foster a good relationship with the family and at the same time keep an eye on the child.  If they think a baby is being badly abused physically they do not have the right to ask for the baby's clothes to be removed.  This puts them in a very difficult position.  Another factor to be taken into account is that these nurses have a very heavy workload. In some instances they may not have support from those in higher positions, and in such cases, to whom do they report?  It is excellent that we are introducing mandatory reporting.  I must stress that there is a shortage of public health nurses.  UCD is very short of money this year to fund lecturers and they may have to reduce the numbers doing the course by half.</P>
    <P>The social workers involved in such cases also often have huge workloads. There is often a rapid turnover of social workers which means they are fairly junior.  There was a shortage of notes in this case.  Social workers do not have back-up facilities to have their notes typed since most social departments have very little in the way of back-up services there is little continuity of records.</P>
    <P>It is only too easy for the abuser to go from doctor to doctor.  One would hope that within one practice there would be better continuity of care of the patient, and such continuity is also important between doctors and hospital consultants. This continuity was quite good in this case.  The obstetrician pointed out in 1986 or 1987 that it was very unusual for a girl of 22 years of age to be looking for sterilisation; he also pointed out that she seemed to have many gynaecological problems.  It is very difficult to correlate complaints which are psychosomatic &mdash; I am not using this as an abusive word.  The girl was referred for complaints such as neuroleptic bladder, numb leg, etc.  It may be said that computerisation would <Col N="742" /> help but the expense would be astronomical.</P>
    <P>The examination of children under the school medical system is one area in which we can do something.  The father in this case, who is also the grandfather, refused to have the child examined under the school medical system.</P>
    <P>The Child Care Act, 1988, states that a court may require a child to attend for treatment at a clinic, but the child must be under a supervision order.  Some good reason must be given if the child is not allowed to be examined in the school care system.</P>
    <P>The teachers knew something was wrong in this case but they were in a weak situation.  Six weeks after the sexual abuse clinic was set-up in the Rotunda Hospital, it was full of teachers with sexually abused children.  They had nowhere to bring them before the clinic was established. I have confidence in teachers because they notice problems very early and can highlight them.  This is why the stay safe programme is so important, as emphasised in this report.  I have heard that some schools are getting solicitors' letters to prevent them implementing the stay safe programme.  This is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>The mandatory obligation to report to the community welfare officer, is a welcome development.  Many of these professionals have been qualified for some time and training on the ground is essential if we are to get the Child Care Act implemented.</P>
    <P>We talked about the Guidelines on Child Sexual Abuse, of which I have a copy.  I had great difficulty getting it and I wonder how many people know it exists.  It is the duty of the health boards to distribute these guidelines.  Are the health boards doing this?  If we had adopted the same attitude to the Kilkenny Incest Investigation report it would not have been distributed.  Perhaps it is not surprising I found it difficult to get a copy of the guidelines.</P>
    <P>Revising and updating the guidelines is a good idea, but it should be done by the professionals who are working in the field rather than asking people to make <Col N="743" /> recommendations.  People are genuinely concerned about these children and are trying to work without training.</P>
    <P>The involvement of the Garda Síochána did not come within the remit of the report.  It is unfortunate that those who flee their homes &mdash; or what are their prisons &mdash; are returned in Garda cars.  If there were more rape crisis centres adults would be encouraged to report incidents which happened when they were children.</P>
    <P>No one has yet mentioned the primary cause of the trouble &mdash; the father.  If the father had not been behaving in such a despicable manner we would not have this trouble.  A great deal needs to be done because this behaviour is completely unacceptable.  Sometimes we think a married man can do what he likes in his own home.  In this case the neighbours cannot be blamed.  One of them took the other child into her home and reared her.  People do not like interfering but perhaps we should.</P>
    <P>Recommendations are needed to improve the situation regarding children testifying in court.  The long delay in child abuse cases coming before the courts is unacceptable.  In the X case there are still more delays.  Multiple interviewing of the child should be avoided.  I am sure the Minister is sincere but he must introduce more measures because the Child Care Act will not be enough to solve this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for sharing her time, otherwise, I would not have had the opportunity to speak in the House today because, like Senator Lanigan, I spent the afternoon at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, an important function of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important thing I wish to say is that we, in this House, spent a lot of time debating the Child Care Bill. Although it was not possible to accept some of the amendments we tabled, the Government at that time agreed to put forward our amendments as Government <Col N="744" /> amendments and the Bill had to be recommitted to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to see if the amendment regarding the guardian <i>ad litem</i> clause can be implemented.  This introduces an impartial officer of the court, who does not represent the court, the family or the State, but who represents the welfare of the child.  This was introduced after the Maria Cauldwell case in England.  I have no doubt it saved lives in England and it would also save lives in Ireland.  It was a good day's work in the Seanad, but it received no mention in the press.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report which is professional. Rather like the painful case story by James Joyce, where the coroner's report ends with the phrase, &ldquo;it seems no one was to blame&rdquo;, it seems to me that the report is not incisive enough although I accept the Minister's statement that it was not appropriate to look for scapegoats.  Of course, it was not appropriate but, we must do everything we can to ensure that this happens as infrequently as possible.  I remember being astonished at the number of child sex abuse cases which happened in the last five years or so.  I began to wonder was it real.  Of course it is real.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister said about a constitutional amendment.  The family is a valuable building block in our society. No one denies this but it has been used as a convenient blanket alibi, a kind of <i>cordon sanitaire</i> around people who molest their own children.  That is intolerable. The family should not be used to protect the abuser; it must be used to protect the child.  The amendment which the report recommends, and to which the Minister has given his support is extremely valuable.</P>
    <P>I am pleased Senator Henry in her usual caring way mentioned the stay safe programme.  It is important that a message goes out from this House that we, as elected representatives, and the Minister fully endorse this important programme. It is wicked that people are trying to frustrate it.  This was raised the other day in relation to another Bill when it was indicated that someone in a responsible <Col N="745" /> position said that this programme was terrible because children might be expected to report incidents even-involving their own father, as if paternity was a justification for incest.  I cannot believe people should be allowed to get away with this.</P>
    <P>Sexual illiteracy is a problem in this country.  People are not as sexually illiterate as we were in my day when there was no sex education programme &mdash; people can draw their own conclusions in my case.  I remember travelling around the country and meeting a young man in Cork who was very distressed because he thought he was homosexual.  He masturbated and he did not know what it meant.  He experienced immense relief when he discovered that he was not destined to be a dirty old man in a raincoat. He subsequently got married and asked us to stop sending him regular communications because although his fiancee was broad minded, she might not understand. We sent him a telegram of congratulations. This man is happily married and well adjusted, but he might have been a casualty.</P>
    <P>In endorsing the stay safe programme, we help not to dismantle the family, which is no one's ambition or intention, but to protect children.  This is something which all of us, whether we are married or not, would wish to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have been happy to hear more from Senator Norris on that topic.  I will be brief because I know that many people are interested in contributing to this debate.</P>
      <P>I studied the Kilkenny incest investigation report with interest, having been one of the first people to call for a debate in March of this year.  I congratulate Ms. Catherine McGuinness and the other members of her team for a job well done. It is a comprehensive and well drafted report.  Unlike a certain inquiry, it did not take a lot of time and it did not cost a lot of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first part of the report deals with the individual case in question and it answers many of the questions I asked. It puts together the facts of the girl's case <Col N="746" /> and the various contacts she had with the different aspects of the health service.  I was interested in the fact that the girl and her family covered up many occurrences by dealing with various doctors and offereing plausible explanations for the injuries, etc.  What stood out in this part of the report was the lack of co-ordination between the various elements of the health service.  The girl's situation was not fully investigated or fully responded to by the health service even when her physical complaints and injuries pointed to sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>The report recognises that we have come a long way since then in recognising and dealing with the grave problem of sexual abuse.  I hope this is the case.  It appears to me that there was, and still may be, an ambivalence towards family violence.  In part, this may stem from a society where parents are to be honoured and obeyed, and rightly so, but we should all remember that there is an equal duty on parents to care properly for their children. When they fail in this regard, the health service needs to act as a unified force in giving a coherent response.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for acting with speed.  I have listened to his speech in which he outlined the action taken so far in dealing with the recommendations and I am more than impressed.  Indeed, if every issue is tackled in this fashion, this country will be the envy of all.  I am pleased to see the Minister's commitment to introduce the remaining sections of the Child Care Act, 1991.  Increasing from 16 to 18 years the age up to which the health board may intervene to protect children is welcome because as we saw in this case, it affected a girl well into her teens and early 20s.  Many people are under parental care at this age and it is only right and fair that they would not be excluded from protection in this fashion at the tender age of 16.</P>
    <P>The idea of supervision orders interests me and I would like to know more about them.  It appears to be a good idea to supervise a child's family situation without removing the child from the family home.  Section 3 of the Act states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> It shall be a function of every health board to promote the welfare of children in its area who are not receiving adequate care and protection.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from this that the onus is now being placed on the health board to not only deal with children suffering from sexual abuse but, more importantly, to identify them.  It is all too easy to pass the buck in a system which, by its very nature is complicated and diverse.  As the health boards will now be responsible for identifying the children suffering abuse, it follows that they will need to co-ordinate their approach, and this is long overdue. This is a point I want to focus on. The report makes recommendations on case conferences as the natural forum where all professionals involved can come together.  This would facilitate the pooling of information and would assist any necessary legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>I note that the report suggests that key workers could be appointed following these discussions and they would be specifically assigned to manage individual cases.  This would be welcome as a practical way of dealing with the problem because all too often we find that we have too many chiefs and not enough Indians, so to speak.  It is only right and proper to focus and make one person responsible for the case having received all the necessary information.  More importantly, such a system would facilitate the indentification of problems and speed up the action necessary to resolve them at a much earlier stage.</P>
    <P>The report also suggested that the reporting of child abuse should be mandatory for certain personnel.  I would like to point out that this recommendation, among others, does not cost anything.  I notice from the report that the problem in many cases was not just a lack of services but a complete lack of co-ordination.  We see the Garda doing one thing, social workers doing another and the medical doctor taking his own independent action.  This cannot continue. A first step is necessary and that should be a standardised system of notification. <Col N="748" /> I noticed that the report went into that in detail and I want to emphasise it because I hope it will be one of the first steps the Minister takes to deal with the problem.  All it requires is thought and planning before being put into effect.</P>
    <P>I also want to focus on domestic violence. The Minister has commenced discussions with the Garda Síochána with a view to strengthening the child abuse guidelines but much more than that is needed.  Looking at the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and at this report, we see that something must be done about barring orders and extending them to cover people other than spouses.  This area must be dealt with for people's general protection.  I do not want to be parochial but money is needed to provide refuge centres.  There are none in County Monaghan. What can you tell somebody in such a situation when they do not have independent means, the resources or the know-how to know where to go?  A refuge is definitely needed.  We should also consider freephone facilities and a greater degree of counselling.  I trust the Minister will look into that.</P>
    <P>I notice from the recommendations in the report that teachers were aware of the problem.  Generally they are, but as Senator Henry correctly pointed out, there is little they can do.  My sister is a primary school teacher and has faced this problem on a number of occasions.  The guidelines for teachers in this area need to be updated and co-ordinated with the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>I support the stay safe programme and the child abuse prevention programme. This should be extended to all teachers and made a mandatory part of their training because it helps to more easily identify problems when children are away from the family home and might be able to talk to somebody other than the usual people with whom they have contact.</P>
    <P>On the subject of general co-operation, I note and welcome that the health board will be made responsible for this. We need more liaison between the various agencies and the Garda.  It is only when that is worked out that we will see <Col N="749" /> a reduction in the number of children abused, and a speedier response to that abuse.</P>
    <P>As Senator Henry said, nobody has mentioned the offender in this case. When I spoke in the debate on this issue earlier this year, I called for action that would protect the victim rather the offender.  I know that requires changes in court procedures which are not in the Minister's domain but it needs to be looked at nonetheless.</P>
    <P>We have discussed the identification of sexual abuse but we need to focus on its prevention and treatment following it.  I would emphasise that a programme in national and secondary schools is essential to make children aware of this.  It should be included in a life skills subject or in some other form, but it should be available and mandatory in all schools. A public education programme would also be useful.  In dealing with the treatment of victims no effort should be spared to follow up their cases and ensure that they have adequate counselling so that they can recover from their ordeal, redress the damage done and, hopefully, have a happy future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the report of the Kilkenny incest investigation, and I wish to pay tribute to a former Member of this House, Ms. Catherine McGuinness, and her team for the excellent job they have done in such a short time.  The committee made 23 recommendations which have great relevance for all cases of child neglect and abuse. The Minister should immediately implement all sections of the Child Care Act, 1991, to ensure that controls are implemented on the level of abuse.  A three year time scale is not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all accept that it is a sad reflection on society that there are people who will inflict such injuries, both physical and psychological, on their own family as we <Col N="750" /> have seen from this report.  Although some would have us believe it, this is not an isolated incident as the ISPCC state and it is their view that at least six children have died as a result of severe physical and sexual abuse within the past 12 months.  That is frightening to comprehend.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate and sad that legislation which was passed two years ago has not been implemented to counteract some of this abuse.  The State has a duty to do everything to ensure the safety of its children.  The State has not paid attention to the needs of children within society.  It is deficient in the co-ordination of services and this should be changed. The protection of children is important to the social health of our community and the necessary resources must be provided and the full implementation of the Child Care Act is a priority to achieve this.</P>
    <P>The Kilkenny incest investigation report recommends that Article 41 and 42 of the Constitution should be amended. This would clarify the constitutional rights of our children, which is not the case at present.  The balance must be moved in favour of the child.  A constitutional amendment should enshrine the rights of children.  We have paid a great deal of attention to the rights of the unborn and rightly so.  Surely nobody can argue against the need to guarantee the rights of the born.  With particular reference to the vulnerability of a defenceless child, the balance of rights, as expressed in the Constitution, has given rise to a confused situation.  I believe that the Minister should introduce an appropriate framework for change at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>The report outlines the role of the Garda Sióchána and in this context, I wish to again congratulate Garda Reddy for her role in exposing this sad, cruel case.  The Garda Sióchána are often reluctant to become involved in family disputes.  I believe they are inadequately trained to do so.  It is of fundamental importance that a child care officer be appointed to each Garda division.  Such a garda could have functions similar to <Col N="751" /> those of the crime prevention officer or juvenile liaison officer.</P>
    <P>If Part III of the Child Care Act was implemented and properly enforced, any delay in coming to the rescue of a child who has been abused and neglected would be greatly reduced.  I do not believe such abuse can be eliminated, all we can do is control and minimise it.</P>
    <P>Our approach when taking action against child abuse is to remove the child from the home.  Our immediate reaction is that the child must be kept safe.  I believe that it is more appropriate that the offender should be removed from the home.  As stated in a previous debate, the concept of third party barring orders must be considered.  In this respect the present law is clearly inadequate.</P>
    <P>The argument in favour of allowing an abused party, be it brother, sister, son, daughter or parent, apply to the local District Court for a protection order or barring order and to let the court decide the case in the normal way, is overwhelming. The powers of the health boards must also be considered to ensure that action is taken where injured parties are too fearful to take an action in their own name.</P>
    <P>The outcome of this sorrowful case and the attention it has achieved has forced the issue of sexual abuse within the home to the top of the national agenda.  This is to be welcomed, as does the highlighting of the problems faced by the various groups and people dealing with this case.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss this case in the House today.</P>
      <P>I agree with the compliments made by Senator Gallagher to former Senator McGuinness, who chaired the team who produced this report.  It illustrates what happens when a woman is in charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us in the House were impatient that there was not an opportunity to discuss this report earlier and the Minister should be aware of this. However, I believe that on reflection, the delay has been worthwhile because it <Col N="752" /> gave us more time to consider the abuse of children and women.</P>
    <P>Reading the report six weeks after its publication makes us all very angry.  The report is a chilling and horrific account of this young person's nightmare which went on for almost ten years.  It makes us wonder what kind of society we have that produces people who inflict this kind of pain on women.</P>
    <P>I reflected on the issue last week when the Wildlife Bill was discussed in the Dáil.  The passion and urgency generated by that debate and the power of the arguments over the value of the greyhound industry made me wonder about the values of this society and what society believes to be important.  Is it because women and children do not appear to have an obvious economic worth that we do not generate the same sort of urgency about what happens to them?</P>
    <P>It is necessary to consider again the values and structures of society and who is important.  I believe the reason the Minister has accepted the findings of this report and that the Government has promised £30 million to implement the child care proposals is that people are unhappy and want changes to be implemented.  There is a desire that such cases will not recur but if they do the facilities should be available to enable the health care professionals and the gardaí to investigate and bring the culprits to justice.</P>
    <P>When considering this report some people believe if more money had been provided for these services this would not have happened.  However, a former Assistant Secretary in the Department of Health said:</P>
    <P>It is clear that the misery suffered by this young woman for so long arises less from the lack of legal provisions and health board resources than from what appears to be gross indifference by far too many people in authority at the brutalisation of women and children.</P>
    <P>A major problem in this area, and it is a problem not readily understood, is the concept of violence against women and <Col N="753" /> children.  In this respect I ask the Minister to refer to the submission to the Southern Health Board made by Women's Aid Helpline.  This report, together with the report by the Kilkenny incest investigation team and the report of the Second Commission on the Status for Women makes interesting reading.  I believe this recommendation should be implemented.</P>
    <P>Violence against women and children is a violation of their human rights.  It causes serious physical and mental injury to women and children.  It breaks bodies, families and lives.  It is a grave social problem which threatens our society and I believe it must be addressed and eliminated.  That must be the aim of all in this House.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's commitment in this area and I welcome his acceptance of all of the proposals in this report. Senator Farrell spoke of opposition to the provision of refuge accommodation. I welcome the recent decision by Dublin City Council to give permission for the provision of a refuge to Aoibhneas but what shocked me was that a Member of the Dáil, who is also a Member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, voted against the proposal.  If the issues of educating people and making them aware of this problem are to be addressed, then I believe more should be expected from Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The issues raised by the Kilkenny case reflect the overall lack of policy in dealing with violent assault on women and children in the home.  As the Minister remarked, this does not come solely within his remit; it affects the Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice and other Departments. An overall view must be taken by everybody involved.  However, I would like them to draw on the experiences of people and organisations such as Women's Aid Helpline who have been involved in this area for many years.  This too was one of the recommendations in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women which requested that those already active in a voluntary capacity should be involved and the funding <Col N="754" /> should be provided by the relevant Department.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by quoting from remarks made by President Robinson on 25 February 1992 when she presented her Allen Lane Foundation Lecture at Trinity College: &ldquo;We must also fundamentally reappraise our view of who and what is valuable in our society&rdquo;.  We should all reflect on that.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and compliment him on responding so speedily to this horrific physical, mental and sexual abuse that has been ongoing for the last 15 and more years.  It is a sad reflection on society that this case was known in the surrounding areas and yet nothing was done about it. This is a particularly sad reflection on the professionals who deal with young people in their formative years.</P>
      <P>I compliment the young woman who took this case against her abuser.  Her action has given us new ideas when it comes to preparing the framework of future legislation.  She is a brave young woman.  If we had more of that spirit in society we would wipe out this type of abuse very quickly.  I am delighted she was there to show the way for other cases.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the investigation team for the speed with which they responded to the terms of reference laid down by the Minister.  I also congratulate Catherine McGuinness for her chairmanship of that team.  We are here to discuss the recommendations of their report.  I read the report in great detail and I would like to be able to spend more time discussing certain aspects of the recommendations, which provide the framework for a longer debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I work as a guidance counsellor in a school and I know about this problem. While I compliment the Minister for laying down the recommendations and trying to speed up ways of implementing <Col N="755" /> them, nevertheless I have reservations in terms of how best they will work within schools.  The Minister mentioned mandatory guidelines.  I recognise that there are many personnel members available. However, what worries me is that the professionals will become experts at talking about a case but will lose sight of what needs to be done in the meantime.  I would like the system to be streamlined.</P>
    <P>If a case in the school is brought to our notice, we find the right person to deal with it.  We look for an educational psychologist, a community health nurse or a social worker, but none of them is available. I know these positions exist in theory, but when a case arises it will take at least a month or six weeks for it to be examined.</P>
    <P>I compliment the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee for the very good structure it has set up.  I can work within it but outside that area the structure is not as tight in terms of co-ordination between the Departments of Health, Social Welfare and Education.  It worries me that we may wait a year before action is taken and I would like the Minister to be aware of that when it comes to how best his recommendations can be implemented.</P>
    <P>When it comes to implementing the Child Care Act, 1991 it should be remembered that we have enough personnel, we do not need more.  What we do need are resources to provide in-service training for those who are already there to see how best they can get immediate attention for each case brought to their attention. I believe there is a lack of confidence on the part of personnel as to how they should approach parents as laid down in the guidelines and reporting to the director of community care.  It is fine in theory but when I am investigating a case I, like many others, do not have enough confidence because we have not attended enough in-service courses to help us over those stages.  If we are to introduce new guidelines there should be in-service courses immediately so that when I return to my school in September I, and my colleagues, will feel confident and <Col N="756" /> competent to take action immediately and not have to wait 12 months until the next stage is reached.  We have so many personnel we do not know where to turn. Everything is fine in theory but not in practice.  I urge the Minister to finalise and refine these guidelines.  As a school guidance counsellor I believe an educational psychologist is very important because he or she can spot a case very quickly but our hands are tied.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for his work in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I too congratulate the Minister on moving so speedily on this matter and I also congratulate Catherine McGuinness, a former Member of this House.</P>
      <P>The first time I spoke in this House, except when I was annoyed with Senator O'Toole, was on this case.  I was reading what I said at the time and I mentioned that some video nasties probably would not hold a candle to the details of this case.  I was not aware of the details then but until I read this report I did not realise how significant was that comment.</P>
      <P>As Senator Henry said, I do not think anybody wanted the Minister to seek a scapegoat or to present a whitewash, but the report does not seem to have addressed why nothing was done.  People who knew this girl did not want to get involved.  As Senator Gallagher stated, there is an ambivalence towards family violence and there is no doubt about that. People must have known about this case. However, we should not use this case or anybody involved in it as scapegoats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned in my contribution on the previous occasion that I wanted the Minister to make the report public.  He did so within five days of receiving it and I commend him for that.  I remember stating and feeling very emotional and passionate about it that for us to debate this issue, which was very sensitive but also had a very high profile, and for us all to beat our breasts and go away feeling we had done well by highlighting it, would achieve nothing.  I stated that if we were not prepared to take responsibility we were no good as public representatives. <Col N="757" /> I pay tribute to the Government, and particularly the Minister, who has demonstrated a caring attitude and his commitment as Minister for Health by bringing his case to Government and getting money in such difficult financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he has received an additional £5 million to be provided for child care services this year, which is equivalent to £10 million which will be made available for each of the next three years.  Other Senators said that was not good enough but I think it is sensible. Even if the Minister has made all the money available today, the necessary services and the mechanisms are not in place.  The Minister is behaving not only compassionately but sensibly.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given a commitment that remaining provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991, will be implemented and, if nothing else were to happen, that is a very significant outcome of the report. The Minister also stated that he hoped the full implementation of the Act will ensure that no child and no family will ever again have to endure such suffering. Nobody would have wished that girl to endure such suffering but she should know it was not in vain.  Hopefully her dreadful experience will ensure that nobody else will have to suffer as she did.</P>
    <P>It would have been easy for the Minister to have done nothing and to have said he was going to investigate all the recommendations in the reports, the suggestion that a constitutional referendum be held and that there should be mandatory reporting, and then come back to us, but he did not.  He is to be applauded for taking immediate emergency action and for the fact that he will address the other issues at a later date.  I urge him to examine the area of barring orders.</P>
    <P>One last point struck me as unbelievable. On page 47 of the report the girl states that when she was being abused &ldquo;all this was brand new.  I thought when he did this to me, &lsquo;what did I do wrong?&rsquo; The more I struggled, the more I got hit. So I would just lie there and get it over with.&rdquo;  Nobody should have to feel they <Col N="758" /> have done something wrong or that anybody has a right to inflict torment on them.  Senator Farrell was right when he said that in a proper family environment, no child would suffer like that but when families break down, unfortunately it is necessary for the State to become involved.  We need a comprehensive stay safe policy in the education system.  No child should ever feel that he or she is in the wrong when somebody abuses them.</P>

      <P>It is sad that we do not have more time for a debate of this importance because the issues are far too complex to be dealt with simplistically. However, we will do our best.</P>
      <P>This is an excellent report and the Minister's response has been admirable. I agree with 95 per cent of the recommendations in the report.  What is clear however, is how little we know about this issue in Irish society in general.  Virtually no effective research has been carried out in this area and when one looks at the data on pages 42 and 43 of the report one finds that the specific Irish data diverges considerably from the generalisations made about international data.  That is understandable but it shows how fragmentary is the basis on which generalisations are based in terms of dealing with the issue at a national level.</P>
      <P>The recommendation on the Constitution has some merit, even though the wording and potential interpretation have to be looked at with great care.  I am surprised that more attention is not paid to Article 42.5 of the Constitution as it stands.  It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, <Col N="759" /> the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.</P>
    <P>If there was a desire to interpret that in a manner which would protect the rights of the child more than they have been protected, there is a great deal of potential in that wording for doing so.  My fear would be that unless the mentality and attitude behind them is fully supportive, words alone, even a constitutional amendment, will do little more to help children than the ignoring, by and large, of Article 42.5 at this stage.</P>
    <P>I have considerable reservations about the mandatory recommendation.  I can see the argument for it and there is obviously a great deal to be said for it. However, the issues involved are far more finely balanced than emerges in our current discussion.  We are horrified by the specifics of this case but there are some sweeping philosophical statements here and I share Senator Reynolds's reservations not about the intent, but about the implications.  The report says that the duty to protect the child from abuse must override the duty to respect family privacy or personal freedom.  Family privacy is largely a convention and it is an important convention for the mundanities of civilised society.  Personal freedom is not a convention; it is a right.  It is a different category from family privacy.  It can be subordinate to other rights but this is a very sweeping statement to be presented without qualification.</P>
    <P>As consciousness of this issue rises, there is a danger of false accusations. This danger may arise in the vindictiveness and viciousness of family or neighbourly feuds.  One may say there are sufficient fail safe mechanisms to counter that but there tends to be an assumption in the tone of much of what is before us that one is guilty until proved innocent. If there was any danger of that affecting attitudes, one would need to be very careful about how precisely one implemented that recommendation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="760" /> On page 43 of the report we are told that the total number of cases reported to the Eastern Health Board was 990, of which 55 were ultimately prosecuted and 38 were found guilty; about one-third were found not guilty.  This does not necessarily mean that abuse had not occurred but while the fact that there was a failure to sustain some of these cases may be a result of the problems that arise with these cases, it may in some cases be because the case simply could not be sustained.  It is something which should warn us against an uncritical acceptance of the unqualified response here which is understandable in the immediate aftermath of the case.</P>
    <P>While on balance I am in favour of a mandatory dimension, the manner in which it is legalised and implemented seems to have implications for our society that need to be considered beyond the issue of child abuse, horrific though that is.  There is an invaluable little direction given, where we are told that there should be mandatory reporting by designated persons of all forms of child abuse.  This includes doctors, nurses, community welfare officers, psychologists, child care workers, teachers and probation officers.  I would put some stress on teachers there.</P>
    <P>Tribute has been rightly paid to the role of teachers in drawing attention to cases of abuse.  However, teachers are not professional child care workers in the way all the others listed here are.  The others have a different type of training; at least I presume they have a different type of training specifically concerned with the issue.  Teachers, before they find themselves in this situation, deserve more training and education in these issues than they will have acquired in their normal education.  There is a reference in the report to in-service training but in-service training for teachers as things stand and indeed all in-service training is derisory in terms of the support it gets.  These are pious aspirations unless something serious can be done about them.  I would draw attention specifically to the implications for teachers which <Col N="761" /> seem to be different from the implications for others on the list.</P>
    <P>The extra resources are welcome but extra resources will not in themselves cope with the fragmentation and lack of co-ordination between the services to which the report drew attention and to which several speakers, Senator Gallagher in particular, drew attention.  My brusque response to the charge of fragmentation is, so what?  Why single out workers in this area?  In what area of Irish public service or the public service anywhere is there not fragmentation?  It is the characteristic of public administration in this country, perhaps in all countries, even though as a small society we are supposed to be integrated.  What we hear about integrated programmes, Structural Funds and other areas is by definition an admission that what we have at present is fragmentation.  It is not fair to blame the health services or to single them out for the type of administrative problems which have arisen.  The problems are undoubtedly there but are part of what we are.  They are not specific to the health services and that has to be taken into account when trying to cope with the problem.</P>
    <P>Finally, and here I echo some of the fears expressed by Senator Farrell, there is the incongruous and tragic possibility that unless we take cognisance of the sentiments which Senator Honan quoted from President Robinson, in ten years time we may have a better prevention and treatment service and all these recommendations may be implemented but we could still have worse child abuse and sexual violence than we have today unless attitudes can be changed.</P>

      <P>This is called the Kilkenny incest case and it is important <Col N="762" /> that, as a representative of Kilkenny and not wanting to downgrade what has happened in this tragic situation, I should be allowed to speak for longer than three minutes.  Certain people said they would speak for seven minutes but spoke for 20 minutes.</P>
      <P>Legislation will not get rid of the brutalisation of children in Irish society; it will not get rid of the brutalisation of women and men in society.  Ireland has unfortunately become a brutal society and this is instanced every day.  There is brutality in all elements in Irish society. Kilkenny may be the place mentioned in this case but the same thing is happening every day in every county.  Unfortunately the spotlight is on Kilkenny today. Brutalisation is a fact of life because we have become a brutal society and there is no point looking for scapegoats.</P>
      <P>The media, education and health boards have been mentioned as playing a part in the atrocity that was committed against this young girl.  How do we adapt to this society?  Do we tell the media and the parents that they should not talk about this?  What must we do to rid us of this brutalisation?  Education has failed dramatically.  This brutalisation is not a recent phenomenon.  There is not a parish in Ireland where similar things have not taken place.  It is fortunate that the Minister acted when he did and he has brought forward plans which may help.  The pooling of information may help, but from where will the information come?</P>
      <P>Mandatory reporting by a child of five or six years of age of incidents that happened over the past three or four years is not proper.  Mandatory recollections by a 16 year old of what happened when they were younger is not what they think about when they are growing up.  As they grow older, they find it hard to relate to what happened to them.  There are a range of reasons people think this way.  In this instance, the media are to be brutally and utterly condemned.  A man from Castlecomer, where this case occurred, named John Burn, the so-called correspondent of the <i>Sunday Times</i> who&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If one visits Castlecomer today, one will find that 90 per cent of the people in that area are accepted although, as Burns said, they came from other regions.  The family in Ireland has been mentioned.  What is the family in Ireland?  Reference has also been made to the elements in society which make up families.  We now have different styles of families and we must accept that.  There is no point blaming the parents of single families for the problem.  We live in a multi-element society and we must work on that.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the recommendations by the investigation team on the Kilkenny incest case.  Their report was formulated quickly and dealt with a tragic case which, as Senator Lanigan said, is similar to many other cases throughout our country, and possibly in every country.  It is a tragedy for any family that is caught up in that situation and we, as a society, have a lot to answer for.</P>
      <P>The phrase &ldquo;sexual abuse&rdquo; seems to crop up in every aspect of life.  On Monday evening, &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo;, the BBC current affairs programme, produced a strong and interesting programme on abuse of young boys and girls by Catholic priests in Ireland, the UK and in many other countries.  These abuses were carried out when the children were at an early age and only 20 to 30 years later did they realise they had been badly abused and they were now prepared to do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lack of procedures in place during the 1980s were referred to early in the report and this is an accepted fact.  I worked in the service during this period and saw many cases where young girls or middle aged women were being badly <Col N="765" /> abused but they would not say anything about it because it was not the done thing. I am glad that in this report that issue is now being addressed.  Senator Lee said it is not fair to attach too much blame to the health services because they can only work within their remit.  However, if a team approach can be introduced there would be an improvement in the service.</P>
    <P>Society has a lot to answer for.  The fact is that this abuse went on for many years and no one seemed to be able to stop it until a garda heard of it.  That seems to be the way our society operated &mdash; people minded their own business and let the victim suffer.  I am glad to see that the remaining sections of the Child Care Act are to be implemented, but education goes hand in hand with this.  We cannot look for funds all the time; they are not there.  If the education system was properly looked at, sex education in schools would alert children to what was happening to them.  Young boys must be as well educated in relation to sexual matters as young girls.  I came across one case in a hospital where a young girl had been abused by a member of her family and became pregnant.  It got to the stage where, if she walked down the street and a boy pulled her into a lane and had sex with her, she said she did not care because she had been so badly abused earlier in her life that she felt worthless and dirty.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of extra staff is to be welcomed.  There are professionals who do an excellent job and are only too glad to get involved.  I also welcome the £5 million the Minister is providing this year &mdash; £10 million in a full year; it will go a long way towards improving the situation.  I agree wholeheartedly with mandatory reporting.  In the service I worked in, I was convinced that mandatory reporting was essential where someone was being abused.  We took it for granted that the abuse was reported, but, of course, it did not always happen.</P>
    <P>Domestic violence occurs in many homes and nothing is being done about it.  The recommendations in this area are also to be welcomed.  The provision of <Col N="766" /> more refuge places for the victims of family violence is also welcome.  County Donegal does not have one refuge for victims of any kind of violence, and it is ludicrous that 70 to 75 per cent of the women being cared for in the refuge in County Derry come from Donegal.  I also welcome the training for health care staff and the involvement of the Garda, but it must be a team effort.  At the end of the day, the community and the education system have a lot to answer for.  I welcome the recommendations in this report.  If they help even one person they are most welcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, for coming to the House to debate this issue on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that the situation in the University College Hospital, Galway, is serious.  The hospital was built in 1956 and no significant capital investment has been made since.  The Minister, in his short term at the Department of Health, has significantly reduced hospital waiting lists, etc.  I realise that the difficulties experienced by University College Hospital and other hospitals throughout the country have nothing to do with this Minister. These difficulties have arisen under successive Ministers, including some from my party.  I acknowledge that fact at the outset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have two acute hospitals in Galway, the University College Hospital and Merlin Park Regional Hospital. During the past 20 years University College Hospital has been the main acute hospital in the Western Health Board area.  It is recognised by the Department of Health as one of the most efficient hospitals in the country with a high level <Col N="767" /> of cost effectiveness.  However, no significant investment has been made since its construction in 1956.</P>
    <P>Nursing staff are under severe pressure because of inadequate facilities.  Nurses coming on and off duty must change in toilets.  There are no changing facilities for them.  The Western Health Board, under the direction of Mr. Eamonn Hannon, has done its utmost to provide the necessary resources for adequate nursing staff.  The nursing staff is overstretched and is under considerable presure day in, day out.  I ask the Minister to consider improving the facilities for the nursing staff and the staffing levels.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the condition of the hospital.  During the week the main building was described by one of the leading consultants who is not prone to exaggeration as nothing more than an industrial building.  No significant maintenance work has been carried out over the past 25 years.  If one attempts to open a window it is liable not to open.  There are inadequate facilities throughout the hospital and it is in need of basic maintenance, such as painting.  In other words, the hospital is in need of a major overhaul and for this funding is required.</P>
    <P>There is need for a significant capital investment in the hospital.  During the past ten years a major development plan has been on a shelf at the Department of Health.  This plan, if implemented, would enable the hospital to carry the workload of the western region.  However, that plan has gathered dust over the years and no work has been carried out.  I blame my party for their lack of action in implementing this development plan.  In 1956 the hospital had 700 beds.  This figure has now been reduced to approximately 400.  There are waiting lists in all the major surgical and medical areas. New theatre and diagnostic facilities, a new casualty department and extra beds are urgently required.  A medium-term plan has been submitted to the Department for the provision of those facilities and I urge the Minister to make available, as a matter of urgency, the capital required.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Western Health <Col N="768" /> Board, the Leas-Chathaoirleach has campaigned for improvements to this hospital.  Often people spend up to five hours in the casualty department before going to the diagnostic unit.  They are admitted or sent home.  This is unacceptable in this day and age.  We have a casualty unit which is grossly inadequate. We lack the necessary consultant staff in the casualty unit to ensure a level of efficiency which is not there at present. We have a diagnostic unit which has not been developed of improved to any significant degree since 1956.  We need scanning equipment because the existing equipment is completely outdated.  We received one C/T scanner three or four years ago and that C/T scanner was no sooner installed than it became obsolete. There is a need for diagnostic equipment which would be capable of meeting the present needs of the western region.</P>
    <P>The important point is that it can be cost efficient if we put this equipment in place because we are sending hundreds, if not thousands, of people out of the Western Health Board region each year to be treated outside the region.  It is costing a fortune to take these people out of the region because we cannot treat them in Galway.</P>
    <P>I know there are waiting lists all over the country, but in Galway, because we agreed to rationalise with Merlin Park Hospital by bringing a number of their consultants into University College Hospital, the hospital is now bursting at the seams.  We have extra consultants in disciplines like urology.  We had one urologist in Merlin Park Hospital with 30 beds.  That discipline was moved into University College Hospital, a second urologist was appointed and now the two urologists have 15 beds between them.  It is not possible for those consultants to operate under those conditions.</P>
    <P>The same situation applies right across the board in all the different consultancies. The hospital was built to accommodate the situation in 1956 when 35 or 40 doctors worked there.  There are now 200 doctors, between senior consultants and junior hospital doctors in University College Hospital, Galway, <Col N="769" /> and we now have a much lower bed capacity than we had then.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the super job he has done to date, but I put it to him that Galway is now the most urgent location in the country for his immediate attention.  I ask him to come to Galway to talk to the medical and nursing staff, the consultants and the health board officials, and see for himself that we have the number one hospital in the country in terms of its efficiency and its cost effectiveness. We have probably the best hospital in the country in terms of the medical attention given to its patients, but we have a team who are working against all the odds in their efforts to provide an efficient health service.  I want to assure the Minster that this is not a political issue, but I ask him to come to Galway to talk to those people.  He will see for himself that money must be provided before the end of this year to proceed with the medium-term development.  I ask him to take the major plan off the shelf, put it in place and commence the long term development of this hospital.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.  I thank Senator Fahey for the cogent case he has made for the development at University College Hospital in Galway, and you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh for your endorsement and for giving me the opportunity to a say few words on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have visited Galway but I have not had the opportunity to visit the hospital. I am mindful of the invitation and I look forward to an opportunity to visit the hospital.  University College Hospital, Galway, is the flagship hospital of the Western Health Board and provides an excellent hospital service to patients in the health board area.  I am aware that the <Col N="770" /> hospital has been dealing with continuous exceptional demands for services.  With a view to addressing the problems associated with these demands, the Western Health Board made a number of proposals to my Department for improvement of ward accommodation, additional theatres, improved accident and emergency facilities and additional X-ray requirements which it proposes to fund through sale of lands at Merlin Park which are surplus to its requirements.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of these proposals a joint working party consisting of representatives of my Department and the Western Health Board was set up to examine the priority requirements of the hospital, to outline ways in which these requirements can be financed and to ensure that the developments proposed for the short and medium term will not jeopardise the long term development plans for the hospital.  I expect to have a report from the group in the coming months.</P>
    <P>I understand that there have been problems with delays at the accident and emergency department of the hospital in recent times.  The Senator will appreciate that delays are an inevitable part of busy casualty departments which have a large throughput of patients.  Each patient must be assessed to determine their medical priority and urgent cases must be attended to promptly.  This necessarily means that the more routine patient will experience some waiting time.  I am pleased to say, however, that the hospital authorities have recently increased the level of medical cover at the accident and emergency department in University College Hospital, Galway, with an anticipated consequent reduction in waiting times.  The existing accident and emergency accommodation is generally considered to be inadequate for the numbers of patients attending.  The accommodation problem in this department is one of the items being examined by the joint working group.</P>
    <P>In relation to staff accommodation, and nursing staff in particular, the hospital authorities have been making ongoing improvements notably in the <Col N="771" /> out-patients department, the day surgery area and maternity department.  It is the intention of the hospital authorities to continue with improvements to staff accommodation and facilities according as the opportunities arise and suitable accommodation becomes available.</P>
    <P>For my own part I will continue to provide additional funds as resources allow for the improvement of services at University College Hospital, Galway.  I recently gave approval to the Western Health Board to proceed to tender for a replacement C/T scanner for the hospital at an approximate cost of £500,000. Senator Fahey has already referred to the major initiative on waiting lists.  I recently announced that the Western Health Board received an allocation of £2,192,600 under this initiative, which was the largest allocation to any health board; £1,312,600 of this additional funding will be used at University College Hospital, Galway, and will reduce average times in the specialities of ENT, ophthalmology, plastic surgery and urology.</P>
    <P>I am mindful of the Senator's invitation and I hope to be in a position in the not too distant future to see the facilities at first hand.  I have had deputations from the area and have met many of the consultants about specific issues and I am always impressed by the degree of professionalism they have brought to their delegations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I seldom table Matters on Adjournment.  It is not my policy to bring people here unnecessarily, but there is a problem about the treatment of arrears section in the Department of Social Welfare and to many public representatives this is a serious problem.  I have been speaking with representatives and staff in the arrears section and, they have emphasised <Col N="772" /> that unfortunately when people look for their equal treatment arrears payments they are paid a certain amount if they apply publicly or through a member of their family, etc.  This is very serious.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why more consideration is not being given to informing everyone of their entitlements and giving equal treatment to those who are claiming through solicitors.  It is embarrassing for the Department and it must be embarrassing for the Minister and his Ministers of State also.  It is certainly embarrassing for me as a public representative when people who make representations to the Department get priority treatment I do not seem to be getting.  I see this happening also to many others, including yourself, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. I do not understand why the Department is not prepared to publicise the true situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given replies in the other House explaining the ongoing situation. He gave the impression that if a person was due arrears, they would not have to apply through a solicitor.  I have letters from and have had discussions with officials which indicate that people who apply through a solicitor are getting priority.  In many of these cases the arrears have already been settled.  Unfortunately the Department is not prepared to disclose what a person is entitled to.  I have informed departmental officials of the situation so I know the Minister is aware that the amount of money is being paid to the solicitor who makes the claim on behalf of a client.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Falsely or otherwise, people say they do not know what are their entitlements. In a situation like that, aggravation can be created between two people &mdash; the person who is paid the amount due and the person who is still waiting to be paid. Where is the equality when people on behalf of whom I have made representations are not getting the same amount as the person who uses a solicitor?  EC equality regulations are costing this country an extra £250 million and £300 million, and the way things are going, it will cost much more.  I would venture to say <Col N="773" /> that this particular section is costing the Department a lot more than we realise because claims are being made by solicitors. I am not saying they should not be making the claims.  However, if the legislation allows it and they are entitled to these arrears, then everyone is entitled to the same amount.</P>
    <P>The equal treatment arrears provisions must be a major embarrassment to the Department.  People have told me that if claims are made through a solicitor a settlement will be reached, although they do not provide details of such settlements because of the confidentiality aspect between solicitors and the clients.  This leaves the general public with a bad impression.  We have a duty as public representatives to make out views known in the press and to the Minister, Deputy Woods, who has demonstrated his concern about this issue.  He is on top of his job and I cannot understand why this practice continues.</P>
    <P>In the Cork region there have already been 900 arrears claims but no disclosures will be made until all 900 have been settled. Many of the claims have been settled and people say they got £7,000 or £9,000.  Yet, when I make representations I am told the amount due is around £342.  However, if the applicants go to a solicitor they get from £7,000 to £9,000.  I cannot let that lie, and I ask the Minister, if possible, to disclose in the press what people are entitled to.  If a claim has already been made and the Department has already admitted legally that this person is entitled to that amount, so be it.  I know this is going to cost a lot more money and that it cannot be paid at once, but the way things are going I think the Department will have to pay something in the region of £1 billion.  The £250 million or £300 million we mentioned in 1985-86 when the agreement was made will not be enough.</P>
    <P>I could not believe the reply I got from the Department saying it was not prepared to disclose to me exactly how much a person was entitled to but that if she applied legally it could say the arrears would be settled and she would receive a <Col N="774" /> substantial extra amount.  I think that is despicable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to explain this as clearly as I can.</P>
      <P>In accordance with EC Directive 79/7, equal treatment between men and women in social welfare matters was due to come into effect from December 1984. Implementation of the directive was delayed by the Government in office at that time until 1986 when the necessary measures were introduced in two phases. In May 1986 the reduced rates of certain benefits paid to married women were replaced by the standard rates, and the maximum duration of unemployment benefit payable to married women was increased from 12 to 15 months.  In November 1986, new dependency arrangements were introduced and married women became entitled to unemployment assistance on the same basis as claimants generally.</P>
      <P>Arising from the delay in implementing the directive, court proceedings were initiated by a number of married women seeking retrospective payments in respect of the period of delay.  These proceedings raised a number of complex legal issues and the Irish courts found it necessary to make three separate references for preliminary rulings to the European Court of Justice.  Having considered the necessary decisions of the European Court, the Government decided in the context of the 1992 budget to introduce retrospective legislation providing for equality of treatment in respect of the period of delay.</P>
      <P>The necessary provisions are contained in the European Communities (Social Welfare) Regulations, 1992.  These regulations entitle married women affected by the delay to the higher personal rate of benefits and the extended duration of unemployment benefit.  They also entitle married women to dependency increases in the form of a household supplement and to unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a 23 month delay in implementing the directive so it is inevitable that there will be differences in the <Col N="775" /> amounts payable to different claimants. The amounts payable to individual claimants depend on the type of benefit involved, the duration of the claim and the number of dependants, if any, in respect of which increases are claimed. Higher amounts are payable where the claimant was unemployed during the period of the delay and qualifies for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>A woman without any dependants who received disability benefit for the full period of delay will receive about £340 arrears, whereas a woman with two children who was receiving invalidity pension for the same period will receive in the region of £1,000.  A woman with three children who received unemployment benefit for 12 months and qualifies for unemployment assistance for a further six months would receive about £3,000 exclusive of any pay-related benefit which may also be payable.</P>
    <P>Court proceedings were initiated before the implementation of the retrospective legislation, in some cases, as far back as 1985.  As my Department has already made known, settlements were made in such cases in the absence of implementing measures.  As the Senator is aware, this whole area is still the subject of court proceedings despite the implementation of retrospective legislation providing for equality of treatment in respect of the period of delay.  By any objective criteria, the provisions for paying arrears have to be regarded as being fair and equitable to all concerned. Essentially, the regulations entitle married women to the amounts which they would otherwise have received if the directive had been implemented on time.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable publicity in recent months encouraging women to take proceedings on the basis that they would secure additional amounts in excess of their entitlements under the <Col N="776" /> regulations.  My Department has repeatedly made known that that is not the case.  In response to such comments, a press statement issued by my Department on April last said:</P>
    <P>The Department is accountable to the taxpayer and would be duty bound to counter, through the Courts if necessary, any claims which are outside the statutory criteria.</P>
    <P>Following the extensive efforts made by my Department to identify all potential beneficiaries, about 85,000 claims have been received under the retrospective legislation.  These claims are being processed at present and payments are being made to the married women as of right. Amounts due are being paid on a phased basis over the period 1992 to 1994, at a total cost of £57.5 million which is being met by the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a person who has made representations to a Member of the Oireachtas or other public representative is not getting the same consideration as the person who has made representations through a legal representative?</P>

      <P>If the Senator is referring to cases prior to the introduction of the statutory regulation, that is a separate issue.  I tried to make that clear in my reply.  What the Senator described should not happen and if he knows of such a case I would be glad if he would bring it to my attention.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 8 July 1993.</P>
