      <P>I have notice from Senator Cotter that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to make a statement on the imminent closure of the Container and Pressure Vessels Limited Plant in Clones, County Monaghan.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Fahey of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide, as a matter of urgency, the capital required to complete the reconstruction of the national primary route N18 at Ardrahan village, County Galway.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to include in its regulation on health and safety in the Army, the regulation agreed between PDFORRA and the Health and Safety Authority in place of the wording included by the Minister which is <Col N="1026" /> totally unacceptable to Army representatives.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator McDonagh of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide traffic lights for the village of Turloughmore as requested by Galway County Council in 1993.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Cotter and Fahey as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Neville may give notice on another day of the matters he wishes to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have had to rule the matter raised by Senator McDonagh as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.  It is a matter for the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is item 1 until 5.30 p.m., item 21 from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and item 1 again from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m.  It is hoped Second Stage of the Finance Bill will be taken today by agreement within those times. I suggest each spokesperson take 40 minutes and other Senators 20 minutes. There will be a sos between 5.30 p.m. and 6 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned those arrangements are acceptable.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I draw the attention of the House to the publication today of the report of the Opsahl Commission on Northern Ireland, one of the most comprehensive studies and assessments on Northern Ireland and possible ways forward there since the New Ireland Forum and the Anglo Irish agreement.  I ask the Leader of the House to make time available before the end of the session to discuss Northern Ireland, perhaps in the context of that report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning's remarks on the Opsahl Commission. I am probably the only Senator in this House to have made a presentation to the Commission and I would welcome a debate on the outcome of its deliberations.</P>
      <P>Over the last number of weeks I have continuously raised the issue of accommodation for the University Senator's group.  There has been much frustration over that period and I was upset we had to interrupt the Order of Business and the working of the House on a number of occasions last week.  We do not wish this to continue and we understand that measures are being taken today to resolve this matter.  I recognise the support and commitment people have given on the matter.  I hope it is resolved soon and that it will not be necessary to raise it again on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Order of Business as proposed.  However, while I accept it is reasonable to regulate the time of speeches, the imposition of a measure like the guillotine at 11 p.m. is a matter I ask the Leader to consider.  If there are speakers still offering at 11 p.m. I suggest the debate should continue, especially in view of the fact that the legislation runs to 170 pages, is complex and there may well be many Senators wishing to contribute.</P>
      <P>Regarding item 4, Statements on Structural Funds on the Order Paper, within recent days a report from the Economic and Social Research Institute has been widely circulated among media commentators.  If this matter is to be properly debated in this House I ask the Leader of the House to ensure the report be made available to the Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to allow time to debate item 22 which is on the issue of attacks on tourists in Dublin which is creating much concern. There was another attack yesterday and it is important for the Minister for Justice to have the opportunity to discuss the issue in this House.  There should be <Col N="1028" /> an urgent debate on the issue to allay public concern and to ensure that Irish tourism is not damaged internationally by the recent spate of attacks against tourists in the capital city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to make provision for a debate on drug seizures in the Cork region, which is an ever increasing problem.  This is of national as well as of local interest.  Such seizures may tarnish our reputation abroad if we are not seen to be patrolling our coast to prevent drugs being smuggled into the country.  I know this is not relevant to the Order of Business but it is relevant to the young people on our streets who are using these substances.  I would appreciate if we could debate this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague, Senator O'Toole, I am glad that progress is being made on the question of accommodation. I want to pay tribute to the interest that you, a Chathaoirligh, have taken in this matter.  Also this morning the Leader of the House, Senator Wright, took the trouble to personally inspect the accommodation in the &ldquo;dungeons&rdquo; of Kildare House.  We appreciate very much this direct personal interest in the welfare and working conditions of colleagues.</P>
      <P>I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business.  This is not intended to be in any way hostile to the Government but to draw attention to a very important matter.  I propose that we take item 24 before item 21 &mdash; a motion in the names of Senators O'Toole, Lee, Henry and myself about the situation in East Timor.  I am pressing this matter today because this morning the Indonesian Ambassador presented his credentials to Her Excellency, President Robinson. Indonesia is guilty of genocide.  There is an illegal occupation of East Timor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way I could get this motion on to the Order Paper was <Col N="1029" /> by removing controversial words, such as &ldquo;genocide&rdquo;.  I would like to have &ldquo;genocide&rdquo; included&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make the point of order?  I believe there is a difference between controversial elements and argumentative items on the Order of Business.  I do not believe there is any argument internationally about the genocide that is taking place in Indonesia.  I move this amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the Foyle Fisheries Commission?  The commission is administered jointly by the authorities in this State and Northern Ireland.  It is very important that we examine how successfully it is working.  Such an examination may provide a model other bodies could adopt.  Only good could come from such a debate and I ask the Leader to arrange one in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning requested the Leader to find time for the House to debate the report of the Opsahl Commission.  I have already spoken to the Leader on this matter and he has promised to do what he can to facilitate such a debate.  I made a submission to the commission and read its report which offers a number of options regarding the problem of Northern Ireland.  I support Senator Manning's request that we discuss the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Norris's motion.  The small island of East Timor, because of its wealth of natural resources, <Col N="1030" /> has had the misfortune to fall victim to the territorial claims of its neighbours.</P>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Leader for their interest in our accommodation. However there are fresh disasters to report.  The fire regulations should be seriously examined.  A new safety door has been installed in the basement which can only be opened automatically. While I am a great believer in new technology, I would like to be assured that if a fire starts we will be able to leave the building.  Apparently the door can only be opened by some great person on high.  Since I moved into an office in the basement, there has not been a fire drill.  This means that in the event of a fire, I will not know in which direction to go because the windows cannot be opened.  I would be grateful if this could be taken into consideration when the accommodation problem is being examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request by Senator Kelleher that the House debate the recent drug seizure in west Cork.  This debate could be broadened so that the Minister for Defence could tell us if extra resources could be provided for the Naval Service to intercept ships and yachts which are bringing drugs into Ireland.  I call on the Leader to make time available for this debate as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the balance in broadcasting Oireachtas debates. Last Thursday, when we debated the Criminal Law (Suicide) (No. 2) Bill, 1993, not one Fianna Fáil Senator who contributed to the debate was shown on the televised broadcast.  Does one have to contribute each day or be controversial to be shown on such programmes?  Would it be possible for such programmes to list those who contributed if it is not possible to show all the speakers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Senator Kelleher's request for an urgent debate on the problem of drugs in the Republic.  I wish to remind the Leader that I requested on two previous occasions that such a debate take place; he has given a commitment that this will happen before the summer recess.  This is a matter of urgency and is probably not unconnected to Senator Neville's motion on the Order Paper.  The crime rate in the Republic is not unconnected with the drug problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Neville. There is need for discussion on the problem of crime, particularly in our capital city.  I would like the Leader to inform us when we can have this discussion.  We are taking this problem very lightly.  The problem of crime, particularly in our capital, is being mentioned all the time; it was spoken about on radio today.  I think we should discuss this matter with the Minister urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Kelleher and the other Senators who spoke about the drug problem, drug seizures and the opportunity that seems to be presented to criminals to use Ireland as a corridor.  I would like the House to be given an opportunity to debate this problem with the hope of having it resolved, possibly with EC support.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader, as I have asked him in the past, to consider providing time for a debate on State-sponsored bodies. We could discuss recent decisions Bord na Móna have taken which can put the peat industry in the midlands in jeopardy. I have been told that one fire station in the midlands has only enough peat to last until July.  These are appalling decisions and are not in the national interest.  This House should certainly be given an opportunity to debate a matter of such public concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the suggestion of Senator Manning and Senator Wilson, last week I gave Senator Wilson a commitment that we would debate the Opsahl report, hopefully before the <Col N="1032" /> summer recess.  I repeat this commitment today and hope that, with the agreement of the Whips and the Minister, such a debate would be arranged.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure Senator Dardis that there will be no guillotine on the Finance Bill today but it is hoped that by 11 p.m. everybody will have had an opportunity to contribute to the debate.  It is hoped that we will return to the issue of Structual Funds next week.  The Minister, having listened to contributions last week, was very keen to return to the House to listen to more contributions.  I have no control over reports but will pass on the Senator's comments.</P>
      <P>Private Members' time would be an ideal opportunity to raise that issue. Senator Kelleher, Senator Crowley, Senator McGennis and Senator Finneran mentioned the problem of drugs in our society.  Senator McGennis referred to this issue during the last couple of months and I gave a commitment that, subject to agreement by the Whips, we would debate this issue before the summer recess.  Items 24 tabled by Senaor Norris and Senator Henry is suitable for Private Members' Business.  The Whips will consider the Foyle fisheries issue raised by Senator McGowan.</P>
      <P>The Kilkenny incest report, raised by Senator Honan, will be debated as soon as I can arrange a time when the Minister is available.  He wants to come to the House and I hope this will take place in the next couple of weeks.  We will be sitting three days a week during the next few weeks.  Therefore, I am sure we will have an opportunity to deal with this issue.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Ormonde's point about RTE, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has been concerned about the coverage given to the Seanad. Senator Ormonde's good suggestion, that if a Senator is not given visual coverage a list should be made of those who contributed to a specific debate, should be implemented.  Senator Finneran mentioned the possibility of a debate on State-sponsored bodies.  This will be agreed by the Whips between now and the summer recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the Order of Business, but I want to address a comment to the Leader of the House. I know he intended to be helpful by suggesting that the matter be taken in Private Members' time.  However, it is a matter which Members on all sides of the House would like to discuss.  Perhaps the Government could think about having a debate outside Private Members' time. In the meantime, I am happy to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1993    [Certified Money Bill]:    Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Finance Bill underpins the Government's priority objective &mdash; to maximise, on a sustainable basis, the job potential of our economy &mdash; in two respects.  First, it confirms the revenue dimension of the strategy of fiscal responsibility at the heart of the budget I introduced on 24 February last.  Secondly, it provides for a number of important new initiatives aimed at encouraging, on a focused and target basis, investment in Irish business and industry.</P>
      <P>My primary and overriding purpose in the budget was to secure financial stability in difficult circumstances, thereby clearly signalling the new Government's commitment to sound economic and budgetary management. This was of particular importance in the aftermath of the period of unprecedented turbulence in financial markets which was set in train by Sterling's steep decline last September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall financial stability is an essential <Col N="1034" /> condition for business development, sound economic growth and job creation. The responsible fiscal stance adopted in the budget is of far more value to employment prospects than any specific measure that might have been in the budget or in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This was a budget which confirmed and consolidated the progress made in our public finances in recent years.  By so doing, it contributed in no small way to the major improvement in interest rates and the financial markets in recent weeks.  It provided for a major boost in investment in the economic infrastructure of this country, and can combine, with moderation in incomes, to enable this country to continue to surpass the employment performance of our EC partners.</P>
    <P>The budgetary strategy went far beyond simply preserving the economic fundamentals necessary for growth in output and employment, vital though these are.  Apart from the major investment boost to which I referred, it had at the top of the agenda the fostering of private enterprise and initiative, and the improvement of the availability of equity finance to Irish business, in order that job creation would not be inhibited by lack of funds.</P>
    <P>Certain increases in taxation were proposed in my budget, both in the interests of responsible overall balance and to make possible other desirable reliefs.  It is understandable that the increases should evoke protest from those affected. However, I challenge those critics who argue that I should now reverse those measures en bloc to spell out unequivocally what they think I should do instead.  This means one of three things: to throw budgetary discipline to the winds and thus put at risk the welcome downward trend of interest rates; cut out or curtail public expenditure programmes to match, or raise the revenues lost in other ways, that is, to increase taxation under different heads or on different activities.</P>
    <P>It is too easy to selectively fault limited elements of any budget, it is a different matter to put together and develop a <Col N="1035" /> balanced overall budget, which is what I presented on 24 February.</P>
    <P>I reject emphatically the suggestion that this year's budget and Finance Bill represented a setback for tax reform, and that the measures adopted are in conflict with the recommendations of the Culliton report.  Those who would have us believe that tax reforn means lower taxation are not being honest; lower taxation must be earned by controlling public expenditure and, most of all, by relieving the pressure from debt service costs.</P>
    <P>Real reform involves reshaping the system so that the necessary revenues are obtained in a way that is more in tune with our economic and employment needs.  This is the course which has been followed over the past five or six years, in particular in the 1992 budget and Finance Bill, and which has brought about a better tax structure all round.  Despite the difficult circumstances of the 1993 budget, for reasons that largely lay outside this economy, I was able to consolidate that progress.  Indeed, it was only through broadening the tax base, in such respects as the introduction of probate tax, taxation of certain welfare benefits and extending the coverage of the VAT standard rate, that it was possible to afford the general income tax improvements in the budget.</P>
    <P>I also reject emphatically that the new incentive measures in this year's Bill represent a u-turn <i>vis-á-vis</i> last year's approach.  Those critics need to appreciate that there is a basic difference between providing the type of limited and well-focused incentives I have introduced on this occasion and the withdrawal of measures which, whatever good intentions lay behind them on their introduction, had been taken for a ride by the tax planners to such an extent that they serve little purpose other than to allow the well-advised few to have tax efficient remuneration at the expense of the many.</P>
    <P>I would like to issue a warning to those who might be inclined to see these new incentives principally as such an opportunity. I will keep the operation of these new measures under close scrutiny.  If it <Col N="1036" /> emerges that they are being subverted from their central purpose, I will not hesitiate to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that the focus on the key objective, to stimulate bona fide enterprise and promote job creation, is preserved.</P>
    <P>The availability to Irish industry of adequate equity finance, especially for start up and development, has become of increasing concern over the last few years and this is a particular focus in this Bill. It contains a package of measures to assist the capitalisation of businesses and the funding of new business start-ups.</P>
    <P>Each proposal is targeted on particular classes of investor and type of investment so that the overall package is designed to meet the various different needs of the economy.</P>
    <P>The main features of this package are: the BES extension already announced in the budget, with abolition of the lifetime cap and an increased company limit: the legislation for special investment accounts giving 10 per cent tax treatment to a range of investment media having a strong orientation to Irish equities; a new seed capital scheme; relief for additional own capital investment by original entrepreneurs; the encompassing within the BES of research and development activities; extensions to capital gains tax roll over relief for entrepreneurs; enhanced incentives for employee investments; a new initiative aimed at increasing pension fund investment in small and medium-sized companies needing venture and development funds.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a number of other measures which will assist various sectors in contributing to the Government's overriding objective of improving employment, for instance: a rationalisation of the tax treatment of &ldquo;scrip dividends&rdquo; issued by quoted companies, making them more attractive to certain investors, and so assisting businesses wishing to retain profits to increase their capital base; new arrangements allowing businesss which supply inputs to exporting companies to avail of VAT zerorating, thus putting them in a position equivalent to that of suppliers from other <Col N="1037" /> EC member states under the Single Market regime; in the interests of tourism, further measures to help improve the availability of hire cars; in the construction area, an extension of the foundation-laying deadline for the urban renewal scheme &mdash; as was announced in the budget &mdash; and a new provision for a reduction in the claw-back period for capital allowances for commercial buildings: in respect of the film industry, a new scheme for individuals investing in film productions, an increase in the amount of tax-relieved investment permitted for corporate investors and changes to facilitate the making of films under co-production agreements with other countries; a new scheme of stock relief for farmers to assist herd expansion or diversification of farm enterprises, together with the abolition of the clawback provisions of the scheme; the removal of stamp duty on corporate bonds, which will assist stability in the financial market to the benefit of both corporate borrowers and mortgage holders.</P>
    <P>In my explanation of the detailed provisions in the Bill, instead of proceedings seriatim, I intend to start with the sections relating to the employment package.  This Bill contains other measures which will be of value to businesses and thus indirectly assist in the preservation and creation of jobs.  These are dealt with under the relevant headings.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains the legislative provisions for two initiatives already announced and which I have already mentioned.  Section 25 provides for the renewal of the BES for a further three years, together with the removal for the previous lifetime cap for investors thereby giving access to a wider pool of savings.</P>
    <P>Chapter IV introduces from 1 February 1993, special investment accounts, the returns on which are liable to tax at 10 per cent.  These accounts can be offered by life assurance companies, unit trusts and stockbrokers.  There is a requirement that a minimum percentage of the funds in these accounts be invested in Irish equities, 40 per cent in 1993 rising <Col N="1038" /> to 55 per cent in 1996, and a further requirement that a minimum percentage is invested in companies whose capitalisation is less than £100 million &mdash; 6 per cent in 1993, rising to 15 per cent in 1996.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the BES and special investment accounts, which cater for specific segments of the market, have the potential to make a significant contribution to improving the availability of equity funds to Irish business over the next few years, given normal conditions on investment markets.  Notwithstanding these provisions and the improvement in the general climate for equity investment in recent months, the Finance Bill also contains a number of further specific measures to help to encourage investment in those areas of the economy which are of vital importance to self-sustaining jobs growth.</P>
    <P>Section 25 also introduces a new seed capital scheme which is designed to provide an incentive to employees who propose to move from safe employment to start their own business.  The scheme will work by allowing the entrepreneur to claim a refund of tax paid on previous income in respect of his or her investment in a new company.  When the Finance Bill was published it provided for relief on investments on a retrospective basis against the income of the preceding three years, up to a maximum of £25,000 income relief per year.  However, following representations which showed that this could render the scheme ineffective for those who had a period of unemployment in the last three years, I amended the scheme in select committee to allow the relief for any three of the previous five years.  Thus, the scheme will in practice allow immediate relief on investments of up to £75,000.</P>
    <P>The scheme will be of advantage not only to those currently in employment, but also to the unemployed, including persons made redundant.  It will be of particular relevance to those with taxable redundancy lump sums.  The main conditions of the scheme can be summarised as follows: (a) relief will be given in respect of investments in new companies <Col N="1039" /> engaged in manufacturing and certain service trades.  To ensure that the relief is directed at areas where there is real potential to create additional employment, project approval from either the IDA or Bord Fáilte will have to be obtained to benefit from the relief, (b) the investor must take up employment with the company in which he or she is investing and remain employed by it for a period of 12 months, (c) the investor must hold at least 15 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital in the company for a minimum period of two years, (d) the investor must now own either directly or indirectly more than 15 per cent of the shares in another company for a period of 12 months prior to the new employment.</P>
    <P>To provide a further boost to investment and employment, section 25 also provides for an increase in the BES company limit from £0.5 million to £1 million with respect to shares issued on or after 6 May 1993.</P>
    <P>The BES currently excludes from relief anyone who owns more than 30 per cent of the company in which they are making an investment. To encourage additional investment by entrepreneurs in their own smaller or start-up early stage companies, the section further provides for this restriction to be lifted where the total capital of the company does not exceed £150,000.  The section also provides that expenditure on research and development related to certain BES activities can qualify for BES relief in its own right.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some commentators consider that these incentives should extend to a wider range of economic sectors, notably to the general area of services.  While I concur with the view that the services sector has the potential to make a major contribution to meeting our employment needs, I have also to take into account the reality that the demand for domestically oriented services is, at the end of the day, constrained by the general level of domestic demand. It would make little sense, therefore, to offer the same range of incentives to new businesses in this area when the main effect would be the displacement of jobs <Col N="1040" /> in existing firms, or indeed in the firms themselves.  Not only would this be an ineffective and wasteful use of public resources, it would be unfair to businesses which have been built up without such assistance to have them contribute through their tax contributions to the subvention of their competitors.  It is the substantially lower risk of displacement in the exposed sectors that, in the final analysis, justifies the provision of special incentives.</P>
    <P>Section 27 introduces a radical extension of the roll-over relief for capital gains tax in the interests of facilitating successful entrepreneurs wishing to embark on new ventures with the potential for self-sustaining job creation.</P>
    <P>At present, such roll-over relief is available to a trader who sells physical assets and then reinvests the proceeds in other assets of that trade or another. Section 27 extends the roll-over relief to situations where an entrepreneur disposes of shares in a company and reinvests them, on a similar basis, in an unquoted company in manufacturing or certain exposed parts of the services sector i.e. sectors falling within the scope of the BES.  For the purposes of this provision, the entrepreneur must be a person holding at least 15 per cent of the shareholding in an unquoted trading company who has been engaged full time in that company.  The effect of the provision will be to defer the capital gains tax charge that would otherwise arise until such time as the entrepreneur leaves the new company.  The purpose of the provision is to facilitate entrepreneurs who wish to reinvest the proceeds of the sale of their stake in an existing company in starting up a new company in these sectors.</P>
    <P>Income tax relief is currently allowed for an employee who invests up to £750 in new ordinary shares in his or her employing company.  The limit for this investment is being increased four-fold, to £3,000.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will recall that in my budget speech, I indicated that I would be entering into discussions with representatives of the Irish pension funds <Col N="1041" /> with a view to their making, through their investment activities, a greater contribution to the development of the economy and to job creation.</P>
    <P>I indicated to the Irish Association of Pension Funds during these discussions that what the Government have in mind in this initiative is greater involvement in the provision of development and venture capital, an area which is not well served by institutional investors.</P>
    <P>I am happy to report that I have been assured by the association that it fully supports the principle underlying my initiative.  The discussions with the association revealed not only the limited expertise and experience among pension fund trustees and their investment managers in this area but also the mixed performance of such investments. Accordingly, it has been agreed, in the interests of redressing this difficulty, that a detailed study of the venture capital field will be carried out within a short time frame.  The study will also look at other opportunities for pension fund investment that would benefit the economy. Terms of reference for the study are at this moment nearing finalisation and the study should get underway shortly.</P>
    <P>Based on my discussions to date with the industry the Government proposes that the pension funds will work towards a target investment of £100 million in venture or development capital, subject to the outcome of the study and to sufficient suitable projects being brought forward.  This increased investment will be pursued on a phased basis over a period of five years.  It is my intention that pension funds will achieve an investment level of £15 million in this area by mid-1994, also subject to the same provisos.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the initiative will redress some of the structural problems which are an impediment to investment in this field so that it will provide a worthwhile avenue of investment for pension funds, help to address the funding problems of developing indigenous business and thereby promote employment prospects in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the area of corporation <Col N="1042" /> tax.  Section 34 deals with the treatment of grants for the purposes of capital allowances.  Since 1986 the general position has been that any State grants in respect of capital assets are deducted from the expenditure on those assets for the purposes of determining the associated capital allowances.  This covers both grants paid directly from State funds or from the funds of any board established by statute or any public or local authority as well as grants paid from an outside agency such as the EC but routed through a Government Department, statutory body, or public or local authority.</P>
    <P>The section clarifies and extends the existing legislation to ensure that the capital allowance entitlement is restricted to the net of grant expenditure no matter how or by whom the grant aid is made.  I point out it is not proposed to alter section 25 of the Finance Act, 1987, which specificaly exempts companies in the food processing sector which purchase their own plant and machinery from the net of grant approach to the calculation of capital allowances.</P>
    <P>Section 36 deals with the taxation of scrip dividends in the case of quoted companies.  A scrip dividend is the issue by the company to the shareholder of additional shares instead of the normal cash dividend.  Scrip share issues enable a company to increase its equity while avoiding transaction costs normally associated with share issues.  Under existing legislation, for historical anti-avoidance reasons, scrip dividends are taxed more severely than cash dividends.  The section changes the existing taxation treatment and taxes scrip dividends with reference to the reality of the situation. Thus instead of existing income tax charge on the shareholder on the receipt of scrip dividends, the shareholder will now be regarded as having received an asset for tax purposes.  This means he or she will be taxed under the capital gains tax code if he or she later sells these shares.  The abolition of the income tax charge will act as an incentive for individual and corporate shareholders to take up the scrip dividends instead of cash dividends.  This will benefit the company <Col N="1043" /> issuing the dividends since it will mean an increase in its share capital and allow it to retain a greater amount of profits.</P>
    <P>Section 37 gives tax exempt status to employment grants paid by Údarás na Gaeltachta under its schemes of employment grants to international service industries and small manufacturing companies. The section also affords tax exempt status to grants paid by the IDA under its scheme of employment grants to small industrial undertakings.  IDA employment grants to international service industries are already exempt from tax.</P>
    <P>Section 38 gives a tax exemption in regard to payments from the market development fund and the employment subsidy scheme in the hand of the recipients. While both of these schemes have now terminated, the exemption will have retrospective effect to the commencement dates.</P>
    <P>Sections 39 to 41 implement my budget announcement that the payment date for corporation tax would be aligned with that for advance corporation tax, the change to take effect in respect of all accounting periods ending on or after 1 May 1993.  In practice, a substantial amount of corporation tax is paid after banking hours on the latest day for payment of the tax and at the end of the year this can mean that payments may not actually be lodged to the benefit of the Exchequer until the following year.  In order to safeguard the £37 million yield n 1993 from this budget measure, it is now being provided that where the payment date for corporation tax and advance corporation tax for an accounting period falls after the 28th day of the month concerned, the tax should be paid not later than the 28th day of that month.</P>
    <P>Sections 42 and 43 provide for the bringing of the Trustee Savings Bank into the corporation tax net for the first time.  The Trustee Savings Bank will be taxed at the standard rate of 40 per cent on an increasing level of its trading income over four years, such that by year four it will be paying the standard 40 per cent corporation tax rate on 100 per cent <Col N="1044" /> of its trading income.  As the Trustee Savings Bank is in competition with all the other licensed banks in the State, the imposition of corporation tax puts it on the same footing as its competitors.</P>
    <P>Section 44 makes a number of changes to section 39 of the Finance Act, 1980 which defines goods for manufacturing relief purposes.  Paragraph (a) ensures the general exclusion from the scope of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax of goods sold to the intervention agency does not apply in the case of subcontracted deboning services carried out by a meat processing company for the agency.  To allow the present legislative position to remain would put at risk the commercial viability of these beef deboning services which are bona fide manufacturing process and are of considerable importance in generating added value and employment in the meat processing industry.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) amends the legislation introduced last year allowing certain coops to qualify for the 10 per cent rate in order to deal with certain problems that have arisen.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) provides that income from the production of a newspaper which is published at least fortnightly for sale to the public qualifies for manufacturing relief.  This will apply irrespective of whether the income arises from the sale of newspapers or from an advertising service provided in the course of the production of a newspaper and whether the company producing the newspaper actually prints it.  This change in the tax treatment of newspapers reflects a review of the position by the Government following representations made in the wake of provisions included in the Finance Act, 1992 which specifically disqualified income from advertising services provided by a newspaper from the 10 per cent tax rate.</P>
    <P>Sections 45 to 47 make a number of amendments to section 84 (a) of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976.  Section 45 (a) provides that where, on or after 6 May 1993 the repayment period of a section 84 loan is extended, the lender is to be regarded as having received repayment <Col N="1045" /> of the loan and as having advanced a new loan which will not qualify as a section 84 loan.  This ensures against such loans being extended beyond the original termination date.</P>
    <P>Section 45 (b) changes the section 84 rules to allow a company connected with an IFSC company to obtain a section 84 loan where such a loan is included on an approved IDA list.  This will ensure that a project which was intended to have access to such loan facilities is not deprived of that simply on account of being associated with a company in the IFSC.</P>
    <P>Section 46 alleviates a problem experienced by loss making companies whose activities are financed in part by section 84 loans.  These difficulties are likely to arise in the early years of a company's trade when substantial start-up losses can be incurred.  Under existing legislation, if a loss-making manufacturing company pays interest on a section 84 loan the company may be liable to pay advance corporation tax six times greater than if it were in a profit-making situation but will be unable to offset the advance corporation tax against its mainstream tax because it has no mainstream tax liability due to losses.  Section 46 provides relief for companies in those circumstances by ensuring that their advance corporation tax liability will be one-eighteenth of the interest paid.  This is the same rate that would apply if the company had income from its manufacturing activities.</P>
    <P>Section 47 provides that the currency exchange gains on high-coupon section 84 loans are to be treated as income from the sale of manufactured goods, thus making them taxable at the special 10 per cent tax rate.  The provision will have retrospective effect to when the gains on such loans first arose.  These particular loans are section 84 loans in a high interest rate foreign currency where the borrower obtains a capital gain through foreign exchange transactions and offsets this gain against his or her interest cost, thereby achieving a very low net interest rate on the loan.  The Government approved in 1990-91 the issuing of such loans in the case of two lists of loans for <Col N="1046" /> specified IDA projects and this change in the law is necessary to ensure that these borrowers obtain the desired low interest rate.  If the gains were taxed at 40 per cent or higher as non-trading income, or under the capital gains tax code, this would considerably increase the cost to the borrower.  Since other high-coupon loans which are not on these IDA lists could also have been used for projects involving increased employment, it is also proposed to apply the 10 per cent trading income treatment to all high-coupon loans.</P>
    <P>Section 51 provides for tax relief for donations made by companies to First Step Limited, a company established for the purposes of assisting job creation by supporting enterprise in areas of high unemployment.  Donations between £500 and £100,000 made by a company in an accounting period from 1 June 1993 to 31 May 1995 will qualify for relief subject to an upper limit of £1.5 million on donations received in each of the years ending on 31 May 1994 and 31 May 1995.</P>
    <P>Like the Enterprise Trust, which can also avail of tax relieved corporate donations, First Step is attempting to harness financial support from the business community towards addressing the problem of unemployment through encouraging and supporting business start-ups in disadvantaged areas.  The company has been operating since 1990 and has a proven track record in the area of seed capital.  Just as important, it provides management expertise to projects and assists in opening up marketing outlets for them.  Section 51 will facilitate the company in attracting funds to allow it to expand its operations.</P>
    <P>I now turn to personal income tax, which is dealt with mainly in Chapter I. Income tax reform has made significant progress during the currency of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  The standard rate was cut from 35 per cent to 27 per cent and the higher rates consolidated into a single 48 per cent top rate.  In addition, the tax base was broadened so as to make the system more equitable and more consistent with <Col N="1047" /> the economy's needs and, of course, to provide funding for the tax improvements. Significant improvement was also made in the exemption limits and the standard band was widened.  Further such improvement is contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 to 3 provide for the implementation of the income tax reliefs announced in the budget, which will cost an estimated £37.6 million in 1993.  The main personal allowances are raised and the standard band is widened.  There are also increases in the general and age exemption limits and in the child addition to those limits, which will benefit many low paid persons, especially those with families.  Overall, the changes will remove an estimated 13,500 taxpayers from the tax net and bring a further 18,000 taxpayers from the higher marginal rate to the standard rate.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for an increase in the interest ceiling for mortgage interest relief from £2,000 single/£4,000 married to £2,500 single /£5,000 married.  In recognition of the higher mortgage rates that prevailed over the period since last autumn, it also provides, as an exceptional temporary measure for 1993-94 only, for an increase from 80 per cent to 90 per cent in the percentage of interest qualifying for relief.  In addition, to assist first time purchasers, the percentage of interest allowable is increased to 100 per cent for the first three years in which they claim mortgage interest relief, subject to the general interest ceilings.  To help offset to some degree the cost of this overall package of improvements, a <i>de minimis</i> exclusion for mortgage interest relief is introduced.  This will disqualify for the purpose of relief the first £100 single/£200 married of interest currently allowable.  The estimate net cost of the package at the time of the budget was about £17.5 million in 1993.  Due to favourable developments in interest rates, it is now estimated that it will cost £15 million.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in a press release on 26 November last, the Bill &mdash; in section 7 &mdash; provides for the taxation of severance payments to outgoing Members of the <Col N="1048" /> Oireachtas and former holders of ministerial parliamentary offices from the commencement of the new payments.  In addition, the legislation makes severance payments to certain public servants subject to the same tax treatment as applies to similar payments in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Section 8 increases the exemptions from tax in respect of non-statutory redundancy payments.  Currently, the first £6,000 of any such payment is exempt from tax.  In respect of an employee's first redundancy, this £6,000 may be increased by up to £4,000 in certain circumstances.  As an alternative to the £6,000, or the £6,000 as increased, the taxpayer may, where it is more beneficial to him, claim an amount known as the SCSB &mdash; the standard capital superannuation benefit.  Briefly, the SCSB is one-twentieth of the average salary &mdash; over the last three years of service &mdash; for each year of service, less any pension lump sum entitlement.  Section 8 increases the basic exemption of £6,000 by £500 for each year of service in the employment in respect of which the redundancy payment is made.  This £500 replaces the £250 which I announced when the Bill was published.  In addition, the value of the SCSB is being increased by exempting one-fifteenth of salary per year of service rather than one-twentieth as heretofore.  I intend that the change will be effective from 6 May, the date of publication of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 29 extends tax relief for heritage gardens.  Up to now tax relief has been available in respect of the cost of the maintenance, restoration, etc., of significant buildings and of gardens attached to such buildings.  The Bill provides for the extension of this relief to gardens which are not attached to significant buildings where the gardens are deemed to be of significant horticultural, scientific, historical or aesthetic interest.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the new temporary income levy announced in the budget.  The new levy will apply for the year 1993-94 at a rate of 1 per cent on all income on a similar basis to the existing health and employment and training levies.  The levy is payable by all individuals <Col N="1049" /> over 16 years of age but with a specific income exemption in order to protect the lower paid.  In the case of the self-employed, exemption will apply where income for the year is not greater than £9,000.  In the case of employees, the levy is payable in any week where income is greater than £173.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of the case of seasonal workers, I provided on Report Stage in the Dáil that, where income levy is deducted from the employment earnings of any individual whose total income over the year does not exceed £9,000, that levy will be repaid.  In addition, all medical card holders, including those whose income is above £9,000 per annum, are exempt from the levy.  All social welfare payments are also exempt and such payments will not be taken into account in determining whether an individual qualifies for an income exemption from the levy.  Unlike the existing levies and the income levy which applied in the early 1980s, employers are not liable to pay the new levy in respect of their employees who are medical card holders. In order to ensure that the levy is paid this year by all liable taxpayers, the Bill further provides for an appropriate amendment to the rules governing the payment of preliminary tax by the self-employed.</P>
    <P>As regards the criticisms made of the levy, it is, of course, the case that the Government would have preferred not to have had to introduce the temporary 1 per cent income levy had the quite exceptional budgetary pressures allowed of any realistic alternative.  Taxpayers are being asked to accept this limited sacrifice against the background of the Programme for National Recovery and earlier years of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> which have seen progressive and substantial increases in real take home incomes.  Furthermore, the levy is not a tax on employment, as a number of critics and commentators have said.  The levy will only impact on employment if taxpayers seek to compensate themselves through higher charges and wages rather than accepting that they should make a limited <Col N="1050" /> contribution towards the exceptional unemployment and other costs imposed by the protracted slowdown in the international economy.</P>
    <P>Section 10, which was introduced on Committee Stage of the Bill in the Dáil, makes significant changes to the current tax treatment of married couples.  I am making these changes in response to the concerns expressed by the Commission on the Status of Women and others on the treatment of married women by the tax system.  The changes made in section 10 will ensure greater equality in the tax treatment of married couples.  The section allows all married couples on joint assessment to choose which partner should be the assessable person.  At present, the husband is automatically selected to be the assessable person.  The couple's other options, of separate assessment or separate treatment, will, of course, continue to be available.</P>
    <P>In the case of a couple who marry in the 1993-94 or subsequent tax years, where no option is chosen, joint assessment will apply automatically with the higher earner in the previous year as the assessable person.  This higher earner could, of course, be either the husband or the wife.  For couples who married before 6 April 1993, the husband will continue to be treated as the assessable person, unless an alternative option is chosen.  I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the Revenue Commissioners will be undertaking a publicity campaign to inform couples of the options open to them.</P>
    <P>The section also makes changes in the payment of tax refunds to jointly assessed couples.  At present, refunds in respect of a jointly assessed couple made after the end of the tax year are almost always paid to the assessable person who, at present, is the husband.  The section provides that refunds will be payable to the two spouses in proportion to the tax paid by each spouse.  This means that if a refund is due, and one spouse paid two-thirds of the couples total tax, that spouse will get two-thirds of the refund.  Furthermore, the inspector of taxes will have the power to arrange in individual cases <Col N="1051" /> that, where the refund is clearly due to an overpayment by one spouse, the full refund will be paid to that spouse.</P>
    <P>Chapter IV provides for the new system of taxation of life assurance companies which came into effect from 1 January last.  It also provides for a similar system of taxation for the unit trust industry. The new system will apply to new unit trusts from the passing of the Bill and to existing unit trusts, with a small number of exceptions, from 6 April 1994. The new system of taxation comprises a single 27 per cent annual tax charge on the income and capital gains of the investments payable at the level of the life company or unit trust.  No further tax liability arises when the return is made to the investor.</P>
    <P>Capital gains tax will be charged without indexation or the application of the small gains relief.  Realised gilt gains and both realised and unrealised non-gilt gains will be subject to taxation, the latter on a seven year spreading basis.  The question of applying similar confidentiality rules to unit trusts as currently apply to life assurance companies will be examined by my Department over the coming year.</P>
    <P>The chapter also provides for the taxation of foreign life assurance products sold to Irish investors.  As the returns on the investments made by foreign life companies will not be subject to an annual Irish tax charge, it is necessary for equity reasons to tax the return in the hands of the policyholder.</P>
    <P>Section 28 concerns stock relief for farmers.  The old stock relief scheme which lapsed on 5 April 1993 is not being renewed and is being replaced by a new scheme of relief from 6 April 1993 to 5 April 1995.  Having regard to the changes in the Common Agricultural Policy and to avoid the related difficulties that could arise for farmers with declining stock values, clawback arrangements under the old scheme are being abolished, which should benefit a considerable number of farmers.  The new relief gives an incentive for developing farmers and for farmers diversifying into new areas of agricultural <Col N="1052" /> activity and there are no claw back provisions attached.</P>
    <P>There are five changes to the tax reliefs for the designated areas; three of the changes are designed to assist in the development of these areas while the remainder deal with tax avoidance loopholes.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides that where a life assurance company locates its new business activities in a new or refurbished rented building in a designated area, the seven year spreading of expenses rule for such business will not affect the full immediate availability to the company of the double rent allowance.</P>
    <P>Sections 30, 31 and 32 provide for an extension of the time limits associated with the urban renewal scheme in the general designated areas.  The deadlines for the expiration of the reliefs are being extended by six months to end November 1993 in the case of &ldquo;new build&rdquo; projects, and by two months to 31 July 1994 in the case of the overall deadline for the reliefs.</P>
    <P>Section 30 also introduces a 13 year claw-back period for capital allowances on all commercial buildings in the designated areas, bringing the tax life of the buildings into line with the 13 year period over which the accelerated allowances would normally be claimed.</P>
    <P>In addition, section 30 closes off two tax loopholes.  First, the double rent allowance, in the case of a refurbished building, from now on will be conditional on the capital expenditure on refurbishment amounting to at least 10 per cent of the market value of the building before the refurbishment took place. Second, section 30 provides for the closure of a loophole in relation to the cross-leasing of property by means of controlled companies which was designed to claim both accelerated capital allowances and a double rent allowance.</P>
    <P>A number of important changes are being made to section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987, the section which provides relief from corporation tax in respect of investment in Irish film making companies.</P>
    <P>First, the present ceiling for investment under section 35, which is £600,000 per <Col N="1053" /> corporate investor, is being increased to £1.05 million.  This can be invested either as a £1.05 million investment in a single film production in any one year in a three year period, or as £350,000 each year for three years in one or more film projects.</P>
    <P>Second, in future, individuals will be able to avail of the section 35 relief up to an annual limit of £25,000.  Third, the qualifying period for the relief, which was due to expire on 31 March 1995, is being extended to 31 March 1996 for companies, and for individuals the relief will run to 5 April 1996.</P>
    <P>Finally, in order to facilitate the making of films under co-production agreements with other countries, section 48 of the Bill provides for the waiving of the 75 per cent Irish production test for a film to qualify for the relief.  At present, at least 75 per cent of the production work of the film must be carried out in the State and not more than 60 per cent of the cost of producing the film may be met by section 35 investments.</P>
    <P>The waiving of this requirement will be subject to certain conditions.  These are, that at least 10 per cent of the production work must be carried on in the State, that the approval of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht must be obtained, and that the percentage of the cost of the production of the film allowable to be met by section 35 investment cannot exceed the percentage of production work carried out in the State, subject to the overall 60 per cent cost of production ceiling referred to above. These changes are designed to boost investment in the Irish film industry.</P>
    <P>The maximum acceptable degree of freedom from tax for foreign trusts is provided for in section 49 in order to facilitate the generation of employment in Ireland from the management of such trusts.  &ldquo;Foreign trusts&rdquo; are those where the settlers and beneficiaries are not domiciled or resident in the State, the assets are located outside the State, and the income is from sources outside the State; only the professional trustees, who must be licensed banks, authorised trustees for collective investment undertakings or similar persons, and approved <Col N="1054" /> by the Central Bank as suitable trust managers, may be located in the State.</P>
    <P>At present, legislation allowing the Central Bank to give such approval does not exist.  New legislation is required and will be prepared as quickly as possible this year.  In view of this, the Finance Bill provisions enable the Minister for Finance, by order, to bring these provisions in relation to the taxation of foreign trusts into effect when the necessary regulatory legislation is in place.</P>
    <P>I now come to Customs and Excise. The Bill confirms the changes announced in the budget with regard to the increases in duty on cigarettes and certain other tobacco products and on cider and perry. It sets out a single rate of duty for heavy fuel oil which is necessary to comply with EC rules.  It provides for the duty reductions on certain low alcohol products, for example spritzers and coolers and on auto LPG.</P>
    <P>The Bill confirms the combined high season-weekend category of licence for amusement machines introduced in the budget.  Reflecting representations from the trade, the Bill also provides for an amendment of the gaming licence regime so as to treat certain gaming machines as a single machine, irrespective of the number of playing positions.  Other technical amendments to the gaming duty system are also included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the importance of the short term car hire sector for the tourism industry and of the shortage problems that can arise at peak demand periods.  This Government has decided to tackle these problems in a fundamental way through reshaping the fiscal environment for such cars.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of significant initiatives to increase the availability of cars for short-time hire.  As well as confirming the scheme of partial repayment of vehicle registration tax (VRT) for cars in the short term hire fleet announced in budget, a further relieving provision is proposed in regard to the arrangements for paying vehicle registration tax on such cars.</P>
    <P>These measures address the concerns of the car hire interests; they create a <Col N="1055" /> framework and climate which should allow for a substantial increase in the hire fleet during the summer season and should underpin the financial viability of the sector generally.</P>
    <P>I have decided to defer the proposed introduction of standard VAT rating for short term car hire originally proposed for 1 September 1993.  The Bill also provides for other minor adjustments to the VRT in respect of mini-buses and demonstration vehicles.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the enactment of certain residual matters in the vehicle licensing road tax area set out in the &ldquo;Government Proposals for Legislation to be included in a Second Finance Bill&rdquo; published last November which were not subsequently enacted.  These deal with underpinning the legislative basis for the national vehicle file; the provision of a framework for the renewal of road tax and driving licences at any motor tax office in the State; updating road tax penalty provisions and enabling local authorities to pass information to the gardaí about cars that have been registered for VRT but, in respect of which, an application for a road tax licence has not been received within seven working days.</P>
    <P>Internal market obligations require that we cease using the intermediate prefermentation worts system as the basis for levying excise duty on beer.  Instead, a system based on taxation of the end-product must be adopted.  The Bill, accordingly, provides for a new rate of duty on beer based on the end-product. It is a revenue neutral rate of £14.62 per hectolitre per cent alcohol in the finished product.  As part of the new regime, which I intend to introduce on 1 October next by means of ministerial order, revised deferment arrangements are also proposed for payment of excise duty on beer.  The revised deferment arrangements will also apply to the payment of excise duty on wine.</P>
    <P>The Bill also clarifies the position of certain minor categories of spirits retailers' on-licences to ensure that they will be subject to the appropriate licence <Col N="1056" /> duty and the associated tax clearance requirements.</P>
    <P>As far as excises are concerned, the Bill provides for certain other technical amendments to Customs and Excise law in order to align domestic law with EC requirements.  Part III of the Bill gives effect to the legislative changes relating to VAT.</P>
    <P>As regards the rate changes announced on budget day, the Bill confirms all of these apart from two.  The first relates to the proposed application of the standard rate to short term car hire, which was to take effect from 1 September next.  In response to the many representations received from the tourism industry, I have decided that this change should be deferred.</P>
    <P>When taken in conjunction with the proposed reliefs for the short term hire sector in relation to vehicle registration tax, this concession should further underpin the financial viability of the sector, thereby facilitating an increase in the size of hire fleets.  Thus, short term car hire remains at the parking rate of 12.5 per cent for the moment.  Ultimately, however, it will have to be taxed at the standard rate in accordance with EC law.</P>
    <P>The second concerns the treatment of ready to pour concrete and concrete blocks, which were formerly taxed at the 10 per cent rate but to which the standard rate has applied from 1 March last.  The increase announced in the budget was primarily intended to combat black economy activity in the overall building and construction sector.  However, following discussions with the industry and the benefit of further detailed analysis which highlighted the danger of distortion of competition, particularly in the Border areas, I decided to avail of the parking rate facility provided for under EC law. Therefore, from 1 July 1993, the rate of VAT on concrete and concrete blocks will be 12.5 per cent, the rate that now applies to building services generally.</P>
    <P>Regarding the VAT rate increases on adult clothing and footwear, I confirm that I have no intention of reversing my decision to place these items at the standard rate.  The primary reason for the <Col N="1057" /> increase in rate was to raise revenue.  This revenue was part and parcel of overall budgetary strategy, which was framed with the need firmly in mind to give Irish industry conditions in which jobs generally could be protected and which has now paid off in terms of creating an environment of currency stability and substantially lower interest rates.  I would point out that to put adult clothing and footwear at the 12.5 per cent rate would cost £77 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the difficulties being encountered in the clothing industry are wholly or even largely due to the VAT rate increase.  Without labouring the matter, I want to repeat that the two-thirds of the output of the Irish clothing sector which is exported will not be affected by the change.  Moreover, given that the higher rate applies equally to the 80 per cent of consumption here which is imported and the 20 per cent which is domestically sourced, the relative position of these supplies has not been distorted.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out to Senators that the new zero-rating facility introduced in section 90 of the Bill will benefit many of our clothing and footwear manufacturing companies where they qualify to participate in the scheme.  Overall, I am satisfied that the balance struck in the budget was the right one from an overall employment standpoint.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would draw the attention of the Seanad to the package of measures which I announced recently, aimed at improving the cost-competitiveness of the manufacturing side of the industry.  It includes a temporary scheme for assistance where the viability of firms and employment levels can be demonstrated to be threatened by the application of the standard rate of VAT to their domestic sales, a review of the impact of employers' PRSI and a review of the criteria under which the IDA assist technological development in the industry.  I will continue to monitor the situation and keep in touch with the sectors representing footwear, fashion manufacturing and retailing, led by IBEC.</P>
    <P>There are two measures provided for <Col N="1058" /> in the Bill which are designed to offset, to a considerable extent, the major cash-flow loss to the Exchequer arising from the abolition of VAT at point of entry on intra-Community trade.</P>
    <P>The first involves a special advance payment in December by the larger tax remitters, equivalent to one-twelfth of their annual liability, to be set against actual liabilities in the following January's normal VAT return.  This initiative, which is restricted to some 2,000 taxable persons whose VAT liability exceeds £120,000 per annum, will yield an estimated £145 million in cash-flow terms.  Provision is made to impose a surcharge of 0.25 per cent of the advance payment per day where a taxpayer fails to make the advance payment by the due date.</P>
    <P>I believe that, overall, this initiative is a balanced one, as it gives the business community the benefit of the cash-flow gain arising from abolition of VAT at point of entry for most of the year.  As there are some 128,000 businesses registered for VAT, Senators will appreciate that the vast majority of traders, and all small and medium size operators, will be unaffected by the initiative.</P>
    <P>The other cash-flow proposal contained in the Bill involves a change in the method of charging VAT on the removal of alcoholic goods from bonded warehouses. The Bill provides that, in the case of all taxable transactions involving such duty suspended goods &mdash; that is, sales made within warehouses, acquisitions from other member states and imports from outside the Community &mdash; VAT will be charged on the last sale, if any, within bond and on the duty inclusive price as the goods leave bond.  It is estimated that this measure, which is designed specifically to counter certain tax evasion practices which have been found in the drinks trade, will yield £15 million, in cash-flow terms, to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes granting zero rating for supplies made to companies the bulk of whose output is supplied to other member states or exported outside the Community.  This initiative will represent <Col N="1059" /> a significant improvement in the trading environment for companies authorised to participate in the scheme, who, up to now, would be in a repayment position in relation to VAT.  Many Irish exporting manufacturing companies, for example, will be able to participate in the scheme and should benefit from a cash-flow gain and savings in administrative costs arising from simplification of the system.</P>
    <P>While the cash-flow effect on traders supplying authorised companies will vary, depending on credit terms, they will, however, gain the very significant commercial advantage of being able to zero rate their supplies to the companies concerned and thus, from the VAT point of view, will be on a level playing field, so to speak, with out-of-State suppliers of the same type of goods and services. Irish hauliers, who transport goods of authorised companies to other member states, will gain a similar advantage. Finally, the Exchequer will improve its cash flow position by an estimated £20 million as a result of the measure.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Bill to enable a flat rate farmer who purchases goods in other member states above the threshold of £32,000 to register in respect of those acquisitions but remain a flat rate farmer in all other respects.  The farmer will, of course, be required to pay Irish VAT &mdash; without deductibility &mdash; on such acquisitions but, it will, as always, remain open to individual farmers to opt for full taxable status should they wish to do so. This measure will represent an important facility for all flat rate farmers, but particularly those in the horse breeding industry.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the abolition of the threshold relating to certain services, including accountancy and advertising, supplied from abroad.  Under existing rules, it is only if a trader's expenditure on such services is in excess of £15,000 that he is obliged to account for the VAT on them.  In contrast, all similar services being supplied by a domestic practitioner would be taxable.  Abolition of the threshold will eliminate this anomaly and <Col N="1060" /> remove any potential distortions of trade for Irish providers of such services.</P>
    <P>Part VI, Chapter I, of the Bill contains the detailed provisions of the new probate tax which will be charged on the estates of persons dying after the date of enactment of the Bill.  I have already had the opportunity of addressing this House on the question of the probate tax.  The purpose of the tax is to increase the yield from capital taxation on inheritances by applying a relatively modest charge to the majority of estates passing on inheritance. At present only a small proportion of inheritances attract a charge to capital acquisition tax.  This is mainly because of the generous exemption thresholds under the capital acquisitions tax code, which for a transfer from parent to child is currently £171,750.</P>
    <P>Inheritance tax yields £30 million per year out of total annual capital acquisitions tax receipts of about £35 million. This represents only about 3 per cent of the total value of estates passing on inheritance and less than 0.5 per cent of the total yield from all taxes.  The probate tax will earn an estimated £11 million in a full year and will increase the overall yield from the taxation of inheritances by about 30 per cent.  This is in line with a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to increase the yield from capital taxes.  It is also justified by economic circumstances since other taxes.  It is also justified by economic circumstances since other tax heads are also required to contribute additional revenues.</P>
    <P>The probate tax will involve a 2 per cent charge on the net taxable value of estates over £10,000 passing under will or intestacy.  There will be full exemption for the family residence where there is a surviving spouse and, where there is no surviving spouse, the share of the family residence passing to dependent children or dependent relatives will be exempt.  In this regard, I introduced a Report Stage amendment in the Dáil which will ensure that the family residence will include normal house contents.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides exemptions for pension benefits, bequests to charities, <Col N="1061" /> heritage property and the proceeds of assurance policies used to pay inheritance tax and/or probate tax.  There will be a special relief, subject to certain conditions, where two spouses die in quick succession.  The tax will be allowed as an expense for inheritance tax purposes and there will be a discount for early payment. Special arrangements will apply where payment would cause hardship and where there are insufficient liquid assets to pay the tax.</P>
    <P>The Government has given very careful consideration to the detailed provisions of the probate tax in the light of the various representations and suggestions received since the introduction of the tax was announced in the budget. Having regard to the generous reliefs and exemptions proposed, the relatively low rate of tax and the deferred payment arrangements which cater for situations of illiquidity and hardship, the Government is satisfied that the provisions contained in the Bill are reasonable and equitable and that the probate tax will not place a significant burden on the taxpayer. At the same time the tax will make a valuable contribution to the Government's economic and social expenditure programmes.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government, section 128 of the Bill provides for an increase in agricultural relief in respect of capital acquisitions tax on gifts from 55 per cent of eligible assets with a ceiling of £200,000 to 75 per cent with a ceiling of £250,000.  So far as the farming sector is concerned, this increased relief, and the fact that there is no probate tax on gifts, will considerably reduce the tax on gifts as compared to inheritances and as such it should provide a positive incentive to the early transfer of farms.  This increased relief will mean that a young farmer will be able to acquire over £420,000 worth of agricultural property from his father or mother before any tax liability arises.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for a number of amendments to existing capital acquisitions tax legislation which are designed to safeguard against attempts at avoiding <Col N="1062" /> tax on the transfer of assets.  These anti-avoidance provisions are contained in Chapter II of Part VI of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to highlight just one of the changes in stamp duty legislation provided for in the Bill as I have not had the opportunity of doing so up to now.  I am referring to section 106 which I introduced on Committee Stage in the Dáil. This is an important measure which deserves special mention.  Section 106 grants an exemption from stamp duty for the issue and transfer of certain debt instruments, known generally as corporate bonds.  Under present legislation, corporate bonds are subject to either a 1 per cent duty on transfer or a 3 per cent duty on issue.</P>
    <P>The abolition of these duties for most categories of such bonds is designed to encourage the development of a corporate bond market in Ireland and to improve access to longer term fixed rate finance for private sector corporate borrowers and individual mortgage holders. Greater availability of fixed rate finance would enable borrowers to reduce their exposure and that of the whole economy to short term fluctuations in interest rates.  The high proportion of fixed interest credit in most EC countries makes it easier for those countries to cope with high short term interest rates during periods of turmoil in the financial markets.</P>
    <P>The market in bonds normally operates on very tight margins, and the 1 per cent stamp duty on the transfer of these securities, rather than generating significant amounts of revenue, has served instead to hinder the development of a corporate bond market in Ireland and to drive such financial activity offshore.  As a result there has been limited availability of medium and long term finance in the Irish financial market which has rendered borrowers vulnerable to interest rate pressure.  The turbulence in financial markets in the past year, which thankfully has now abated, illustrates just how vulnerable we are to interest rate and exchange rate volatility.</P>
    <P>The development of an Irish corporate bond market should help in bringing <Col N="1063" /> about greater stability in the Irish financial system, to the benefit of corporate borrowers and mortgage holders alike. The change has been strongly welcomed by the financial services sector and business commentators.</P>
    <P>The stamp duty exemption will not extend to all types of loan capital.  The duty will remain in place for those bonds and other negotiable loan instruments which could be considered to offer certain of the advantages of equities to investors, such as convertible bonds, irredeemable bonds, deep-discount bonds and index-linked bonds.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes legislative provision for two extensions of the tax clearance system announced in the budget, to cover the issuing of various excise licences, to which sections 79 and 140 relate, and to ensure that the residential property tax liabilities have been discharged when houses are being sold, which is in section 107.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1993    [Certified Money Bill]:    Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The opening paragraph of the Minister's speech states: &ldquo;This Finance Bill underpins the Government's priority objective &mdash; to maximise, on a sustainable basis, the job potential of our economy in two respects&rdquo;.  This statement is inaccurate and untrue because the Finance Bill does the opposite: it imposes taxes on work, energy, initiative and enterprise.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill was the opportunity to tackle the problem of having 300,000 people out of work.  It is the vehicle which enables the Government to tackle the endemic problem of unemployment.  The Minister could have reduced unemployment by reducing tax on workers, employers' PRSI and VAT on products produced by sensitive industries.  Regrettably, the Minister has taken the wrong direction.  That is why I consider his opening statement to be inaccurate and untrue.</P>
      <P>The Minister's proposals for VAT increases will cause job losses because they will affect a number of labour intensive industries.  The increases will affect the ordinary worker in many ways as, combined with the new 1 per cent levy, they will cause job losses instead of maintaining existing jobs or creating job opportunities.  To add insult to injury, the Government will give a total tax write off of all arrears of tax due to the Exchequer from people who have defrauded the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's proposal to increase the VAT rate on hotels, holiday <Col N="1065" /> accommodation, newpapers and building supplies from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent is a serious mistake.  The VAT increase on newspapers is a charge on information and is a retrograde step.  Irish newspapers are printed in Ireland, their staff are employed in this country and they are competing against imported newspapers from Great Britain.  Some of our national and provincial newspapers are in serious financial difficulties at present.  This VAT increase will exacerbate an already difficult situation for some of those newspapers. Visitors from Great Britain, Europe and America compliment the quality of our newspapers and we can be proud of the standards they have maintained.</P>
    <P>Newspapers compete with RTE television and radio for advertising revenue. RTE is publicly funded and the removal of the cap on its advertising will adversely affect newspapers and periodicals. People in the newspaper industry estimate that the proposed changes in VAT will cost the industry at least £200 million. This will affect jobs and the important role of newspapers in education and in providing access to detailed information.</P>
    <P>The increase in VAT rates demonstrates that the Government has little knowledge of the difficulties being experienced in the clothing and footwear industries.  In 1991 VAT on clothes and footwear was 12.5 per cent.  In 1992 the Minister increased it to 16 per cent and in this year's Finance Bill he has increased it to 21 per cent.  The Minister must be aware of the damage these increases will do to our hard pressed clothing and shoe industries which are already under pressure and how they will affect jobs.  The Minister is, no doubt, aware of the number of clothing and footwear firms which have closed and that further increases in VAT on clothing and footwear will cause additional hardship.</P>
    <P>The VAT rate for shoes and clothes in the North is 17.5 per cent.  In the Twenty-six Counties it will now be 21 per cent.  VAT on clothing and footwear is charged at the same rates in the North and in Great Britain.  The higher rate of VAT <Col N="1066" /> in the Republic will lead to an increase in sales of clothes and footwear in the Six Counties and in Britain.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the serious job losses in the footwear and clothing industry. Between 1989 and the end of 1992, 2800 people working in the clothing and footwear industries lost their jobs.  I am certain that the Minister does not fully realise the effects of those job losses.</P>
    <P>I can supply the Minister with a list of the name and addresses of firms which have already closed.  At Gardeur, 180 employees lost their jobs.  At Cavan Fabrics, 80 were made redundant while at Babygro, the figure was 350.  At Bonaventure, 450 jobs were lost.  Cosmo closed with a loss of 40 jobs, and Mitzi closed with a loss of 180 jobs.  At Irish Blouses, 30 were made redundant, at Robert Usher, 150 and 200 at Laura Ashley.  The list is extensive, and the total number of jobs lost is 2,800.  Since the Minister's recent announcement, two more firms have gone out of business, Wexman in Wexford, with a loss of 109 jobs, and Beeline in Dublin with a loss of 120 jobs.  A number of retail fashion outlets have closed or made staff redundant since the budget.  For one reason or another, these firms are in difficulties, and the increase in VAT will exacerbate an already difficult situation.</P>
    <P>Best Menswear in the Square in Tallaght is about to close.  Three jobs will be lost in a small firm in Galway.  Clery's have made 60 staff redundant and Duggan's have made 40 staff redundant.  The list is long, and, unfortunately, these VAT increases will make a difficult situation worse.  The Minister stated he is increasing VAT on clothes and footwear because the revenue is needed.  The revenue accumulating from these increases will be offset by an increase in payments of unemployment benefit, and the loss of PRSI contributions and income tax.  This is short term economics and the Minister should think seriously before he takes this action.</P>
    <P>I read this Bill during the last few weeks, I noted the situation in regard to the building industry and the decrease from 21 per cent to 10 per cent for poured <Col N="1067" /> concrete and concrete blocks.  The Minister has acted on representations to him by different groups in the building industry and his proposal is welcome and wise. I ask him, even at this late stage, to consider further the situation in regard to the clothing and footwear industry.</P>
    <P>Workers pay too much tax, I am certain the Minister is aware that, for example, a married man with six children receives approximately £180 unemployment assistance per week.  If this person obtained a job with a county council or a local authority, he would earn approximately £186 a week.  When the loss of benefits is taken into account, that person is financially better off drawing unemployment assistance.  The 1 per cent income levy make this situation worse. Many workers pay tax at 48 per cent and a 7.5 per cent health levy.  They are now asked to pay a further 1 per cent levy. PAYE workers may be taxable at the top rate of income tax, if they are single and have no benefits, on a figure as low as £11,000 per year.  They must also pay 7.5 per cent PRSI, and the 1 per cent income levy.  I cannot understand the attitude of the Government in bringing in this 1 per cent levy.  Most of the people in the PAYE system are outraged that such a levy should be imposed.  The Minister has taken bad advice.  If the Minister and the Government hope to maintain the goodwill of workers and trade unions, the imposition of this 1 per cent levy is an unwise step and I cannot see the sense of imposing it now.  Will the Minister consider withdrawing this levy?</P>
    <P>I wish to raise another matter with the Minister.  When the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance he promised a review in 1990 or 1991 on the issue of disabled drivers.  People suffering from severe arthritis and permanently disabled cannot obtain exemption from tax on importing a car and other such allowances for disabled drivers, because they have not lost a limb or do not suffer from a similar physical disability.  Somebody with chronic arthritis should get the same exemptions; the cost to the Exchequer would be minimal and it would be of <Col N="1068" /> tremendous help to many who are permanently incapacitated.  I ask the Minister to examine this matter.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to examine taxation on lunch vouchers.  Under the lunch voucher scheme tax must be paid on all but the first 15 pence of the cost of the meal.  This figure was set in 1965 when three shillings was the price of a meal and is unrealistic now &mdash; it would not even buy a cup of coffee today.  The Minister should examine how this allowance could be increased because it would be of immense benefit to small cafés and restaurants. Many of these are having difficulty staying in business: such an increase might help some of them and it would not be of great cost to the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the changes he made in relation to the probate tax.  I note that the family residence and the normal house contents will be exempt. The Department and the Government have not thought out the probate tax sufficiently or given it the required study. When the matter was debated in this House I made the point that the probate tax is a return to death duties &mdash; it is a form of coffin chasing.  The Minister said that he wishes to broaden the existing narrow base for taxing inheritances. There are already heavy tax liabilities on death in the form of inheritance tax and these changes will cause hardship in many case where there are no liquid assets.</P>
    <P>Inheritance tax is chargeable at a basic rate of 20 per cent rising to 40 per cent and, while the thresholds vary considerably from £11,450 for a non-related person to £170,000 for a son or daughter, it can be a severe tax burden on a family property.  The Minister said that on a transfer: &ldquo;a young farmer will be able to acquire over £420,000 worth of agricultural property from his father or mother before any tax liability arises&rdquo;. That is correct if one is referring to transfer only but if a property is transferred to a bachelor who dies suddenly inheritance tax will have to be paid.  In this area the probate tax has not been given sufficient thought.</P>
    <P>Although the probate tax is dressed up as being of benefit to PAYE workers, <Col N="1069" /> thousands of people &mdash; or their dependants &mdash; will be caught by it in years to come.  In the past parents advocated thrift; setting aside moneys for education, health and many other good reasons.  The probate tax goes against such thrift.  The PAYE worker pays tax on everything earned and more tax on savings.  On death he will have to pay a further 2 per cent probate tax.  This is the wrong direction for our system of taxation.</P>
    <P>Until now tax was not payable on many small estates, but probate tax will be payable on most estates.  As pointed out in the explanatory memorandum to this Bill a dependent child with an income in excess of £3,877 per annum, for example, a married man with children living in the family home, will now become liable for probate tax.</P>
    <P>This probate tax is a retrograde move and it not something with which the Government should proceed.  The section that says the tax must be paid at the time of the filing of the inland revenue affidavit prior to the grant of probate being issued is something that the officials in the Department have obviously not explained fully to the Minister, otherwise he would not proceed with this section.  I am certain that the Minister and Senator O'Kennedy are aware that on somebody's death no property can be interfered with, assets cannot be touched, all bank accounts are closed and that all dealings with the estate are suspended and frozen until the grant of probate is issued by the principal probate office. When the grant is issued the beneficiary in the estate can divide up the assets or deal with them in the form outlined by the deceased person.  A person may have money in a bank account but the beneficiary or executor cannot deal with the assets without obtaining a loan from a bank to pay the tax due because it is a type of self-assessment.  This is an iniquitous approach and unfair when there is a bereavement in a family.  The penalty of 15 per cent interest is very severe, particularly when interest rates have now been reduced.  Will the Minister again examine this situation?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> I previously outlined a situation where business people would have to pay this tax and I thought that the Minister would have taken the points I raised into account.  The Minister spoke about exemptions being granted to farmers which are double those granted to businesses. As job losses are so high the same exemption limits should apply equally to farmers and businesses.  They could apply to a small business, a shop, a small trading company, a restaurant or a pub. Where people are employed or in a family business and where there are no liquid assets, there should be an increased exemption.  Many people experience great difficulties in meeting inheritance tax payments.  Where a business is trading and discharging its liabilities, taking a sizeable sum of money, £10,000 or £15,000 out of it, could be the difference between surviving and going to the wall.  Too many businesses fail and we have a duty to see how we can keep them afloat.  I ask the Minister to examine this matter because it is important.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that my comments in the Seanad would have had some effect on the Minister and would perhaps have convinced him and his colleagues that furniture should be exempt.  I note the Minister's comment that normal contents of a home have been exempted.  If a revenue return is made on land, the Revenue Commissioners and the valuation office have power to inspect the farm or land.  If a normal return is made for a dwelling house, who decides what is a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; amount of furniture?  Will the Minister or the Revenue Commissioners send officials to inspect dwelling houses to see what is &ldquo;normal&rdquo;?  This is a serious issue because many people have their houses and the contents of the house insured, because of the average clause in insurance contracts, many properties are insured at a higher level than the realistic market value of the property.  If the Revenue Commissioners ask for the insurance policy on a house and furniture, they may say that if a person dies and has furniture worth £50,000 included on an insurance policy that person is liable for 2 per cent probate tax or they <Col N="1071" /> may give an allowance of £10,000 and then charge tax at 2 per cent on the remainder.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister a simple example and ask him to bear it in mind in regard to this probate tax.  A retired national school teacher dies.  He has been reasonably successful and, perhaps irrespective of whatever scheme this House has put in place to try to deprive him of his savings, he has succeeded in saving some money.  He may have received a gratuity on retirement and would perhaps have an insurance policy and some money saved.  He passes away at 70, those moneys are part of his estate and are taxable at 2 per cent.  If his wife had predeceased him and his son was living in the house and earning in excess of £3,800, he is liable for probate tax on the estate.  I do not think that is what the Minister had in mind and what was intended in this scheme.</P>
    <P>Probate tax is particularly difficult as it arises at the sensitive time of a bereavement in a family.  We are aware of the existing powers of the Revenue Commissioners; under section 181 of the Finance Act, 1992, the Revenue Commissioners have extensive powers and it worries me how these powers may be used in regard to probate tax.  The Revenue Commissioners' powers are much more extensive than in Great Britain and in most other countries yet many of those available have not been utilised.  If they had many of the scandals in the recent past would have been avoided.  Year after year, additional powers are granted to the Revenue Commissioners, this House has never carefully considered the extent of these powers and the dangers that can occur in the future.  Consideration should be given to their extent.</P>
    <P>In spite of all these extensive powers, the Minister now sees fit to grant an amnesty to people who have already defrauded and cheated the system.  I believe the proposal to grant this amnesty will be anathema to the ordinary PAYE worker.  Most workers who are trapped in the PAYE system will be outraged <Col N="1072" /> when they realise that people who have cheated and defrauded the system will now get off, subject to a 15 per cent interest penalty.  This proposal will bring Irish tax laws into disrepute at both national and international level.  I am certain that many foreigners living and paying tax here must be wondering what sort of a country we have when they see people defrauding and cheating the system and getting away with it.</P>
    <P>This type of amnesty is different from the 1989 amnesty under which all taxes due had to be paid although penalties were waived.  In the current case, people who have defrauded and cheated are being allowed to avail of their ill-gotten gains subject to the payment of a 15 per cent penalty.  It is my view that this amnesty will be proved to be unconstitutional because there cannot be one law for a law abiding citizen and another for the tax cheat and defrauder.</P>
    <P>We are heading down a dangerous road and future taxation policy could be seriously damaged by such an approach. I would ask the Minister to be careful, I believe he is not totally in favour of the amnesty.  However, irrespective of who is or is not in favour of it, we are heading into dangerous territory and I would ask the Minister to seriously examine the situation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is significant that the Minister for Finance of the day has devoted so much time to comprehensively presenting the Finance Bill to this House.  Senators will know that we do not have power in this House to move any amendments to money Bills, and in particular to the Finance Bill.  For that reason I think it is a mark of extreme courtesy, which we all appreciate, that the Minister has made himself available to explain to us the overall strategy of his economic policy as contained in this Bill and to listen to what Senators have to say within the time constraints he has to operate.  In that context, if during my contribution, the Minister finds those constraints oblige him to be elsewhere, I will understand.  As a former Minister for <Col N="1073" /> Finance I understand the demands of the job, and it is as a former Minister for Finance that I would like to make some observations on what the Minister has presented today.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that Senator Enright, as a spokesman for the Opposition, has, by and large, made a very reasoned and fair analysis of the Bill, though towards the end he strayed into another territory which is not part of this Bill.  I share some of the reservations the Senator expressed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; in relation to the amnesty, but we will deal with that on another day when the legislation is presented to us.  I would prefer to confine myself now to the thrust of this Bill as part of a three-pronged attack on the problems facing this country, and indicating the Minister's and the Government's strategy on economic and fiscal control and programming.  I support, as I am sure almost every Member of this House does, the position of the Minister when he said that his primary and overriding purpose is to secure financial stability in difficult circumstances.  That must be the most important element in his strategy because there are difficult economic and financial circumstances not alone in this country but to a much greater extent in the universal economic climate, and particularly in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that the Minister and the Government adhere to maintaining financial stability in those difficult international circumstances.  The Minister has made it clear that this Bill is but one element in the Government's overall fiscal and economic strategy, and I support that approach.  I have always thought of fiscal and economic strategy as being a tripod or three-legged stool which will not be stable unless all three legs are firmly in place.  The first and most important leg is control of Government expenditure, the first element in annual budgetary and fiscal strategy.  This must be controlled in the annual Estimates <Col N="1074" /> review, and, in particular, in current Government expenditure which normally begins in September or October. When I was in Government we began the expenditure review in August, with hardly time to finish our holidays, and we had the job done by November.  This was the most important element in Government policy and when that was achieved one could deal with the budget and subsequently the Finance Bill.  I am pleased that the Minister, with whom I was privileged to be in Government over those five years and previously, is firmly adhering to that same strategy.</P>
    <P>Control of Government expenditure is the most vital element in the fiscal and economic approach and I support the Minister because of the consequences of that effective, disciplined approach.  Any Government can spend in response to every demand, but that is the sign of a weak, ineffective and vacillating Government. A good Government is one that recognises the demands being made by various sectors, yet stands firm and does not respond to what appear to be reasonable and popular demands for more spending.  This policy came into effect in 1987 and I am glad it is being maintained in a vigorous and effective way in 1993. The Minister has made it clear that this is his central purpose.  If he were to respond to some of the easy options right now, so much of what has been achieved, perhaps at some considerable pain, since 1987 would be lost and that would be a major tragedy.  However, I know that in the hands of this Minister there is no risk of that happening.</P>
    <P>Let us see what has emerged from this consistent Government policy.  The inflation rate has been reduced from double digits &mdash; 20 per cent and over when we came into office &mdash; to 2 per cent, thereby signalling to the world at large that this is a country with an enterprise climate for the generation of employment and the security of investment.  This is happening at a time when many other countries in the EC are failing to meet the same test.  Therefore, that strategy must be maintained.</P>
    <P>Before we came into Government in <Col N="1075" /> 1987, especially before the appointment of the Minister, interest rates abroad were a benign influence on interest rates here.  Rates were much lower outside and tended to pull our interest rates down. In the unfortunate period from 1983-87, despite interest rates being much lower outside, Irish rates were at their highest ever.</P>
    <P>Now, because of the overall economic strategy the Minister has underlined, interest rates have dropped to the point at which they should be.  Through no fault of Government our real interest rates are still too high and the difference between our inflation and interest rates is too great, possibly higher than anywhere else in Europe.  That is a function of the money supply which has certainly come under greater control in the last six months, when there was a reduction of 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important to maintain this economic and fiscal strategy, particularly when the main EC economies, notably Germany are in considerable difficulties, if not disarray.  The problems of the German economy, the former mainstay of the EC, are now immense and complex. Political direction is lacking, as is economic and fiscal control.  These facts will pose problems for other EC members.  In my time as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Finance, one could be secure in the knowledge that the German Government had strict control of inflation and the economy. That is not the case now and, therefore, we must be all the more disciplined.  One can see what happens in other economies and the reactions to Governments in France, Spain or Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Ireland will not get much sustenance or comfort from the overall economic climate in Europe for the foreseeable future.  That is why the policy pursued by this Government must be followed. Otherwise, as a small open economy, the country would be in great difficulty.  One does not have to dwell on the point that a lack of progress towards the ERM, supposed to be central in European strategy, demonstrated the lack of co-ordinated <Col N="1076" /> direction on the part of most EC member states.  It must be significant for a Minister who has attended the EC Council of Ministers recently to have it acknowledged that Ireland is pursuing the consistent policy and that other countries are trying to follow it.</P>
    <P>The ASEAN countries were the beneficiaries of a support and development programme from the EC when I was Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1977-79. That is nearly unthinkable now.  The EC had a programme to help them to create the basis of sound economic activity.  The programme should now be operated in reverse because in that area there has not been a recession, lack of direction and confusion seen in the EC in recent times.  The signals coming from the economy and the Government are most important.  They indicate this is a climate for enterprise and the Finance Bill is securing that pattern for the future.</P>
    <P>In common with what has been said today, there is only one way to consistently reduce taxation levels and simplify the tax code, by controlling public expenditure.  During my period as Minister for Agriculture the Government decided that the consequences had to be faced.  We knew we were bound to be criticised but we decided to go ahead with the task on hand.</P>
    <P>Two bodies under my responsibility operated independently, ACOT and the Agricultural Institute, which cost £35 million between them.  Consistent with Government policy, I was told they would receive £25 million the following year and would have to make the most of it.</P>
    <P>I recall the reactions of the farm organisations who said the moves were outrageous but nobody utters a whimper now.  At one fell swoop we reduced the expenditure by £10 million.  That is significant, not just for its effect in that year but what it has prevented in the years since.  We also introduced the concept that farmers pay a little towards this good service, particularly if they are at a certain level of income.  It was understandable that the immediate reactions were unfavourable but now it is different. <Col N="1077" /> I mention that as an example of the approach we must adopt.</P>
    <P>The central thrust of employment as the great priority and the encouragement of investment is clear from the Bill and is more important than some of the schemes outlined by the Minister.  Those observing Ireland from the outside will want to know what the climate is like, whether Government policy can be trusted and whether the Minister is consistent. They will not necessarily inquire what schemes are available under the BES, significant as those may be.  Nonetheless, foreign observers are influenced by what we do in the financial services sector and elsewhere.  The less we spend the less tax we have to raise.</P>
    <P>I would normally favour a short Finance Bill if the conditions were ripe and public expenditure was under sufficient control.  It often happens that the detail of Finance Bills such as this one is comprehensive to the point of being complex. The only people able to come to terms with that are accountants.  They then engage in an annual search for tax avoidance measures which are sometimes close to tax evasion.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I told the Leinster Society of Chartered Accountants that I would much prefer to see accountants advise entrepreneurs and potential business people about their economic strategy rather than devoting so much time to finding new loopholes and tax avoidance measures.  Each Finance Bill is minutely examined in the finance houses, not merely to see how new schemes can be availed of, but how to avoid heavier taxes.  Some will be straying into the area of tax evasion and there is a thin line between the two.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill are not all positive, especially the 1 per cent income levy.  It is not simply an issue of equity although that is important.  The 1 per cent income levy belongs to a period which is not consistent with the policy now being pursued.  During that period, 1984-85, when I was Opposition spokesman on Finance, the purpose of reducing the budget deficit was not achieved.  The strategy was not to reduce the deficit <Col N="1078" /> by controlling public expenditure, but by increasing taxation.  In that context a one per cent income levy was introduced by the then Government.  However, the present 1 per cent income levy is not consistent with the Minister's economic strategy and I hope, therefore, that it will not be permanent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not introduced when I was Minister and, furthermore, the Government of which I was a member did not introduce such measures.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this Bill, like the budget, is employment oriented. Taken in conjunction with the control on expenditure, on which I have spoken at some length, the specific aids to employment creation contained in this Bill are important.  For example, the relief for seed capital investment by entrepreneurs in new companies is crucial to their encouragement and development.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the relief for investment in research and development.  This area has enormous potential.  The added value of knowledge derives from our heavy investment in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not invested enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but there has been a substantial investment and I hope the level will increase.  We have a knowledge base that demonstrably can operate to our advantage in employment creation.  Because of this I welcome the extension of relief for investment in research and development which is now no longer confined to a BES scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital gains roll over relief is important as are the welcome changes in the BES scheme such as the new limits and exemptions.  These measures, with the increased relief to employees to invest in employer companies, are part of an overall pattern which will demonstrate to people at home and abroad that the <Col N="1079" /> Government is pursuing policies of investment and employment creation.</P>
    <P>I have a reservation in that these schemes are confined almost entirely to the manufacturing and international services sector.  The potential for job creation in the other sectors of the economy is important, particularly in the services sector which has a high employment level, the distribution and marketing sector, and the tourism sector overall &mdash; not only in relation to car hire &mdash; where I welcome the arrangements introduced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister addressed this issue in his speech when he pointed out that the same range of incentives would be offered to new businesses in this area when the main effect would be the displacement of jobs in existing firms who had not had the benefit of these incentives.  I am amenable to the argument but I am not fully persuaded by the logic as it is an argument that could be made in respect of most incentives.  Perhaps the Minister could keep options open on this issue as the services sector is one that could be developed to a considerable extent through incentives.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Finance Bill is in line with the Culliton report when it recommends that tax exemptions should be targeted. The Culliton report is not as comprehensive as it should be because its terms of reference were confined to the manufacturing sector.  The services sector, the tourism sector and other sectors were not included in the remit of the Culliton report.  This might not have happened if we had remained in Government as one group.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider the employment potential in the services sector, especially in tourism.  Even allowing for the observations he made in the House today, the Minister might be amenable to introducing change where it appears to be appropriate.</P>
    <P>The improvement in the provision for equity finance, which has been a matter of importance for this country, is welcome. Again, it is a measure consistent with the thrust of the Bill.  The new <Col N="1080" /> initiative aimed at increasing pension fund investment in small and medium sized enterprises who need venture and development funds is important.</P>
    <P>The Minister signalled these measures in the budget.  However, a number of the measures introduced by the Minister in this Bill were not in the budget but adopted after arguments during the course of the Dáil debate.  Such measures are welcome.</P>
    <P>The ordinary citizen will not necessarily be involved in availing of all the reliefs and incentives introduced in this Bill.  If they do not have the advice or wherewithal to avail of these measures they will be aware of the tax levels to which they are subjected.  It is a matter of significance that within a short period of time the standard rate of income tax has been reduced from 35 per cent to 27 per cent.  I confidently hope that, given the thrust of the Bill, this trend will be maintained.</P>
    <P>In the 1980s it would have been difficult to believe that we would by now have a single higher tax rate of 48 per cent as it was then greater than 60 per cent and the standard rate was 35 per cent.  I have no doubt that with the thrust of this Bill we will achieve even more reductions in tax rates.  There has been real progress in the fact that 13,500 taxpayers will leave the tax net and that 18,000 people will benefit from being taxed at the standard rate rather than at the higher, marginal rate.  This is the the most significant thrust in a very significant Bill and I welcome the opportunity to support it.  It is very much in line with the policy pursued when I was a member of the Government and I am happy that it is still being pursued vigorously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In the early part of his speech the Minister spoke of the need for income moderation to enable us to surpass the employment performance of our EC partners.  In that context, in the context of what the Minister said in his budget speech and of what happened in the meantime any fair-minded person recognises that control of public service <Col N="1081" /> pay and public expenditure is a major part of any Government's efforts to balance the books.</P>
      <P>To achieve this, the social partners and the Government came to an agreement two and a half years ago which resulted in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  At that time we did not foresee the present recession.  The increases provided for in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> were minimal and the wage agreement appeared to be in line with forecasts.  The Government ran into difficulties in January 1992, it discussed these with the social partners and, after difficult negotiations, agreement was reached on how the wage and salary increases provided for in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> would be dealt with during the remaining period of the programme, to the end of 1993.</P>
      <P>In his budget speech this year the Minister stated that he saw difficult economic times ahead and wished to outline the difficulties he was facing to the social partners, particularly to the public service unions affiliated to the ICTU. During this period a number of issues arose such as the appointment of an arbitrator, the need to examine methods of determining pay awards in the public service and the removal of the limits imposed on various pay increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement announced last weekend between the Government and the public service unions affiliated to the ICTU did not constitute a concession by the Government or a change from the policy it announced in the budget, it was a restatement of and a recommitment to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  That should be stated clearly and positively.  The argument is an important public recognition of the need for consensus and a recognition by the Government that the trade unions moved towards the Government's position last year in a time of economic strife and were ready to do so again.  The battle is over, there will be difficulties with the local bargaining clause, the final formula for pay determination and the extension of pay related social insurance, all of which have been referred to by the Government. <Col N="1082" /> These matters need to be dealt with in the long term and I am sure there will be differences between us.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that last weekend's agreement was a reiteration of what was previously agreed.  However, it was presented incorrectly by the media, in many cases the Minister's Budget Statement was followed by an account of the decisions made at the weekend and the agreement was presented as a climb-down or a concession.  Members of my own union rang me over the last few days inquiring about the new agreement and the concessions it contained.  However, there is no new agreement and there is great confusion.</P>
    <P>I have been very critical of the Department of Finance in recent months because it lacks vision as to the direction the country should take.  I recall some of the great initiatives by the Department of Finance since the foundation of the State such as the ESB Ardnacrusha scheme, the rural electrification scheme and the establishment of Erin Foods and the Sugar Company.  These developments were made possible by visionary thinking, patriotic entrepreneurs and progressive Department of Finance and Central Bank policies which do not now exist.  There is no evidence of them in the Culliton report which has failed to grasp the realities of the problem.</P>
    <P>We should look at our economic performance over the last ten years.  Over this period our economy grew beyond all expectations.  In 1987 the debt-GNP ratio was approximately 150 per cent, I estimate that it is now down to about 110 per cent.  The Minister did not refer to this ratio in recent times, I would welcome if he could confirm the ratio when replying to Second Stage of the debate because it is of crucial importance in terms of our commitment to the EC.</P>
    <P>Before I become more critical I wish to give kudos to the Government regarding the Exchequer borrowing requirement. My comments on this matter do not take from what I have already said about the need for constraint and discipline in public spending and for achieving value for money from such spending.  We have <Col N="1083" /> an EBR of less than 3 per cent.  In the European context this would be considered to be very small, none of our EC partners would be concerned about such a figure.  Even Britain, which is governed by grey, dull, unimaginative Tories, has an EBR of between 7 and 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>We have lower inflation, interest rates which are even lower than those in Germany and an EBR which is less than half that of Britain and, as far as I know, substantially less than that of Germany. Thus, our economic indicators are favourable.  What has gone wrong?  We have done all the things we needed to do since 1987 when Mr. MacSharry became Minister for Finance.  The purpose of the fiscal rectitude since then was to reduce inflation, interest rates, the EBR and the debt-GNP ratio.  We have succeeded in reducing the first three beyond our wildest expectations.  We must reduce the debt-GNP ratio to below 100 per cent over the next two or three years but I have no doubt that this will be done.</P>
    <P>What has gone wrong?  I ask this question every year when the Finance Bill is being discussed.  In 1982 we had a workforce of approximately 1.2 million.</P>
    <P>The economy has grown out of all proportion and a huge amount of wealth has been created in the last ten years.  Various job creation schemes have been introduced. In fact, this country was almost turned into a FÁS scheme in order to create the correct climate for jobs.  Over the last ten years there have been arguments about the levels of emigration and the fact that if there were fewer emigrants and more immigration the unemployment figures would be different.  It has been said that because there are 25,000 people entering the workforce annually is not wonder the number of people unemployed is increasing.</P>
    <P>I have said this before and I will say it on every occasion we discuss the economy: the worries about the 300,000 unemployed are strongly underlined in media comment and discussion.  These problems affect everyone &mdash; the Government, the Opposition and Independent politicians.  It is a problem for <Col N="1084" /> all of us to tackle but, in my view there is a bigger problem, it is not that unemployment has increased from over 100,000 in 1982 to over 300,000 at present; the real problem is that we had 1.2 million people working in 1982 yet despite the introduction of FÁS schemes, business expansion schemes, and support for industry, nationally and internationally, there are now fewer people working.  This highlights our failure in this regard.</P>
    <P>Some 10,000 jobs are created each year, but 25,000 people enter the workforce. Therefore, unemployment will grow.  There was a reduction in the number of emigrants from approximately 40,000 to 10,000 two years ago and there was net immigration last year.  This has led to a higher level of unemployment. Perhaps someone could explain to me why fewer people are now working.  Why have our job creation schemes failed to keep the same number in employment as there were in 1982?  I am not using this as as political football; I am not saying that I could do better if I was in Government. I accept the good intentions of people at all levels of political life to try to solve the problem of unemployment but I ask that the focus be moved to the employed, rather than the unemployed, in order to make progress.</P>
    <P>I believe that the cause of the problem lies in the Department of Finance.  There is no leadership, vision of sense of mission in the Department, and I have said this on numerous occasions.  Departmental personnel do not worry about value for money; they do not raise their eyes above the bottom line in any page of accounts.  Their views is centered on balancing the books.  Those who should be concerned about national investment have no idea about value for money. They do not know if money is being properly spent.  They are more concerned about saving money and balancing the books.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance has no ambition.  It is like the hard worker, they never get rich.  It grieves me to criticise people who operate in the public service but the Department of Finance is proving <Col N="1085" /> that it lacks vision and mission in its approach to the Irish economy.  It does not have a plan.  It talks about balancing the books but it is not showing any lead.</P>
    <P>When I see imagination, as in this Finance Bill, I take the opportunity to praise it.  I see some imagination in the new tax measures which have been introduced.  I welcome the removal of the cap on the BES.  The scheme was abused by banks and accountancy firms when it was turned into a no-risk investment in asset backed and guaranteed returns two or three years ago.  A previous Finance Bill closed that loophole.  Why then were we trying to encourage people to invest in the BES? The cap on the BES never made sense to me.</P>
    <P>The £0.5 million cap was a great deterrent and lost many companies investments over the past number of years. Tipperary Glass, for example, could have had an investment of at least double the £0.5 million under the business expansion scheme of 1992 had it not been for the cap.  I support the removal of the cap.</P>
    <P>I smiled when I heard the references to research and development and the inclusion of research and development in the BES.  Some of us have pointed out the appalling record of the Irish private sector in research and development over the past ten years.  I did not check the figures today because they annoy and frustrate me but the last time I checked, not only were we the worst in Europe in terms of our investment in research and development, but we only invested half as much as the second last country in the league of European development. Belgium was the only country ahead of us, but even they were investing twice as much as we were in this area.</P>
    <P>This reflects the unimaginative approach of Irish industry.  This will be evident in this House in an hour's time. I invite the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, to return and listen to the debate on the copyright issue.  People have no imagination and they want to copy other people's work without paying for it.</P>
    <P>There are industries in Ireland which take advantage of the period after which <Col N="1086" /> the patent runs out on products but they can still be developed and marketed as generic products &mdash; usually in the medical and chemical industries.  For example, we now call paracetemol by its name but prior to this, it was marketed under a brand name.</P>
    <P>The chemical area of the agri-industry is dependent on the period between 16 years, when the patent expires, and 25 years, when the product is still useful to the industry.  An industry can take advantage of this period because it does not have to pay royalties.  This shows how lazy we have become and why we are not developing our own products.</P>
    <P>I was talking to a man last week who has an industry on the Border.  He was looking for someone to develop new products for his company.  He searched Ireland to find someone who would design and develop these new products. Eventually he had to employ a person from London.  He could not find anyone in Ireland to do the job.  This does not mean there are no intelligent people in Ireland but there is no market here and the people who design and develop new products must go to England to get employment.  Therefore, we lose out.</P>
    <P>These people who are good at their jobs will not charge high fees for their services.  Instead, they will design a product at minimum cost, but they will be paid royalties if it is a marketing success. This is an investment in one's own ability, but it is moving money out of the country. An Irishman, working in a London based company, will come to Ireland and work in the industry along the Border for six to seven months.  He will design a new product at minimum cost.  This person will return to London and continue his work.  If the product is a success, a royalty will be paid to the English company.  This means that not only are we not employing the person to design and develop the product, but the royalties are going to another country.  This creates many difficulties.</P>
    <P>What has happened to the shape of Irish industry and the Irish workforce over the last ten years?  Ten years ago, when the Minister and I were teachers, <Col N="1087" /> we described Ireland as an agricultural country.  It is no longer an agricultural country.  The number of people involved in full-time farming at present is approximately 160,000.  When I was at school, Ireland was predominantly an agricultural country.  We then moved to a point where the economy was roughly one-third agriculture, one-third service and one-third manufacturing industry. Now that has changed again and service and manufacturing industries have outstripped farming.  The agri-industry is different as it involves both types of industry.  That means that the agri-industry demands a huge level of research and development and, in particular, food processing and the development of the food industry.  That is not being done and we are losing out seriously as a result.</P>
    <P>However bad last year was economically, our exports increased.  There was an increase of over 10 per cent in our exports as the Minister announced about six weeks ago.  The previous year the increase was 14 per cent.  Over a two year period in a recession, we have increased our exports by over 20 per cent.  The work is being done and the market is there but the development is all wrong.</P>
    <P>I would criticise this budget on the basis of the 1 per cent income levy.  It is a disgrace and is no more than an increase in the basic tax rate &mdash; that would have been a more honest approach.  On budget day I spoke officially on behalf of my union and said that if the 1 per cent levy is seen to create jobs I would not begrudge it.  I would be the first to pay it and I would be prepared to encourage the 20,000 members of my union to pay it if it creates jobs.  However, I do not see that happening, and I do not say that cynically.  I do not believe that the 1 per cent levy will create jobs.  If it does, I would even support increasing the levy to 2 per cent.  However, the general belief is that the money will be used to balance the books.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy spoke about his opposition to income levies but, as I interrupted him to point out, when he was Minister for Finance he was not in a <Col N="1088" /> hurry to get rid of income levies; and while he might not have introduced new ones, he did not get rid of any old ones as far I recall.  I am sure he would have corrected me had I been wrong.</P>
    <P>In terms of our dependency on and our movement towards the EC &mdash; and I have said this for the last two years &mdash; the problem we had with the exchange rate mechanism and with the monetary system over the last six months could not have happened if there was a single European currency.  What is happening is that the money market is playing one currency off against another.  For any Irish person who has been abroad for a holiday, or for those who are in Latvia today, for instance, it takes about two hours to understand a new currency and to work out its value.  I do not see any threat to our sovereignty or our independence by moving into a single European currency as soon as possible.  The sooner this is done, the sooner we can sort out those people who make money out of our misery every time there is a problem with currencies in different European countries.  Those who target weak currencies could not do so if there was a single European currency.  Apparently the British have trouble understanding that but let them do their own thing.  It makes no difference to me whether I am dealing with ECUs or punts.</P>
    <P>In developing our economy we have lacked imagination, the private sector has let us down and the public sector has not given a clear enough direction.  I find the development in the tax base and the BES imaginative.  The scheme allowing a person to move into industry and to invest in an industry provided they take up employment for at least 12 months, and allowing them to claim a tax rebate of up to £75,000 paid over the previous three years in imaginative, novel and will encourage people to invest in industry.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy mentioned that when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs there was a support scheme for some of the Pacific countries, the ASEAN countries as he referred to them.  It would be worthwhile considering the case of <Col N="1089" /> Taiwan where, less than 20 years ago, the economic indicators were not much better than our own.  They have now gone to the top of the world league.  Thailand is following quickly behind and the Pacific countries, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, have a new market area in southeast China where there has been huge development.  Those countries were no better off &mdash; or were worse off &mdash; 20 years ago than this country.  I say this to illustrate that imaginative development can lead to significant economic development and can give the opportunity for a state to progress.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage there will be time to deal with specific aspects of the Bill.  I take the Minister's point that it is easy for someone to stand up and pick flaws in 150 pages of legislation.  However, the Minister is paid more than us to face that, so I do not have a problem with it.  I recognise that this Bill is an attempt to bring about a balance, but there is need for an injection of imagination in the Department of Finance.  There is also a need for an entrepreneurial and risk-taking element to have some influence in the Department of Finance and that should be reflected in Finance Bills in the future.  Let us take a chance and invest in our future.  It is not just research, development and training that is needed, education is also needed.  However, I will not deal with that now as I have often aired my view on that subject in this House.  A fault with the Culliton report was that it did not recognise that we cannot have research and development in a state without also investing in education. I hope the opportunities created by the Finance Bill to allow for imaginative investment in industry will run their course.</P>
    <P>The tax amnesty is a major blunder, and I will speak on that when the relevant legislation is brought before the House. I do not understand why the move on the probate tax was made but we will discuss these issues on another day.  I look forward to the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Inevitably this debate will be wide ranging because of the nature <Col N="1090" /> of the Finance Bill and its implications for the year ahead.  I would like to deal with a wide range of issues.  I would like to underline my party's main priorities. Our approach to the Finance Bill would be increase the equity of how tax is paid, how revenue is brought in so that there is a fairer sharing of responsibility, and, if possible, to take the burden off the PAYE sector and extend it to other sectors who at present do not pay their fair share.  Another priority for us is job creation.  I would like to address the Finance Bill from these two aspects.</P>
      <P>This Bill was formulated in the context of the wider European and world economies and at that time interest rates were unstable and it was necessary for the budget to be relatively conservative &mdash; or, at least, not as radical as we would have liked &mdash; since we needed to set our economy within a stable framework.</P>

    <Title>Copyright Act, 1963: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to review the Copyright Act, 1963.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for coming this evening to listen to our deliberations.  I thank the House for the opportunity to debate this matter of public concern and hope all Senators will get an opportunity to state their views.</P>
      <P>I called for this debate because, in my view, the Copyright Act, 1963, is no longer an acceptable response to copyright as it exists at present.  Therefore, I call on the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to give urgent consideration to reforming this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern arises from the sheer volume of representations from individuals and organisations that have been <Col N="1091" /> made to me on the issue.  Publicans, shopkeepers, disco proprietors and many others have made their grave concern known to me regarding the arbitrary copyright charges being imposed without appeal.  This is not an unimportant matter because it affects thousands of individual small businesses around the country. Often these small businesses are in a financially vulnerable position and can ill afford the punitive fines being asked of them.</P>
    <P>At present these charges are being imposed by the Irish Music Rights Association &mdash; commonly known as IMRO &mdash; and the Phonographic Performance (Ireland) Limited &mdash; commonly known as PPI.  Both organisations engage in the imposition of excessive and arbitrary charges.  For example, PPI has over 80 different tariffs.  It claims it is a licensing body as defined in section 29 (2) (b) of the Copyright Act, 1963.  If this is the case it cannot be too long before manufacturers of glasses, linen, furniture, carpets, etc. will claim royalties for the public use of their products.  This may seem an illogical extension of the Copyright Act but as far as I am concerned anything is possible given the current position.  The charges asked of small businesses are often outrageous.  I know of one nightclub owner who has been issued with a demand for £0.25 million recently.</P>
    <P>I wish the House to bear in mind that IMRO and PPI are not small operations. They are powerful international organisations with monopoly positions which they do not hesitate to exploit.  At present these organisations are using their considerable muscle to extract more and more royalties from individual small traders without reference to either the viability of the enterprise concerned or the ability to pay these royalties.</P>
    <P>IMRO abuse their monopoly in a variety of ways.  It takes independent retailers to court to seek injunctions in the case of disagreement; it reserves unto itself, by way of its licensing agreement, the right to raise charges at will and to increase charges retrospectively.  This is <Col N="1092" /> utterly unacceptable.  IMRO is subject to no control whatsoever and makes no reference to viability, ability to pay or even the usage of the music.  As far as I am concerned, neither the user of the music nor the creator of the musical works has any real alternative but to work with this monopoly group.  I have reservations about monopolies at the best of times, but this is a particularly unhealthy situation.</P>
    <P>At present the small traders have no right of appeal.  There is a glaring need for some form of an appeal procedure so that small traders have some form of defence.  IMRO seems to lack any sense of proportion.  By its own words it will demand charges from an old lady who is listening to a radio playing in her living room while working in her corner shop. There is something drastically wrong with the 1963 Act if IMRO can get away with describing this as a public performance and demand payment.  At present our small traders are totally defenceless.  The need for change is patently obvious.</P>
    <P>At this time it is useful to point out the importance of small traders to the economy.  They have a pivotal role to play in regional infrastructure, and they offer employment.  We are not living in the most prosperous of times and unemployment continues to grow.  Small businesses have much to contend with in this inhospitable climate without the additional problem of dealing with the outrageous charges imposed by IMRO and PPI and the heavy handed manner in which they seek to impose these charges.</P>
    <P>The need, therefore, to amend the 1963 Copyright Act is clear.  There are several proposals I would like to make in this regard.  Any changes to the law must address the fact that IMRO and PPI set their charges in an arbitrary manner, and can impose such charges retrospectively. The question of not having an avenue of appeal must be tackled without delay as they are available in other aspects of our legislative framework.  Why should our small traders be left exposed in this way? It is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough that these organisations operate in a monopoly, but there <Col N="1093" /> is also no control over the two agencies and this cannot continue.  There is nothing to stop them behaving in their current roughshod manner.  This must be tackled with all due haste.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Employment and Enterprise, Deputy Quinn has already indicated his intention to review the 1963 Act.  I hope at this stage that it is well progressed and has revealed the injustices I have already outlined.  I urge the Minister to take action as soon as possible. I know the Minister is committed to retaining and developing employment. However, if IMRO and PPI persist in their current penal campaign, it may result in job losses among our small traders, something we can ill afford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and welcome the opportunity to speak.  I am pleased the Minister of State has come to the House to listen to our views on this important matter.  I would also like the Copyright Act, 1963, to be re-examined because it has been fairly open in so far as those who operate under the legislation have a free hand to charge what they like.  They have gone to extremes and many are now being forced out of business.  At least one major company is in the High Court every month and that this is a planned approach by those seeking royalties.  Every member of this House recognises that successful artists and musicians are entitled to royalties. Many who give their lives to it &mdash; it is like breeding a greyhound &mdash; know that they may not succeed; it is an uncertain industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those manufacturing records also want to charge a royalty, it is similar to the manufacturer of the glass I am holding asking for them.  It was bought and is being used, but the manufacturer will never get a royalty for it and cannot levy new ones, at thousands of pounds, every year.  This area will have to be re-examined as little consideration was given to it in the 1965 Act.  It was not a big issue at the time and was not adequately discussed. Both businessmen and public representatives using this music in public <Col N="1094" /> are obliged to contribute and they have no control on the amount imposed.</P>
    <P>Figures illustrate the scale of these charges.  In 1987, one business was charged £3,690 which increased to £12,480 in 1988, these figures were levied without consultation.  In 1989, they increased to £24,104; in 1992, to £58,543 and in 1993, to £124,655.  The total court claim was for £267,830 which is scandalous and should not be tolerated by any country.  I appeal to the Minister of State to consult those penalised by the court. The law is so loose that the justice has no option but to grant the record company an injunction, they come back in a fortnight for an interlocutory injunction, which also must be granted &mdash; the person involved must pay their demand or go out of business.  Urgent legislation is needed to protect those in this business, whether operating a night-club or a lounge bar, and I call on the Minister of State to urgently examine the situation. There is no protection under current law for those being charged exorbitant sums. It will be serious if a number of business have to close because of this and good sense should prevail.  This outdated legislation allows many people to make excessive claims and I am certain the Minister of State will regularise the matter and introduce reasonable charges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the motion.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House, my support is not an usual occurrence, but it is evidence of the broad acceptance on all sides that an unjust situation prevails.  Senator McGowan made the case well in relation to the charges levied by PPI.  I wish to speak on behalf of the music users also and because of Senator McGowan's contribution and time constraints, I will focus mainly on the situation with regard to IMRO and their charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who play music do not object to paying reasonable royalties, provided they are fair and it is done within a balanced regime.  At present, two organisations collect royalties through agencies in Ireland.  These organisations were correctly described by Senator Finneran as <Col N="1095" /> multinationals.  IMRO collects on behalf of the Performing Rights Society in respect of writers and composers.  PPI collect on behalf of record companies.</P>
    <P>A third royalty organisation has come into existence, the Mechanical Copyright Protection Society and it operates from the same address as IMRO.  These organisations collect independently of one another and set their own charges.</P>
    <P>In relation to radio and television, each collection agency sets its own charges at whatever level it decides, without regard for the user's ability to pay.  If one fails to pay these charges, one faces court proceedings.</P>
    <P>In the past, price controls maintained a certain balance.  However, since they were removed IMRO, in particular, increased their charges by 2,000 per cent in some cases.  The situation in this country is different from that in the UK, where a copyright tribunal functions and deals with appeals.  The working men's clubs in the UK appealed a new scale of charges introduced by the Performing Rights Society.  The copyright tribunal reached a decision in March 1991 and it directed that the fees should revert to the 1983 level on the grounds that the value of the PRS repertoire was no greater than in 1983.  The PRS was obliged to refund the increased charges.  Unfortunately, we do not have a similar regime in this country.</P>
    <P>The Copyright Act, 1963, was enacted at a time when there were no organisations representing the interests of music users.  Copyright organisations had a major input and the legislation reflected this.  Following its enactment, copyright organisations began to take people to court.  They employed the best legal brains in the Law Library, while defendants were often represented by a local solicitor unfamiliar with the finer points of the law.  The silks at the time had a field day, they won case after case.  We have created a body of case precedent which works to the disadvantage of music users.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;public performance&rdquo; in relation to television or radio needs to be redefined.  It originates from a case in <Col N="1096" /> Yorkshire in 1932.  A hotel advertised itself as having a radio in each bedroom. However, the court found that the talents of songwriters and composers were being used to attract business to the hotel. Consequently, the court found for the copyright organisations.  However, circumstances have changed since 1932 and this matter must be re-examined.</P>
    <P>Copyright organisations claim that if a television or radio is visible or audible in a place accessible to the public, a public performance is taking place.  Therefore, they may claim royalties.  Yet, RTE, Cable TV and local radio stations pay the same organisation over £2.5 million annually to broadcast these programmes. Places affected by this include hotels, public houses, shops, garages, offices, waiting rooms, buses, taxis, hairdressers, workshops, etc.</P>
    <P>According to the 1990 annual report of the Performing Rights Society, the parent body of IMRO, £3.249 million in royalties was collected in this country. Collection costs totalled £787,000.  Some £2.538 million was sent to their headquarters in London.  Despite a detailed analysis of the accounts, I found no record of moneys refunded to Ireland.  I will put the Irish contribution in an EC context.  Germany contributed £1.28 million, France £4.2 million, Ireland £2.538 million, Italy £2.3 million, The Netherlands approximately £2 million, Spain £1.6 million, Belgium £1.2 million, Denmark £0.75 million, Portugal £71,000 and Greece £2,000 and Luxembourg no return.  It is clear that we are paying exorbitant sums to copyright organisations.</P>
    <P>The population of the US is approximately 80 times greater than the population of Ireland.  There are thousands of radio stations, television stations and record companies in the US.  The US returned only £10.6 million to the PRS headquarters, four times greater than our return, despite the fact that our population is one-eightieth of the population of the US.  As Senator Finneran said, there is a monopoly.  IMRO, PPI and the Mechanical Copyright Protection Society have applied to the Competitions Authority for several derogations from the <Col N="1097" /> terms of the Competition Act, 1991.  This is an acknowledgment that these organisations are anti-competition in the way they operate.</P>
    <P>Often, people are intimidated into signing contracts.  Agents are paid 20 per cent commission and their approach is straightforward &mdash; sign this contract, pay this bill or face a court injunction.  Three such cases came to light this week.  Last year a publican in County Tipperary paid £300 to these organisations.  This year he received a bill totalling £1,345 and was threatened with a court injunction if he failed to pay.  A business in County Cavan paid £443 in 1992; this year it was ordered to pay £2,781.  A draper in County Waterford, while waiting for customers, was listening to the radio.  An inspector entered the shop and demanded £50 in royalties because he claimed it was a public performance.  The draper refused to pay because he claimed the radio was for his benefit.  He was subsequently taken to the Circuit Court.  The court found against the draper and he now faces court costs of approximately £1,000, in addition to the £50 in royalties.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the implementation of a recent EC Directive dealing with unfair terms in consumer contracts.  As legislators, we are the guardians of the people who elected us.  If legislation is used to the disadvantage of the people, we must change it.  If people are threatened, intimidated or exploited in their legitimate businesses we must deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>As music users &mdash; and I speak on behalf of organisations which represent music users &mdash; we have no objection to paying what is due, providing it is paid to a regime which ensures fairness, balance and equity.  This motion has received widespread support.  Members, through experience in dealing with the public, recognise that a regime providing balance and fairness does not exist.</P>
    <P>The purpose of royalties is to reward the talent of composers.  I refer to a headline in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 12 April 1993, &ldquo;U2 may sue to control music royalties&rdquo;. I will quote the first paragraph of the article which followed: &ldquo;The rock group <Col N="1098" /> U2 may sue the British Performing Rights Society after it failed to concede to an ultimatum this week to allow the band to collect its own live performance royalties.&rdquo;  Paul McGuinness goes on to say several interesting things which, unfortunately, I do not have time to discuss. I am proud of U2, they are our fellow countrymen.</P>
    <P>I am proud of Niamh Kavanagh and her success.  However, in the days following the Eurovision Song Contest in Millstreet, the Performing Rights Society issued a statement giving credit to the two song writers.  Niamh Kavanagh was not mentioned I am sure because she had not yet signed on the dotted line.  When U2 were small fry, they signed on the dotted line and signed away their royalties. They now have to go to the UK High Court to try to get them back.  There is an injustice on both sides of this divide.</P>
    <P>We need to redefine what is meant by a public performance and to end the double charge in relation to radio and television broadcasts.  We need to establish an independent body to set the level of charges, and there is no reason for such a body not being self-financing. Finally, we need to establish an effective appeals system.  It gives me pleasure, on this rare occasion, to support a Government motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to listen to the views expressed in relation to the existing monopoly.  I congratulate Senator Finneran for proposing this motion.  I imagine that every public representative has received many representations in relation to this issue from small shopkeepers and dancehall and disco owners. Recently, I received figures from the new local radio stations, particularly the local station in my own area of Letterkenny. The situation at present resembles almost a legalised Mafia operation.  Previous speakers described the situation well and I will not reiterate their points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local radio station in my area, which provides a wide variety of listening material for all age groups, pays over £1,000 a month to the IMRO group.  It <Col N="1099" /> is costing the station £12,000 a year at present, and I have no doubt it will cost at least £50,000 in three or four years' time.  I know artistes who try to survive, make their records and give much satisfaction to the public.  They receive nothing back from this group and they are being ripped off.  This is why the situation must be examined seriously and why the Copyright Act, 1963, must be changed.</P>
    <P>The local radio stations do not have a choice in the matter.  They are asked to send to the IMRO group a log of their tapes for two days and a decision is taken in regard to charging them for those two days.  The more money the local radio station has, the better the variety we will have and it will not all be music.  I ask the Minister of State to take a serious look at the current legislation and the monopoly at present.  Those who really suffer at the end of the day, in addition to the artistes, small shopkeepers and lounge bar owners, are the public because if a disco has to pay large amounts of money to IMRO the cost of admission will rise.  Small shopkeepers will increase the price of their food to pay for it and the cost of advertising rises, so we all pay at the end of the day.  Will the Minister of State take those brief points into consideration?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Two minutes will be sufficient.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am concerned about this situation.  I have been involved in the entertainment business for many years, in New York and Ireland, and many people came to me in the past about Performing Rights Society money.  I live in a rural area where the IMRO may demand money from a shopkeeper because the radio playing in her kitchen can be heard in the shop.  There is something seriously wrong with the system. <Col N="1100" /> I agree with my colleagues who spoke earlier this evening.  If somebody pays once, why do they have to pay again?</P>
      <P>I am chairman of Kerry County Council and I have many problems trying to collect rates from business people, now not only must we pay one rate to the local authority, we must also pay the IMRO, the PPIS and the Revenue Commissioners. We are becoming an organisation which collects money for others. This will put small organisations out of business.  A man in my constituency is trying to run a music business in his pub and he must pay the IMRO five times what he pays in rates.  In return for paying his rates, he demands that we, as a local authority, repair his roads and maintain his sewerage and water systems.  These hidden people are on a gravy train&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, parasites.  These people have a hidden agenda.  I have been involved in the music business for 25 or 30 years in the USA and Ireland.  This situation is far more serious than it appears and is killing rural Ireland.  A previous speaker quoted £124,000 for one year.  The Minister would be delighted to get £124,000 from any business in this country.  These people are looking for £124,000 to run themselves, but we are trying to run a country and we must make a decision.  These people are cunning and they are undermining society.  If a shopowner in rural Ireland opens the kitchen door and allows the music to be heard in his shop, he is told he must pay for the privilege.  It is time people opposed that system.  The Performing Rights Society once threatened to take me to court when I opposed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new organisation, IMRO, is taking everybody to court, and it has the legal power to do so.  We are legislators and it is time we introduced legislation where one charge, paid through the television licence or to the Minister, would suffice.  The people in the industry could then solve their own problems.  Business people have too may problems &mdash; paying rates, taxes, water and other charges.  It <Col N="1101" /> is time we put this problem in perspective and arranged a single system of payment because this problem can only be solved through a single system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Finneran and his colleagues for proposing this motion. I have listened carefully to what has been said.</P>
      <P>Copyright law in Ireland must, of course, comply with our international commitments in this area, notably the Berne Convention for the protection of literary and artistic works and the Rome convention for the protection of performers and producers of phonograms and broadcasting organisations.  Increasingly, EC legislation is also having an impact on Irish copyright law.</P>
      <P>There is at present considerable activity at international level in relation to the copyright system.  Very rapid changes in technology are occurring and copyright matters are now becoming very significant in world trade terms.  The copyright systems of all countries must adapt to those international developments.</P>
      <P>The relevant UN agency &mdash; the World Intellectual Property Organisation &mdash; is convening later this month two separate meetings of the national experts of all member states.  The first is to discuss proposals for a new international agreement on the protection of literary and artistic works and the second proposes a new agreement on the rights of performing artists and phonogram producers.</P>
      <P>For the first time, intellectual property issues are included in the proposed new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  While the Uruguay Round of discussions has not yet been finalised, I anticipate that trade related intellectual property rights will be an important part of any new GATT and may give rise to new legislation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the European Economic Area Agreement, Ireland will be committed to the ratification of the Paris Act of the Berne Convention and to amendment of the Copyright Act to give effect to certain <Col N="1102" /> necessary provisions by the end of next year at the latest.</P>
    <P>The European Commission, in 1991, published a major work programme on copyright and has proposed a wide and extensive range of measures in this area. A directive on the protection of computer programs and a directive on rental rights, lending and other copyright protection have already been adopted.  A common position of the Council has been adopted on a directive on satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission.  These measures require changes in Irish copyright law as they become adopted by the Community.  Certain consequential changes arising from the EC legislation will also require to be made to the Copyright Act.  Other EC proposals are under discussion or in the pipeline.</P>
    <P>By its nature the copyright system is international in character and based on certain fundamental principles contained in the international agreements.  There are, of course, still significant differences between the copyright laws of the industrialised countries in accordance with the international Conventions as they are applied to the particular circumstances of each state.</P>
    <P>We can, I believe, take considerable pride in the achievements abroad of Irish artists who are currently very successful on the international music scene and in other artistic areas.  The income earned by these artists is, of course, underpinned by the copyright laws of other countries. These laws are sometimes more stringent than our own.</P>
    <P>On the home front, there are practical reasons for the use of collecting societies to collect royalties and distribute them to the rightowners.  I am, of course, aware of the systems which exist, the developments which have occurred, and the types of disputes which have arisen in recent years.  These are normal features of the international copyright system which could not function in practice without the use of collecting societies.  These societies licence the relevant copyright works to users and collect the royalties which form part of the remuneration of the songwriters, <Col N="1103" /> composers, record producers and other rightowners.</P>
    <P>The Irish Music Rights Organisation is a licensing society for the songwriters, composers, etc.; Phonographic Performance (Ireland) Limited collects royalties on behalf of record producers, with a special arrangement for performing artists. By the way, there is no legal reason &mdash; although there are practical difficulties &mdash; in an organisation setting up in competition with IMRO.</P>
    <P>Those commercial operators who use music for the entertainment of their customers, whether it be in a disco, hotel or wherever, need to have a central organisation from whom to obtain a licence.  If the songwriters and so on had no available representative to grant a licence, then disco operators, for example, could not legally play the music and so could not run their disco.  Its a fact of life, therefore, that the rightowners need a collecting society to license their music and collect the royalties, while the music users need a central source from which to obtain a licence.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances it is inevitable that disputes will arise between the owners of the copyright and the users of the copyright works.  I am fully aware of the arguments in this area covering the amount of the royalty fees, the bases on which the fees are charged and other related issues.  There are also complaints about the ways in which the copyright owners enforce their rights.</P>
    <P>The Copyright Act, 1963, clearly provides for dispute settlement by the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks in such cases.  The controller is independent in the exercise of his statutory functions.  I am informed, however, that there are 62 cases involving copyright disputes before the controller but most of these are in suspense pending the outcome of an appeal to the Supreme Court on a preliminary decision of the controller.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I have listened carefully to what Senators have said about the need for a review of the Act.  It is, in any event, clear that the international and EC <Col N="1104" /> developments which I mentioned earlier oblige us to make major amendments to copyright law.  Therefore, as I announced in the Dáil on 18 May, I intend to proceed with a formal review of the Act.  The difficulties which Senators have raised will, of course, receive particular attention. Any Act that is 30 years old, by virtue of its age, deserves a thorough review.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that such a major review of copyright law will involve careful analysis of the cultural and economic effects; the extent to which Irish law may deal with certain difficulties within the parameters of international copyright law; the legal obligations which arise under our EC commitments and the need for fairness and effectiveness in resolving disputes.</P>
    <P>However, there are a variety of issues which I can assure Senators that I will focus on in this review.  In the legal area I will focus on the Supreme Court decision on the PPI/RTÉ notification and an examination of the definition of &ldquo;a public performance&rdquo;.  Under charges I will focus on the amount and method of charging, the frequency of changes in tariffs, a speedier appeals system and whether there is scope for price setting by the Department and/or controller.  The area of competition will be examined as will the scope for competition.  I have a personal interest in ensuring that free market forces operate fully and fairly in this area which is a view I take of the economy generally.</P>
    <P>We will also look at section 52, to see whether this section should be amended. We will carefully examine the general principles involved in copyright law, and finally, I will play careful attention to the effects on small business and on local radio of existing copyright legislation. Senators therefore can be assured that a primary aim in reviewing the legislation is to seek a correct balance between the protection of copyright owners and the use of copyright material.  I found today's debate very interesting and informative and I have listened carefully to all the contributions.  I will examine the principles involved in those issues and will <Col N="1105" /> look carefully at the examples mentioned by Senators.  I will conduct the review urgently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in this issue because I worked as a musician for several years and I have also managed establishments where live and disco music was played.  I understand the difficulties experienced by both sides in regard to this issue.  It is important to understand that most artists who perform live music earn very little from it.  They earn most of their money from the royalties paid when their recorded performance is played to an audience, so there is a need to protect that area, and that is the function of copyright law. Unfortunately over many years, words such as performance and broadcast have been defined beyond definition by the courts.  To give an example, if I sang a song in this House, it could be deemed to be a performance, and Seanad Éireann would have to pay a licence to the relevant organisation.</P>
      <P>I have spoken to many people involved in both sides of the business and I understand venues using the copyright material are not adverse to paying a fee.  They would like some indication, however, of the amount of fee payable each year. They would also like an independent assessment of that fee to ensure it is just and equitable, and a proper appeal system to help solve disputes between the copyright owner and the copyright user.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister mention the issue of competition in his speech.  When I was preparing this contribution, I considered asking him to direct the competition authority to investigate each of the organisations involved in collecting royalties here, because there seems to be a monopoly in this area and if that is the case, these organisations are using their dominant position in the market to put people out of business. This has important consequences for live musicians, because if a venue cannot pay the licence fee, it cannot hire bands and musicians become unemployed.  A definite solution to this problem is urgently needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> The Minister will only solve the problem by changing the law completely, with a new definition of the terms used.  The nature of intellectual property, covering copyright, trade marks and patents, makes this a very difficult area, and the Minister will need a very precise interpretation of each word used in an Act to cover every possibility, so any legislation introduced could be very legalistic.  If, however, an agreement could be negotiated between all interests involved in this issue, a very short Act would cover the whole area, but this approach would involve a lot of work on all sides, and a decision would have to be made as to whether competition will be allowed in this area.  This would be the most important element of any agreement, and no conclusion can be reached on this issue until there is a decision in the U2 case against the PRS in the United Kingdom, and until it is known whether the decision in that case can lead to a solution in Ireland.  I congratulate the Minister on his presentation so far.  I know he is an active worker in reforming legislation in all his Ministries, so I wish him luck in his efforts to reform this area, and hope it can be brought to a speedy resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking in this debate, because the matter before us this evening is of public interest and of particular interest to two groups in our society &mdash; to writers and composers, and to vintners.  I am delighted the Minister indicated here what he intends to do in relation to the introduction of new legislation, which will be an amendment to the Copyright Act, 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to ensure that composers and songwriters are treated fairly.  Equally, it is important that vintners and publicans across the country are treated fairly and that exorbitant charges are not imposed on them for the privilege of broadcasting performances on their premises.  The ability of establishments to pay these fees should be examined closely.  We all know of cases where large extensions were added to public houses, but because of reduced disposable income and the <Col N="1107" /> higher rate of emigration, owners cannot now fill these premises.  An assessment of their ability to pay on a square footage level is unfair, and some other method must be used.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced in his speech he will focus his review on the legal aspects of this issue, including the Supreme Court decision on the PPI RTÉ notification, and the definition of a public performance.  I welcome this and hope the Department will examine the issue extremely closely, so that duplication and triplication of royalty payments can be stopped.  It is important in assessing the charges to set up a suitable appeal system supervised by a controller from within the Department.</P>
    <P>No group or organisation should be allowed free run throughout the country, without legislation or controls, without complying with international standards and setting standards for ourselves, and in setting those standards recognising the differences that exist between Europe and other parts of the world.  These differences also must be catered for &mdash; one cannot take an exact copy from some place in Europe because it may not reflect the reality here.</P>
    <P>Many people in this country are finding it extremely difficult to survive in business, particularly in rural areas as publicans. The number of charges, for example, rates, ESB bills and licence fees which publicans must pay means that many are paying more in charges than they are able to put aside for themselves. When we are attempting to create more jobs and to divert resources to rural communities it is extremely important that nothing is done to lessen the ability of people to survive in rural communities.  I ask the Minister of State to look at this matter.</P>
    <P>Will he also examine the situation in relation to composers and writers?  I would like them to get a fair crack of the whip and I am sure that the vintners and others who play their music would be happy to pay a fair amount.  However, a middle group is taking a substantial slice <Col N="1108" /> of the cake while composers and those who are trying to make a living in the pubs are not being treated fairly.  I ask the Minister of State in the course of his review to address this matter.</P>
    <P>Part of our problem is that we have become much too bureaucratic.  Too much money is spent on administration which, in turn, creates more and more administration.  The result is that the ordinary people &mdash; those who should be the real beneficiaries &mdash; benefit least.  The Minister of State should base his review on fair play, a sense of natural justice and equity.  I hope that when the legislation comes to the House this side will be able to support it.  If the Minister of State continues on the road he is pursuing we will not have any difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the motion.  Like many of the Senators who spoke I believe that songwriters are entitled to a fair amount of money for their work.  However, with many Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, I have received complaints from music users.  They are right to complain, because the vast sums demanded of them for playing music in pubs, nightclubs or other establishments, are totally out of order.</P>
      <P>One thing I noticed about demands is that there is not an itemised bill.  One simply pays up without knowing to whom the money is going.  I would like to know how much goes back to the individual and how the amount is worked out.  How does one know what songs are played in a nightclub and how often they are played?  I fail to understand how the overall bill is arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGowan read a demand for an exorbitant figure to somebody who had got in touch with him.  Senator Dan Kiely mentioned rates &mdash; which are a pittance in comparison to the costs paid to IMRO.  I was surprised by what Senator Howard said regarding the royalties collected in European countries. Most of us have been on holidays in European countries where music is continuously blaring from every café and nightclub and on the street.  There is no <Col N="1109" /> comparison between the quantity of music played in other countries and in Ireland because of the population difference &mdash; this is only a small country.  It is extraordinary that we head the league in royalty payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are nearly head of the league in paying money to IMRO and the copyright organisations.  I was delighted by the Minister of State's announcement that he will quickly review the Copyright Act, 1963.  Perhaps he could go a step further.  Until the new Copyright Act is introduced and there is fair play, will the Minister make an order or a regulation freezing all payments due and putting on hold all upcoming court cases to collect these moneys?  We owe that much to those who are paying through the nose for the use of music.</P>
      <P>IMRO as a collector of royalties should be much more accountable, because there is a dispute and because we have documentary evidence of exorbitant bills running into more than £200,000 in some cases.  Senator McGowan outlined one case; there are others which are bigger than that.</P>
      <P>To resolve the dispute will the Minister of State order immediately that all payments are frozen and any court cases pending postponed until the Copyright Act, 1963, is amended?  Otherwise, many will probably have paid excessive amounts while waiting for the Act to be amended.  These are the people I would like to protect.  Nobody has told me that they do not intend paying; they will pay a reasonable amount, yet people are receiving demands for, say, £6,000 one year, £12,000 the next, £18,000 the following one and so on.  There is no reason for such increases.</P>
      <P>I again ask the Minister of State to put all outstanding charges on hold until he has investigated all the allegations of exorbitant charges and brought an amendment Bill to the Copyright Act, 1963, before these Houses.  I hope the investigation is clear and thorough.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators on all sides of the House for supporting the motion.  The support is in itself an indication that the different parties have taken an interest in what has been happening on a national basis and taken into consideration that the representations to them require a response.  Obviously, the only adequate response is amending legislation.  I assure the House that it was not my intention in proposing this motion to deny artistes or composers their copyright royalties.  My intention was that an equitable system should be established and that the present system is investigated and shown to be inadequate and irrelevant to the 1990s and the 2000s.</P>
      <P>The Minister responded in a positive manner and I thank him for that and for saying that he will review the legislation. The music users will have their opportunity, as an organised group, to make their submissions and give their point of view, as is only proper when legislation is going through the House.  In 1963, it was very much a one-sided argument and loopholes have been found that have not been helpful to anybody, including the artists.  The group U2 are questioning why, out of a sum of £140 million collected, £26 million was spent on administration. The artists have no more protection under the Copyright Act than the music users.  As the Minister said, I have no doubt that all aspects of the European and international agreements must be adhered to and debated.  This time we will have a balanced debate with an input from both sides and I hope, in the near future, we will have copyright legislation that protects the interests of everybody involved.  Once again, a Chathaoirligh, I thank you for allowing this motion, I thank the Senators who responded and the Minister for his attendance and positive response.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that I will need quite that amount of time. Before the change of business I had introduced what I wanted to say.  The two main priorities from the Labour Party's perspective would be, first, equity in the taxation system and, second job creation. At the time of the budget and the preparation of the Finance Bill the interest rate problem in Europe was acute.  That has now settled down significantly and we can look forward to a period of economic calm and stability.  There will be scope over the next few years for more radical measures and a more radical approach to the budgets and the Finance Bills.  I expect we would be able to make greater inroads into the area of equity in taxation.</P>
      <P>There has been significant progress this year on the widening of the standard tax band as well as the level at which people are liable for tax.  In his speech, the Minister said that the implementation of this section of the Bill would cost £37.6 million in 1993, and that the changes would remove an estimated 13,500 taxpayers from the tax net while bringing a further 18,000 taxpayers from the higher rate to the standard rate.  I welcome these moves towards tax equity which, though gradual are in the right direction.  Our approach would not be the same as, for example, the Progressive Democrats' which would be to concentrate on reducing the higher rate of tax.  We would be more concerned with widening the standard band and removing people at the bottom of the scale from the tax net altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1 per cent levy is a contentious issue and is not something any of us wants to see in the taxation system for any length of time.  It is described in the Bill <Col N="1112" /> as a temporary levy, and that would be our view.  It was brought in at a time of specific problems but should not be part of the ongoing taxation system and, in my view, it should go next year.</P>
    <P>Taxation is used to raise money for public expenditure and there have been significant and positive aspects to this.  As regards support for families, £62 million was provided in this year's budget for child income support.  Most of that money was to meet the increase in the family allowance to £20 per child for the first three children, and a higher rate after that.  In addition, there was an increase in child dependant allowances and a £12 per week increase in the family income supplement.  These items are not in the Finance Bill but they were in the budget and are directly related because taxes are required to pay for this increase in family support spending.  My position, and that of my party, is that we must support families who are in difficulty and the money has to come from somewhere.  All sectors of society have to bear their share of the taxation burden, and we are in favour of greater equity within the taxation system.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn my attention now to the subject of job creation, our second major priority.  Senator O'Toole spoke of the need for greater imagination in the approach to job creation, and I would agree with that.  There are, however, some measures in the Finance Bill which do encourage that kind of approach. They include encouraging indigenous exporting industries through the seed capital measure, the expansion of the business expansion scheme and the removal of the cap.</P>
    <P>Other elements that are associated with the Finance Bill, although not a part of it, include the jobs fund in the Programme for a Partnership Government, the decision to set up an economic and social forum, and expenditure of the £8 billion in EC Structural Funds which we hope to attract, plus the £4 billion in matching funds from our own budget. All these elements are connected in the planning required for job creation, and they tie in with the provisions in the Finance <Col N="1113" /> Bill to encourage job creation as well as encouraging various sectors to invest in local exporting firms.  The Minister said he would continue to implement the various measures and would, if necessary, review them if they were not achieving what was intended or if loopholes were discovered.</P>
    <P>Speaking about job creation and Structural Funds, I have consistently referred to the need to monitor and review measures, to listening to what the people involved are saying, and to take those issues on board.  We should be prepared to change decisions when necessary because if one does not listen to how programmes are being implemented or look at progress and the target dates, or if there is too rigid an approach, one will not learn.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's plan to monitor the various measures which are, as he said, &ldquo;focused incentives&rdquo;.  It is important that the Minister would target areas where there is scope to create more jobs and bring investment into areas where it is needed.  Specific measures are designed for this purpose, and they include the seed capital scheme, the special investment account scheme, the various incentives for employees to invest money in their companies and get tax relief for doing so, and encouragement for people who are made redundant to invest redundancy payments in setting up business. These measures need to be specific otherwise they would not achieve their intended purpose.  We should not simply throw money at companies and schemes; instead we should investigate how that money is to be spent.</P>
    <P>The buzz word in management and training is &ldquo;total&rdquo; in the sense of &ldquo;total management&rdquo;.  My understanding is that would involve consultation from the bottom up rather than the top down with small businesses struggling to survive and with those trying to set up small or medium-sized businesses.  Its purpose, which is the correct one, is to understand the problems and rather than injecting money to assess how money should be spent.  That coincides with what Senator O'Toole said earlier about the need for <Col N="1114" /> imagination and understanding.  The people doing the job are those most aware of the difficulties.</P>
    <P>Specific reference is made in section 51 to a company called First Step Limited set up in 1990, a company that should be more widely known than it is.  Its purpose is to encourage the establishment of small businesses in areas of high unemployment and to help them with investments. If employment is to be generated, certain needs must be met and capital injections made available.  We must also be able to help with management and marketing and with the expansion of product markets.  In an earlier debate we talked about the dangers when setting up businesses similar to ones already existing in other parts of the country, of simply replacing one with another.  That must be borne in mind and was referred to also by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Much needs to be learnt about employment creation.  We must listen to those working in small industries and to those trying to set up enterprises, accept their suggestions and try to understand the problems.  If the problems were easily solved solutions would have been devised before now.  We have had high unemployment for many years and we have to begin to reduce the numbers.  Senator O'Toole said we have not created many jobs over recent years in Ireland despite our awareness of the problem and our attempts to solve it.</P>
    <P>An overall planned approach is necessary to bring the various strands together. These include this Finance Bill, Structural Funds, the County Enterprise Partnership Boards and responses to the Culliton proposals and especially for those trying to establish small businesses. There is great scope for learning and for understanding problems and for focussing and targeting seed capital and investment funding where there is real scope for job creation.  People have initiative, ideas and the incentive to turn these into jobs in Ireland.  They need support.  I strongly support the initiatives in this Bill which will focus on job creation.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Bill contains investment incentives for the film industry <Col N="1115" /> which has great employment potential. There have been many Irish film successes in recent years.  Irish people have the imagination to make films here, if the necessary injection of capital were available.  The Bill addresses that issue.</P>
    <P>The time extension for the urban renewal schemes is welcome.  In my city, Limerick, the scheme has been a wonderful means of developing the inner city. Limerick has been transformed by it.  The same would be true of other centres around Ireland.  That scheme could continue to be of benefit and I am pleased it has had its life extended.</P>
    <P>The changes in the tax assessment of married couples were mentioned today by the Minister.  There will now be greater equality for women in marriage for tax assessment and regarding the return of overpaid taxes.  The woman can now be seen as the primary earner.</P>
    <P>I welcome the trend of the Bill and I appreciate in the context it was formulated it could not be more radical. The moves towards greater tax equity are welcome, as are the steps towards targeting for job creation.  The 1 per cent levy should be removed as soon as possible. In future years there will be room for a more radical reform of the tax system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Finance Bill which has passed all stages in the Lower House. This Bill was conceived over a period of about ten weeks when the Government parties were preparing their proposals for Government seeking a radical solution to the problem of over 300,000 unemployment people.  The solution included a 1 per cent levy, an increase in VAT on clothing, footwear, hotel accommodation and other holiday services, a 2 per cent probate tax on property and a rearranging of increases in telephone charges which means 25 per cent of people will take the full brunt of the £34 million in increases the relevant Minister spoke of in this House some weeks ago. Following the conception and birth of the Finance Bill I can only conclude all of those working in the sectors mentioned <Col N="1116" /> will undoubtedly be in severe labour as long as this Government is in office.</P>
      <P>Members on the Government side welcomed these proposals while hoping the 1 per cent levy would only last a short period.  I ask why has it been included among the taxes on pay slips and not separately identified.  My conclusion is that the levy is there to stay.  The increases in social welfare and child allowances have been largely taken back by the 1 per cent levy.  The Government with its huge majority could have ensured it was worth someone's while to go to work and give incentives and provide opportunities to those who wished to start their own businesses.</P>
      <P>The biggest increase in the numbers employed in this country is in the Revenue Commissioners who visit businesses, small and large, throughout the country.  This morning, an individual who had difficulties making his tax payments contacted me advising that the Sheriff was not offering him any flexibility in making these payments which would help him to remain in business.</P>
      <P>The system we have developed over the last number of years is playing a major part in preventing people from starting up their own businesses and preventing those in business from employing more staff.  As an illustration, the Revenue Commissioners reassure people after an audit has been undertaken that the years covered by the audit will not be re-examined.  However, as soon as any moneys are paid, another section of the Revenue Commissioners requests a further audit for the same years.  The comments from the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; and their attitudes &mdash; are sometimes unhelpful, especially for those trying to maintain a business and keep people employed.</P>
      <P>Given the attitude of the Revenue Commissioners that everyone throughout the country has unjustly done the system out of money, how will an amnesty, at the give-away price of 15 per cent, bring the money belonging to even one person back to the State?</P>

      <P>Given the present system, there will be no growth, young people will not be able to start up businesses and there will not be an expansion of existing businesses.  That is the problem in rural Ireland which the Finance Bill fails to address.</P>
      <P>I am not surprised that eight out of the nine Labour Party Members in this House were not Members when the Labour Party was last in Government with the Fine Gael Party.  However, as I have been a Member of the Oireachtas for the last 12 years I can testify that decisions in Government today are similar to those taken between 1982 and 1987. People are demoralised because of the system and the only people who will be better off under the proposals recently announced by this Government are those who have not been honest in regard to the system.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the jobs lost in the clothing industry were not related to the increases in VAT introduced in the budget.  However, large numbers of people have been hit by VAT increases and jobs have been lost since the budget. Furthermore, it is a culmination of increases over a period of years which has contributed to the downfall of many companies.</P>
      <P>We were condemned for introducing a Private Members' motion on the VAT increases and the Government refused to implement our proposals.  However, it made sweeping changes in other areas in response to strong lobbying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was similar prevarication in relation to privatisation which has been on and off the agenda.  If State assets are sold one of two measures should be taken with the funds.  The national debt should be reduced or there should be investment in projects that create employment. <Col N="1118" /> However, under the last Government and the present Government the funds are used for day-to-day expenditure. Given this situation it is no wonder that people have fears that the country will have no major assets, continuing debt problems and high unemployment.</P>
    <P>Increases in VAT on hotels, accommodation and holiday services from 10 to 12.5 per cent, with brochures printed for this year, will have a detrimental effect on the industry in the coming year.  This is an industry that provides large numbers of short term jobs and with a major number of projects being undertaken around the country there is added potential for permanent long term employment. However, this is not the way to deal with the tourist industry and I am pleased at the reversal in Government policy.</P>
    <P>Two years ago, when the proposed abolition of the BES schemes was announced, I said that such a measure would have a detrimental effect on the numbers of people working on new accommodation for visitors to this country. At least somebody listens, even if on a number of these issues action is taken too late.  The reintroduction of the BES schemes will create extra employment over the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>I recall the time when a land tax was proposed, the Fine Gael Party was blamed by those the tax would have affected.  The proposal did not survive but now there is a probate tax.  It is proposed to impose a tax of 2 per cent on inherited property, even property of the smallest value.  This measure will be like every other tax which, when introduced, is seldom abolished.  It is a step in the wrong direction.  Reorganising the tax system, as proposed in the Culliton report, over a period of two to five years would go some way to ease the burden on people who are paying the most and finding it most difficult.</P>
    <P>I met a person last night who voted for one of the Government parties.  She was told during the election last November that there would be free third level education. She has two children in third-level education and a third will go on to third-level <Col N="1119" /> provided he is successful in his exams.  We now find that this proposal, made by the major party in Government, will not be implemented, there is no mention of it in the budget or in the Finance Bill, no tax allowance will be given to people paying the top tax rate of 48 per cent and PRSI which, combined, amount to 56p or 57p in the pound; no allowance is to be given to those how have to borrow to finance third-level education for their children.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's response to the proposal is set up a commission.  This is not much help because we know who is affected, people in the middle income group who pay the high rate of tax and have two or three children eligible for third-level education.  I know a family who, to allow their daughter who was very successful in her leaving certificate to go on to third-level education, had to withdraw their son from a third-level college because they could not afford such education for two.  A simple and easy solution for such problems is to provide tax relief to assist those people in the same way that tax relief is given to those paying mortgages.  All parties during the election said that providing free third-level education would be part of their policy if elected to Government. One of the Government parties is proposing the establishment of a commission and the other one is saying that it is unable to implement the proposal it put forward during the election.</P>
    <P>It is sad that the budget proposals and the proposed telephone charge increases which will affect about 25 per cent of the population are defended by Ministers as being part of the Culliton report recommendations. It is obvious that selective parts of this report are being implemented.  This is a far cry from the time when Telecom Éireann, in advertisements on all the television networks and radio channels, encouraged everybody to have a telephone.  Now that a large proportion of the population have telephones, the company says it can only survive competition by increasing charges for elderly people living alone <Col N="1120" /> and small businesses who will bear the brunt of the proposed increases.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposals for dealing with unemployment show that we do not have a very bright future.  We still await real action in setting up the county enterprise partnership boards.  Changes have been made to these boards which are probably an improvement on the original proposals.  Unless real power and sufficient funding are given to these boards we will not be successful in helping young enterpreneurs to start and develop businesses because costs are stacked against them at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Finance, during the course of the debate and when amendments are tabled tomorrow, will consider changing some of these proposals which will have disastrous consequences for the areas they will affect. Is the Minister telling us, through the VAT increases he has introduced this year, that over the next one to three budgets he intends to achieve a standard VAT rate of 17.5 per cent, when the standard rate in many other countries in much less?  The Government has gone down a cul-de-sac by seeking revenue from old reliables such as imposing a 1 per cent levy on incomes and VAT increases.  It is not dealing with the real problems.  I hope the Minister will tomorrow accept some of the reasonable amendments which were rejected by the other House but which should be accepted if progress is to be made in dealing with the problem of more than 300,000 people who are unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall strategy of the budget, which is clearly more important than the individual details of the Finance Bill, is commendable in its overall accuracy or in getting the balance right.  Last February, when the budget was framed, the currency crisis, which erupted in September, was still a major factor and the dominant issue in the international financial markets.  Interest rates were spectacularly high a few short months ago.  During September alone rates increased by 3 per cent.  On budget <Col N="1121" /> day there was every indication that rates would continue to rise.  In the Dublin money markets in February they were almost 16 per cent.  To say that the budget had a turbulent background is an understatement. It was set against the further feature of the longest international recession in the post-war era.</P>
      <P>The success of the budget, and, therefore, of the Minister and the Government, is most visible in the impact on interest rates.  Today interest rates in the same money markets are slightly over 7.5 per cent, less than half what they were in mid-February when the budget was framed.  The Central Bank which is the controlling authority, has on 12 different occasions intervened to reduce interest rates which resulted in corresponding reductions in retail rates.  Interest rates, which are critical determinants of the cost of money and investment, are lower now than they have been for any sustained period since the 1960s.  The overall success of the financial strategy, which I have briefly outlined, is more important than the individual details of the Finance Bill, important as they are and I will refer to some of them.</P>
      <P>We now have lower inflation, lower public borrowing and a higher balance of payments surplus than virtually any other country, not alone in the EC but in the broader OECD.  We know how important competitiveness is for a small open economy such as ours, we depend on exports.  Our economy is more competitive now than it has been for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic commentators, who are often the bearers of depressing news, are now more optimistic than they have been for some time.  Some of them have speculated that GNP will grow by as much as 4 per cent in 1994.  Clearly, growth rates are in excess of what is expected in other international countries.  We need better growth rates.  When I chaired the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment last year it was evident that we had to move quickly in terms of growth rates to maintain or improve existing levels. If jobs are to be created as quickly as <Col N="1122" /> possible, better growth rates than the international norm are needed.</P>
    <P>Employment is the most important issue for the Government.  The Finance Bill is a Bill for jobs.  There is more scope for improvement in the taxation area. However, some important improvements have been made in the taxation area which will help job creation.  The budget is framed and focused in that regard.</P>
    <P>Provisions, such as the seed capital scheme, are imaginative and relevant to the current problems and challenges.  The seed capital scheme, for example, offers an incentive for employees in safe employment to leave their jobs and start up their own enterprises.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment had a short existence of six months.  However, during that time a recurring theme among the various interest groups which we consulted was the acute shortage of seed or venture capital for development purposes for small, indigenous industry. Therefore, this imaginative tax refund on previous income up to a total of £75,000 for new enterprises should help to encourage people to start their own enterprises.</P>
    <P>I mentioned people in safe employment. Many experienced and talented people have the capacity to start their own business, but they are now redundant. The incentives in relation to the taxable redundancy lump sums under the seed capital scheme are important.</P>
    <P>A further positive development in this regard is the business expansion scheme which has been renewed for a further three years.  The lifetime cap on it has also been removed.  The intention is to increase the capital flow to small and start-up enterprises.  It is now widely accepted that we rely too heavily on overseas investment for job creation.  Two out of every five industrial jobs are provided by multinational companies.  However, we need to augment indigenous industry and help it to grow stronger.  In this context, the BES will help to augment the capital for indigenous companies.  The special investment accounts are a step in the right direction, because they should provide funds for risk-taking adventures. <Col N="1123" /> By international standards, we are doing well in the savings area.  There are abundant savings in Ireland.  However, where are they being directed?  To safe investments, rather than being used as risk-capital. At the beginning of this year it was possible for investors to get an interest rate as high as 15 per cent tax free on savings, without any risk.  This situation needed to be reversed.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill reverses this unsatisfactory situation.  Companies were at a disadvantage, in terms of income and capital gains tax, compared to the 15 per cent no-risk return.  The combination of lower interest rates and special investment accounts have reversed the undesirable trend which existed a few months ago.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the area of pension funds is being considered with a view to including these funds in Irish industry.  In that context, I welcome the joint initiative between the Minister for Finance and the pension funds industry.  I notice in the speech of the Minister for Finance that the pension fund industry has welcomed this initiative.  The idea is to remove obstacles which are forcing these funds to invest in non-Irish companies and to change that practice.  The hope is that substantial funds, perhaps £100 million or more, will be available as capital for Irish industry over the next few years.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about incentives for private enterprise and entrepreneurship. Ireland needs more entrepreneurs but a variety of issues have not facilitated that development.  However, I am concerned about one matter and I referred to it recently in the debate in the House in response to the Culliton report. There is too great an emphasis on the employee, especially among those who are better educated.  I speak from experience of university work where some highly educated people aspire to jobs as employees of large organisations, rather than starting their own enterprises.  The seed capital scheme is imaginative in this context because it is targeted at employees who would normally remain <Col N="1124" /> employees.  Through this measure people in safe employment or the unemployed can avail of the tax refund incentive to start their own business and to move from the employee culture.</P>
    <P>We need to do more in the educational system to encourage people to start their own business.  I do not intend to discuss this in detail, as I referred to it on a previous occasion in the House.  There are strong views about the curriculum at second level schools.  Academic subjects have been in the second level curriculum for a long time and should be continued. The Culliton report argued that a balance should be struck between the academic subjects and the introduction of technical subjects, without neglecting the academic subjects.  Many people may have an aptitude for technical projects, rather than for languages.  However, the two are not mutually exclusive.</P>
    <P>A lot can be said for traditional academic subjects.  I refer specifically to mathematics.  As a schoolboy, I thought that mathematics was an abstract subject. However, it is an intellectual training, especially for decision making with which we are faced during our lives.  We need a balance between academic subjects and technical subjects, with more emphasis on knowledge and skills, to provide a basis for enteprise and to facilitate entrepreneurship through the educational system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the positive elements of the Finance Bill, especially the incentives which I mentioned.  I have other concerns also in relation to entrepreneurship.  The context in which Irish enterprise must operate and prosper leaves a lot to be desired.  I am referring to the level of bureaucracy which faces small and medium sized enterprises.  Bureaucracy has it place and accountability is important. However, I am concerned about bureaucracy which impedes progress. This can stifle initiative and waste valuable time and effort.  I understand the necessity for accountability in the public service, but for someone starting a business or small enterprise, the amount of form filling is daunting.  Often the level <Col N="1125" /> of bureaucracy is unacceptable and needs to be streamlined as a priority.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the county enterprise partnership boards.  I welcome this initiative, which is one of several efforts at enterprise promotion.  We already have the area based partnerships in areas of acute unemployment and they are doing a good job.  The area enterprise partnerships were represented in the subcommittee system of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment last year. Several interest groups were represented, made up of committed people who had day to day experience of job creation and they contributed greatly to our work.  Although I am not fully familiar with the proportions of the national economic and social forum which is about to be formed, we will have the benefit of a wide variety of interest groups who can participate and contribute in a realistic, practical and informed way, as we found in the employment committee.</P>
    <P>I want to return to the point about bureaucracy.  We must always be vigilant that the various initiatives taken to promote enterprise do not get confused in a bureaucratic morass.  In the context of the county enterprise partnership boards that are now being added to the initiatives, there needs to be overall co-ordination and a vigilant watch kept on the various initiatives, so that we are not tripped up by bureaucracy and do not lose sight of the objective of tackling the most urgent economic, social and political problem facing the country, namely that of employment.  It is essential that the structures be kept under review to eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy. Every effort must be made to ensure that all branches of the State apparatus are as enterprise friendly as possible, as opposed to presenting obstacles.  While there are valuable incentives in this Finance Bill, if we do not watch the bureaucratic and structural implications of what we are doing and keep them constantly under review, amended and streamlined, there is the risk that we will give incentives with one hand and frustrate the system with the other.</P>
    <P>In the light of the Culliton report and <Col N="1126" /> the Government's response to it, I detect a new urgency in relation to the State apparatus and the kind of positive role it can play side by side with a private sector that will be encouraged and receive incentives in the Finance Bill.  I was particularly glad to hear the Minister say that he will report at six monthly intervals on the progress made on the response to the Culliton report.  It is already evident in the published response that there is a timetable for implementation.  That needs to be watched carefully so that the proposals and actions outlined in that response will be fully implemented as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The budget was framed in difficult circumstances. Fundamentally, the budget and the Finance Bill safeguard our financial stability and confirm our commitment to sound economic and budgetary management.  It is a Bill for jobs.  There is quite a distance to go with regard to taxation, but we must remember that there is space and political time in which to make further progress on the taxation front.  The Finance Bill is a Bill for jobs and that is what we need more than anything else.</P>

      <P>I have a couple of points to make in a general sense.  I am not an economist so there is not much point in my trying to get purchase on the entire matter, pretending that I know about material when I do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the tax amnesty.  I do not approve of it at all.  I think it is a mistake, particularly when one puts it in context of the remarks made in the last few days about people who are described as social welfare &ldquo;dodgers&rdquo;.  It seems that we are using the carrot and the stick and we are giving the stick to the weakest people.  That is the kind of language that has been emanating from the Government.  We are going to be very severe on people who, after a <Col N="1127" /> small amnesty, are to be brought into the social welfare net yet these people are simply earning a few extra pounds in order to bring themselves above the level of miserable and wretched poverty. These people are treated with severity while encouraging &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money back into the country.</P>
    <P>I happen to know where some of this &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money is and how it is generated. Some of it is generated by property speculation in the inner city of Dublin, as under the counter cash payments from well connected property speculators who are able to bypass the Revenue Commissioners by getting cash in hand and transferring it out of the country, or in a neat and almost abstract fashion by transferring payments from one Isle of Man bank account to another.  These are the people we expect to bring this money back in, to launder it.  I do not think it will work.</P>
    <P>I object strongly to this on an issue of principle as there is a disparity in the way we treat the weaker sections of society, the so-called social welfare &ldquo;dodgers,&rdquo; when we have an economy that drives people to that practice, while the people with real wealth are being gently encouraged to bring it back to the country. that disparity is not something we should encourage.</P>
    <P>It might be possible for the Minister to have a word in the ear of the Revenue Commissioners about their general approach to the public.  I cannot claim that I have been badly treated by them but they frequently send computer-generated, unpleasant letters to people without considering the paltry sums of money involved or the circumstances of these people.  The attitude of a small number of people in the Revenue Commissioners ought to be looked at and changed.</P>
    <P>I speak with some feeling about this matter because, when this tax amnesty for the super rich was announced, a 95-year-old relative of mine got a threatening letter from the Revenue Commissioners stating that the sheriff would be sent if this person did not immediately <Col N="1128" /> send a cheque for £250.  She got a similar letter last year and it turned out that they were wrong and that they owed her money.  At the age of 95 the prospect of having to deal with the sheriff is extremely upsetting.  This relative of mine telephoned the number at the top of the letter and explained that she was elderly and a little confused and very upset about the matter, and was putting a cheque in the post immediately.  The person on the other end brusquely asked for the case number and my relative asked the person to hang on for a moment so that she could look through her papers to find it.  The telephone was put down at the other end of the line.  That is not acceptable.  For elderly people the shock of such an event can have a serious impact on their health.  Personally, I could not care less about such letters, which go straight into the bin.  It is different for elderly people, and at the time when they are offering a tax amnesty to the super rich there is something obscene about looking for these tiny amounts.</P>
    <P>Most of the people in the Revenue Commissioners are decent and civilised and deal with people in a humane way but perhaps these instances should be brought to their attention and those few who are out of line should be asked to consider imaginatively what it is like to be on the receiving end of this kind of material.</P>
    <P>With regard to inner city renewal schemes, some years ago I got some recommendations included in a Finance Bill about listed buildings within designated areas.  I have asked several times about the take-up of this.  If one person has taken up these opportunities that is as much as has happened.  Could the Minister ask people in the Department to examine this scheme again and consider if it can be broadened a little?  I had very useful and educative discussions with people in the Department of Finance and we eventually came to this arrangement. They were clearly guarding the nation's capital and they were afraid there would be a haemorrhage.  The amount of money involved has been minute but if we are <Col N="1129" /> serious about our heritage we ought to be cautiously expanding this kind of programme.</P>
    <P>The very small heritage areas such as Henrietta Street, North Great George's Street, Mountjoy Square and others in Galway, Limerick and Cork should be exempt from property tax.  The cost to the Exchequer would be minute.  These were all slum areas in the inner cities where people took a calculated risk, put in their own money and much hard work, only to find they were in the situation that existed in the 18th and 19th centuries of being rack-rented.  Everybody recognised it was grossly unfair that tenants who, by their own efforts, increased the value of their property were clobbered. That is happening to people in our few cities who are restoring historic buildings, which is one of the objectives of Government. As soon as they do this they find themselves in the trap of the property tax.  I would be happy to have discussions with officials of the Department to consider some form of exemption.  With regard to town houses in particular, it is not practical to open them to the public for 30 days every year or whatever the requirement is.  There should be some direct exemption.</P>
    <P>I wish to move briefly to the question of Temple Bar.  It is time there was a review of what is going on there.  I speak with some feeling as I took the first lease on number ten Fownes Street in 1978.  It became the first gay community centre, the Hirschfeld Centre.  We did much work there and it was regarded very highly.  We stemmed the massive increase in AIDS infection in the gay community; there is no question or doubt about that. We worked for nothing and provided a service, which the Government of that period was unwilling or unable to provide, in terms of health care and community resources.  Not only did we pay every single tax, PRSI, VAT, corporation tax, etc. &mdash; I made very sure that we did because I was not going to be caught in any kind of shady operation &mdash; but we were hit for non-distribution of profit.  As none of us had taken a profit, we were penalised and taxed 20 per cent <Col N="1130" /> extra for working for nothing in the interest of the State.  That seems absurd.</P>
    <P>The Temple Bar property company was somewhat crass in the way it moved in.  It attempted to create an immediate kitsch culture there.  When I moved to Temple Bar there were two pubs, a barber's shop and the Project Arts Centre. People talk about the &ldquo;left bank&rdquo; ambience and I know where it came from, even if the people who have carpetbagged the scheme do not.  It is a pity that it is entirely tax driven.  It should not be.  There is a place for these tax schemes where VAT write-offs can be given but that only helps profit-making business. There should be some degree of cash injection for small businesses and voluntary groups.  I appeal for a review of the operation of Temple Bar Properties because of the way in which it threw out a well-known artist, Judith Guy, from her studio.  I understand that &ldquo;eviction&rdquo; is still a dirty word in Ireland.  The company demolished all of Essex Quay overnight and it put up a completely hostile development against the walls of the Hirschfeld Centre.  If there are the possibilities of great energy coming from Temple Bar is it not directly the responsibility of the Department of Finance but it should be examined so that there can be a degree of encouragement for a mixed development of small enterprises as well as the cosy circle that seems to have large amounts of cash delivered to it.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a brief remark about the £6 billion which may be treated with complete scorn because it is so naïve.  If I were the European Community I would not leave the money in the hands of Irish politicians to deliver.  I will tell the House exactly what I would do with it and the Minister might even agree with me.  I would put it towards repaying this country's debt, rather than building roads and interpretative centres all over the place &mdash; interpreting the bubbles on the Liffey. We know that many of them are a waste of time and utterly hostile to the environment. Instead of looking around for projects to mop up the money in case it embarrasses us by being put back into the pool, could we not just say for once <Col N="1131" /> and once only, give us this chance to put all of that money, or at least a sizeable proportion of it, against our national debt?  It might require some kind of legal manoeuvring in the EC but why not go for it?  If £6 billion was wiped off our debt, the Government would be in a position to reduce tax.  It is a naïve idea but it might work.  Naïve ideas sometimes do and I have plenty of them.</P>
    <P>I intend to put down an amendment on the question of VAT on health clubs. There is an anomaly in this area.  Health clubs are charged VAT but leisure facilities and quasi-amateur operations are exempt.  This is clearly unfair competition. I speak with feeling because I am a member of a health club.  It may not appear so but I have managed to lose over three stone in two and a half years through doing aerobics.  It is a marvellous thing and there is no doubt that it contributes to health.  The Government has certain health objectives.  It spent £1.8 million on advertising through the Health Promotion Unit of the Department of Health and then it imposes VAT on health clubs.  It is unfair because they are in competition with groups such as the ESB Sportsco, Loughlinstown Leisure Centre and the Aer Lingus Athletic and Sports Association.  I do not have time to read it all out but I have a list here of 30 professional clubs in the Dublin area that closed down in the last 18 months to two years simply because of unfair competition from places like these leisure, community and business centres, many of which get cash grants from central funds.  The GAA and rugby clubs are other examples.  They are able to provide facilities in which, for example, aerobics teachers can rent a hall for £10 a night and make £200 a night.</P>
    <P>There is a haemorrhage away from traditional health clubs to these groups that are trading unfairly.  I have evidence that they clearly advertise that they are commercial operations in commercial competition.  I have here an example of a notice that was in the Department of Finance and the former Departments of Tourism and Transport and Industry and <Col N="1132" /> Commerce advertising an aerobics class for £2 an hour.  This provided in a facility which received State funding but was not charged VAT.  Why not?  The criteria for exemption from VAT include teaching or training in arts and crafts, ballet, cooking, drama, dress-making, elocution, languages, modelling, music, driving of commercial vehicles, hairdressing, management techniques and selling.  Why can something like health care, which improves people's physical well-being, not be included?</P>
    <P>If there was sufficient time, I could put on record information from the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports in the United States of America listing the advantages of fitness in terms of prevention of premature death, cancer, cardiovascular disease, cholesterol, high blood pressure, body weight and composition, osteoporosis, insomnia and so on.  In terms of employment, turnover of employees and days lost, the President's Commission has clearly given evidence which demonstrates incontrovertibly that these types of health clubs play a vital and economically efficient role in improving the health of people.  Professor Risteárd Mulcahy, who will be well-known to the Minister of State and other Senators for his work in cardiovascular disease, wrote the following letter to the owner of a health club in Dundrum:</P>
    <P>Thank you for your letter referring to the problem of VAT being imposed in the health and fitness clubs.  It seems illogical that the VAT is imposed because the Revenue people have decided that clubs such as yours make no contribution to people's health. This of course is quite wrong.  I think that the facilities offered by the health and fitness clubs and philosophy behind the service provided by those clubs plays a major role in health promotion and encouraging people to look after their own health and that of their families.  If the reason for the imposition of the VAT is based simply on the contention that the clubs make no contribution to people's health, I <Col N="1133" /> imagine that this is something that could be contested in the courts.</P>
    <P>I would certainly give you every support in your efforts to have the VAT removed and I am taking this opportunity of returning the petition form which I have had completed by my colleagues Professor Ian Graham, Dr. David Kilcoyne and Dr. David Moore.</P>
    <P>You cannot have a much better authority than the State's leading expert on cardiovascular disease who says that this is clearly a health matter and yet the State is investing, both directly and indirectly, in unfair competition.  There are a number of ways this can be addressed. One is to have a level playing field and to start penalising health and leisure centres. This is not the way to do it.  It should be possible to include health clubs in the excluded categories, along with dress-making, hairdressing and ballet.  I know they are all wonderfully valuable, but does the Department of Finance believe they are more important than health and fitness?</P>

      <P>I wish to refer briefly to the investment incentive schemes which have been improved.  I welcome the provision of relief for seed capital investment by new entrepreneurs, including redundant workers.  People working in a company may feel that they could start a business of their own but there is little incentive for them to do so, especially if they are earning large salaries.  I am also glad that the limit is high because many of our businesses fail due to underprovision of capital at the initial stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I was delighted to see relief for investment in research and development projects, I became dismayed when I read it.  Research and development are two favourite topics of mine and I remember telling the Minister of State for Enterprise <Col N="1134" /> and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke, during the debate on Digital how important it was to maintain the research and development function because it had built up a good relationship with University College Galway and Galway regional technical college.  The company has retained most of its employees there and the new computer firm coming to the complex was partly attracted by the high levels of research and development there.  Many of our regional technical colleges, Dublin Institute of Technology and universities are greatly involved in this.</P>
    <P>There is little knowledge or philosophy of research and development.  The extension of the BES relief will only be for a further three years &mdash; that is 1995-97. One would have barely started in building a research and development area in this time; it would take a year to assemble personnel and to get projects started and at least three years before the company is up and running.  Relief should be given for a longer length of time.  What is suggested is not realistic.  You cannot put money into research and development on a quick-fix basis.  A five-year project is the shortest feasible time span.  This provision would not have been made unless somebody claimed that they only needed six months to get good research and development projects going and I would be highly suspicious of such individuals.</P>
    <P>While I praise the reliefs, I am also bitterly disappointed because putting a six-month time span shows a deplorable lack of understanding of what research and development means.</P>

      <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity to discuss much of what was announced in the budget earlier in the year.  I do not understand why we could not have had this debate after the budget debate in the Dáil.  Some type of a debate takes place on the appropriation legislation. There are many welcome provisions in the Finance Bill, which have largely gone unnoticed by the general public.  It is necessary to publish a short guide, similar to the guide on social welfare services, on the incentives contained <Col N="1135" /> in the Bill.  Even the explanatory memorandum is complex.  I fear that some of the professionals in the business are advising those who have money to invest that these new incentives do not offer much to them.</P>
      <P>In framing a tax system, the Minister of State and the Government must be aware that a deepening unemployment crisis exists; there are approximately 300,000 unemployed.  The Government has had some success in coping with the financial problems in our economy and our economic fundamentals are sound. Our inflation rate is forecast to be around 3 per cent this year, our borrowing requirements are as targeted by the Government and expenditure projections for March are broadly in line with what was predicted in the budget, yet there is an upward trend in unemployment which had disappointed many of us.  We had anticipated growth of approximately 2 per cent in the labour market this year, not 20,000 additional unemployed and we will be unable to provide employment for all of them. Worthwhile incentives must be put in place to create employment and reduce unemployment.  I ask the Minister to forecast the number of jobs which will be created as a result of these incentives because we must set targets in relation to job creation.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators referred to the huge amounts in pension funds and how they can be translated into sustainable employment.  However, with approximately 20,000 people joining the labour market this year, unemployment figures will continue to increase.  Urgent and immediate action is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will put in place a framework whereby substantial capital will become available for start-up small businesses and industries.  It will also provide tax breaks for investment in research and development.  This too is welcome.  Last week a group representing small industries published a detailed plan which is worthy of consideration.  It outlined how assistance could be given to small businesses in order to create employment, <Col N="1136" /> with little cost to the Exchequer.  Such incentives would involve long term investment in job creation and in industry.</P>
    <P>Employment opportunities for school leavers are limited.  Today in particular, we must focus our attention on those sitting the leaving certificate.  They look to politicians for information about future plans and policies.  What they see is an economy that is over-taxed to the stage where it is almost stagnant.</P>
    <P>We must return to a system where income tax levels may be systematically reduced.  I do not like the 1 per cent levy and it must be removed as soon as possible.  What were introduced as temporary levies often increase and remain indefinitely.  Such measures are unnecessary especially at a time when the economy is sound.  However, if the Minister for Finance and advisers believe such measures are necessary, I am prepared to accept that but this levy must be abolished as soon as possible, particularly for the lower paid workers.  The Bill provides for lower paid workers but I am not sure if this provision applies to the low income self-employed people.  This is an important detail.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Department of Finance, the Minister, the Minister of State and those involved in the preparation of the public capital programme.  Increased investment in the public capital programme will stimulate and create meaningful employment in public service projects and schemes.  This may be expanded into a number of smaller schemes; I welcome the extension of the business expansion scheme.  I ask that the figure which has been increased from £0.5 million to £1 million be further increased to £2 million.</P>
    <P>It is important that, under the business expansion scheme, big projects, particularly in the area of tourism, are undertaken. Such projects will attract large numbers of overseas visitors.  They must be located in key tourist areas.  Resorts such as Ballybunion, County Kerry; Salthill, County Galway; Kilkee and Lahinch, County Clare, have deteriorated over a number of years because of lack <Col N="1137" /> of investment.  The BES has given a boost to Ballybunion and Kilkee.  There has been considerable investment in holiday accommodation in some seaside resorts.</P>
    <P>The Minister must provide the £2 million mentioned in the original business expansion scheme.  I welcome the Minister's decision to extend the urban renewal scheme.  The result of that scheme may be seen in Ennis, County Clare.  Derelict areas in many towns could benefit from the extension of this scheme.  There are shortcomings in the scheme which will be overcome.</P>
    <P>The BES and the urban renewal scheme must be directed towards underdeveloped areas.  There have been abuses of the BES in large urban areas which did not need this level of investment.  I know of an establishment where the price for bed and breakfast increased from £25 per night to £75.  I do not condone such measures.  Large investment projects must be undertaken in underdeveloped tourism areas.  This would provide additional employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the income tax relief for an employee who invests up to £3,000 &mdash; a new limit &mdash; in his or her employing company.  That is a welcome and positive trend.  I am not sure if the majority of people employed in industry or elsewhere are aware of the existence of that provision and the Department should bring it to the attention of ordinary PAYE workers.</P>
    <P>In relation to the current state of the economy all the indications are that the strength of the economy will begin to show in the next year or so.  An upturn has taken place in the British economy, on which we are very dependent.  There has been a greater upturn in the United States economy, and while the situation in Europe is not great, the overall trend seems to be one of a rising tide.  With such a small economy, we should be in a better position to participate in developments which are taking place right across the European Community.  We can provide many more jobs here by encouraging processing and the development of our indigenous industries, especially small businesses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> The thrust of this Finance Bill is worthwhile. It should boost the chances of further businesses being established and increase the volume of our exports and technology products.  As previous speakers have said, agricultural production and incomes have been increasing and the rising tide of economic progress and our highly skilled workforce should enable us to create many more employment opportunites. We should focus on areas such as tourism and the development of a small craft industry.  A review is taking place of development agencies and the various organisations involved in the promotion of industry and we should not lose time in coming to grips with the unemployment situation, which is our major economic problem at present.</P>
    <P>In this legislation, the Minister is going a long way towards establishing a taxation system which will encourage intensive job creation and employment opportunities and he should be complimented on it.  While we would quibble and disagree with some of the details of the legislation, the overall thrust of the Bill is worthwhile and will make a meaningful impact on our employment situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some elements in the legislation which I oppose totally. Those are the VAT increases on clothes and shoes, the 2 per cent probate tax, the 1 per cent levy, the telephone charges, in addition to extra charges such as the £30 call out charge and the charge of £128 an hour.  All of those charges have been implemented in the last number of weeks.  Those charges, in addition to the increases in VAT and the 1 per cent levy, are putting great pressure on small businesses and on the general public and that should be made clear to Government.</P>
      <P>I would also like to draw attention to a number of aspects of the allocation of grants, one of which is grants for golf clubs.  Privately owned golf clubs can receive substantial grants but public golf clubs, who may have large memberships, cannot receive any grants from the lottery funds or any other funding.  The Minister for Finance should examine this because there is a great need to expand the tourism industry and to develop poorer regions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Belton that we brought in the lottery and we spent it well.  I would also like to draw attention to a very interesting part of the Finance Act, 1992 which affects many county councillors and the PAYE and business sectors.  Company directors are now exposed to a potentially large increase in their tax bills.  The legislation obliges directors of all corporate bodies, even directors of a charitable or sports organisation operating as a company to make a tax return, subject to the imposition of a surcharge on late returns and possible audit of the tax return.</P>
      <P>For the tax year 1992-93 onwards, directors must submit an annual tax return without being requested to do so by their tax inspector.  This applies whether or not the director has paid all of his or her tax through the PAYE system. The latest date for submitting a return is 31 January following the end of the tax year.  For example, the return for the current tax year 1992-93 must be filed by 31 January 1994.  Previously, a director with PAYE income only, did not have to file a return unless specifically requested by the inspector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The complexity of the tax return form will mean that many directors will have to obtain professional help to complete it and the cost of professional services is not tax deductible.  Failure to meet the filing deadline will result in a surcharge of 10 per cent of the tax liability for the year, including tax paid through the PAYE system.  For example, a person who paid his or her full tax liability of £20,000 under the PAYE system would have a surcharge of £2,000 if he or she missed the filing deadline.  That is very serious.  Members of local authorities or credit unions who are appointed to voluntary or sporting organisations may be <Col N="1141" /> liable for the 10 per cent surcharge if those organisations do not file tax returns in the nine months after the deadline. That issue has not been addressed in this Bill or in the last Finance Bill and it should be addressed in the Seanad on this occasion.  That requirement should be changed because it affects people who wish to get involved in local and sporting organisations or credit unions &mdash; organisations which provide great facilities throughout the country.  I propose that this section be omitted from the Finance Bill so that such people will not be liable for the surcharge as they have already paid their PAYE.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to private bus operators who, although they are registered for VAT, cannot reclaim VAT paid on the purchase of buses or diesel.  That puts these bus operators at a disadvantage. We need a better transport system and every assistance should be given to private bus and tour operators so that they can compete with State-owned and foreign operators.  They should be permitted to reclaim VAT paid on their equipment and on diesel.  Every other business registered for VAT can reclaim its VAT payments.</P>
    <P>The unfair competition between the ESB &mdash; a State-sponsored body &mdash; and private electrical dealers.  The ESB is permitted to sell appliances and the repayments can be made through the ESB billing system.  This issue has been raised in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Electrical shops should be able to provide the same facilities as the ESB.  A person who buys a washing machine or television from a private electrical shop should be allowed to use the ESB billing system to make repayments over the required period, and they should also benefit from the same allowances.</P>
    <P>Businesses that provide canteen facilities and may subsidise the cost of meals for their staff are not obliged to pay tax on those services.  Employees do not have to pay PAYE or PRSI on that benefit in kind.  In contrast, employees of small businesses which do not provide canteen facilities must pay PAYE and PRSI on their meals.  Where a luncheon voucher <Col N="1142" /> scheme operates tax must be paid on all but the first 15 pence cost of the meal. This severely discriminates against small businesses and employers as well as the restaurants which cater for them and, of course, the company which provides meal vouchers.  The rules are unjust and I do not understand why they have not been changed.</P>
    <P>Apart from discriminating against employers in small businesses, the tax laws also discriminate against restaurants and delicatessens which provide moderately priced lunches and meals, and favour commercial catering companies. Consequently catering companies have grown while moderately priced restaurants and delicatessens are forced out of business.  Prices in restaurants and delicatessens have increased as a result of the loss of their luncheon business to canteens in the workplace and they have become even more uncompetitive and expensive.  The tax laws discriminate against Irish Luncheon Vouchers, a company that provids a meal voucher service for businesses which do not have canteen facilities.</P>
    <P>In discriminating against small businesses the tax laws do not comply with the recommendations of the Culliton report. Their adverse effect on restaurants and delicatessens is contrary to the best interests of the tourism industry.  In discriminating between citizens they are unjust.  Such preferential tax treatment for larger companies with canteen facilities places small restaurants and delicatessens at an unfair disadvantge even though they must provide additional services, such as to toilets and staff quarters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak about the income levy.  The Government has carried out an astute public relations operation in its presentation of policy.  The income levy is called a &ldquo;temporary income levy&rdquo;.  That is the equivalent of taking a gun, shooting someone and then saying the person is only temporarily shot and will not be shot again.  People are obliged to pay the levy and there is nothing temporary about that.  Saying that the income levy is temporary is a <Col N="1143" /> public relations trick, a sop by the two parties in Government.  The levy is not temporary for the people who must pay it and it is not temporary in its effect on employment.</P>
      <P>We have heard many times that we must establish the right circumstances to solve our unemployment crisis.  Look at what has happened.  There has been an increase in VAT on clothing; this will affect one of our most important industries. I know from the experience of clothing factories in my area that the clothing industry faces terrible problems as a result of foreign imports.  Instead of taking those problems into account what did the Government do?  It increased the VAT on clothing.  That is a move taken by a Government that has gone mad, it has become blind.  It is a Government that says one thing and does the opposite. I am surprised that the smaller party in the Government puts up with such treatment. However, it also has many advisers.  Perhaps it is a Government run by advisers.  Perhaps the programme managers are running the country because straight thinking politicians would not have imposed this measure.</P>
      <P>Now the Government has introduced an amnesty for people who failed to observe the laws of this State.  Like a magician, the Minister, Deputy Woods, then puts his hand into the hat and pulls out another amnesty for those cheating on social welfare, for persons who do not want to observe the laws of the State.  At the same time, responsible people from the PAYE or the self employed sector who have paid their taxes must sit back and watch while these people are given amnesties.  We are told by senior Members of Government that the most important thing is to bring in the money. That is the philosophy of the present Government.  Who is supporting this? Labour, the party of change.  This change will not be forgotten by responsible people who pay their way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Probate tax is also introduced in this Bill under which tax will have to be paid on the transfer of a business or farm which may have taken a lifetime to build <Col N="1144" /> up.  The estate of a responsible individual who paid taxes, and has a certain amount of wealth, on which tax was paid during that lifetime, will be subject to a further 2 per cent tax.  At the same time, the Government is making special arrangements for those who did not pay tax due and who may have sent their money abroad.  This Government has lost all sense of responsibility.  When people disregard the institutions of State, the Government itself is sometimes to blame.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers who have taken the trouble to read the Finance Bill, I welcome it.  In the circumstances facing the Minister for Finance and the Government this year, the Bill and the budget which preceded it are a prudent mix of employment inducing incentives and creative tax measures.  I will concentrate primarily on the employment creation measures contained in the Bill.</P>
      <P>In a nation with 300,000 people unemployed, and with a still growing young population, the employment emphasis is entirely appropriate.  In the Bill, and in his contribution earlier today, the Minister recognises that a major problem for Irish industry, particularly for small and medium sized Irish industry, has been the perennial difficulty of inadequate equity financing.  The measures in the Bill take a very creative approach to that area. Without capital, ideas cannot be converted into products or into jobs.  That reality sometimes evades comrades on the doctrinaire left.  The package provided in this Bill contains measures both to assist in the capitalisation of existing industry, and perhaps more importantly, to help fund new start-ups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the features of Irish business is the unwillingness of financial institutions to provide funds when they are really necessary, and on the converse, indeed the perverse side, the rather openhanded willingness of those same financial institutions to throw funds at business and at well placed individuals when they do not really need them.  We could all give many examples of good schemes and businesses which have failed because <Col N="1145" /> of tight fisted and narrow minded attitudes on the part of banks, and a perusal of the public press would enable all of us to mention occasions when those same financial institutions have bolstered their own cronies with extraordinary generosity. Perhaps that is a debate for another day.</P>
    <P>The Minister's investment inducing package contains no less than eight specific elements including the BES extension, which everybody has welcomed. Elements of this package include improvements to and the sensitisation of the scheme, the introduction from 1 February last of special investment accounts, which were the subject of much inaccurate comment at the time, and the seed capital scheme, which is aimed at encouraging employees to start their own businesses. This ingenious scheme helps to overcome the perennial problem of finding initial working capital.  Under the scheme an individual can enjoy up to £75,000 immediate relief on investment. The Minister, his Department and the Government have shown they are sensitive to criticism about this scheme, because, since its inception, some fine tuning has been introduced.  The Minister has indicated that, as a result of political input from all sides in this House and elsewhere, he has redrafted the scheme somewhat, to allow any three years out of the previous five years to be chosen by an individual.  In this way he will help people who have become recently unemployed to avail to the maximum extent of the benefits from the scheme.</P>
    <P>The section 27 provisions introduce a welcome extension to roll-over relief for capital gains tax.  Under the new arrangements, an investor can cash in shares in a company and reinvest in manufacturing or in specific service industries, deferring the capital gains tax.  This will be a useful inducement of capital into small manufacturing and service industry, and the Minister has taken pains to avoid problems that existed previously by being very specific about where this particular inducement can be availed of.  Bringing research and development activities into the business expansion scheme is a welcome <Col N="1146" /> development.  The research and development area is historically an area where Irish firms have been deficient. Without research and development, companies inevitably stagnate.  New products, processes and technologies are vital to long term growth.  The extension of the business expansion scheme umbrella to research and development must be welcomed by anybody interested in Irish industry, in Irish services or in Irish employment.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a target for the creation of a £100 million venture or development capital fund to be subscribed by pension funds is another initiative which I regard as worthwhile and commendable.  Pension funds and other institutional investors in Ireland have historically shied away from investment in small and medium sized industries. Ironically while Irish industry has often been starved for capital, Irish pension funds and institutional investors have effectively been exporting capital to safe, secure, often poor earning investments outside the country.  It is time that investment by pension funds came under scrutiny.  While no potential pensioner wants chances taken with pension funds, it is reasonable to assume that most pension contributors would like, if they were asked, to see Irish pension funds invested in a way which would be beneficial to themselves and to the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister introduced a number of new tax break schemes aimed at making more capital available for productive and job creating investment, he has also had the courage to recognise that earlier schemes become tools for enhancing the private take of unscrupulous and well placed individuals.  With the help of tax advisers who themselves are not overburdened with conscience, they come up with new and ingenuous ways to avoid meeting their tax obligations. We have all been offended by stories that have been made public in recent times of people using extraordinary ingenuity to pervert tax schemes which were put in place to induce investment and employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1147" /> An illustration of this form of antisocial behaviour can be found in the activities of senior personnel in one of the building societies.  Some time back a new tax break was introduced on patent earnings. In a country that recognises that earnings from artistic endeavour are eligible for special tax treatment it is reasonable to extend that privilege to the intellectual property of the investor.  When the Government introduced such a tax inducement I, like everyone else, welcomed it.  I believed that it was a good measure aimed at enhancing and encouraging innovation, yet these laudable arrangements have been abused by people in high places.</P>
    <P>In the case of the building society I mentioned special software to handle the needs of the society was devised by a software house specialising in that area. This software was then registered as the design of a subsidiary company of the building society and senior personnel from the society in question received payments from the subsidiary.  As these represented the earnings of intellectual property they attracted the most advantaged tax rate.  In other words, a scheme which was brought into operation for the very best of reasons was perverted into a conduit through which the greedy could grab more.  They had not invented any process nor had they contributed in any way to the development of the software in question.  Their sole contribution to the sum of human knowledge was to come up with yet another elegant tax scam and they were able to get away with it.</P>
    <P>Something needs to be done about that because it is an offence to every taxpayer in the nation.  I applaud, therefore, the fact that this Minister has set about weeding out arrangements which, whatever their original intention, have become little more than new forms of &mdash; to use a euphemism which is all too current of late &mdash; tax efficient payment systems.  I compliment the Minister on that work.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister should go a step further.  I accept that he has undertaken to keep all the tax based inducements which he has introduced in this Bill under <Col N="1148" /> review and will, if necessary, do some fine tuning to ensure that they do not become bolt-holes for the greedy.  I would like the Minister and his officials to turn their minds to the introduction of some legal advice which would allow the Revenue Commissioners to claw back any tax avoided by the perverse use of inducement schemes.  If such a device could be designed it would strike a blow for the vast majority of decent people who pay their due taxes and bring the smart alecs to boot; it would be beneficial to the economy in the long term and rewarding to the Exchequer.  I am not sure what form such a legal device would take, but I am convinced, given all the evidence amassed over the last five or six years about the abundant capacity to abuse tax schemes, that something along these lines is necessary.</P>
    <P>New or amended schemes are just one plank in the Minister's employment platform. The rationalisation of the tax treatment of scrip dividends, new arrangements allowing businesses supplying export industries to avail of zero VAT rating, special car hire arrangements in the tourism industry, the extension of the final date on the urban renewal scheme, the new arrangements to encourage investment in the film industry, special stock release for farmers to assist herd development and the removal of stamp duty on corporate funds add up to a formidable range of initiatives aimed at improving investment and job creation.  There has not been a fair or rational debate on this here or in the other House.  The contributions of the Opposition have not given due recognition to how adventurous this Finance Bill is.</P>
    <P>In an earlier contribution the point was made that new incentives are not in themselves enough, it was suggested that in addition to incentives we should be looking at the disincentives to job creation. The warning in that contribution concerned excessive bureacracy and its impact on job creation.  We are naturally inclined towards excessive bureaucracy: it has grown to a point where excessive regulation is a very real impediment to <Col N="1149" /> job creation and business.  I will go further and suggest that excessive regulation and the &ldquo;job's worth&rdquo; mentality that often exist in our public administration has reached the point where it may well negate, in part if not entirely, the beneficial impact of the tax inducements which the Minister and his immediate predecessors introduced.</P>
    <P>This is not the time to go into the matter in great detail, but the point can be illustrated by the manner in which we operate EC regulations and our own planning laws.  EC regulations are applied with a vigour not evident in other member states.  Within yards of my own home, for example, a butcher slaughters in his own abattoir.  He is being driven out of business by a combination of excessive adherence to the letter of EC regulations, as interpreted by officials from the Department of Agriculture and Food, and the excessive observance of planning rules by the county council.  Although this man gives good employment and has never been the cause of a complaint he is likely to be driven out of business, because every official seems to take the view that it is more than their job is worth to apply common sense as well as the rules.</P>
    <P>The farcical twists and turns that we have gone through over whether the Office of Public Works can build is another example of this national malady. When grand public administration reform strategies &mdash; along the lines of the Devlin report here &mdash; failed in other OECD states, those nations turned to more specific strategies.  One of the strategies adopted by almost every one of the most developed OECD nations was to look at &mdash; and I know it is a cumbersome title &mdash; debureaucratisation policies which aim to limit public regulation and bureaucracy to the very minimum consistent with good public administration.</P>
    <P>We have no equivalent in operation. We need to slash away unnecessary regulation and to deregulate where possible. We should, for example, extend the type of audit that operates in public administration outside the purely financial area. We could copy the type of form audit <Col N="1150" /> agency in France and probably go a step further by introducing an administrative systems audit to limit to the minimum necessary any form of administrative activity or regulation.  As Members know, this is an area close to my heart and I will probably return to it in future debates; it is not appropriate to go into detail now.</P>
    <P>There have been many improvements in personal income tax since 1987 and the current position is better than when personal income tax rates rocketed in the mid-1980s.  I have always defended the measures taken in the last five years on personal income tax &mdash; not just on a partisan basis.  Nevertheless, personal income taxpayers perceive the tax burden on them as excessive and in spite of the changes it remains excessive.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the standard rate has been cut from 35 per cent to 27 per cent and there is now only a single higher rate of 48 per cent.  That was because of the political courage and willingness to address the issues in public finance.  I also welcome the additional income tax relief totalling almost £38 million in this budget.  The increase in the interest rate ceiling is also welcome.  Its impact and the impact of the lower interest rates have not received the publicity or acknowledgment they deserve from people and parties who were critical of the Government in 1992 when interest rates were moving in the opposite direction.  However, that is the nature of politics and it would be naive to expect generosity in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am less happy with the 1 per cent levy and the amnesty proposals.  The latter has caused a great deal of understandable resentment among compliant taxpayers and PAYE payers.  If this group is to continue to have faith in the equity of the tax system, they must see a substantial yield to the Exchequer from this amnesty and very real evidence that tax evaders are brought increasingly to boot.  Many of those engaged in the so-called liberal professions, who are in receipt of cash payments, skim off substantial money for investments, frequently outside the State or alternatively for burial in nominee accounts.  This must be stopped.  It is an <Col N="1151" /> abuse by people who regard themselves as being at the upper end of society.  It is an abuse that is endemic, particularly, in the medical and dental professions and we have to establish some form of policing arrangements to bring it to an end. The tax codes must be adhered to at all times.</P>
    <P>I wish to speak about the 1 per cent levy.  I have never spoken in either House against the expansion of the tax system. Our tax base is too narrow and falls too heavily on the shoulders of the PAYE taxpayers.  Nonetheless, I do not like the idea of any, across the board, levy on income.  If services are worth providing &mdash; and the services which are being provided by the levy are &mdash; they are worth providing from general taxation.  I hope that the 1 per cent levy is a temporary provision and that it will be terminated at the earliest possible date.  I say this while being conscious from economic history that income tax was introduced during the Napoleonic Wars as a temporary levy to be abolished as soon as the hostilities in Europe came to an end.</P>
    <P>I had, therefore, just two criticisms of the Bill and I have made them.  The Bill, as a whole, deserves the endorsement of this House and the Minister deserves the compliments of the Members of the House.  The Bill does not deserve the mindless criticism which it has received from the Opposition.  I compliment the Minister and I will be pleased to support this Bill.</P>

      <P>In this budget, everybody expected that there would be some new initiatives in relation to job creation because, as the Minister and the Government said, unemployment is the major problem facing this Government and the area on which it will be judged.  The majority of people expected moves <Col N="1152" /> towards further tax reform and that there would be greater fairness in the distribution of the tax burden.  This budget could not be said to be pro-employment. The recent report of the Central Bank emphasised the negative and damaging effects that the tax wedge is having on the labour market.  The 1 per cent levy which was introduced in this budget increased the tax wedge.  This is an issue about which we, in the Progressive Democrats, have always been talking.</P>
      <P>When we were in Government, we tried to ensure that, however slight, the wedge between the cost for an employer of employing somebody and what the worker would take home in his pay packet was reduced each year.  I appreciate it is extremely difficult to do that but it is generally perceived that the PAYE workers bear the brunt of the taxation burden.  In the past number of years, as Senator Roche said, they have been getting some indication that the Government was looking after them but that certainly stopped in this budget.  I cannot understand how any Government which says that it is pro-employment could impose a 1 per cent levy on people who are earning £173 a week, which is below the average industrial wage.  It is a flat rate of tax on all income and because of that it has led to an increase in the burden on PAYE workers.  We, as a party, gave a commitment that we would try to reduce tax rates and when we were in Government we did that.  If we were in Government now, the 1 per cent levy would not have been introduced in this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Workers tend to think that the cost of employment is just what they get into their pocket at the end of the week but the employer has to take the gross cost into account.  There are now no fewer than five different taxes on work.  We tend to tax work as a luxury.  The five different taxes are income tax, employers' and employees' PRSI, health contributions, the training levy and now the 1 per cent income levy.  We talked previously about the Culliton report and employment through enterprise, Deputy Quinn was in the House to discuss <Col N="1153" /> it.  The Culliton report stated that our tax system and how we choose to adapt it represents the single most effect tool at the disposal of Government if it wishes to create an enterprise society.  I agree.  It is not the only thing that can be done but it has a major impact on employment and that is why the actions of the Government are very strange.  The Government protests that greater employment creation is its top priority and talks about a pro-jobs budget.  Sadly, its actions speak louder than words. Workers are disheartened and dismayed by the imposition of the 1 per cent levy. The Minister said that if we want to provide the level of services required this is the means of doing it.  I hope that it will be a temporary levy.  In relation to the tax amnesty, the PAYE workers expect they will be given relief in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that two-thirds of the clothing produced in this country is exported and that there is no VAT on it. He also said that two-thirds of the clothes sold in the shops are imported and that the same rate of VAT applies to those as applies to the clothes produced in this country.  The clothing industry is labour intensive but the retailing and drapery trade is also quite extensive and employs many people.  In rural areas or in smaller towns, the family grocer and the smaller grocery shops are closing down.  In the past number of years drapery shops have closed down and the increase in VAT will put the tin hat on it.  We will have ghost towns around the country.  We talk about rural development and keeping people in rural Ireland.  By bringing in proposals that will close small grocery and drapery shops, we are reducing the only employment available in many towns.  I oppose it for that reason.</P>
    <P>There is a general perception that if people are making millions the Government will look after them.  This is the signal being given out through the tax amnesty.  The small businessman or PAYE worker who constantly pay their taxes year after year are being given bad signals.  People are prepared to make sacrifices but they must understand and believe that the principle of fairness in <Col N="1154" /> taxation is paramount in the Government's mind and that the distribution of the tax burden is fair &mdash; and seen to be fair.</P>
    <P>The Minister will make the point that a certain level of services must be provided and that cannot be done unless taxes are collected.  We talk about tax reform but people object to each new tax introduced. I do not accept that broadening the tax base and reducing the rate of income tax will leave everyone better off in every circumstance.  There has to be trade-offs where some people benefit and some lose out, but those who lose out should be those favoured at the moment. That is what everybody means by tax reform.  The people who are now paying what they perceive to be, and what is, an unfair share are those who should benefit from tax reform.  The people whom Senator Roche talked about, who are not paying their fair share, should be brought into the tax net and not afforded the benefits of a tax amnesty at 15 per cent. It is difficult to convince ordinary people that this is a fair taxation system if that is how we treat them.</P>
    <P>I would also like to deal with the probate tax.  It is strange that the Minister reintroduced this measure which was abolished in 1974 by the then Coalition Government because it was inequitable and unfair.  The capital acquisitions tax was introduced as an alternative and I cannot understand why the Minister could not have increased the rates of this tax instead of introducing the new tax which affects people who are not well off. The threshold is only £10,000, the same as it was in 1974, but since then the cost of living has gone up by 560 per cent.  On Committee Stage in the other House the Minister said that if the threshold had been raised to £50,000 one third of the people who will now be liable to pay this tax would not be liable.  If the threshold was raised to £100,000 almost two thirds of those people would not be liable.  The small person, who does not have much money and will not inherit a lot of money, will end up paying this tax, which is unfair.  We must return to the principle of fairness.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1155" /> I welcome section 10 which was introduced on Committee Stage in the other House and in which the Minister made changes in relation to the taxation of married couples in response to the recommendations by the Commission on the Status of Women.  Although I welcome and appreciate the changes, the Minister should have gone further.  The commission recommended separate tax assessments rather than a joint assessment for married couples, and felt that, in relation to married women who had been out of the workforce and were returning to work, in general the husband tended to have all the allowances, including tax at the lower rate.  When women returned to the workforce they went in at a high rate of tax and the only allowances they had were in relation to PAYE and PRSI.  Inevitably, many men advised their wives that it was not worthwhile to work, and when wives looked at what they were getting at the end of the week, because they were paying tax at the marginal rate, they agreed.  This was the reason we wanted separate assessment to be the norm unless a couple opted for joint assessment.  It is an important issue because women's earnings would then be greater and men could not claim that it was hardly worth a woman's while to return to work.  This was the principle that the Commission on the Status of Women recommended and I hope that, next year, the Minister will continue along these lines.  I welcome the reforms and hope the Minister will adopt the principle of fairness and try to show ordinary people that this is the direction we are taking.</P>

      <P>In recent years the public have taken a great interest in the Finance Bill.  Some years ago it was just the budget, but they know now that the Finance Bill gives effect to the budget. Unfortunately, for the vast majority of people, the 1993 Finance Bill is particularly complex legislation and many of its sections require careful study before passing judgment on them.  One thing is clear, however, the Bill provides no <Col N="1156" /> progress towards fundamental tax reform, as has been stated by other Senators, and confirms the kick in the teeth to the PAYE sector in the form of the 1 per cent levy.  Imagine imposing a 1 per cent levy with the support of a socialist party when people are marginalised and on the bread line and complaining about the hole tax and PRSI makes in their wage packets.</P>
      <P>As the Government indicated its support for the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Culliton report, it is disappointing that it has not availed of the opportunity presented by the Finance Bill to review the 1 per cent levy which will apply to all but the lowest paid workers and which flies in the face of the Culliton recommendations.  Culliton was the doctrine preached but where is Culliton now?  What is being implemented? Nothing has happened and nothing will because it is all empty rhetoric; neither has there been any move towards the broadening of the tax base as recommended by Culliton.  Virtually all the new reliefs and concessions are directed at the business and commercial sectors.  If business does not respond in this climate of incentives then the Government is wasting its time promoting that school of economic recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It remains to be seen if the myriad of new schemes and tax reliefs will result in an increase in employment levels and if any new jobs created will counterbalance the jobs lost in the clothing industry.  In February 1982, the then Government, which was only six or seven months in office, was brought down because it imposed an 18 per cent VAT rate on clothes and footwear.  There is no doubt that the VAT increase on clothing in this budget will result in job losses.  In my own town I have had discussions with people in the trade who say it is already having such an effect.  I will not go into that now because it has been mentioned frequently.  There were signs of development in both the voluntary and statutory sectors, but those in the voluntary sector are getting sick and tired of waiting.  They have attended seminars, they have had <Col N="1157" /> reports and have been preached to by able people, but nothing has happened.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in many instances those who carry the burden and provide essential core services were depending on social welfare schemes which have not been approved or implemented.  This matter should be taken on board quickly because what we want now is action.  The changes proposed in the social welfare scheme are not working and this is placing a major burden on those voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>Nothing exposes the confusion at the heart of public policy on job creation and investment strategies quite so well as the Finance Bill, 1993, sponsored by the Minister, the purpose of which was to close loopholes in the tax code, limit exemptions, shut down shelters, restrict allowances and set up a conciliatory tax regime.  These were accompanied by modest income tax reductions as distinct from radical tax reform.</P>
    <P>This year a tax amnesty was introduced. PAYE taxpayers are extremely angry about this amnesty which also has a demoralising effect on the staff of State Departments and the Revenue Commissioners who strongly advised against the move and who repeatedly asked for additional staff and resources to combat rampant tax evasion.  One member of the Government said tax evasion was endemic in Irish society.  If it is necessary to appoint people to prevent tax evasion and avoidance that should be done.</P>
    <P>It will come as no surprise that Fianna Fáil is prepared to excuse the activities of tax offenders.  What surprises and shocks me is the fact that Labour members support the amnesty.  I am especially surprised Deputy Kemmy is so supportive of the measure.  A socialist party backing a tax amnesty while putting a 1 per cent levy on the PAYE sector is difficult to understand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be positive and constructive at this late hour of the evening and focus on what is good or promising in the Bill and make suggestions as to how it can be improved, in this Bill or perhaps in future legislation.  I will concentrate <Col N="1158" /> on one major issue connected with this Bill and talk about it from the business perspective, responding to something Senator Hillery said earlier. This is the issue of raising capital for Irish companies.  I focus on a single issue because everything of a general nature worth saying about this Bill has already been said.  However I will be speaking about taxation on Committee Stage..</P>
      <P>Why is the question of getting more capital into Irish business so crucial?  We must begin with the realisation we have an under-developed appreciation of the need to provide businesses with capital.</P>
      <P>We do not fully appreciate why businesses need capital in the first place.  A growing business &mdash; especially one where technology is changing &mdash; needs constant transfusions of capital all the time, generated both from inside the business through retained profits, and from outside the business by attracting investors.</P>
      <P>I am not talking about injections of cash just to keep the business going, to pay the bills at the end of the month.  This is money for investing in the future of the business, in its capacity to grow and to create more jobs.  Our under appreciation of the role capital should play in any business, and of the need for adequate capital in every business, has had a bad effect in both the public and the private sector.</P>
      <P>In the public sector, it has given us commercial State companies unable to grow to the extent they could because they are not capitalised properly.  The philosophy behind most State companies had been to give loan capital and to starve them of equity.  A correctly structured business enterprise has a balance of the two, with most of the development capital coming from equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the private sector, on the other hand, too many businesses are run on a hand-to-mouth basis.  As with State companies, many try to run entirely on loan capital, usually from a bank.  This is sometimes made worse by the fact that they are often run at such a low level of profitability they cannot generate a healthy proportion of their new capital resources from within the company.  That <Col N="1159" /> is something every healthy company should be able to do.</P>
    <P>In our public policy towards private sector companies, a key thrust should be to ensure in every possible way that companies are properly capitalised.  It should not be a main job of the State to provide business capital for the private sector.  We should do as little as possible of that.  The best possible role for the State is to create favourable circumstances for other people to invest in the private sector, rather than have the State do so.  A key task for the State should be to ensure on the one hand people are encouraged to invest in private sector companies rather than in other forms of investment and on the other hand that companies are encouraged very strongly to capitalise themselves properly.</P>
    <P>The central problem, where this Finance Bill comes into play, is that for a long time now the investment playing-field has not been level.  Investing in Irish companies has not been as attractive as investing in other ways.  Our national growth has been hampered as a result. The State is not an innocent bystander in this, because to a large extent the State designs the playing-field through its taxation regime.</P>
    <P>For instance, on 31 December last there was already a bias against private-sector investment.  In the first week of January, the special savings accounts were introduced which offered a totally new advantaged to what is in any case virtually a risk-free investment.  If one invests now in bank deposits, interest on the first £50,000 is taxed at only 10 per cent.  The most tax one can pay on any deposit interest is 27 per cent.</P>
    <P>That measure tilted one end of the playing-field out of sight.  The measures in this Bill to extend the 10 per cent regime to a series of other savings instruments are an attempt to redress some of the balance.  I welcome them on that account but they do not go far enough. The special savings accounts and the new instruments allowing for investment in equities are not equally attractive.  One <Col N="1160" /> investment is virtually risk-free and the other has all the risks associated with any business investment.  Yet the tax regime treats them in the same way.</P>
    <P>These new instruments will not be successful in attracting funds and people will not invest in Irish industry, which is the objective here.  I therefore make a concrete suggestion.  If the Minister cannot accept it in this Bill he might bear it in mind for the next time time and the sooner the better.</P>
    <P>The equity related savings instruments, those intended to inject more capital into Irish industry, should have a tax advantage over the other schemes. This approach could be attractive to the Minister and the Department of Finance because they can create this differential not by lowering further the tax on equity related savings but by increasing the tax on special savings accounts.  I am not often heard suggesting something like that.</P>
    <P>It is clear the 10 per cent tax on special savings accounts is more generous than is necessary to discourage people from depositing their money abroad.  The original DIRT tax was disastrous.  As soon as the exchange controls were removed they disappeared.  We now know that it is not necessary to have a tax as low as 10 per cent to keep the money in this country &mdash; a rate of 15 per cent would be sufficient.</P>
    <P>This gives the Minister space in which to discriminate in favour of the equity-based savings.  They should remain at a tax rate of 10 per cent, while the special savings accounts should increase to, say, 15 per cent.  The money would stay in this country, but people would be given a clear and easily understandable encouragement to place their money into equity-related savings that would put more capital into Irish business.</P>
    <P>Given the importance of capital, I welcome most of the changes in the business expansion scheme.  For example, it is a good change to allow people to invest in their own businesses through the BES. The prohibition was an anomaly whose removal I welcome.  I am pleased to note that, outside the BES, there is a 400 per <Col N="1161" /> cent increase in the amount of shares that employees can take up in the companies they work for, getting a tax allowance on what they spend.</P>
    <P>I wish also to draw attention to what I believe to be a retrograde step in the proposed changes to the BES.  This is the lifting of the amount that a company can raise from £500,000 to £1 million.  Lifting the limit in that way is too crude and I believe that it will have a negative impact on the smaller enterprises that the scheme is designed to help.  By raising the limit to £1 million, the focus will shift to bigger companies where the initial fundraising is concerned.  The promoters of these schemes, who are important players in the equation, will go for the companies looking for £900,000 or £1 million at the first bite.  The smaller companies, with a need for a first injection of, say, £300,000 to £400,000 will find it harder to be considered, or worse, they will be encouraged to overstate their requirements.</P>
    <P>I propose that the £500,000 limit be maintained for the first injection of funds. This would give the smaller companies a fair crack of the whip.  Then, instead of cutting them off permanently from further BES funding, companies who had already reached their limit should be allowed to obtain additional funding of up to £500,000 for each of two years.  This would keep open the door for further injections of capital for these smaller companies, without biasing the whole scheme against them at the crucial first stage of injecting the early capital.</P>
    <P>I share the scepticism that some people have expressed about the value of the BES in job creation.  It has proved to be far more effective as a tax shelter for fairly well-off people than as a creator of jobs.  The way to deal with this is not to abolish the BES, which would be throwing out the baby with the bathwater, but to keep working at refining and focusing the scheme so that it does for the country what it is capable of doing.  As with the special savings accounts, the incentive under BES is more generous than necessary. It would save the Exchequer substantially, while producing the same <Col N="1162" /> result, if tax relief on the BES was restricted to the standard rate.  In its present form, the BES is expensive to the Exchequer and it is necessary to continue to improve it to ensure a better return. Senator Roche spoke of the measures that could be taken to ovecome abuses of the BES but this is not the issue I am raising.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to give entrepreneurs some of their tax back, in order to help with the seed capital for a new business.  It is a novel idea which targets the difficulty that many promoters of start-up companies have in acquiring capital.  In order to be credible to other investors and to State agencies, a promoter has to put up some of his or her own money.  Usually borrowings will be made against a house, but this is not always possible.  This proposal provides another possibility and is a good idea.  I hope it will not be abandoned because of too high expectations.  It would be foolish to expect thousands of takers under this proposal.  If there are a hundred in the first year we will be doing well.  The proposal is closely modelled on the IDA's enterprise development programme, which is aimed at attracting senior people out of big companies and encouraging them to start up on their own.  That is the kind of person that the legislation is clearly targeting.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that in more than 10 years of the IDA's scheme, there are still only hundreds of EDP companies. The key point is that they are the successes.  They have a very low failure rate.  It is important to judge this proposal on the quality of results rather than the quantity.</P>
    <P>It is a serious mistake to restrict this scheme to manufacturing and a few internationally-traded services.  That is the traditional approach which does not take account of the view that there is little future employment growth in manufacturing. Over the next 20 years it will be a considerable achievement to maintain present levels of employment in manufacturing and even then it will not be the same jobs.</P>
    <P>If we want to increase employment <Col N="1163" /> substantially, which is what must be done as we do not have any choice in the matter, then the only area which will generate increases is the services sector. This was realised by the Taoiseach when he announced the setting-up of a task force on jobs in the services sector at the recent IMI conference.</P>
    <P>I am realistic enough to understand that we cannot overturn our present bias towards manufacturing immediately.  We should recognise the potential of services by allowing service businesses equal access to any new schemes that are introduced. I have no problem with most of the proposed restrictions on this scheme, but to continue to exclude services is, I believe, cutting off our nose to spite our face.</P>
    <P>There are three main ways in which this Finance Bill addresses the central problem of helping the growth of the private sector.  First, the Bill creates a 10 per cent regime for savings instruments that are equity-related.  I welcome those, but stress that they need to be more attractive if they are to compete with risk-free special savings accounts.</P>
    <P>Second, the Bill expands the scope of the BES in several different ways.  I welcome those also but believe that more refining is necessary to tighten the focus on the small companies that we really want to help and to increase the cost-effectiveness of this tax incentive.</P>
    <P>Third, the Bill creates an innovative way of helping some entrepreneurs put together their part of the seed capital for new projects.  My welcome for this is accompanied by my plea that services must be brought within the scope of new schemes like this because in the future services are where the extra jobs will be, not in manufacturing.</P>
    <P>In urging the Minister to consider improving his proposals in these ways, I point out that, taken together, they would increase rather than decrease the revenue yield to the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to this debate.  I particularly thank the <Col N="1164" /> Senators who offered constructive criticism and proposed some good ideas.  In the last hour or so there have been some excellent contributions which I appreciate.</P>
      <P>The primary and overriding purpose of the Finance Bill and the budget was to secure financial stability in difficult circumstances and to signal the Government's commitment to sound economic and budgetary management.  I was glad that this was recognised by Senators from all sides of the House.  After a period of unprecedented uncertainty in financial markets worldwide &mdash; from which we are now luckily free, although a number of countries are still in great difficulties &mdash; we had to try to give clear commitments to the markets, which we cannot ignore, and to show them the thrust of Government policy.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn made the point, and I am glad to hear it being made by a prominent business person, that commercial and business decisions should not depend on the Finance Bill or any other legislation.  The view that we have to insert amendments to provide incentives for special or vested interest groups or to encourage ideas is unadulterated rubbish.  People should see that in this small country with an open economy the essential condition for business development and job creation is economic growth.  The fiscal policy of the Government in the budget in any year is of far more value to the prospects for employment creation and investment generation than such incentives.  It is wrong to believe that fiscal policy can be disregarded and that half-baked and probably half-mad ideas are better than overall control.  Today we had a balanced debate on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that last year and this year we continued in difficult circumstances to maintain tight control of the Exchequer borrowing requirement and the current budget deficit.  It is not unnoticed in the EC, where there is average negative growth this year of around -0.8 per cent, that this country will probably achieve growth of around 2.7 or 2.8 per cent. With Luxembourg, we will have one of <Col N="1165" /> the lowest current budget deficits in the EC, provided that nothing goes drastically wrong in the second half of the year.</P>
    <P>There are three reasons for our low interest rates.  The way we handled devaluation after the devaluation of sterling by around 20 per cent and the inflows into our economy were major factors. The point has to be made that the markets waited for the budget.  There were no inflows for two and a half weeks afgter devaluation.  Not even £1 million came into the economy.  People waited to see the policy to be pursued by the new Government, to see if they would continue to pursue fiscal policies which measured up to what the international markets and community wanted or if they would totally disregard such policies and ignore what had been achieved since 1987 by successive Governments.  I acknowledge that the Progressive Democrats were part of the Government when the 1990, 1991 and 1992 budgets were framed.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole said that balancing the books is of no importance.  He represents the 50,000 teachers we manage to pay every week.  Such payment requires much balancing of the books.  If we did not balance the books I could assure him that next year it would not be a 1 per cent levy we would have to bring in but a 10 per cent one in order to keep books balanced.  My colleagues in my own party and my colleagues in both this Government and the last one have heard me making this point.  I have argued since 1984 within my own party and in Oireachtas debates that if Governments do not continue to pursue tight fiscal policies we will have no future.  We have to measure what we can produce based on sound economic policies.</P>
    <P>There is no point in people in this House, the other House or anywhere else saying they are in favour of tax reform, broadening the tax base and better services if they are also opposed to new taxes being introduced by the Government which broaden the base.  People cannot have it both ways.  One cannot talk about tax reform if one equates such reform <Col N="1166" /> with tax reductions.  Tax reform does not mean reducing tax; it means finding alternative ways of collecting the same amount.  Otherwise services would have to be reduced.  No speaker, with the exception of the last speaker, favoured reducing public expenditure in any area. I am prepared to listen to an argument, I do not have the time now to go through all the detailed questions but I will do so tomorrow.</P>
    <P>There is no point in people saying that they are against the 1 per cent levy but that more money should be provided for education and the health services.  We heard this in the debate today.  It is pointless for people to say that the probate tax is unfair on relatives of the deceased, while at the same time saying that they are in favour of tax reform and broadening the tax base.  Tax reform means redistributing the burden of existing taxes.  Broadening the base means introducing new taxes such as the probate tax and others.  Increasing public expenditure in any area means increasing borrowing or taxation or reducing spending on other services.  These are the economic indicators with which any Minister for Finance or serious politician has to live.  I am prepared tomorrow to listen to any worthwhile amendments whereby people want to cut services by taking £50 million from a particular area or close a school or a hospital or curtail various sectors or businesses in order to finance tax cuts.</P>
    <P>Last year when I closed the loopholes, exemptions and thresholds everybody welcomed this as being tax reform except the groups which were affected.  I closed 48 loopholes last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The closing of these loopholes affected about 95 pressure groups.  Every time an exemption or a threshold or a concessionary tax is removed, if there is not a pressure group <Col N="1167" /> already there I can guarantee that by the time the debate on budget night is completed there will be a pressure group meeting in Buswells Hotel.  This is what we have to face.</P>
      <P>I thank all Senators who put forward constructive suggestions and I will certainly look at them. Although I may not be against some of the arguments made by Senator Quinn about the BES scheme, in the discussions we had about these changes opinion was divided. I am glad to hear the Senators' views on this.  If the incentives which have been mentioned today are abused, I hope I will be here next year to remove them. This year I have tried, in difficult circumstances, to target any incentive given to a defined area.</P>
      <P>While Members of both Houses complained that there was insufficient time to debate the Bill, two individual tax advisers published books on the Finance Bill.  I do not mean that they published the budget night papers, although I commend the fact that they were published overnight.  These publications were detailed assessments.  These advisers also hold major conferences where they inform their clients about tax avoidance. I do not think that tax advisers use the word &ldquo;tax evasion&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Accountants, legal professional or tax advisers would never use any clause or section of the Finance Bill for tax evasion, but they have a loose definition of the word &ldquo;avoidance&rdquo;. <Col N="1168" /> Deputy Roche, who has studied this at great length, is more severe than I am.  If any of the concessions which I am putting before this House are abused, they must be removed.</P>
      <P>The schemes for entrepreneurs must be availed of by people who are willing to give up their jobs or who are unemployed. I agree with Senators that we must give these people time.  We do not have 5,000 people in this country with totally new ideas which will make a lot of money.  I would like to see people with more bright ideas and this will give them an opportunity to develop innovative schemes.</P>
      <P>The services area was mentioned by a number of Senators.  This is an issue which the Government will continue to consider.</P>
      <P>I wish to address a point to Senator Honan about the Council for the Status of Women.  The Government has moved part of the way on this and I am not against movement in this area.  I thank the Senator for her comments.  Following the divorce referendum, we will have an opportunity to look at the scheme again. We have followed the philosophy that tax law must follow State law.  Many other initiatives can be considered if the people so wish.  If it is not the wish of the people, then we can consider the scheme to see what else can be done in the area of separate assessments.</P>
      <P>I thank all the speakers and I assure them that officials from the Department of Finance have taken detailed notes.  If the issues are not raised tomorrow, we will consider them in general legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for giving me the opportunity to discuss this serious matter, and I want to thank the Minister of State for coming here at this late hour.  I also thank the Minister of State for convening a meeting last week in an effort to find a solution to this matter.  Some of what I will say will not be nice and none of it will refer to the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>What is unfolding in Clones is a calamity for the community; I cannot think of a parallel anywhere in the country. Clones is situated on the border and two-thirds of its catchment area is north of the Border.  The town has suffered the dreadful consequences of its geographic location through a constant haemorrhage of trade to the northern side.  Another town has developed on the other side of the Border in the form of a thriving market, selling goods of every type at prices which, over the past 15 years, have proved to be an embarrassment to the traders on the southern side.</P>
      <P>Without the closure of this factory, Clones is already a town in deep recession.  If the CPV plant is allowed to close, it will be the death knell for this proud community.  Clones can lay claim to a glittering history.  It was a thriving three hotel town, a place of importance. The well appointed diamond with its historic Celtic cross and fine tall buildings, sits on top of a small hill and the rest of the town spreads in all directions.  The round tower is the centrepiece of an old settlement.  In the days before the railway was closed, Clones was a throbbing centre of trade and commerce.  It was one of the important towns of Ulster and this is demonstrated by the fact that it hosts the Ulster final every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proud community started to fight adversity in earnest approximately eight years ago.  It set a headline for the rest of Europe by carrying out an in-depth survey of the town's needs, holding meetings in every neighbourhood at a time when rural development was not part of our vocabulary.  This community meticulously planned a garden festival which would have rejuvenated the whole town. It failed to get the necessary support for <Col N="1171" /> this ambitious venture, morale dropped to a new low and all seemed lost. However, like the phoenix, the community rose to the occasion again and a few weeks ago the development association in the town announced that it had received grants of almost £400,000 from the Interreg Fund for a number of projects which are now ready for development. The local credit union is providing a grant of £100,000 towards the programme which locals see as the first step in the rebuilding process.  The action of the credit union underlines the intent of the people of Clones.</P>
    <P>This is obviously no ordinary community. We can only try to imagine the feelings of utter distress which ran through the community when the 30 days notice of the closure of the CPV plant was announced last Friday week.  The Government cannot turn its back on this fine community as it faces possible oblivion. The factory can and must be saved and the Government must make every effort to achieve this.  This serious matter was raised in the other House on Tuesday, 1 June and I was very disappointed with the Minister's response, and more disappointed with the subsequent lack of action.  When the depressing news broke in Clones on Friday, 28 May, I took immediate action.  I made a public statement which was carried in the media the following day.</P>
    <P>On Monday, 31 May, I informed the senior Minister's office and gave a full briefing, including the telephone number of the chief executive of the parent company, the decision maker in matters pertaining to CPV.  I kept in touch with the Minister's office throughout the day and after lunch I was informed that the IDA's engineering division has been called in.  I was happy in the knowledge that Government action had begun.  The Minister in the Dáil on Tuesday said that &ldquo;the IDA are in close constant touch with the company&rdquo;. The Minister's office provided me with a copy of the script on Wednesday morning and throughout Wednesday I <Col N="1172" /> continued to make contact with interested parties with a view to keeping the factory open.</P>
    <P>At 4.30 p.m. on Wednesday of last week, no contact had been made with the chief executive of Powerscreen International. No contact was made throughout the remainder of last week by either the Minister's office or the IDA, although the Minister of State who is here this evening was in contact.  Yesterday at 4.40 p.m. a feeble telephone call was made and I understand that a meeting will take place on 15 June with the IDA; I welcome that.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave some peculiar information to the Dáil.  The fact is that the IDA was not in close, constant touch with the company, and I can prove it.  The Minister of State in the House is an exception but neither the Minister nor the IDA showed any interest in the factory closure from Friday, 28 May until lunchtime yesterday and they stand condemned before the people of Clones, the people who work in the factory and the plant's management.  I reject the humbug that was inherent in the Minister's speech that night.  The factory's workforce and management and the people of Clones deserve much better.</P>
    <P>In his introduction to his speech in the Dáil that evening, the Minister named three Oireachtas Members who, he said, had expressed their concern to him &ldquo;over the last number of days&rdquo;.  My name was cynically omitted from that list even though I had been in touch with his office on six occasions before his speech and had passed on valuable information to him.  I was unable to speak to him personally because he was involved in Government business every time I telephoned, and that I understood.  His colleague from Monaghan returned from a long visit to Cambodia on Tuesday night and was not in touch with the Minister before he made his speech regarding the factory closure.  Yet the Minister said that his colleague had been in touch.  He should not give that sort of information to the Dáil.  It is entirely cynical and he should apologise for his behaviour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> There are two essential elements required to keep the CPV plant open. First, the plant and its technology must be modernised and updated, second and this is essential to the first, a spirit of cooperation between the management and the workforce, which sadly does not exist at present, must be achieved.  Industrial relations at the plant are dreadful, and that is the kernel of the problem.  If we are to achieve anything we must attack that problem with diplomacy and try to wheedle both sides into a situation where they can talk to each other.  It is a sad story but if we put our minds to it we can achieve a positive outcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State who is here started a process on Friday last because I heard some very good reports of the meeting she had with union personnel. That is a start and both the union and management need confidence in the future.  Both are frightened at this stage by what they see and in what they are involved.  The Minister did something to assuage the fears of the union.  It is good that people talk and we will not achieve anything until the workers in the plant, the management and the decision makers in Powerscreen International sit down to talk.  I have been in constant contact with all interested parties in the last week and a half and all my efforts are pushing in that direction.  I want the workers in Clones to be in contact with the board and executives of Powerscreen International in order to try to achieve the basic element of management which is communication, and secondly so that they can sit down together and work out a future.  This can be done.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to assist the Minister of State who has promised that she will do everything in her power to help, and who has acted on that promise. Again on behalf of the people of Clones and everybody involved in this, I thank her for her efforts.  I have not been in contact with her to date but I hope from tonight that I will maintain contact with her so that we can achieve something and use her undoubted ability and interest in this case to try to save the factory and the town of Clones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cotter for raising this subject on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, spoke to me about this matter this evening and it was because I met with the union last Friday and had what both of us thought was a fruitful meeting that it was agreed I would come to the House tonight &mdash; it is not out of disrespect that the Minister is not present &mdash; I am glad to do so.  The Minister is concerned about this issue and wishes to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
      <P>CPV is a company that can be saved, although in what form has yet to be resolved.  I met with one of the trade unions last Friday and had a progressive and open meeting with them.  Many such meetings, although courteous, often lack a spark.  However, the unions were more realistic here; they wished to further the best interests of Clones.  I thought about the disaster a loss of 160 full and part-time jobs would create if it happened in similar towns in my constituency.  This would be, proportionately, as great a disaster for these towns as the more publicised job losses which were hotly debated in both Houses.</P>
      <P>The passion with which Senator Cotter spoke about the subject is evident of a similar passion among those wanting to save what is a viable industry, a thriving community and a motivated workforce. I repeat the assurances given by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to do everything possible and I intend to do the same.  The unions are prepared to reenter into negotiations with the management on the basis of an open agenda. Senator Cotter referred to the uneasy relationship between the unions and management but maybe this is a first step in alleviating this.  In my years of meeting with trade unions, I have never met any with as much openness and clarity of thought as they.  They wish to save the firm and have assured me that they will approach any talks in a flexible and positive manner and are confident that an accommodation between the sides can be reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> CPV have enjoyed a long and fruitful relationship since 1967 when the company was established to manufacture sheet metal containers, it has received substantial assistance since then.  The company supplies containers mainly to the bulk chemicals industry, which experienced a severe downturn in 1992 and CPV has been badly affected by this. The company was acquired by Powerscreen International &mdash; a company both the Cathaoirleach and I know &mdash; in 1992 and it has been making strenuous efforts to put the undertaking on a more viable footing.  Despite its best endeavours, the management is having to face up to the realities of the deteriorating situation.  I want to assure Senator Cotter that the IDA are in close and constant touch with the company.</P>
    <P>There were three senior management personnel &mdash; two from my Department and one from the IDA &mdash; at the meeting last Friday.  I recognised, from the contacts my Department had with the unions, that a breakthrough could be made if the correct expertise was brought to bear on the issue.  We had an open and strong discussion &mdash; I know &ldquo;full&rdquo; and &ldquo;frank&rdquo; are trite words.  The IDA are in close contact with the company to see if, even at this late stage, anything can be done to avoid closure and consequent job losses.  In addition, the Labour Relations Commission, which had been working with both parties &mdash; I have also made contact with them &mdash; is available to deal with any industrial relations issues, in so far as they may have affected the decision arrived at, which is now negated.</P>
    <P>Senator Cotter knows what I am talking about when I say the unions were open-minded and have an open agenda for talks.  Arising out of this discussion and the Minister's concern &mdash; I personally contacted the IDA &mdash; I feel that the firm can be saved; I only hope this will be done in time.  The company has good prospects for the future and deserves our attention.  The loss of an industry of this size would be a severe blow to Clones and would have enormous repercussions for its future.  My hope is that, with the <Col N="1176" /> combined efforts of those involved, we may endeavour to save this firm.</P>

I want to tell the Minister that the information she is getting is not accurate because management were not contacted until yesterday at 4.40 p.m. by telephone.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me to raise this important and urgent issue and I also thank the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy N. Treacy, for coming to the House.  I apologise for bringing him here at this late hour.</P>
      <P>The condition of the national primary route, N18, at Ardrahan is of concern to those living in the village and those passing through it.  Major reconstruction was undertaken on this road in 1992 and was partially completed by the end of the year.  For the past six months, the villagers have awaited the completion of this work and there is grave concern there because no money has been allocated in this year's roads Estimate to finish the project.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the allocation of money during this year, hopefully from unspent moneys in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately £700,000 was spent on the road passing through this pleasant village in South Galway which has one of the more attractive market squares but because money ran out at the end of 1992, the job remains unfinished.  It is now in an unfinished condition which is both dangerous and unattractive in what <Col N="1177" /> is an attractive village.  It is dangerous because the road surface is temporary and walls and other aspects of the work have been left unfinished.  A local publican has not been able to get into one of his main stores, where it opens on to the national primary route, for the past six months due to the unfinished nature of the work.</P>
    <P>Work which has been carried out is the cause of concern among business people in the village.  For example, a partially constructed footpath is causing chaos for business people because it restricts parking, say, in front of the local post office.  Last Friday I witnessed chaos among a number of pensioners visiting the post office because cars were parked along the carriageway of the national primary route.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to request Galway County Council to re-examine the construction of this footpath.  Its planning was ill-advised.  Part of the footpath has been allocated as a parking space for buses.  This will undoubtedly cause accidents because the parking for the bus is directly opposite the junction which is being constructed.  It reduces visibility for traffic exiting onto the national primary route, particularly with regard to traffic coming from Gort, County Galway.</P>
    <P>I ask Galway County Council to re-examine the design of the work carried out to date and to leave the carriageway unchanged.  They have destroyed the market square of Ardrahan, which was one of the most attractive in County Galway, if not in the country.  The job has been left undone and, even when it is finished, the present design will, in my view, cause traffic accidents in the future. I ask the Minister to tell us how much money will be spent in 1993 and to give an estimate of the sum required to complete this work.</P>
    <P>I am aware that money has been allocated and that this job has not been included.  However, it is fair to assume that allocations made to County Galway may not be spent.  I want to emphasise the urgency and importance of completing this work.  In its present condition, the village has been destroyed. <Col N="1178" /> Walls and road surface are unfinished and could be the cause of accidents in bad weather.  It is unusual for a job on a national primary route to be abandoned for six months.  I hope the Minister will indicate whether money will be provided to complete this work in order to make this area safer and to enable the village of Ardrahan, County Galway, to return to its previous splendour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Cé go bhfuil sé déanach, is cúis áthais dom i gcónaí teacht anseo chun freagra a thabhairt ar an rún tábhachtach seo ón Seanadóir Fahey.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Fahey for raising the issue on investment in our network of national roads and, in particular, the position in relation to the national primary route, the N18 with particular reference to the historic village of Ardrahan, County Galway.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware, the road network is the dominant mode of internal transport accounting for over 90 per cent of both passenger and goods traffic. National primary roads, account for less than 6 per cent of total road mileage but carry over one-quarter of all road traffic. Their importance to the national economy is well illustrated by two additional statistics; two-thirds of traffic on our national primary routes is work related and typically one-sixth of the traffic is comprised of heavy commercial vehicles.</P>
      <P>The reasons for the high level of dependence on the road system in Ireland are well known &mdash; a low density and widely dispersed population and a relatively low level of urbanisation.  The Government is committed to creating the kind of environment which will allow Irish industry to compete and prosper under Single Market conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The upgrading of our transport system is fundamental to this objective.  Such a strategy has been endorsed by the Industrial Policy Review Group &mdash; Culliton &mdash; which regarded improved access and internal transport as crucial elements of industrial policy aimed at increasing <Col N="1179" /> employment and wealth creation.  The group noted that the condition of the road network had been a significant constraint in this regard for many years.</P>
    <P>We are now making good progress in addressing the needs as identified in a review carried out by the Department of the Environment in 1987-88.  The review estimated investment requirements of over £3 billion for national roads. The operational programme on peripherality, which covers the period 1989-93, is the main platform for policy and investment in the roads area.  The programme set a target of 12 to 15 years to complete the development of the national primary network.</P>
    <P>By the end of 1993, expenditure on this network over the five year period will total some £670 million.  We are confident that the National Development Plan, 1994-99, will again see substantial investment in this area and will bring significant further progress on addressing identified needs.</P>
    <P>The N18 serves an important function in linking the cities of Galway and Limerick, and facilitates access to both Shannon and Galway airports.  In addition to catering for commercial traffic, the route also serves tourists arriving at Shannon and travelling on to County Kerry and west Cork, or northwards to Connemara, County Galway.  The stretch of road referred to, carries circa 1.25 million tourists each year.</P>
    <P>Since 1991 the Department of the Environment has provided road grants totalling £1.15 million to Galway County Council for improvement works on the N18, while further allocations of £150,000 have been made to the county council again this year.  The largest element of these grants, some £850,000, has been paid for work at Ardrahan, County Galway, involving the reconstruction and realignment of approximately 1.4 km of roadway so as to remove dangerous bends on the approach to the <Col N="1180" /> village.  Payments made to date exceeded the initial estimated cost of the work by some £70,000.</P>
    <P>I understand that the county council now estimates that a further provision of £75,000 is required to complete the project, mainly in respect of sections of footpaths and fencing.  This extra request from the council is being examined in the Department of the Environment at present.</P>
    <P>As the funds available to that Department for roads in the current year have been fully allocated, our Government colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, is not in a position to provide further funding at this time.  However, when the merits of the council's request are established, he will no doubt endeavour to meet whatever additional funding may be warranted at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Substantial investment on improvement works to that section of the N18 which passes through County Clare and south of the area to which the Senator referred, is also taking place.  Grants totalling £4.8 million have been allocated this year.  The main areas of expenditure concern the Bunratty bypass, Setrights Cross, the Ennis bypass and pavement improvement between Limerick city and Shannon.</P>
    <P>Galway County Council has benefited proportionately from the substantial overall increase in road grants allocated this year.  The total 1993 provision of £340 million is a record.  In Galway's case, the 1993 allocation for national roads at £4.423 million represents an increase of over 41 per cent on the position in 1992. I am sure Senator Fahey will agree that this is a most welcome increase and will benefit both locals and tourists alike in our fair county of Galway.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 11.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 10 June 1993.</P>
