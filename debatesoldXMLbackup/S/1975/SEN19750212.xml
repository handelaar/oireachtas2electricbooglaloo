      <P>During the Recess Senators will have learned with deep regret of the death of our colleague, Senator Denis Farrelly.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrelly had been a Member of this House since 1969, and had served as a Member of the Dáil for the previous eight years.  In both Houses his charitable and kindly disposition contributed to the esteem in which he was held by Members of all parties.</P>
      <P>The late Senator was very active in local affairs.  He was chairman of Kilmainhamwood Local Development Association since 1958 and of the Kilmainhamwood Gaelic Athletic Club since 1965.  He had been a member of the Meath County Council since 1959.  He served as chairman of the North Eastern Health Board since 1971 and had been a member of the Regional Hospital Board since 1972.</P>
      <P>As an active and progressive farmer he displayed a keen interest in agricultural affairs.  He became a chairman of the Meath County Committee of Agriculture in 1967 having first become a member of that committee in 1956.  He became a member of the General Council of the Committees of Agriculture in 1965 and a member of the Executive in 1967.  He was also a member of the Irish Farmers' Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of the auctioneering profession he was active in advancing the interests of his vocation.  He had <Col N="498" /> been a member of the Irish Auctioneers' and Valuers' Institute since 1967 and was twice elected to this House on the Industrial and Commercial Panel.</P>
    <P>With the passing of Senator Farrelly we have lost an esteemed and valuable colleague who will be missed by us all.</P>
    <P>I have conveyed, on your behalf and my own, our deepest sympathy to the widow and children of the late Senator.</P>
    <P>I bhFlaitheas Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 5, 1, 2 and 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, it is a matter of some concern to us in the Fianna Fáil group that sufficient business is not coming forward to the Seanad for discussion, particularly in the form of legislation from the Government.  It is a primary duty of the Government to bring forward legislative business to this House.  To put it bluntly, they are not fulfilling that duty and we want to register our protest in this manner.  We wish to state that the responsibility lies with the Government to bring in legislation and have it expedited so that we get a volume of legislative business.</P>
      <P>Many of the motions on the Order Paper have lain there for quite a considerable time.  I should like the Leader of the House to bring forward some practical proposals on having Seanad meetings at which we can discuss the backlog of motions.  I suggest that we do this irrespective of the presence of a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of motions on which we could have constructive debates. Motion No. 24 from our group states &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann notes with concern the deteriorating state of the national economy&rdquo;.  It is a pertinent motion in view of the very serious state of the economy at present, which is causing growing concern among people in all walks of life.  On this issue there is a massive silence <Col N="499" /> from the Government, both in the Houses of the Oireachtas and outside. I wish to point out to the Leader of the House that we shall insist on this motion being taken on the next sitting day of the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Motion No. 24.  It is a matter of real concern to all sections of our community.  It is a motion which could give rise to a meaningful debate on the current state and the potential future state of the economy. It would command wide public interest and rightful concern.  I want to give notice that we will insist on that motion being taken on the next sitting day of the Seanad.  I ask the Leader of the House to make the necessary arrangements so that we can have an agreed and meaningful debate on this serious issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Senator Lenihan in wishing that the Seanad would meet more often for business, but I would place a different emphasis on the role of the Seanad.  I do not agree with Senator Lenihan that we are a second Chamber dependent on what is happening in the Dáil or even dependent on business coming from the Dáil.  This House has its own role to play and it must play it more frequently and more actively.  It is possible to initiate legislation in this House.  We could play a very constructive role in this way. It is possible for the Government to initiate legislation through this House. We should meet on a more regular basis to discuss motions.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan mentioned one motion.  I think he is trying to queue jump in this respect, but that is a matter for the House.  Rather than take a motion, however significant the subject matter may be, we ought to evolve a much more definite system for dealing with the Order Paper of the Seanad and for getting through that Order Paper quite independent of whether the Dáil is sitting or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Leader of the House a specific question as to <Col N="500" /> whether it is proposed that the Seanad will sit tomorrow if the business for the day has not been completed when we rise tonight?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I will not be accused of queue jumping if I ask the Leader of the House to take Motion No. 21.  It has been a year on the Order Paper.  As a Member, on the agricultural panel I can make little contribution here if I put down a motion asking that this House discuss the serious plight of those engaged in agriculture and it takes one year for the House to consider that motion.  I would have to admit to those people who elected me that I am wasting my time.  It is my duty to bring to your notice, Cathaoirleach, my utter disgust, because this is the most ineffective body that one could sit on.  A local agricultural committee of any county council would be more effective.</P>
      <P>At the present time the plight of the farmers is very serious.  They are being hammered and are trying to survive.  Therefore the House has a duty to discuss this motion.  In a month's time it will be too late.  At the present time those engaged in agriculture are being forced to pay £100 a ton for fertilisers which the merchants purchased at £50 a ton. This is racketeering in the very basic commodities.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Senator is going on to discuss the subject matter of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than trying to score points, I am trying to justify the urgency of my motion.  I am going to press for a division.  I hope that the people in the Government benches are equally as concerned about those engaged in agriculture, and that they will not walk into the lobby and oppose the motion being taken today. I propose that you include No. 21 on the Order Paper for today, sir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the plea made by Senator Lenihan and other speakers for more action in the Seanad and in particular a quick programme to get through as many of the motions as are relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> I would support the suggestion that the equivalent of No. 24&mdash;in other words something that would give scope for a general debate&mdash;be given priority.  At Christmas the debate on the Appropriation Bill was most unsatisfactory. It was rushed through a couple of days before Christmas.  I think we got a tacit assurance then that scope for a more general debate would be provided shortly.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader of the House to provide the scope for that more general debate.  Perhaps four or five of the motions before the House could be merged.  When we do get that general debate six hours is not enough to discuss topics as wide as the state of the economy.  I appreciate there must be a limit put on it, but I suggest that the limit of six hours is totally inadequate.  It should be increased at least to 12 hours or perhaps more.  The limits on individual contributions should also be increased slightly from the half-hour allowed in a regular motion for consideration of what is in effect a general debate motion.  A limit of 45 minutes might be adequate.  We are all anxious to contribute whatever we can by way of constructive debate and, accordingly, I ask the Leader of the House to facilitate the House as soon as possible in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want also to support those who have already spoken on this, in particular Senator Lenihan and Senator McGowan.  The motion pertaining to agriculture has been on the Order Paper for months and months.  It should be made known to the public in general that Senators on this side of the House do not call the House together.  If the legislation is not coming through from the Government side, then the Seanad does not meet.  This point should be made very clear.  I have a vivid recollection of a Parliamentary Secretary appearing on television and blaming the Seanad for meeting only two days inside the last term.  He neglected to point out to the public and to the media at large the reason for this. The Senators are anxious to meet and do their business if the business is given to them.</P>

      <P>Is Senator Dolan seconding the amendment of Senator McGowan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to that of the Senators who have spoken already if only to dramatise the increasing sense of discontent being felt with regard to the number of times the Seanad meets and to the long list of neglected but very important issues enshrined in those various motions on this Order Paper, which perhaps will never be discussed.  I want to give notice that Motion No. 20, which Senator West and I have down almost for a year, is a matter of extreme urgency.  It reads:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, in view of the present rapid increase in urbanisation, mining, industrial development and other sources of pollution, is of opinion that a separate Department of the Environment should be set up with responsibility for the preservation of the country's scenery, wild life, fisheries, architectural and archaeological riches and other cultural and tourist amenities.</P>
      <P>Many things have happened since we put down that motion, including spillages in Bantry Bay, which makes that an issue as urgent as any of those mentioned already.  It seems disgraceful to me that the Seanad is not called together more often and allowed to sit in a more continuous way so that a number of those very crucial issues on the Order Paper can be openly discussed and reported.  In this way the Government could inform themselves, at least to some extent, on the opinion of this House with regard to these very important international issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to add my voice to the protest regarding the small number of occasions on which the Seanad has met.  As has been pointed out by Senator Dolan, a Parliamentary Secretary stated on television that the Seanad was to blame for the small number of occasions on which it met last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="503" /> We are fully aware that it is a matter for the Government to give us business to do.  Because there has been lack of legislation in the last year we have met on only a few occasions to deal with it.  Even so, if the Government are not presenting legislation to the House, we could still meet and deal with motions.  Nobody is trying to queue jump, as has been suggested.  We feel that Motion No. 24 is one that needs immediate consideration. People are walking frightened through this land at the present time, frightened for their jobs, frightened of the whole state of the economy. The Ministers involved are not coming to the Houses of the Oireachtas to make statements or asking suggestions for the improvement of the economy.  The only statements ever made are made outside the Houses but in such a fashion that people are still left unaware of the state of the economy.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Appropriation Bill the Minister gave what I am satisfied was an undertaking, although perhaps that word might be too strong. I would ask the Leader of the House to look through the debates on the Appropriation Bill and he will find that the Minister for Finance said he was quite prepared to give as much time to this House as the Seanad wanted. I feel this motion should be taken and whenever within the month it suits the Minister to come we are prepared to hear what he has to say and to offer our contributions.  We feel many things are being left unsaid and that we have things to say that are important.  The few occasions we have met and dealt with legislation has been remarked on in public by the Press and various other people.  This is a slight on the Seanad. The fact is, of course, that the Government are not doing their business and are not presenting legislation to this House we can deal with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice in support of the plea to have Motions No. 22 and 24 debated on the next sitting day of the Seanad. I do so because of the urgency of the problems that affect the economy both in the agricultural and economic fields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="504" /> In fact, we cannot dissociate one from the other because both are linked with the state of the economy.  For that reason I appeal to the Leader of the House to make time available to us next week to have a worthwhile discussion on the state of the economy.</P>
    <P>We are being criticised because we are doing no work.  It should be made perfectly clear that we are anxious to discharge our duties as public representatives. We are anxious to carry out useful work on behalf of the Irish people but we are denied the opportunity. I feel a positive and worthwhile effort must be made now to ensure that Seanad Éireann plays the role which it was intended to play in the first place.  For that reason I strongly support the plea to have Motions Nos. 22 and 24 debated at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesSanfey" hpid="Mr. Sanfey Mr. Sanfey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sanfey</NameTxt>
      <P>So many Senators have made reference to the few occasions on which the Seanad met that I should like the opportunity, for a couple of minutes, to put some facts on record with regard to the number of times the Seanad has met.  It may come as a surprise to Senators to hear that the Seanad met last year on 38 occasions. If we exclude the year 1971, when the Seanad met on 47 occasions, one would have to go right back to the year 1946 to find a year when last year's total sittings was exceeded.  In fact, in the life of the Seanad since 1922, the average number of sittings per year works out at 29.9&mdash;I suppose you could call it 30.  Also, in the lifetime of the Seanad last year's number of sittings, namely 38, has only been exceeded in nine years as follows: in 1923, 1924, 1925, 1929, 1931, 1933, 1934, 1946 and, as I have already said, in 1971.  If the House desires to hear the full facts before me I can go right through from the year 1922 to date and give the exact number of sittings per year, but this information I have elicited is available to any Senator who wishes to check it.  I should just like to place it on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity when Senator Sanfey was giving us these details that he did not go a little further in this research and tell us <Col N="505" /> the number of Bills that came before the House in 1974.  It was not the wish of the Government that the House sat on 38 occasions.  It was due to the vigilance of the Fianna Fáil Opposition in this House who insisted Bills, such as the Constituencies Bill, be debated long and fully.  I remember the Leader of the House standing up week after week during the last few years and saying exactly what we are saying today.  He was ably joined by his colleague Senator Alexis FitzGerald. It was completely wrong for Senator Sanfey to give the impression that, because the Seanad sat on 38 occasions in 1974, the House dealt with more legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesSanfey" hpid="Mr. Sanfey Mr. Sanfey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sanfey</NameTxt>

      <P>Whether a Senator is &ldquo;with it&rdquo; is really a matter for the Chair.  The Chair is having some doubts whether the speakers in this debate are entirely with it, &ldquo;it&rdquo; being the motion that the Order of Business be agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like Senator Sanfey to continue his research and on another occasion tell us the amount of legislation presented to this House by the Government in 1974.  It was the main reason this House met on so few occasions since last August.  The reason should be made known loud and clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I must intervene here.  The Senator is going very wide. This is not a debate on the way in which the Seanad carried out its business during the past year.  The discussion is concerned with what business <Col N="506" /> the Seanad propose to transact today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Seanad to transact more business and I should like to think that the present Cabinet could be made capable of introducing legislation and so giving us more business.  It is nine months ago since a motion was tabled in my name and in the names of Senators Dolan, Killilea and Keegan, asking the House to take note of the discussion document on Local Government reorganisation.  Despite requests by us to have this motion debated nothing has been done about it.  It appears to me that the Government and the Minister for Local Government are afraid to face this motion, bearing in mind the promises the Minister for Local Government made concerning local government reorganisation, not alone before the general election but particularly after it.</P>
      <P>It is bad enough that we do not meet to discuss legislation, but that we fail to meet to discuss motions would give me the impression that members of the present Cabinet are just too lazy to come into this House to hear these motions being debated.  I would ask that an opportunity be given, at the earliest possible moment, to have Motion No. 17 discussed in this House.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I hope Senator Sanfey, for whom I have the height of respect, will convey the information he has already given to the House to the Party Whip who made a statement on television that was very misleading because it was referring to the facts as given by Senator Sanfey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Senators McGowan and Dolan in their proposition that we take Motion No. 21.  It has been on the Order Paper almost 12 months.  At the time it was put on the Order Paper the decline in agriculture was only commencing. Since then it has gone on and we <Col N="507" /> have not had an opportunity of speaking on it or of hearing replies from the Minister on it.  I appeal to the Leader of the House to accept our proposition that Motion No. 21 be taken today. Like other speakers, I feel very strongly about the remarks passed by one of the Whips of the Dáil.  It is something that should be taken up by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, in particular the remarks passed by Deputy Barry Desmond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear the remarks to which Senator Ryan referred.  If he thinks that it is proper that they should be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of this House he has the course open to him to do that.</P>
      <P>This has been a useful discussion. I was tempted to start by saying that it would be worthwhile for the Seanad to meet more often, if only to avoid debates on the Order of Business. Jokes apart, it has been a useful discussion and it has been a discussion which has been free from acrimony. Possibly one of the reasons for that is that Senator Lenihan and others who contributed are aware that, so far as I am concerned, in relation to Seanad meetings they are pushing an open door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House has a very important role to play in our parliamentary democracy.  Members of the House should not become discouraged by the kind of criticism that undoubtedly has been aroused by the failure, or apparent failure, of the House to meet more often.  Indeed the meetings of this House in the last few years, since the change of Government, have been well up to, if not more than, the average.  Quite apart from the number of man hours which Senators may spend in meetings of the House, the importance of this House to our parliamentary process is the manner and quality of the work of revision and of discussion that takes place in this House.  I can testify, as a person who has had a certain amount of experience here and elsewhere, that as a <Col N="508" /> general rule the average standard of work, the average standard of scrutiny of legislation, of constructive suggestions made in the Seanad&mdash;and I include both sides of the House in this&mdash;is extremely high.  It is that kind of work and that kind of standard we should set as our target to adhere to in the future.  I hope that it will be possible to arrange that the Seanad will meet more frequently&mdash; certainly as frequently as possible.</P>
    <P>There is no point in any of us closing our eyes to the facts.  While I appreciate and understand and I do not argue against the point of view of Senators who urge meetings merely for the discussion of motions, I do not think that is the important role of the Seanad.  I agree that when Senators take the trouble to put down motions they should be entitled to have those motions discussed and disposed of within a reasonable time. However, it is not always possible to arrange for that.  One of the reasons&mdash; and this is why I say there is no point in closing our eyes to facts&mdash; is that particularly since we joined the EEC it is not always possible to have Ministers available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to come to that, if the Senator would contain herself without interrupting for a minute.  It has been agreed in the scheme of procedure in relation to motions that it is open to proposers of motions to go ahead in the absence of Ministers.  I have no objection in the world to Senators who are sponsoring motions deciding to exercise their option in that regard, but it has been pointed out in the past that when that was done it did not result in a very satisfactory debate, certainly not as satisfactory a debate as otherwise might have taken place.  But that option is open to Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the motions which have been referred to by Members of the Fianna Fáil group, I think it is right to say, and possibly some of those who spoke in this discussion may have overlooked the fact, that we invited the Fianna Fáil group to let us <Col N="509" /> know their order of priority with regard to motions.  That invitation has so far not been responded to except to the extent that references were made today.  The reason we asked Fianna Fáil to do that is because it is recognised, and it is implicit in the scheme which was adopted in relation to motions, that it is time a Fianna Fáil motion, if I may call it such, was discussed in the House.  As far as this is possible we will be glad to facilitate them if we get the order of priority. I gather from Senator Lenihan's remarks today that he regards Motion No. 24 as the one which should receive priority so far as the motions from his group are concerned.</P>

      <P>Let me take No. 24 first.  As regards Motion No. 24, the position is that as soon as the Minister for Finance has finished with the Budget discussions in the Dáil he will be available to deal with it.  I agree with Senator Lenihan that, so far as the subject matter of the motion is concerned, it is a matter that would be well worth discussing; it is a matter that would be of immediate and real concern.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson spoke of the role of the Seanad&mdash;I do not remember quite what her words were and I do not wish to misquote her&mdash;to the general effect that we might have some more satisfactory procedure for fixing matters in the Order of Business. I am wide open to any concrete suggestions that may be made along those lines.  We could certainly have them considered at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to see if there might be any more satisfactory methods worked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discussion was a good one and I trust my contribution to it has not introduced acrimony which was lacking up to this.  Ministers will attend as often as they can but I do not think any of us should be asking too much.  We all know that in present conditions there is extreme pressure on Ministers.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, I understand, will be introducing legislation in this House <Col N="510" /> shortly.  I would certainly suggest, and I hope to make a suggestion that I hope will be well received, that other Ministers might follow that example as far as possible.  It would be a good idea and would assist the House generally. It would also assist the public understanding of the role of this House as part of the legislative machinery of the country if more Government legislation was introduced here.  I hope that it might be possible to arrange for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful for the constructive response to our suggestions from the Leader of the House.  I am aware that the real problem in this matter does not lie with him.  I am aware of his personal views, which he has often expressed, of the importance of having more regular Seanad meetings, discussing motions with or without the Minister being present, and initiating more legislation.  Above all else, I recognise that it is not the fault of the Leader of the House but the Government's fault that a sufficient volume of legislation is not going into the Dáil and not coming here.  The basic trouble lies in a Government who apparently cannot agree to real legislation among themselves.</P>
      <P>We in our group regard Motion No. 24 on the state of the economy, Motion No. 21 on the serious plight of those engaged in agriculture and Motion No. 17 seeking a debate on the discussion document on local government reorganisation as being our three most important motions.  I give the three to the Leader of the House because they cover three separate areas of administration and three separate Ministers.  If Deputy Ryan, the Minister for Finance, is not available for Motion No. 24 we would hope that Deputy Clinton, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, will be there for Motion No. 21, and if either of those or both are not available, then Deputy Tully, the Minister for Local Government, will be available for Motion No. 17.  In that way we are giving the Leader of the House a range of choices between three Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> We will not press for a vote at this stage, although I can appreciate Senator McGowan's disappointment when one considers that his motion on agriculture has been there a year. We will not press for a vote if we get a guarantee that all of those three, or one or two of those three motions, can be taken from our group at the next sitting day of the Seanad. If we get a guarantee from the Leader of the House then we would bring the matter to finality for this day.</P>

      <P>I know Senator Lenihan is not trying to be clever in this but he will appreciate that off the cuff, at a moment's notice, I would not be in a position to give anything in the nature of a firm guarantee in reply to his request.  All I can say is that we had reasonably firm hopes that the agricultural motion would be taken fairly early and I still hope that that is possible.  I hope that one or other of the three motions he wants to have discussed may be taken either at our next meeting, or within the next few meetings anyhow.  I cannot put it further than that without consultation with the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must apologise that the situation I am left in is that I have been in the Dáil all morning and such is the diligence of the refurbished Front Bench of the Opposition that I have been delayed somewhat longer there on the provisions of that legislation and I must return to that House at 4 o'clock for the continuation of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> The Bill that I bring before the House here is an important one.  It brings change in an area where there has been too little change, legislatively at any rate, for a considerable time. There is general acceptance that there are too many trade unions in Ireland. This has long been acknowledged by union leaders and others concerned with the problem.  We have 400,000 workers organised in roughly 100 unions.  These figures become even more alarming when one considers that almost one quarter of these workers are organised in six major unions, which leaves the rest in the remaining 90 or so unions.</P>
    <P>Multiplicity of trade unions in this country has created problems in industrial relations for both employers and unions.  Where a union has a small number of members it becomes impossible for it to provide the proper range of services necessary to promote members' interests in the most effective manner.  Of course a complication is the growing sophistication of industry and technology.  This means that if a union is to negotiate its way through job evaluation schemes and so on&mdash;the host of matters a union must concern itself with nowadays&mdash; it must have a wide range of professional and technical skills in the staff available to it.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances unions working with fewer than 1,000 members would find it very difficult to provide such staff.  Where a number of different unions represent workers of the same occupation or grade in a firm, negotiations can be very difficult and protracted, and worthwhile changes may be held up as a result of this multiplicity of unions.  Of course it has led to particular inter-union disputes and the 1973 annual report of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions shows that their disputes committee had to deal with 23 inter-union disputes. These disputes seem almost inevitable when one considers the large number of unions catering for workers in many of our national companies. There are, for example, 21 unions representing 11,000 workers in the ESB, 33 representing 21,000 in CIE, 18 representing 2,200 in Guinness' <Col N="514" /> and 12 representing 700 in Gouldings.</P>
    <P>The shortcomings of our trade union structure have been brought into sharper relief by the events consequent on our entry to the European Economic Community.  Many of the smaller unions find themselves at a disadvantage in endeavouring to keep abreast of the rather complex issues of interest to workers arising from our accession to the EEC.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement itself is keenly aware of the need for the rationalisation of the present trade union structure.  Recently, at the invitation of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, an eminent expert from the International Labour Office began a preliminary study of the problems created by the multiplicity of trade unions in Ireland.  I am hopeful that this preliminary study will have the effect of stimulating moves towards rationalisation.</P>
    <P>The existing legislation on amalgamations is contained in a number of pre-1920 Acts.  The provisions of this legislation were such as to act as a positive disincentive to amalgamation. The vagueness of this old legislation has undoubtedly contributed a very large legal deterrent to anybody thinking in those directions.  Senators will be aware of the legal battle which delayed the formation of the NEETU some years ago.  I hope that, as a result of the enactment of this Bill, similar difficulties will be avoided in the future.</P>
    <P>The purpose simply stated, of the Bill is to facilitate amalgamations between trade unions.  It will do this by providing clear-cut procedures for amalgamations and for the transfer of engagements.  It also provides for financial assistance from public funds towards the expenses involved.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill an instrument of amalgamation must be prepared.  This instrument will be examined by the Registrar of Friendly Societies and if it satisfies the requirements of the Act and regulations to be made under the Act it will be approved by the Registrar. A written secret ballot on the instrument of amalgamation, as approved by the registrar, must also be arranged and every member of the <Col N="515" /> union must be entitled to vote freely at this ballot.  At least seven days before the ballot is held the members of the trade union must receive notice in writing of the ballot and this notice must again be in a form approved by the registrar.  If the instrument of amalgamation is approved as a result of the ballot, the next step is to have the instrument registered by the registrar before the amalgamation can take effect.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provisions for transfers of engagements between trade unions.  By that we mean one union transferring its membership to another union without a new trade union being formed in the process.  At present there is no legislation in this country governing such transfers. While the absence of such legislation does not make transfers impossible, it leaves very much at large how such transfers should be effected.  This Bill provides that in the case of a transfer of engagements a procedure somewhat similar to that provided for in the case of amalgamation shall be followed by the transferor union.  In this way the interests of the members of the transferor union will be adequately safeguarded.</P>
    <P>These new procedures governing amalgamations and transfers of engagements which will be supervised by the Registrar of Friendly Societies are aimed at eliminating grounds for disputes in regard to the validity of amalgamations or transfers and at safeguarding the interests of the members involved.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation if two or more trade unions wish to amalgamate at least 50 per cent of the members of each of the unions must vote on the proposal to amalgamate and the vote of those in favour must exceed those against by 20 per cent or more.  This provision places a very difficult burden on trade unions in that it can be almost impossible to secure a 50 per cent turnout of workers even where critical issues such as wage negotiations are being discussed. The Bill proposes to replace this rather difficult requirement by providing that a simple majority of <Col N="516" /> those voting in favour of amalgamation or transfer of engagements will be sufficient to allow an amalgamation or transfer to take place.</P>
    <P>In order to simplify matters still further, the Bill contains a provision whereby a committee of management or other governing body of a transferee union, that is the union accepting the engagements, will be given power to alter the rules of the union to enable it accept a transfer of engagements.  However the Bill also provides that this power will not apply where a union adopts rules specifically excluding the operation of this provision.</P>
    <P>Under existing trade union legislation no time limit is specified within which a complaint against an amalgamation or transfer of engagements may be lodged by members of the trade unions involved.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides in this regard that the registrar would have power to deal with complaints in regard to amalgamations or transfers based on certain specified grounds and any such complaints will have to be lodged with him within six weeks of the application for the registration of the instrument of amalgamation or transfer.  If the complaint is substantiated, the registrar will make an order stating what must be done before he will consider an application to register the instrument.</P>
    <P>The Schedule to the Bill sets out the powers proposed for the Registrar of Friendly Societies in connection with the hearing of complaints.  These powers include power to require the attendance of witnesses or of any trade union officials concerned, the production of documents and so on.</P>
    <P>Under existing arrangements, legal difficulties can arise in regard to the transfer of property held by amalgamating unions.  I have therefore made provision in the Bill whereby the property of amalgamating unions may pass without any conveyance or assignment to the new union.  The property would be vested in the appropriate trustees.  The Bill also enables any changes in the ownership of registered trade union property consequent on an amalgamation or <Col N="517" /> transfer of engagements to be recorded under the Registration of Title Act, 1964, with a minimum of difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provision whereby the Minister for Industry and Commerce may, with the consent of the Minister for Labour, make regulations for carrying the Act into effect.  These regulation will cover such matters as applications to the registrar, registration of documents and so on.</P>
    <P>I have had discussions with a number of trade unions which are at present contemplating amalgamations and are taking steps in that direction.  I have therefore made provision in the Bill that, where steps have already been taken by trade unions with a view to amalgamation before the Bill becomes law, they may proceed as if the Act had not become law or, alternatively, the amalgamation may be completed under the provision of the new Act.  Finally there is the question of grants.  My intention is that no trade union should be discouraged or prevented from considering amalagamations or transfers of engagements because of the costs involved, which in some cases could be considerable.</P>
    <P>The Bill therefore includes a provision which will enable me, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make grants available towards exceptional expenditure necessarily incurred by trade unions in connection with amalgamations.</P>
    <P>A number of amendments were moved to the Bill during its passage through the Dáil.  The most siginificant is that relating to the position of British-based unions which operate in this country.  There are at present 18 such unions in Ireland with a combined thirty-two county membership of 170,000.  These would increase the cost of engaging appropriate consulting services, for example.  The amendment now forms section 15 of the Bill, which provides that a British-based union may not hold or be granted a negotiation licence unless it has an executive resident in the State or Northern Ireland with power to take decisions over a wide range of matters.  The provisions of this section will not come into operation in the <Col N="518" /> case of British-based unions which already hold negotiation licences until such time as I fix by order.  Sufficient time will be afforded to British-based unions to amend their rules to meet the requirements of the section.  Basically, all this section does is to ensure that Irish trade unionists have a say in the management of their own affairs in this island, North and South.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not force amalagmation on any union which feels that its members' interests would be best served by the retention of its own separate identity.  I would hope however that the Bill will act as a stimulus towards rationalisation.  I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The groundwork for this Bill was laid by the previous Government and this Government in very close consultation with the trade union movement.  Broadly speaking the Bill is acceptable to our group in principle. There are a number of details on which we propose to put down amendments on Committee Stage.  I am giving advance warning that we do not propose to plan Committee Stage today.  So far as we are concerned we would like to see Committee Stage on a future occasion when we can consider amendments that may improve the Bill in a practical way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been quite evident for some years that the multiplicity of trade unions, more particularly in the large organisations to which the Minister has referred, has not been helpful, to put it mildly, in securing industrial peace, and in general pursuing the legitimate claims of workers <i>vis-á-vis</i> employers.  The trade unionists themselves and the public generally have been the main sufferers as far as inter-union disputes have been concerned on a number of occasions.  The provisions in the Bill for approved procedures facilitating amalgamation and transfers of engagements are to be welcomed.  Heretofore, the basic problem was the procedure involved in amalgamation or transfer and the very archaic voting procedures that have existed and to which the Minister referred.  The fact that up to 50 per cent of the members had to vote and there had to be a 20 per cent <Col N="519" /> majority was an inhibiting factor in getting agreement.  What is now proposed&mdash;a regularised system of election, with a majority maintaining, and a proper balloting procedure under the supervision of the Registrar of Friendly Societies&mdash;makes sense.</P>
    <P>There is the question of allowing the individual member to have the choice of a postal vote.  It may be incorporated by way of regulation by a trade union involved in amalgamation or transfer.  We would like to see that being the right of the individual trade unionist himself or herself.  By reason of the scattered nature of many employments we feel this should reside elementary right which should reside with the individual trade unionist.  We will be moving an amendment on those lines on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The provision for grants to facilitate amalgamations and transfers is welcomed.  I know that the trade union movement at Congress have been pushing for this for some time. One amendment which the Fianna Fáil Party moved in the Dáil and which is now being adopted by the Minister on Committee Stage is one which we pushed very strongly.  I am glad the Minister accepted that amendment which now forms section 16 of the Bill and which makes it mandatory that, in regard to an outside-based union, before it can obtain a negotiating licence for the purposes of the Trade Union Acts, there must be a committee of management or other controlling authority of which every member now under this section must be resident in the State or in Northern Ireland.  That is a very important departure which the Fianna Fáil Party moved in the Dáil and is an improvement on the Bill as it originally stood on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>Along with the fragmentation and multiplicity of trade unions, I say quite bluntly that the other main disturbing feature in our industrial life has been the existence of British-based unions.  We are dealing with the multiplicity and fragmentation of trade unions in this Bill.  We have taken the first practical step to deal with the other weakness in our trade <Col N="520" /> union structure by ensuring that, if there are to be amalgamations or transfers of the nature envisaged in this Bill, such can only be negotiated by a British-based union.  It will primarily be a British-based union that will be involved in this sort of procedure.  A British-based union must have a committee of management here.  Every member of it must be a resident in this country before any such amalgamation or transfer takes place.  Otherwise we could easily have had the situation where a British-based union without any base here in the form of management committee or controlling authority could proceed to engage in amalgamations and transfers and, to put it bluntly, embark upon a campaign of gobbling up Irish-based unions.  That is the first shot in this battle that I hope will be pursued actively by Congress, by the large Irish-based trade unions that have influence, by Irish trade unionists generally.  I hope they get every facility and help from whatever Government are in power to ensure that we gradually erode and finally end control that has existed here to the detriment of our economy. It has had a deleterious effect on our economy and has induced into the Irish trade union movement a spirit of class warfare that is not part of the tradition of the Irish trade union movement itself and the Irish labour movement generally.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters in the Bill which will involve Committee Stage amendments.  I do not like this business of having two Ministers and two Departments involved in the administration of the Bill.  I appreciate the difficulties of the Registrar of Friendly Societies within the control of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It is unsatisfactory in a Bill of this kind that you have the Minister for Industry and Commerce and one of his subsidiary bodies supervising the electoral procedures that are proposed under this Bill and which, of course, will be largely a matter for the Minister for Labour.  I realise that this would involve a lot of redrafting of the legislation but, candidly, I would be happier if this procedure <Col N="521" /> of amalgamation and transfer was directly within the ambit of the Labour Court under the Minister for Labour rather than have it as is proposed here, dealt with by the Registrar of Friendly Societies under another Minister in a separate Department.  It could give rise to confusion in the future.  I appreciate that it might have presented a very difficult drafting problem. Again, this is a matter we will be looking at with a view to possible amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which has political undertones, and it is the only one.  It is a matter not just of politics but of individual right.  It is the question of opting in or out of the political fund.</P>
    <P>We put down an amendment in the other House on this aspect which went to a vote on the First Stage and was rejected.  We propose to put down an amendment again on Committee Stage on this aspect.  What we propose is that, in the case of any such amalgamation or transfer, if the smaller union to the amalgamation or transfer does not have a political fund under their rules and mergers with a larger union that has a political fund, the smaller union should not be coerced by reason of their amalgamation to have a political fund.  We feel that this is a reasonable proposal.</P>
    <P>I know it has political connotations as far as the Labour Party are concerned, but I am thinking in terms of the freedom and liberty of the individual trade unionists.  If a smaller trade union has not imposed on it this obligation to discharge to the political fund of the Labour Party, which is what it means, I do not see why in the event of amalgamation or transfer that union and its individual members should be forced to contribute to a political fund to which heretofore they had not contributed.</P>
    <P>What will be proposed in our amendment and what was proposed in the other House is that in that case:</P>
    <P>The members of an amalgamating trade union which has not got a political fund shall, upon becoming members of an amalgamated union with such a fund, be <Col N="522" /> deemed to have opted out of such fund.</P>
    <P>In other words, it is perfectly equitable that, if they had not been paying into such a fund, then these members, on amalgamation with a larger trade union, shall be deemed to preserve their present position and shall be deemed to have opted out of a contribution to a political fund.  If they decide democratically, on becoming members of a larger union, to opt for a contribution to the political fund, this can be done by individual members.</P>
    <P>If they have not heretofore contributed to a political fund they should not be forced to pay arbitrarily, without any choice in the matter, towards a political fund.  I am not suggesting that they should not contribute to a political fund if that is their democratic decision.  If they have not contributed to a political fund heretofore, then that position should be allowed to continue, and on amalgamation or transfer they should be deemed to have not opted for contribution and then on merging it would be open to the members to opt, by democratic decision, for contribution if they so wish.  We will be moving an amendment on Committee Stage along those lines.</P>
    <P>In principle, this Bill is most acceptable and is an excellent Bill. It is one that can be improved in certain areas that I have just mentioned, and while we will give the Second Stage to the Minister, we wish to see the Committee Stage held over for some weeks to enable constructive amendments along the lines I have mentioned to be prepared.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In these days of dissension and conflict it might be appropriate for me to point out that the trade union movement is a national body in every sense of the expression, embracing the whole country, North and South, and bringing into the orbit unions with headquarters in the Republic and unions with headquarters in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is general agreement within the trade union movement that the movement requires rationalisation. <Col N="523" /> There is quite a variance of opinion regarding the scope and the form of that rationalisation.  In any event, the question of rationalisation inside the movement is one for the movement itself.  Whatever might eventuate in the future in this respect it is absolutely certain that it will involve amalgamation and transfer of arrangements and so on.  This is the field in which legislation is necessary and essential.  I welcome this Bill, and I thank the Minister for bringing about the necessary changes in the legislation &mdash;changes which will enable unions, if they so desire, to amalgamate or transfer in an easier and cheaper fashion than hitherto.</P>
    <P>However while the Bill, generally speaking, is acceptable to the trade union movement and followed a great deal of discussion between the Minister and the trade union movements, there are some things that I think should be included in it.  They are things which I understood the Minister had agreed with Congress.  For instance, Congress were anxious to ensure that voting on amalgamation and transfers of engagements should be confined to benefit members of the unions themselves or to members specified in the union's rules as entitled to vote on amalgamation and transfers. I do not think there is anything in the Bill to cover this point.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would give us some further information about this aspect.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the making of grants to cover certain expenses arising in amalgamation and transfers. It does not specify the type of expenses that would be paid.  For instance, will the expenses include fees for consultants or the reports from consultants?  Will the expenses include the payment of legal expenses? Unlike the position in the United Kingdom we have a written Constitution here and very often trivial cases end up in the High Court or the Supreme Court if two or more unions want to effect an amalgamation or transfer.  It is quite possible that on some very trivial question the matter could end up in the High <Col N="524" /> Court or the Supreme Court.  Although the matter itself might be trivial, we all know that the legal fees are not trivial.  I should like to know if the provisions relating to grants from the Minister for Finance include consultancy fees, legal fees and so on.  What exactly does the section provide for?</P>
    <P>The most important factor in this legislation is not covered by the Bill. It is the question of the power which members of these unions have to &ldquo;do their own thing", as it were.  The Minister says that section 15, as amended, provides for the setting up of an executive committee of British unions in Northern Ireland and that this ensures that Irish trade unionists have a say in the management of their own affairs.  The members of these unions and the members of Irish unions and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions representing the whole trade union movement do not want any section of workers to have a say in their affairs.  They want them to control their own affairs.  Something in addition to the setting up of purely Irish committees in respect of British unions is necessary.</P>
    <P>We have suggested to the Minister that there should be a written provision giving authority to the members of Irish unions in Ireland, North or South, to decide for themselves whether they will effect an amalgamation or a transfer.  That would dispose of any deficiencies that would crop up in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan suggested that where amalgamations are effected and the members of one union had not been paying into a political fund those members should not be required to pay into the political fund of the other union. The existing legislation covers this adequately.  If one were to argue that members merging with another group of workers should not be required to contribute to one fund in the other union, why should they contribute to a strike fund, a pension fund, or any other fund?  If they are embraced in the political rules of another union they have the opportunity of opting out, so it could really be a paper exercise.  However, when companies <Col N="525" /> amalgamate either on a national scale or an international scale nobody knows who pays what into the political funds. There are no records kept as there are in the trade union movement.  It is not true to say that payments into the union's political fund is payment indirectly into the Labour Party fund. The rules of most unions provide that the fund is used for political purposes. A number of unions in times of elections give financial support to members of the union of all political persuasions and of none.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister for the assistance he has given Congress in formulating this Bill.  I should also like to ask him to have regard to the points I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone looking at the industrial and economic problems we have had over the past 40 years is bound to look for causes.  World recession or our own Government's fault or lack of increased production could be put forward as a cause.  Inter-union bickering could be a cause.  There are hundreds of scapegoat causes that could be pinpointed The unions are often unjustly blamed.  Mainly because of historical reasons we find ourselves in the position of having a large number of small unions.  Over 400,000 workers are organised in over 100 unions in this country.  In contrast there are 6,400,000 workers organised in 16 industrial unions under the West German Trade Union Federation.  The high number of trade unions here has created grave problems and has had an effect on our economic progress. Both employers and trade unions have suffered as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incidence of inter-union disputes is also on the increase.  This is not to be wondered at when we consider that there are 21 unions representing 11,000 workers in the ESB alone.  This in itself signifies a grave need for amalgamation and for a lesser number of smaller unions.  To further complicate matters there are a number of unions catering for the same category of workers.  This is the main cause of friction within our trade union movement.  When so many small unions represent the <Col N="526" /> same type of worker, naturally there would be a tendency towards friction.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I welcome this Bill.  Amalgamations of unions will be made somewhat easier because of this legislation.  It is up to the workers, the trade unions and the employers to ensure that they formulate agreements all sides can adhere to.</P>
    <P>Our entry to the EEC naturally has created grave problems, particularly for the smaller unions.  The fact that the larger unions would be in a better position to cope with these complex problems again illustrates the necessity for a lesser number of unions and, indeed, for the amalgamation of most of the smaller with the larger unions. Smaller unions are not capable of dealing with the complex issues and situations which could arise because of our involvement in the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>Many people involved in trade unions down through the years have given serious thought to amalgamation. There was some hinderance in existing legislation towards that development. On that basis, and taking into consideration that so many involved in the trade union movement have naturally tended towards amalgamation, this Bill is welcome.  When one takes into consideration the position in West Germany, Holland and other continental countries, it is only natural to assume that now, when we are involved with such countries in trade and in every aspect of our economy, we should be aligned with those countries in other respects.  Trade disputes could be settled more easily because fewer unions will be involved.</P>
    <P>The smaller unions, after amalgamation, may find it difficult to get employment for their officials.  I feel certain the Minister will ensure that a person employed in a small union will be re-employed after amalgamation. There are diminishing numbers in the smaller unions.  When they consent to amalgamation, this is a very serious step from their point of view.  They are burying their identity and that is not an easy thing for any group to do. On that basis alone, every precaution <Col N="527" /> should be taken to ensure that those officials in the small unions are re-employed after amalgamation.</P>
    <P>I would welcome a more definite provision in this Bill in regard to the postal vote.  When one is considering amalgamation there may be a tendency on the part of the officials of the smaller union to do something to try and hold on.  If this Bill were more definite on the postal vote, that problem could be minimised to some extent.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to detain the House too long on this Bill.  When through amalgamation, we have a lesser number of unions, there will be closer co-operation between urban and rural workers.  Unions should make some efforts to cater particularly for the farm labourer.  This is one section of the community which has been left to one side through the years.  After some years, through the amalgamation of these unions and with the emergence of a significantly smaller number of unions, there could be some room in those unions for the small farmer.  In many cases the income of the small farmer can now be aligned with the income of the farm worker.  Those people have been left out in the cold down through the years.  With fewer unions catering for all types of workers, the farm labouring community will be properly organised and involved in the trade union movement.  At a later stage in this debate some of the trade union officials might be able to enlighten me on this point.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the amalgamation of unions, there will be a certain amount of difficulty involved in getting each worker who has a vote to use it. We are all well aware that in the Australian parliamentary elections a voter who has a vote and does not use it, can be fined.  From the point of view of democracy this system might not be in line with our thinking. If the trade unions concerned fined a worker who did not utilise his vote in regard to amalgamation, it would strengthen their hand and bring about a change of attitude in the individual concerned.  He should <Col N="528" /> utilise that vote in order to ensure that he is more properly represented in the larger trade union movement. My suggestion of a fine would not, I know, be in the best traditions of this country.  However, Australia is considered quite a democratic State, although, of course being fined for not voting in parliamentary elections is a difficult thing.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will be a help towards streamlining the amalgamation of unions.  I hope every financial aid will be given by the State to unions who desire to amalgamate.  We should give every help we can to the unions so that they can work more effectively, because the good work they are doing will naturally develop our economy.  There will be better representation of the workers concerned. Indeed, both the worker and the employer would benefit from such amalgamations.</P>
    <P>We here are fortunate that the trade union movement here covers the Thirty-two Counties.  The barriers between North and South have caused much trouble in the past in other spheres.  That is not the case with the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>On a Trade Union Bill naturally the emphasis is placed on the trade union movement and the worker.  We seem to forget the employer.  There is a substantial number of employers here who would tell you they are the hardest workers in the country.</P>
    <P>Through legislation such as this I hope there will be more unity and concern on all sides.  That is the reason I welcome this type of legislation. I have tried to point out the reasons I feel that the trade union movement has not developed to the extent it should have in the past year. As I said earlier, for historical reasons we were saddled with a large number of small trade unions.</P>
    <P>I am not condemning small trade unions and I do not want the wrong impression taken, but I feel certain that the workers in those small trade unions realise that they can better further their interests by amalgamating with larger trade union groups. This is more true now than ever before. <Col N="529" /> Let us hope that this legislation will enable us align ourselves with the industrial countries we are now involved with through our membership of the European Economic Community to the extent that we will have a smaller number of trade unions working for the betterment of the worker and perhaps co-operating better with the Federated Union of Employers, because this is on the cards.  When the Federated Union of Employers have a lesser number of unions to deal with, naturally there will be more co-operation and more development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>If I leave out the employers in my contribution it is not because I think they are not affected by this legislation but because of my bias for the workers.  I am not saying that employers are not affected by the lack of rationalisation in the trade union movement.  Employers can be hit by this lack of rationalisation and multiplicity of unions.  On the other hand, I should like to say that for many years the trade union movement has been conscious of the need for rationalisation within the trade union movement.  The Minister pointed out that in my own firm there are 2,200 workers represented by 18 unions, and I could not agree more that this seems a rather ridiculous situation.  I happen to represent 1,700 of those workers.  That means that the other 500 or so are represented by about 17 unions.  Some of the 1,700 I mention are in another branch of my union, therefore, we are talking about 17 unions in one industry representing about 500 people.  That is a measure of the problem you face. Fortunately in Guinness's we have a good working relationship.  Disputes there are very infrequent, I am glad to say, and that is to the credit of my fellow trade unionists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to talk in a general way about the advantages of this Bill to the working class movement &mdash;what they can gain from it.  The Minister referred to problems in the way of amalgamations&mdash;for example, the difficulties the two engineering unions got themselves into.  That was the subject of High Court and, <Col N="530" /> ultimately, Supreme Court wrangling. The two unions found themselves taking part in a very costly and trying exercise and nobody is quite sure whether the problem has been totally resolved.  It is a problem that left a lot of headaches and made a lot of men older before their time.</P>
    <P>The Trade Union Acts from 1876 to 1970, even the 1941 Act or the 1971 Act, did not give the scope that this Bill will give to meet the type of problem we had with regard to the multiplicity of unions.  Therefore this Bill sets out clearly what exactly is needed to satisfy the law with regard to amalgamations of trade unions bearing in mind that some of them have not got big money and cannot afford the crushing cost that can result from actions such as have been taken by the two engineering unions.</P>
    <P>I am impressed by many provisions in the Bill.  I share Senator Kennedy's views on scope, form and one or two other areas.  I also share his view about who takes the initiative in respect of amalgamations.  Unions are very conscious that something must be done about this.</P>
    <P>I also accept that the Bill does not do anything that would jeopardise any initiatives taken in that respect.  Therefore, I must go on record as giving it a welcome.  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is clearly defined in section 2.  This is a very positive word.  I do not wish to take up time by quoting the sections but they are very positive in their meaning.  This is a very encouraging trend.  When the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used it impresses me because it puts the onus on both unions to know exactly where they are going.  This ensures that they will not get into a situation similar to that which the electrical and engineering trade unions got into in the past.  Another trade union, in a lesser way, got into trouble also.</P>
    <P>It is clearly stated in section 3 that every member of the union shall have a vote.  It protects the rights of the individual to have a say in determining where he believes he will get the best service.  Two-thirds of the voting power is another way in which the individual's rights are protected.  The <Col N="531" /> section dealing with the secret ballot also protects the members.  There can be no interference or constraints on them.  They must get notice of their rights prior to voting.  Seven days before any action takes place there must be notice in the papers before voting&mdash;not before discussions are under way, but before voting.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed not only to facilitate the movement towards rationalisation of the trade union movement in general, and to help towards a better relationship by which the nation can benefit, but also to protect the individual, who in the past may have had the feeling that he was about to be sold out by one of his trade union leaders.  That can no longer be the case.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes it clear that, where unions want to merge, to take advantage of the better services they can get, to avoid overlapping and so on, the financially weak unions will be in a position to get aid, and the resources of the stronger unions, as I read the Bill, will not be drained by embarking on amalgamation.  The union that is financially strong and the union financially weak will both be entitled to financial assistance to meet certain costs.  Like Senator Kennedy, I am not sure exactly what is meant by costs, whether it means consultants' fees, legal costs and so on.  Nevertheless, there is scope there to deal with costs.</P>
    <P>Everybody agrees there is need for greater unity in the trade union movement and for a more rational structure in order that the members would get a better service.  This Bill goes a long way to encouraging that move. I am particularly interested in this question of unity, not only from the employers' point of view but more so from the point of view of the workers and what they are losing by dissipating their energies through this multiplicity of unions overlapping, the draining of resources that could be employed on a better basis, not making use of best talent available to put forward their causes.</P>
    <P>No trade union legislation can be drawn up that will bring about a unity <Col N="532" /> of hearts and minds.  That has got to happen within the trade union movement itself.  We can only draw up a Bill, put as many constructive provisions into it to meet the situation, and do as much as possible to see that the harmful effects that might have been there heretofore in amalgamations are wiped out.  It is a question of whether the Bill can induce this unity of hearts and minds.  The ingredients are there.  If it is adequately publicised, the fears, doubts and mistrusts of members that there might be a sellout or that their fate would be decided by officials without ballots and without a right to compensation, will be overcome.</P>
    <P>Many people are genuinely concerned about Ireland and her workers. I have no doubt that, having read the Bill, they will be satisfied that the means by which they can strive towards this unity of hearts and minds is built into the Bill.  If the Bill goes only some of the way towards achieving a trade union movement with less antagonism and conflicts, less competition between members, less overlapping in matters common to each union involved in any industry with consequent waste of time, money and energy, then it will be seen by trade union leaders as something that will help them to effectively initiate positive moves and practical steps towards rationalising the structure of the unions.</P>
    <P>In the early sixties efforts were made to deal with trade union rationalisation. In 1965, the general unions, with a membership of almost 200,000 &mdash;the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, the Workers Union of Ireland, the Federation of Rural Workers, the Irish Municipal Workers Union and the Marine Port and General Workers Union&mdash;after efforts to amalgamate, finally talked about a federation.  Unfortunately, that did not take place either.  Finally two unions, the Transport Union and the Workers Union of Ireland, finished up talking about the question of amalgamation. I refer to this to demonstrate that, had this Bill been on the Statute Book at that time and had the facilities been there, more positive and <Col N="533" /> practical steps would have been taken to bring about trade union rationalisation. It is also quite clear that quite a lot of unions now, which have a common historical background and with no real basic differences in their policies or approach&mdash;in a lot of cases the relationships are very good and friendly between the unions&mdash;and with the old prejudices, conflicts and suspicions gone, will welcome this Bill.</P>
    <P>Trade unionists will be very keen about this Bill, because with the pace of change in industry, through the technological progress and re-organisation, there are problems facing unions and they need to establish a close working relationship.  Generally speaking, the Bill provides the guidelines. It is desirable that the trade union movement, with its 500,000 membership covering the Thirty-two Counties, should grow in its effectiveness to influence changes in society.</P>
    <P>At the moment the trade union movement plays a very effective role. But if this multiplicity of unions, the overlapping and the waste of time I referred to earlier on, can be overcome it can play a more effective role.  If people make use of the possibilities within the Bill and the facilities it provides to make sure the individual is protected, then the changes in society that the trade union movement would like to see coming about, the question of a more equitable distribution of wealth and the development of our natural resources, will take place.</P>
    <P>Earlier on I said that this Bill might not have all the ingredients the trade unions would like to have built into it to help them cope with the many complex and difficult situations that arise through the multiplicity of unions in single industries.  It may not have taken sufficient notice that federation might be desired by a lot of people who are afraid of losing their identity.  I think Senator Cowan touched on this briefly.  There is a fear that people might lose their identity in larger unions.  I would prefer amalgamation, but the people in small unions afraid of losing their identity would welcome some indication <Col N="534" /> of how far the Minister would go with unions who might want to enter into a federation.  It might be a good thing to take care of this.  On the other hand the Minister was trying to deal with amalgamations and to introduce any question of federation possibly might minimise the effects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Workers nowadays have been getting a lead from the Trade Union Congress. In a very big organisation there is always a communication gap.  But by and large the workers are beginning to understand the increasing need to co-ordinate negotiations at local, industrial and national levels and also the need to represent workers' interests at national level, both directly to Governments and on national bodies.  They have influence in this particular area, access to Ministers and so on.  They have scope to sit on national bodies.  But, with the coming together of many talents the elimination of waste of time and energy which the Bill will help them bring about, they can protect those interests at national level more effectively than they can at the moment.  The workers realise this.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is given more widespread circulation throughout the trade union movement to stimulate the thinking of the ordinary members it will help to ease attitudes towards amalgamation. When the rights of individual members is fully understood by people on the shop floor a great deal of the thinking about large unions and the disparity in membership may no longer be a threat because the knowledge that the trade union officials are not deciding their fate will now become evident.  Even though this was not the case before the Bill was introduced, when trade union leaders were trying to bring about amalgamations or federations, there was suspicion and doubt in the minds of members that they might be selling them out.  This was not the case because the rules of the unions would not have allowed that but nevertheless the suspicion was there.  The provisions of the Bill will reassure individuals, particularly in respect of their rights to consultation and a valid vote by two-thirds majority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="535" /> Workers will grow in experience through the educational training programmes and being in contact with workers who have a higher standard of education.  This will help the people I spoke of earlier on.  This Bill will help them to understand that their togetherness is all-important in this day and age.  It may well be that, properly handled, we could have a concensus that to crow in your own particular bailiwick is no longer serving the interests of workers particularly when they witness the development of very large and powerful organisations representing interests opposed to the trade union interests.  Workers are then more likely to take the view that their security lies in the evolution and modernisation of the trade union structures and resources.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides the means to facilitate the viewpoint I have just expressed. If I am correct in my assumption that the earlier viewpoint of suspicion, doubt and fear of being swallowed up is diminishing, the Bill can be of assistance to workers to come together on many matters in the first instance and then finally get down to the question of either federation or amalgamation.  Workers could cooperate on a lot of matters they have in common, then broaden them out into federation and subsequently into amalgamation.</P>
    <P>The inevitable result of that kind of development will be that they will recognise the strength that grows out of their amalgamation, not in the sense of sheer cussedness that they get strength and power to abuse situations, but on the basis of bringing together a lot of talent that are presently wasted on trivial things, and dealing with arrogant and unreasonable attitudes and unnecessary conflicts within the movement instead of a concentration on the collective abilities to overcome the threats that bedevil the trade union movement or to strengthen the efforts of the trade union officials, when they are trying to match up to people who have not got their interests at heart or when they are trying to circumvent the effects of powerful organisations opposed to trade unionism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> Again, speaking from the shop floor point of view, I think that there will be an awareness nowadays that it is only organisations of a reasonable size that will be able to provide the staff to cover the very wide range of services and activity that is demanded and is necessary to meet the challenge, not only from other bodies opposed to trade union interests, but to deal with the increasing rapidity of technological change, the effects of free trade employment and the need for training and re-training as a result of the many rationalisation programmes taking place within industry and which leaves people in some age groups with nowhere to go.  If all the resources are put together then the pressures can be put on to see that in this respect also the workers' rights are protected.  It is only by a coming together through amalgamation that this real effectiveness can manifest itself.</P>
    <P>The question of growing living standards is another matter to be considered.  If the Trade Union Bill is communicated in the proper way and it is properly understood either by way of seminars or explanatory statements by the trade union movement then it will be welcomed by workers.</P>
    <P>Many trade union leaders in the past, when they were talking about amalgamations or federations, because of old prejudices and conflicts could not be as clear in their announcements or statements as they would have liked.  They had to tread very warily indeed.  They were a little vague so as to avoid offending their members.  Again, it is a question of their members talking about their identity being lost in big organisations.</P>
    <P>The Bill will allow people to be positive.  The trade union organisation and its affiliated bodies may find sufficient in the Bill to enable them now to come out strongly in favour of amalgamation because in the past they had not got anything on the Statute Book to back them up.  They will be able to advise members in what direction they should travel in the interests of using this power in a conation <Col N="537" /> structive way to counter the effects of organisations that have not got trade union interests at heart.</P>
    <P>The attitude of trade union workers and their organisations in the past was that they believed that trade unions were designed and structured to represent and to defend the working classes. They believed that the trade unions should set up organisations for dealing with their demands but this did not really reflect the collective will and purpose of the trade union movement or of organised labour.  To speak about the trade union movement as being strictly a defensive organisation was a bit narrow.  It was a hindrance to bringing about a strong, unified and truly democratic labour movement. I am glad to say that latter day attitudes have grown away from that strictly defensive attitude.  Workers today look on their organisations as both offensive and defensive organisations. In my opinion the growth of unity in the movement will give them real power and the capacity to promote and advance the social and economic interests of Irish workers.  I think the Bill will go a long way to speed up that process.  I am satisfied that the workers seek the objectives of achievement and maintenance of full employment, a steady rise in living standards, equality of opportunity, a fair distribution of incomes and wealth, the elimination of poverty, comprehensive and adequate welfare services and improvements in the quality of life and environment.  I believe they have now come to a greater awareness of the fact that they are in a very strong organisation.  They believe those objectives are desirable. We are getting away from the narrow concept of what can be squeezed out of the employer at local level and there is a movement towards the type of policies, aims and objectives I mentioned.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement has in the past made great strides, both North and South.  What it has achieved has not only been good for the trade union movement but has been good for the Irish nation as well. Despite the difficulties encountered by the Northern Ireland trade unionists <Col N="538" /> they have played an important role in building up the economy there, but they have not got a lot of credit for it.  Northern Ireland trade unionists have a lot in common with trade unionists here.  They would probably have some reservations about the question of British-based unions. However, the section is framed in such a way that I do not think it would be an impediment to union rationalisation.  I am sure people from the North of Ireland would sit in on discussions which might bring about amalgamation of trade unions in the South.  The objections I mentioned about the unbalanced distribution of wealth and so on will no doubt influence them, particularly as they would like to see the same thing occur in the North.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that rationalisation has been on the cards for 16 or 17 years now and that little progress has been made.  People must understand the complications it entails&mdash;for example, as I mentioned earlier, loss of identity and people wanting to crow in their own particular bailiwick. The aim of the Bill is to bring people together.  There is a danger that we could lose the value of what we are aiming for by trying to achieve major objectives but at the same time, because of past conflicts, prejudices or traditions, staying in smaller units. Small units are not viable in many cases and the employees of some small unions are lucky on occasions even to get their wages.  Members need to have a realisation of that fact plus the fact that they are losing out on expertise, talent and are allowing their own energies and the energies of their own officials to be dissipated.  If the contents of this Bill are communicated correctly we can look to initiatives being taken to rationalise the movement without the fear or suspicion that so often is part and parcel of merger discussions.</P>
    <P>The outlook of trade unionists generally can continue to broaden to meet workers' needs and demands that have multiplied and have taken on new forms.  If the will is there to utilise the Bill properly the trade unions will come to a realisation that <Col N="539" /> it is no longer possible to exist in small units, because the requirements of their members as trade unionists, citizens and parents will not be served.  If they confine themselves to local matters, they will be unable to influence industrial, political and cultural and educational matters on a national scale.  Workers must understand that the questions in which trade unions are involved are no longer confined to the place of employment.  The trade unionist himself is a producer and a consumer.  When he leaves his place of employment he has to broaden out. He can broaden out further if he makes up his mind to play a decisive role in shaping his future.  This can only be done by recognising that his interest does not lie merely within the walls of his place of employment.</P>
    <P>The Trade Union Bill, 1974, if given the consideration that it merits, will create the atmosphere to help people to make use of the possibilities contained in it.  Possibly a realisation will emerge among workers&mdash;I hope it will &mdash;that the Bill if properly utilised can constitute a step towards proper unity and from unity to the great strengths which I referred to earlier and the satisfaction of trade unions exercising a greater influence in society as a whole not only for themselves but for the nation.  They can do this without merging with the views of the private enterprise society or surrendering any of their ideas to the private enterprise system.</P>
    <P>The Bill strives to facilitate the approach to unity.  It may also be the means whereby the unwarranted confidence in private enterprise to solve our economic ills will be challenged constructively through the efforts of a strong, united trade union movement. These are the possibilities I see within the Bill, whereby the workers can, if they get to understand the meaning of it, achieve quite a lot.</P>
    <P>When I refer to challenging private enterprise regarding the unwarranted confidence in the system, I do not say it in a bitter way.  It can be done constructively by the talents that will come together in the trade union movement. They have already played a great role, <Col N="540" /> despite the complex and difficult situation which they are in, not only to shape the economy but also the social side of life.</P>
    <P>Apart from what is contained in the Bill and the possibilities it offers, people may become conscious of the fact that where you had bitter enemies who invaded each other's countries and slaughtered each other and even raped each other's lands and homes, they have come together on the Continent. They did not come together for the sake of satisfying the needs of people outside their own particular movement. They come together on the basis of an enlightened selfish interest.  We as trade unionists would be the last in the world to say trade unionists are not selfish.  Of course we are.  The nature of the society and its advertisement campaigns have made us selfish.  We can be selfish and at the same time constructive in selfishly pursuing our own particular aims.</P>
    <P>If we amalgamate and use all the facilities available to us and the services that can be given to us through amalgamation, then your trade unions can realise the benefits, and the prejudices will be sunk.  The fears that stopped them coming together in a common venture for a common purpose will have come to the surface and there will be further development.</P>
    <P>We should give the Bill a hearing and concentrate on the possibilities the Bill offers for real unity.  It will not solve all our problems but it will give us a chance to deal with the real ones and not the side issues.  It will enable us to apply our resources more effectively to tacking unemployment, the rise in living standards, the quality of opportunities, fairer distribution of wealth and incomes, the elimination of poverty and exercising an influence over the proper utilisation of the natural resources of the country.  That list of policies, coupled with the question of adequate social welfare services and the quality of life and environment, are very worthwhile social and economic aspirations. Therefore, while the Minister has not put those policies into his Bill, it is a matter for the people within the trade <Col N="541" /> union movement to take the initiatives. I thank the Minister for having sufficient courage to bring about the type of Bill that was very badly needed.  I hope that many of the points which I made will be shared with a lot of my fellow trade unionists and that they will grasp the opportunity to initiate moves that will help us to grow and develop into a much greater and more effective organisation in the interests of the trade unions as a whole but in the interests of the nation also.</P>

      <P>Like those who have already spoken, I wish to welcome this Bill which is well designed and well intentioned.  I believe it will be most useful.  It will provide the machinery which eventually, we hope, will lead to the amalgamation of the multiplicity of trade unions in this country.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that trade unions have been very necessary.  Indeed the history of the whole trade union movement in this country would be a most instructing and a very interesting book if put together.  I belong to one of the oldest trade unions in the country, the INTO, which was formed almost 110 years ago.  This is a union from which many of the other unions who were formed in later years have derived immense benefits from the manner in which that union was set up and from their general structure and the various sections and funds which they provided for members.</P>
      <P>Unions in the beginning were very necessary.  They taught the worker to stand on his feet.  They taught the employer and other people to realise the dignity of the worker and the human being and that the man who was working was a very important factor in the economy of the nation as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my part of Ulster, well into the middle of this century there was a practice whereby workers who were hired with various people had no set hours.  I have in mind a story which was told of a man who went to work in the morning at 6 o'clock cutting whins for horses.  He went out ploughing during the day and at night when <Col N="542" /> the work was finished he was sent out to the barn to thrash.  The result was that he was working about 18 to 20 hours per day.  He then told the employer he was going to leave.  He said why: &ldquo;I think I will go somewhere where I might get a permanent job.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That shows that in those days the worker certainly needed a trade union to back up his demands and give him a rightful place in society. We in this country have to be very thankful to the various trade union movements throughout the ages who have amalgamated the workers into various groups and who have fought for the rights and who have produced their rules and regulations and so on. If in later years we have multiplicity of trade unions, that to my mind is besides the point.  I think, however, with our entry into the EEC, that it is necessary for us to re-examine the whole structure and I compliment the Minister in bringing in this Bill because it does not force amalgamation but provides the machinery whereby many of these unions can get together, and by doing that they will be able to work out for themselves fewer unions with better bargaining power and with more funds which they will try to use to benefit their workers through fostering educational schemes and providing the various things that members of unions now appreciate or are entitled to.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to almost 100 unions catering for 400,000.  In present circumstances that is totally wrong.  We can look at some of the groups mentioned. For instance, in CIE there are 21 unions catering for 11,000 people; in Goulding's, 12 unions catering for 700.  Figures like those, I think, were given.  There are 18 unions in Guinness's.  One would imagine that in a firm such as Guinness's that have provided, so far as I know, throughout the years tremendous services for their workers, it would have been possible for the workers to get together and have one or two unions.  I am not dictating as to what is in their best interests but from an outside point of view one would say that one or two unions would be in a better position to negotiate rather than having multiplicity <Col N="543" /> therein.  The same thing could be said of CIE and the ESB.</P>
    <P>The Bill may have the effect of encouraging these people to get together. I fully realise that often it is not easy because there are various officials in charge of various unions and that a means must be found whereby few of those people would lose their positions or if they did that they would be compensated in that respect.  People who have dedicated a great part of their lives to jobs such as those cannot be thrown overboard and we cannot expect those unions to come together and jettison the officials.  There must be machinery provided, and I think there is some in the Bill, whereby public funds might be used to help to solve this problem&mdash;anything in that way that could be done to ensure that we would have fewer unions.  I feel it is generally accepted now that it would in one way or another mitigate the number of industrial disputes we have had.  I am not questioning the right of the worker to withdraw his labour but at the same time we have to be conscious in the competitive world in which we live.  We must have our workers organised in such a way, we must have our unions organised in such a way, that they will be able to negotiate quickly, that they will understand &mdash;and they should be taken into this in a big way&mdash;what the employers are trying to do.</P>
    <P>Employers, too, are very important people and those who own factories and those who create employment certainly will have to be considered. In the past, the workers had given magnificent service.  They should be taken more into the confidence of the management.  We have an enormous amount of machinery in the country now for settling strikes, between the Labour Court, conciliation and arbitration and so on.  In the years ahead we would strive as earnestly as possible to ensure that we will not have these strikes which are detrimental to the workers themselves and which we know are very detrimental to our country.  A strike places the employer who would be trying to sell goods on foreign markets in a very <Col N="544" /> awkward position, because he often is not able to fulfil the orders and if he is not, then eventually we will reach the position where workers will be let go.  Eventually the manager and the factory may lose their overseas orders.  I know that the workers realise these things, that with our entry into the EEC it is more important now than ever.</P>
    <P>Some provision has been made in the Bill as to how these amalgamations could take place.  I think one section refers to having a ballot.  In days gone by it had to be a two-thirds majority but now that has been changed to a simple majority.  That is a good thing.  On the question of having a ballot, it is important it should be a secret ballot, that the ballot papers should be posted out to all the members and that they should be returned to an auditor and counted in that way.  I do not agree with a practice in some places of a show of cards or a show of hands because if often puts people in an awkward position.  The ballot is the fairest way and the most democratic way of doing it.  That is covered in the Bill too.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned the change of name and that, too, is important. There would have to be agreement and I think it is covered by some section whereby two or three unions may get together and may agree on this and it should not be a very difficult exercise.  I am sure the officials of the trade unions and the Congress of Trade Unions will be very happy to facilitiate the unions involved in trying to achieve this very desirable purpose.</P>
    <P>We have a situation whereby some unions in this country are British-based. We have to be very careful so as to ensure that the people who will be making the decisions at executive level will not be making decisions in London or Berlin or some other country which would adversely affect our workers here.  It could happen that many of the higher positions in these unions would not be held by Irishmen. We have to ensure that the rights and legitimate aims of our trade union officials will be realised in this respect, in other words that any member of a <Col N="545" /> trade union would have the right to go right to the top in his own country if he so wished&mdash;get promotion on his ability, and so on.  Very often there may be different methods and different rules in these foreign-based unions and I know that our trade union officials will keep a close eye on this. It would be in their own interest to do so and certainly in the interest of their workers.</P>
    <P>It has often been brought to my notice that some insurance companies could be foreign-owned and have their officials abroad.  These things certainly would be to the detriment of our own unions' members in such companies.</P>
    <P>I am sure that somebody has made a close study of how our trade union movement compares with trade union movements in France or Germany or in any of the other Common Market countries.  It is significant that more than 6,000,000 workers in Germany have only 18 unions, or something like that.  I suppose there is a lesson to be learned from it.  In post-war Germany the workers were very conscious of the need to build up the national economy and they organised their trade union system probably something different from ours.</P>
    <P>We have a different history and now that we are in the EEC it is no harm for us to have a second look at this and I welcome the Minister's thinking on it because in this Bill he is giving them a chance to more or less stimulate interest in the facet of the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>There are various things in this Bill regarding the transfer of property.  It includes rules for amalgamation in the rule books of various trade unions and so on, and reference will be made to most of these on Committee Stage.  The Bill is a genuine, sincere effort by the Minister to try to bring some sane thinking into the general national outlook so far as unions in general are concerned for the benefit of the workers and for the benefit of the employers.  We are all in this, both worker and employer.  It is our duty to ensure that the national economy will improve and expand because of the efforts we, as workers or management, <Col N="546" /> put into it.  We must all be united in this.  We must all try to get together with the best possible bargaining power we have so as to ensure that we will grasp the opportunity that is being given to Irish workers and Irish management to ensure that our country will get its deserved share of the benefits we feel will flow from our entry into the EEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill, which enables unions to get together to discuss amalgamation. This is proper and right because we have more than 100 unions representing 400,000 workers and in firms such as quoted by the Minister and by Senator Harte, there are more than 20 unions representing 11,000 workers.</P>
      <P>In situations like that it is definitely necessary that we should have amalgamation machinery set up so most people could sit around and talk about it and find out the benefits of amalgamation and what would be going for them.  There is just one doubt in my mind about amalgamations. It is the possible emergence of unions that might be too powerful. The flow of information from the top to the bottom would be slowed up and the flow of information from the bottom to the top also could be slowed and deliberately slowed up, and this causes me doubts.  Many of the unofficial strikes that have taken place have been caused because the demand for the strike at local level had taken so long to get to the top and a decision made at top level.  This took so long to get back to the workers that frustration set in and because of this frustration unofficial strikes took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should not like to see a rush into amalgamation without enough thought having been given to it.  I am involved in amalgamation in another sphere. When these amalgamations started everybody interested himself in them. They occurred very gradually and successfully until only a few small societies, as we will call them, were left and then there was a rush by the bigger societies to rob those smaller ones.  A falling-out took place and this has <Col N="547" /> been detrimental to the industry about which I am speaking, the dairy industry.  This was caused by the lack of interest of the ordinary members in the amalgamation question.  Neither was there enough interest taken by the shareholders.  If they had talked about it among themselves they would have learned more about amalgamations and would have done a better job than they did.</P>
    <P>I would be a little frightened that because of this legislation unions might opt for amalgamations that would not be good for them.  Unions should represent a certain discipline. The three teachers' unions should come together by amalgamation or federation.  In that way they would get better benefits, have less quarrelling and fewer strikes.  The doctors' unions should come together.  All their members have the same problems. They should amalgamate and negotiate as one unit with the Minister to iron out the problems that have arisen and not leave the country in the state that it might be in the future.</P>
    <P>Amalgamations are very valuable, but there are doubts in my mind about the way unions should go about amalgamation.  I know of one place where in a small union a large number of members went on unofficial strike and the union did not back that strike.  The result was that the strike failed after one or two days.  Those who were on official strike made application to the biggest union in this country for membership and were accepted into that union.  The smaller union, of which I am president and proud to be president&mdash;and proud to be a union official&mdash;made a case to that union and explained what had happened, but the small union got no soot.</P>
    <P>The reason I mention this is that I can see a time coming when to either defeat smaller unions or to have an amalgamation there would be powerful unions who would try to influence the members of other unions thereby taking votes from the unions to influence the amalgamation ballot.  That would be a bad situation, and the case <Col N="548" /> I have mentioned proves that this can happen.  Those people who were accepted into that union were even in arrears to the union they had been in and this was also pointed out and the arrears were never cleared.</P>
    <P>The powers of the big unions when they get too big can be detrimental to the idea of amalgamation which should be co-ordinated, and be subject to rules of certain disciplines.  I appreciate that amalgamations would cut out a lot of problems&mdash;for instance, the problem of separate negotiations within firms.  There would be one union negotiating for one type of people and there would be no obstacles.  This is the type of interest that should be taken in amalgamations of the future.  I also believe strongly that the votes should be secret and that a majority vote should rule.  In our own union this is exactly what happens and I am glad to say that it is the unanimous opinion of our members that this is the proper thing to do.  I am not too keen on postal voting, for two reasons.  Firstly, a postal vote is sent out, whether in a registered letter or not, and the person who gets it could be of weak character and could be influenced by strong members who would show that person to vote the way they wished the member to vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the tea break I was saying I would not be too happy with the system of postal voting because I believed that a lot of illegal voting would take place.  I know of a number of occasions where postal voting was introduced and when the vote was received by the voter a door-to-door collection took place and one or two individuals voted <i>en bloc.</i> To me that is not a good system.  I would prefer that a notice of meeting would go out.  The notice would state that a vote would take place in secret at the meeting and that the majority vote would carry the decision.  That is the way I should like to see voting taking place.</P>
      <P>The other thing I should like to see developing&mdash;and I should like the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to take an interest in this&mdash;is a code of practice.  It is necessary now because amalgamations of trade unions will be a new thing and many of the people concerned, the members of the trade unions, may not realise, even though it may be explained at meetings and so on, the importance of what is taking place.  If there was a code of practice, then a guarantee would be given to the voters or to those concerned and an explanation would also be given to them of what was about to take place, why and so forth.</P>
      <P>This is necessary because there are people in the trade union movement who do not understand many of the systems there and who would not understand what amalgamation was about and why amalgamation should take place, what benefits would derive from amalgamations and mergers. Therefore discussions on amalgamations should not be rushed.  Those concerned should take time and consider and explain what is involved and so forth.  It is important that this code of practice be introduced.  The people who would know most about that would be the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and I am sure they will do something like it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="552" /> What has happened on many occasions, and, as I explained before the tea break, should not happen again, is coercion, deliberately forcing people to vote one way or the other or canvassing or the transfer of union members from one union to another.  This should not go on.  No member of one union should be transferred to another union without the consent of both unions.  If there is a rule about that it has not been practised, and if there is not, then a rule should be made.  If canvassing of members is allowed to take place before voting and people are encouraged to join one union, then they could influence the voting at an amalgamation.</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask a few questions that arise from the Bill.  One of them is about the committee of management or the executive resident in the State or in Northern Ireland. I could see the position arising where the committee of management or the executive would be composed totally of English members, elected by the majority votes of the union.  The majority votes might be English-based, and they would elect the executive.  That elected executive could be composed entirely of English-based people transferred to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would not like to see that type of situation because that is no better than what we had before.  The Irish members should be allowed to elect their own Irish executive.  The decisions should be made by that executive.  That would take into consideration the influence of the Irish voter and it would also be Irish people instructing Irish members.  The members of the trade unions would have more confidence in what they would be told by that type of executive. If that is not so, I would like if the Minister would examine what I am suggesting and perhaps change section 16 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would not agree with any type of compulsory voting.  I would agree to allowing the members to decide if they wished to vote or not.  We are all free to do as we wish provided we do not break the laws of the land.  If a person felt he did not understand <Col N="553" /> what was going on or if he felt that he did not like to make a decision one way or the other that trade unionist should be allowed not to vote.  There should be no compulsion on anybody to vote not should there be any compulsion on anybody to attend a meeting.  He has every right to attend and should be encouraged to attend but he should not be forced to attend meetings.  If a certain dialogue at grass-root level developed and members got explanatory leaflets and had explanations given to them about what was taking place in an amalgamation opposition, a good day's work would be done.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that finance would be available to help amalgamation. If amalgamations were proposed and meetings held and money was spent in organising those meetings and the decisions was taken not to amalgamate, would the cost of organising all those meetings be paid?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I can see there are dangers in it, but at the same time if we had amalgamations, taking into consideration the discipline of the members and the amalgamation of those individual disciplines into one union, I would think we would be doing a good job for all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to welcome this Bill in broad terms.  It is the sort of Bill which does not place any extra burden on the Exchequer and if it goes through and is acted on should help to save not just the Exchequer but the country as a whole large sums of money which might otherwise have been bound up in the settlement of wasteful inter-union disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I yield to no one in deploring the division which still exists in the trade union movement.  The greatest division of all exists between the two big general unions.  I welcome this Bill in so far as it tends, for the first time, to make things easier for unions to amalgamate.  The tendency in this country, and not alone in trade unionism, has been towards fission.  There has always been within each group one smaller group which feels that it alone is in possession of the purity and <Col N="554" /> the totality of some particular doctrine or some peculiar principle of organisation.  It sees it not only as a God-given right but a God-given obligation to split and separate from its parent organisation in order to manifest in organisational terms its adherence to this principle.  We cannot afford many splits like this in society. We certainly cannot afford them in the trade union movement.  The Minister referred to another piece of legislation passed not very long ago which bears to a certain extent on the same subject.  The Trade Union Act, 1971, he said, by laying down more stringent requirements for the granting of negotiation licences has helped to prevent the further fragmentation of our trade union structure.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Trade Union Act, 1971, has acted in this way but in this House I was one of the severest critics of that Bill.  I believed then and I believe to a certain extent now that the measures taken in that Act to prevent the fragmentation&mdash;which we all agree is a bad thing&mdash;were ones which went perilously close to the border of unconstitutionality.  I believe that the price that may have been paid in principle for the passing of that Act and for the benefits it conferred on the country within a short term may yet prove to have been very high indeed.</P>
    <P>There is always the danger when we introduce legislation about trade unions that we see trade unions as a method of controlling workers and not as methods of representing workers.  If we fall into this habit of thinking about ways of controlling workers, whether industrial or commercial workers, we are fundamentally misrepresenting the purpose of the trade union and making it more difficult to promote industrial and economic harmony.</P>
    <P>The internal democracy of trade unions is as important as their negotiating aspect.  It is because of this that I view with a certain reserve the provisions in this Bill which amend the existing trade union legislation to allow for simple majority votes to decide questions of amalgamation. The system laid down in the <Col N="555" /> existing legislation is a cumbersome one.  It calls for a 50 per cent majority of the total membership of the union concerned.</P>
    <P>While accepting that this is cumbersome and needs to be changed, I would perhaps question whether it needs to be altered quite so dramatically and quickly.  At a time when we are accepting that the structure of trade union organisation is becoming more and more complex, I am unhappy that we must simplify and pare away at democratic principles in order to make this complexity workable.</P>
    <P>I believe trade unions have a responsibility towards their membership. That responsibility involves very much greater streamlining and making more efficient the processes of internal democracy within the trade unions.  I am sad to see here what seems to be a second best solution. One is probably prepared to accept it because the impossibility of doing anything else is so marked.  I ask people to be on their guard against accepting legislation which effectively more and more will concentrate power and authority in the hands of an activist elite at a time when more people are being effected by the decisions this activist elite are taking.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill unreservedly. Section 15 refers to English-based trade unions.  The Minister reminded us in his speech that this Bill now provides that a British-based union may not hold or be granted negotiation licence unless it has an executive resident in the State or Northern Ireland with powers to take decisions over a wide range of matters.</P>
    <P>It has already been the case for quite some time that companies in order to be registered in Irish law must have a certain proportion of Irish-based directors.  This may have been in many ways a token representation, but the law was there and had to be obeyed.  It is totally anomalous that the conditions which apply to one side of industry in that respect should not also apply to the other.  I welcome the Minister's foresight in introducing this legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> Problems faced by organised labour in different countries throughout the world are very broadly similar.  That is not to say that the remedies for those problems in each individual sitution are exactly the same, or that people living not just hundreds of miles away but in different jurisdictions and under different law systems, are in a position to judge precisely what remedy should be applied at the furthest extremity of their unions.  It goes against the grain in a sense to say this because people who believe in organised labour, in its values and in the values it defends, will maintain very stoutly and rightly that the fundamental purpose of organised labour is the same in every country in which it exists and there should not be any conflict between organised labour in one country and organised labour in another.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the history of international labour has shown that this is not necessarily true.  It has been shown also that very often when there is a national conflict any supposed solidairty between organised labour in one country and another is very quickly swept aside by political, nationalistic or other considerations. One of the reasons for this may have been that people assumed the commonality of interest and identity of interest without going too closely or too deeply into the need to build a firm substructure on which this commonality of interest could be based.</P>
    <P>To my mind this section goes a long way towards recognising the reality that different situations demand different solutions while, at the same time, not cutting across the fundamental principle that the interests of organised labour are the same.  I speak as a member of an English-based trade union.  It is not mere chauvinism which makes me say that there have been not a few occasions in the 12 years I have been a member of that union where we have been baffled, frustrated and felt deeply misunderstood by officials at headquarters in London, however well meaning and closely involved in our situation they may be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> I look forward to some details from the Minister when he replies about the power he has in mind that resident executives in this State or in Northern Ireland should have with regard to the conduct of the affairs of English-based unions of which they are the local representatives.  As I said, it is not chauvinism which makes me praise this, it is industrial pragmatism.  It is something which does not cut across the concept of solidarity which is the basis of trade union activity.  Indeed, subject to the reservations I have mentioned, we welcome this Bill as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan</i>): I thank the Senators for the welcome extended to the Bill and their general acceptance of it.  I would also like to apologise to the Seanad for my trips to the other House during the debate.  I am sure Senators, being familiar with the importance of a vote&mdash;even one vote in a democratic system is important&mdash; will appreciate the necessity for my obeying the Division bells.  As has been said throughout this discussion, the object of this Bill is to facilitate the amalgamation of trade unions and the rationalisation of the trade union movement within the country.</P>
      <P>It has been admitted by all that there are too many trade unions here at the present time, having regard to our population and the membership of the trade unions, which is less than 500,000.  It was pointed out by the Minister in his opening speech, and accepted by Members of the House, that many problems and a significant proportion of the disputes which arose in the last comparatively short time, are due to inter-union disputes within the same firm.  In this city within the last year we had a classical example of the absurdity of such disputes.</P>
      <P>This is an enabling Bill.  There is nothing in it to pressurise or compel unions to amalgamate or enter into agreement with each other.  It certainly facilitates amalgamation.  Because it does that, it has been welcomed by everyone who spoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anything that will lead to better and more orderly industrial relations <Col N="558" /> and tend to eliminate disputes between the management and employees, is in the interests of the management, the work force, of the country and the economy.  This Bill has been accepted very generously in principle by the Seanad.  Some Senators expressed reservations or fears in regard to some sections. When the Bill is gone into in Committee and the various sections are thrashed out and discussed, the Seanad will be satisfied that many, if not all, of their fears are unfounded.</P>
    <P>I would like just to deal with some points Senators have raised in the course of the debate.  The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Lenihan, welcomed the Bill.  His only reservation was on the lines of &ldquo;anything you can do we could do better&rdquo;, but in general, he accepted the Bill.  On the question of postal votes, he felt every member of the trade union concerned should be given an opportunity to vote.  Section (3) (1) (b) lays down that every member of the unions concerned will be given reasonable facilities to vote.  I am satisfied that that in many cases will entail resorting to postal votes.  Therefore, I do not think the Senator need be worried on that score.</P>
    <P>He was also concerned because the Minister for Industry and Commerce comes into the Bill.  If he does, it is in a very indirect way and only because the Registrar of Friendly Societies operates under the Department of Industry and Commerce and the machinery, established for many years in the Registrar of Friendly Societies' office, is being used to implement some of the provisions of the Bill, to vet and approve the agreements which will be drawn up to carry out amalgamation.  Indeed, the Registrar of Friendly Societies covers a fairly large field in the course of his operations.</P>
    <P>The machinery is there and that is why it is being used.  If we were to set up alternative machinery, it would probably lead to delays and, perhaps, more expense.  It was natural that Senator Lenihan would raise the subject of the political fund and that he would make the obvious Opposition <Col N="559" /> political point that Members of the unions were in some way obliged to subscribe to the political fund of the take-over union.</P>
    <P>The Bill is signed in regard to contribution to the political fund.  It proposes to accept the law as it is at present.  There will, of course, I understand be a necessity for the new union, or the amalgamated union, to decide to contribute to the political fund.  Every member of the new union, as I call it, will in the future, as in the past, have the opportunity of opting out, or saying that he does not want to contribute to the political fund, if that is the way he feels about it.  I do not think that there is any departure from the present law which has worked very well in the trade union code.  I repeat there is nothing of a compulsory nature here.  Anybody who contributes to the political fund, does so of his own free will. There is no change in the law in that respect.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy raised the question of the right to vote.  He said he would be happier if a member's right to vote was confined to members in benefit.  Section 1 (2) reads:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of sections 3 and 4 &ldquo;member&rdquo;, in relation to a trade union, means a member for the time being entitled to any benefits provided out of the funds of a trade union but, where the rules of a trade union specify the persons (or class of persons) entitled to vote on a particular matter (or class of matter), &ldquo;member&rdquo; means those persons.</P>
    <P>That probably covers the point raised by Senator Kennedy.  If he is not completely satisfied, and as this is a Committee Stage point he can discuss it when the Bill reaches that stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy also asked what matters would be covered by the grants to be paid under section 14.  I am told that section 14 is wide enough, and is intended to be wide enough, to cover a fairly wide range of grants for exceptional expenses incurred in the amalgamation or transfer of engagements. It is intended that these <Col N="560" /> expenses would cover legal, consultancy, printing and posting expenses and also compensation for redundancy. That point was raised by a number of Senators.  I am advised that the Bill is wide enough to cover all those items, none of the Senators need have any worry.  I think it will be agreed that this is generous.  Senator Butler also asked if it would cover expenses incurred in an abortive effort to amalgamate.  My understanding is that it is wide enough to cover such an effort.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy also inquired what power the Irish branches of British-based unions would have under the Bill.  The powers are set out in section 16 (2), which was referred to by Senator Horgan and others.  The intention is that there will be a committee of management composed of people resident in the island of Ireland.  This committee will be:</P>
    <P>...empowered by the rules of that trade union to make decisions in matters of an industrial or political nature which arise out of and are in connection with the economic or political condition of the State or Northern Ireland, are of direct concern to members of the trade union resident in the State or Northern Ireland and do not effect members not so resident.</P>
    <P>I understand that subsection is taken <i>verbatim</i> from the constitution of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>Senator Cowen was concerned about redundant officials of smaller unions.  He was anxious that they should be re-employed by the continuing or new union.  The question of their re-employment must be a matter for negotiation during the negotiations for amalgamation.  The Senator can be assured that, if these officers become redundant and are not employed by the continuing union, they are provided for in the section which enables the Minister to make grants towards expenses.</P>
    <P>Senator Cowen was also concerned about farm labourers.  The Seanad may know that the Minister for Labour is in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries <Col N="561" /> at the moment on the question of establishing a joint labour committee to cater for these workers, instead of the existing Agricultural Wages Board.  These negotiations have been going on for some time.  The question of the unionisation of agricultural workers is a matter for the workers and their unions who cater for them or are prepared to cater for them. There are more difficulties here than there might be in the ordinary cases because agricultural workers are scattered throughout the country in isolated places.  At any rate, the object of this Bill is not to compel anybody to become or to prohibit anybody from being a member of a union.  This is simply an enabling Bill dealing mainly with the amalgamation of unions and it would not be proper to include that matter raised by the Senator.</P>
    <P>I listened with considerable interest to Senator Harte's contribution on the trade union, the objects of the trade union movement and particularly its development, the part it played in its early years and the new and much wider role it plays now.  I share the Senator's hopes for the Bill.  I am hopeful that the positive advantages it confers on trade unions will be availed of.</P>
    <P>Senator Dolan gave the Bill a céad míle fáilte and had some very complimentary things to say.  He, like some other Senators, was concerned about officials becoming redundant as a result of amalgamation.  I hope I have put the minds of Senators at ease.  I also hope I have made it clear that under section 14 grants can be made to enable the smaller union of the amalgamation to make redundancy payments.</P>
    <P>Senator Butler had some doubts about the wisdom of creating larger unions.  He seemed to think that by doing so the end result would not be so good.  He expressed fears that if the larger unions were too large they would be difficult and that this might lead to members not getting service as good as they are getting now.  In my view there is considerably more merit in the larger union.  A larger union can afford to be strong <Col N="562" /> when demanding what it considers to be the reasonable rights of its members. It is also strong enough not to be pressurised by members into making unreasonable demands or entering into inter-union disputes.  I hope I am making myself clear on this point. A union that is weak or small may find that in order to establish itself, and attract more members and continue in existence it may have to be unreasonable.  Therefore there is a lot to be said for fewer and stronger unions, the kind of union that would give a better service to its members and be in a better position to press reasonable demands on employers and so we will have fewer &ldquo;wild cat&rdquo; or unreasonable strikes.  The end result will be in the interests of employees, employers and the economy in general. The bigger unions will have more expertise and more machinery at their disposal for efficiency communicating with their members and keeping themselves up to date with modern trends and requirements.</P>
    <P>Senator Butler also inquired whether the Irish executives of the British-based unions should be elected by the Irish membership of the unions concerned in order to ensure that the executive is composed of Irish people.</P>
    <P>Under section 16 (2) of the Bill every member of the executive of a British trade union must be resident in the State or in Northern Ireland. Persons so resident would be clearly sensitive to the situation in Ireland. A British union operating here and soliciting the goodwill of the work force in this country is much more likely to recruit or appoint an Irish executive than British personnel.  This is something the Senator can refer to again on the Committee Stage, but I certainly think that the likelihood is that membership of the Irish committee will consist of Irish nationals.</P>
    <P>Senator Butler seemed to fear compulsory voting.  There is nothing in the Bill, good, bad or indifferent to make voting compulsory.  Indeed, the opposite is the case.  As the law stands at the moment, unless 50 per cent of the membership of a trade union vote on an issue like this, no decision can be taken.  If more than 50 per cent <Col N="563" /> of the membership are so uninterested as to fail to vote, then there is stalemate and no decision on amalgamation can be taken.  Further, it is necessary under existing law that 50 per cent vote number one and that at least more than 20 per cent vote in favour of the proposal to amalgamate than against.  Under the proposals in the Bill only a simple majority is necessary and there is no stipulation as to what percentage of the membership should vote.  The Bill provides that adequate notice must be given to the members so that they will know the proposals that are going before the meeting or are going before the trade union and they will have every opportunity of voting on them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question raised by Senator Butler, I can assure him that the grants are available in respect of efforts to amalgamate which do not turn out to be successful.</P>
    <P>I was rather interested in the point put forward by Senator Horgan when he feared that the simple majority provision introduced into the Bill might put power in the hands of an activist élite.  I do not think he need be afraid of that because the Bill will ensure that every members will receive notice of the vote.  If a member declines to vote, his action might reasonably be construed as indifference. The provisions of the Bill set out that each member must be given notice of the proposal and given an opportunity to express his views on it through the ballot.  It is unreasonable to say that a simple majority is not enough.  I do not accept the Senator's fears that this will put power into the hands of an activist élite.  At the moment the sleeping majority of the unions who do not think it worth their while to find out what is going on, come to a meeting or vote, have power by default to obstruct a worthwhile development in the trade union movement.  All that is necessary to obstruct a proposal to amalgamate or to restructure a union is that 51 per cent be so disinterested in the working of their own union that they do not bother to vote.  That is a bad thing.  The procedure <Col N="564" /> in the Bill, which lays it down that a simple majority is sufficient provided every member of the union who can be contacted is given notice of the proposal and given an opportunity to vote, is a good one.</P>
    <P>What I have said deals with practically every point that was raised in this Second Stage debate.  I again want to thank the Senators for their contributions and for the manner in which they received the Bill.  This is my second visit to the Seanad as a Minister and I must say I enjoyed it.</P>

      <P>I have been informed that the Minister might have a problem in being present in the House.  I indicated that my attitude, as a promoter of this Bill, was that I would prefer that the Bill be debated and that the Minister would come in later and make his contribution.  The debate itself can play an important role in influencing attitudes on the record.  I only regret, looking at the pile of papers that Senator FitzGerald has brought with him, that there are not more people here to listen to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Senator Robinson on introducing the Bill and once more performing such a very useful function in so doing.  Indeed, it is a pity to see her talents lost on the Independent benches. Her influence is necessarily limited and her ability to receive other good opinions somewhat narrowed by <Col N="565" /> her failure to be a member of the Fine Gael Party, a course which I would encourage her to consider she might adopt: follow Mrs. Margaret Thatcher and become perhaps in time our first woman Taoiseach&mdash;although she would have great difficulty in reaching that eminence which can only be held, as Bagehot said, successfully by someone with uncommon abilities and common opinions.  Senator Robinson undoubtedly has uncommon abilities but equally undoubtedly has not got common opinions.  I think she would have great difficulty then in reaching the highest post in this land, capable of being rewarded by our political process.</P>
      <P>I will go on, having said that in a complimentary vein to say this, that I hope not to sound patronising, because the debate, until I stood up seemed to be good.  I missed the early part of the debate but I was happy to be present when Senator O'Higgins spoke on the second day of the debate. However, although I missed the first day, I read all the speeches made on that day, which were, I thought, extraordinarily good, even if many of the arguments offered in support of the measure would have to be resisted, and pungently rejected in some instances.</P>
      <P>My interest in bastardy was greatly increased by the introduction of this Bill.  I did not know as much about it as the sponsors of the Bill obviously did.  Therefore I had to do rather more reading for it than I ever did before.  I read the debates in the United Kingdom on the measure which introduced some of the elements in this Bill.  The debate here has been far in excess, I thought, of the quality of either the House of Commons or the House of Lords.  It is no harm to say that because we are so busy running ourselves down, as we did today so successfully in the point that some of us made with regard to the usefulness of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I found it intellectually very provocative and stimulating.  Before I go into the Bill perhaps I could be allowed make a few comments on some of the points that were made. Senator Michael D. Higgins&mdash;I have <Col N="566" /> not got the precise words he used&mdash; used some such phrases as &ldquo;We should not sit in judgment on another man's love, on another person's love.&rdquo;  We must sit in judgment on all men's actions even if they may be described as loving actions, irrespective of their pernicious effects, because this is part of the business of making laws for the relations between people and the consequences for people of the action of others.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly there have to be some laws with regard to how we treat the business of marrying, and the question of rights does arise.  I presume what he is saying is that, in effect, the laws should be such as to give to the product of the most casual commercial exchanges as many rights as come to the offspring of a permanent, faithful, loving and lifetime union.  Maybe this is a view which will be accepted by the House; maybe in due course public opinion here will accept this view; maybe this is a view many people today regard as the right view.</P>
    <P>I suggest there will be considerable difficulties with regard to this the morally attractive argument made, as Senator Robinson said, for driving the word &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; out of the language, which I take it she means out of the statutory language.  I will point out through the Chair to her shortly that this Bill will not do that, but that is another point.  Maybe this is something which recommends itself to people, but all sorts of difficult questions will arise.  For example, it is right to say, and is obviously correct, that practical difficulties are there even though there is the morally attractive argument of not having a wholly innocent product of sexual intercourse punished, treated adversely; of course it would be monstrous if he were not given rights, which he should have, equal with all legitimate children, to obtain anything from the State that a legitimate child would receive.</P>
    <P>It is by no means clear to me at any rate that the persons who should pay the price of making recompense to him should be the mother who is betrayed, the father who is cheated and the faithful children of the house of a union where someone has grossly broken his or her bonds.  That price <Col N="567" /> should not be paid by them in all circumstances, irrespective of the circumstances, because there could be circumstances where this would be wholly justified and there could be circumstances where it would be totally unjustifiable.</P>
    <P>In any case, with regard to this matter of sexual conquest it is no good simply saying that one cannot sit in judgment on another man's love. Of course, that is very fine.  Society has got to take note of this basic strong sexual instinct and drive and has got to have laws which in some fashion reflect an opinion as to the manner in which these instincts should be exercised, given expression to and the legal consequences of this happening. I merely say that it is not as simple as Senator Michael D. Higgins said.  In fact, much of what I have to say today, although not a repeat, is certainly in support of the line which Senator Michael O'Higgins expressed with regard to this.  As I go along I expect to make that clear in a little bit more detail.</P>
    <P>A reference was made by Senator Trevor West to the legal practice of the Celts.  I do not know what source of information Senator West has on what the practices of the Celts were with regard to bastards.  A &ldquo;bastard&rdquo;, by the way, is a term of art.  It is the correct legal description of somebody born out of wedlock.  It is a legal word although it may be used in this pejorative way.  Samuel Ferguson wrote, for example, about the Brehon Laws with regard to this: in the annual allotment of the commons there is no objection to bastardy, but not so with regard to the portion dedicated to the family.  The policy there was to make legitimacy the absolute test.  It is remarkably interesting to note how Ferguson's description of what was the Brehon Law in this regard accurately describes what is our current law.</P>
    <P>The sections of the Bill which I wholly favour are the sections with regard to improving the maintenance provisions, the provisions for apprenticeship fees, the provision for funeral expenses and so on.  We should seek <Col N="568" /> to see that an illegitimate has all rights in relation to what is held in common, that is so far as it is made common by becoming part of the public purse.  In relation to private property serious practical difficulties will have to be faced before we can proceed.</P>
    <P>With regard to what Senator Robinson said, I think she identified the wrong culprit when she gave a history of how we have laws in regard to legitimacy.  She said it derived from the Cannon Law's influence on the common law.  I think the position is that nothing could be further from the truth than that statement.  I invite Senator Robinson, when replying, to give some textual support for her proposition. Let us take, for example, legitimacy by subsequent marriage with which the Statute Book in England in 1926, secured very nearly 700 years later, what the Church and the Bishops of England sought to get at the Statute of Merton in 1236 when the barons withdrew shouting: &ldquo;<i>Nolimus mutari leges Angliae</i>&mdash;We will not change the laws of England.&rdquo;  They would not change that law favouring the legitimisation of people subsequently married under church influence although the church had succeeded in getting that introduced into the civil laws of the continent and had originally persuaded Constantine to amend the Roman law to provide for legitimisation by subsequent marriage. In fact Lord Bryce, in a very learned essay on the whole history of the laws in regard to marriage and divorce, said that at all times the church was doing everything to try and legitimate. It did not illegitimate.  It wanted to facilitate; it wanted the sinner to repent, and one of the acts of repentance was to marry the girl and establish a permanent union.</P>
    <P>The Church's influence was being exerted throughout this period in favour of legitimacy and against illegitimacy in so far as it could.  It was the Romans, first as lawyers and then through their influence as priests, and not <i>per se</i> as Christians, who in fact had this notion of legitimacy.  The whole strength of the family as an institution is a western idea, an idea of a monogamous marriage.  It is a <Col N="569" /> western idea, strong and powerfully held among the Greeks and the Italians.  Originally Herodotus speaks of the tribes of Scythia and Libya that they lived totally promiscuous lives. Their condition was polyandrous.  The Persians and Babylonians, and even the Israelites at the time of Moses, were polygamous.  Gradually the East was changed by the influence of the Romans and of the western world.  The idea of the single monogamous lifetime partnership between a pair concerned and burdened with responsibilities for the children they bore is at the very heart of Western civilisation and marks its growth.  In so far as it declined, it did so in that respect.</P>
    <P>The later Roman Emperors were very worried by the developments at that time and the situation which was similar to that which develops now, where a degeneracy was taking place. They tried by laws to strengthen the marriage bond and failed.  They only succeeded because the sects which they were persecuting came along with the teaching in regard to the inviolability and the indissolubility of the marriage institution.  In the Germanic tribes legitimacy was such that you did not have a legitimate union if you married somebody not in your own social order and rank.</P>
    <P>It is under the influence of the Roman law and the influence of the church that was changed.  The Canon Law is not responsible for this concept, be it a good one or a bad one. Wherever it comes from, it is not the church.  In fact, the Canon Law did not have anything to do with the matter of property rights.  It is a misreading of the history of the common law to say that the ecclesiastical courts had any function whatever in the determination of property rights.  This was entirely a function of the common law courts. Common law judges were establishing laws on the basis of what they found. They were Christian judges.  One of the greatest of them, Coke, was known to spend a quarter of every day in prayer. He was a very noble man and a great figure in the history of the common law.  The common law judges were concerned to find out what were the common practices of the Christian <Col N="570" /> people of the Anglo-Saxon world.  This is what they found was the common practice.</P>
    <P>Our concern to make life as happy as we possibly can for people who are suffering in any way must continue. If there are any ways&mdash;I will suggest some&mdash;in which to do this we should adopt them.  As Senator Robinson surveys this third day of the debate here, perhaps she will draw some little comfort from the thought that the Italian Parliament have now been debating a like measure and it is in its seventh year.  The Family Planning Bill may go no slower than this one, if the Italian precedent is to be any guide to us, if Irish public opinion of which the law should be an index and a reflection in fact does not want this measure in the form in which it is offered to us.</P>
    <P>It was not until the Council of Trent that even clandestine marriages were in any way at fault.  The proposal to require a witness to a marriage to ensure its validity was intensely resisted and was one of the most fought over matters in the Council of Trent.  They possibly reached the wrong conclusions, as often happens in matters which are debated intensely.  If you think too deeply about something you often end up doing the wrong thing.  It is to be noted that the secular powers in Britain, after the Council of Trent, imitated the Council of Trent and introduced similar ecclesiastical legislation making witnesses necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson said that the Canon Law was responsible for something which is alleged to be totally odious.  This is another way of saying that the church is responsible or that Christianity is responsible.  It is another way of suggesting that St. Matthew created a lot of trouble in his text in regard to the indissolubility of marriage. I suggest the common law of England is a great deal more Christian than the Canon Law.  Many of the concepts of the common law reflect the belief of the people in Christianity.</P>
    <P>The belief in truth reflected the fact that people are required to make an oath binding their conscience to determine what is the justice between <Col N="571" /> parties.  The idea that &ldquo;the letter killeth but the spirit giveth light&rdquo; lies behind the court of equity. It lies behind all the law cases in which you will find the courts of these lands trying to soften the narrow rigidities in statutory law.  It is part of the statutory law of this land that contract for the sale of an interest in land has to be evidenced in writing and you cannot enforce it otherwise.</P>
    <P>But the courts have contrived in every way that has been open to them, inspired by this kind of text, to use any pretext to prevent the Statute of Frauds, as the phrase has it, from being used to do a fraud.  Another illustration of it is where the actual judgment referred to a text in the Bible&mdash;&ldquo;the snail is in the bottle case&rdquo;&mdash;where a manufacturer is made liable to somebody who bought a product at the end of the distributive process but bought it from a shop without any meeting of the manufacturer and the consumer, and the judge said that you must love your neighbour; the manufacturer and the consumer were neighbours and as such the manufacturer should be rendered liable for his failure.  The abolition of capital punishment, the inspiration behind it is still&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Family Law Reform Act of 1969, which deals with many other things but deals with some of the things that are dealt with here. That Bill was introduced pursuant to a report of the law committee known as the Russell Committee.  I have studied this and I do not think that this House should be coerced to reach the same conclusions on all matters that the Russell Committee, with one dissentor, reached.  The report of the committee is a rather inadequate document.  It reaches its conclusions all right.  There is an obvious distinction between a mother and father in relation to the procreation of children. The mother is associated with the child continuously for nine months and the father's association may terminate after the first moment.  Therefore the question of the reaction of the mother to the child and the familial recognition by the mother may be expected to be completely different from the reaction of the father.</P>
      <P>If Father Fergal O'Connor is correct&mdash;he is reported today as saying that only 4 per cent of the begetters of illegitimates stay with the girl after the conception&mdash;it is rather horrifying to think of the number of fathers who seek finally to evade their responsibilities. There is also the natural fact which we cannot ignore: it is easier for a man to exercise these functions secretly and frequently and to have many such results if he has a sufficiently wide number of acquaintances to co-operate with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is therefore a real distinction between the two, as males and females know.  Therefore it is the decision of the Russell Committee and the recommendation which was accepted by the British Government and is enshrined in the Family Law Reform Act that gives these property rights to the children in respect of both the fathers and mothers.  This conclusion is reached with a wholly inadequate supporting <Col N="573" /> argument, in my view; a wholly inadequate psychological and social analysis and a confession of ignorance as to the full extent of illegitimacy and the extent to which there was in fact recognition by fathers.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan referred to the wages of sin&mdash;that despite inflation the wages of sin continue unchanged.  The wages of sin will continue while men or women act as they do.  The real deprivation is much more than material deprivation.  The real deprivation is the emotional deprivation of a child who is repudiated.  There is nothing you can do which will substitute for that deprivation of any share out of the loot when the old man dies.  You can do a lot in terms of increasing the child's right to get a proper maintenance and proper education during the father's lifetime.  We cannot legislate morality.  We can help people to attach deterrents to the results of conduct, but if people go on in this kind of way and if society has this kind of view and if there is a psychological deprivation irrespective of the social view resulting from the rejection&mdash;a rejection which a legitimate child can suffer, too&mdash;there is no Act of Parliament which can make up for a callous, cold-hearted, blackguardly father who does not give a damn about his children whether they are legitimate or illegitimate. There is nothing we can do in the Seanad about that situation.  It is just as well to be aware of the limitations of legislation.  We can to some extent mitigate the consequences of conduct.</P>
    <P>I thought it desirable to say that because I am not impressed by the proposition that merely because the United Kingdom has enacted legislation we must enact legislation of a like character, though there are very many features of the UK legislation with regard to this matter which recognise the practical difficulties that there are in relation to it and the dangers of it which are not specified in this Bill.  Perhaps Senator Robinson will tell us why that decision was taken, what must have been, I am sure, a deliberate decision.  Perhaps Senator Robinson will tell us why this must, I am sure, be a deliberate decision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> I am thinking in particular of the important safeguards with regard to blood tests and which, of course, provide as you would expect, that such tests will only be conducted if the person whose blood is being taken consents to have it taken.  If he refuses, the court is entitled to draw a conclusion from it.  But it is an important thing, and an interesting point is the view of the bishops.  They are of interest to me on this one as although they were not useful to Senator Robinson on the other Bill they are useful to her on this one because they called for this bland abolition of all distinction between illegitimates and legitimates.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there is a doctor in the House, but I understand that blood tests on the man&mdash;and this is my reading of the understanding of the advisers to the British Cabinet in 1969&mdash;can only prove that he was not the father.  It is a negative test.  We cannot prove that he was.  I think this goes really to the roots. There are great dangers.  I see since reading section 10 that the kind of proof which is required in relation to an affiliation order proceeding is quite different from the kind of proof which will be required in a serious paternity action in the High Court fought under the equivalent Family Law Act, 1969.  For example, one thing that the bishops say, which I would have liked to see in this Bill, and which they are right in saying, is that there should be some procedure whereby people who are going to be damaged, whose interest is going to be affected, should be able to come and argue their case.  There are all sorts of possibilities of collusive agreements which may have been approved by a district justice in a hurry, possibilities of collusive affiliation order proceedings, which might be thought to be the sounder thing if you are really engaged in collusion whereby you get recognition of a child who is then made the recipient of benefits under provision for the child of a union which is thereby legitimated and through the child a fortune can be inherited.</P>
    <P>At least the bishops recognised this <Col N="575" /> in their statement.  There should be provision for somebody to come in. But there is no provision.  It is the father against the mother.  That is the simple position in the affiliation order proceedings.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson said that she hoped this would abolish illegitimacy. If I understand her Bill, it will not do this, because she has adopted the Act of 1930 which defines a mother as any single woman or any widow or any married woman living separate from her husband and includes any married woman not living separate from her husband and includes any marriage was delivered of an illegitimate child.  But it does not take in an adulterine child.  The Bill before the House does not legitimate an adulterine child because an adulterine child is only to be legitimated where the mother and father are still living apart.  If they are living together, the mother is not a mother within section 1 of the Affiliation Order Act, 1930, and her child is not going to be legitimated by this Bill&mdash;he will remain a bastard if we enact it.</P>
    <P>Similarly, if there is no acknowledgement, if the mother takes no affiliation order proceedings&mdash;she is a proud woman and be damned if she would and has private means&mdash;she chooses to bastardise her child.  He is remaining illegitimate under this Bill if enacted.  Similarly, if she is dead she cannot take proceedings, or if a putative father has died before the proceedings are brought to a conclusion, in all these cases it seems to me we are going to have illegitimates after this Bill is enacted in its present form.</P>
    <P>If we proposed to take in all adulterine children, that would be an interesting debate on its own.  It is a very serious and important matter, requiring treatment of a most careful kind.  Take the situation of a fetching lady with a consort who, getting bored with his wife, is looking for a little bit of excitement.  He happens to have a lot of money.  She knows he has a lot of money.  She sets her hat at him. She gets a hold of his affections and they have a child by her deliberate <Col N="576" /> plotting&mdash;and this does happen, let me tell you: I absolutely know of one certain case where it happened, where the woman went to get the man's fortune and got the man's fortune by this procedure, or a chunk of it.  Very often in such cases a person will make a will and make a provision for such issue.  But here we are talking about rights where he does not want to provide or where a provision will be made at the expense of the faithful wife and her children.  I am not satisfied that this is something which we should adopt.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I am not clear what are the views of Senator Robinson and the other sponsors on the products of &ldquo;incestuous&rdquo; unions, but it seems to me, and I draw the Minister's attention to this, that the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930, may be unconstitutional if the view of the constitutional rights of the family are determined along any line on which the judges have been going in regard to marriage, because it seems to me it may entitle a sister to sue her brother for the maintenance of the result of their frolics, and it seems to me that this Bill would, because there is no provision against the products of incestuous unions in the 1930 Act, adopt it.  I do not know whether that was as was intended, but I have raised the point because I was rather struck by it.  However, I may be wrong. Maybe the language of the 1930 Act saves that situation.  But if so the incestuous children will remain illegitimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not think so in all cases.  With regard to the amendment of section 2 of the <Col N="577" /> 1930 Act, I am really looking at every single phrase.</P>
      <P>Everybody is agreed that a six-month period is too short.  This limitation of the time within which the application can be made is too short. The English have made it three years, the bishops want it to be three years, Senator Lenihan said first six and then three to six.  I do not know enough about it to know what is the right period, but on this one it seems to me that the English, with their experience, might be followed.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson's Bill goes much too far.  It is hazardous in the extreme to think that a man could be made a subject of affiliation order proceedings 20 years after his alleged child was born to the woman.  How could he gather evidence as to what he was doing on the night of the 2nd November in these circumstances?  It would be extremely difficult, I imagine.  There must be a limiting period during which he has a mind clear about what was going on, where he has had an opportunity of testing the corroboration which is offered.  It is particularly dangerous when it is taken in relation to section 10&mdash;&ldquo;in any disposition where there is a death after the date of an affiliation order.&rdquo;  That means that an order could be made 20 years later and if he was 20 years old when he did this&mdash;give him a life of 60&mdash;there would be property rights emerging 40 years after the event in question in relation to a proceeding that was taken 20 years after it.  There must be a limitation of that period; it must be cut back.  Perhaps three years would be sufficient.  Subject to a three-year period, I would welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure why the limit should be 16 years of age.  There should be some power in the courts to extend it. Why should the test of the extension of the 16 years be the suggested test of full-time instruction in university college, school or other education establishments?  I am not sure that there should be some power to look at the circumstances of every case.  You may have a chap who could not get into higher education, whose role in life is to stay at home on the farm or build up in business or so on, but the circumstances might altogether <Col N="578" /> justify a maintenance order going beyond the 16-year period.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that the £200 for the apprenticeship fee is enough.  That should be more.  The Minister might alter the amount, presumably upwards. As regards section 10, a point which occurs to me relates more to criticism of the Act which it is proposed to amend than to this Bill.  When there is a case under the old Act where a maintenance order is made at a time when there was a limitation on the amount which could be awarded, or where there is a case of an agreement which was approved at a time when the justice had to take into account as one of the tests for approving it, perhaps the child would do better if he got an affiliation order.  It seems to me there should be some procedure whereby somebody would get a right under that agreement that he could have got by virtue of the raising of the levels to a higher figure if he had taken the affiliation order proceedings. There should be some system of varying these agreements, restoring the right to come in, which I do not think is there, because it is a bar to all proceedings. That is the word used in the section.  If this agreement is sanctified, the man cannot come back looking for a variation of an affiliation order for which he has never previously looked.  That is a defect which ought to be amended.</P>
    <P>Still on section 10, I think it would be monstrous to apply this Bill in respect of proceeding which had been taken before this Act came into force, when the father, weak-mindedly perhaps, may have agreed not to contest the matter, not realising he was giving away quarter of his estate as a result of Senator Robinson's Bill and thinking he was only liable for the lump sum payment or the weekly amounts.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I think very strongly that in affiliation order proceedings, the method of establishing paternity should be far more serious in relation to any property rights that are to be given to the results of the union. I notice&mdash;I do not know if this is deliberate&mdash;that the illegitimate child was the only one to whom the affiliation order has been made under the Act of 1930, also referred to in the <Col N="579" /> first subsection.  There must be provision made &ldquo;or an order has been made under the Courts Act of 1971&rdquo; if the alternative proceedings have been brought instead of the affiliation order proceedings.</P>
    <P>The dangers of this section as regards property are very considerable. I agree with what Senator Horgan said that there ought to be provision whereby children of a union which has been declared null and void should not become illegitimate.  That, certainly, should be amended.  The only alternative in claims against fathers is that the Court takes account of the familial relationship.  It is the child who is being accepted into the house and reared as one of the family to whom this is being done particularly in recognition by the father of his obligations.  Maybe the father in that case is not the father of the child. The head of the house may loyally stand over the child whom his wife may have borne for another before they married, for example. He may be prepared to accept it but may fail to make a will.</P>
    <P>There is vaguely some effort to say that this is the sort of will people in these circumstances would be likely to make.  The law which treats a mother's illegitimate child as having fewer rights in her. will than her legitimate children does not reflect what, in most circumstances, a mother would want to do. In most cases the will making would take care of them.  We are talking about wills that are not providing for illegitimate children: we are trying to provide a system whereby these children will have a right to come in and look for provision.  Where a child has been recognised by a father who failed to make a will, and where there is no evidence that he was unfair to his wife, where there could not be legitimation because they could not marry at the time of the conception, some provision should be made whereby the court could have regard to the justice of the situation.</P>
    <P>It is rather odd that you could have a situation, if the estate is small enough, whereby the bastard would get the whole lot because he has a <Col N="580" /> claim which is a provable debt in the estate.  He has got to be paid off first because he is a creditor under the Illegitimacy (Affiliation Order) Act. The legitimate children have to take what he leaves over so this is the sort of thing that has to be borne in mind when you are looking at your figure of £20 per week.</P>
    <P>All of this is now becoming perhaps more important, and it seems to me to require most careful study, and I do not think that we need necessarily end up with the same answers that the British have come to.</P>
    <P>There has been a wide spread of property now in the world but there has not necessarily been an equally wide spread of the habit of will-making.  I do not know whether anyone has done any statistics or social analysis on that. It would be very interesting to do so. Under the old situation the bastards were generally provided for, because the truth of the matter is that it is only a bastard who would not provide for his bastards.  In fact, in most of these cases men of substance do make this provision for them.  Settlements are made, in most of these cases.  Now property has spread all over the place and you have got this sort of situation where, because of this, will-making is not so widespread as the property.  Therefore, the provisions of the Succession Act, perhaps, and provisions with regard to intestacy become more important, and require a good deal of attention.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Romans I want to make one point that relates particularly to this Bill.  Senator Robinson, in her speech, rightly drew attention to the permanent associations that can arise between people who are not married.  There are distinctions to be made between children who result from such unions.  She is right in raising the question of what just do we mean by marriage although I myself do not think there are any grounds for her suggestion that the Constitution, can, in some way, be invoked in support of this Bill or indeed any of the amendments however justifiable they might otherwise be.  But I still think that she is right in raising this whole question because the question is being discussed, the matter is raised.  It is well <Col N="581" /> to raise it.  However, my position is, this country must properly stand fast on a definite view about the nature of the marriage bond and follow out as compassionately as possible the legislative policy with regard to this.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by reading a few quotations.  One is from Evershed on Domestic Relations.  It says:</P>
    <P>The fundamental conception of the term marriage is the union of a man and woman from which springs other lives bound together by common origin and affection and giving what is known as a family the nucleus of social and political life.</P>
    <P>Here is what Lord Bryce says:</P>
    <P>In all communities that have risen out of the savage state, no legal institution is at once so universal, and also so fundamental a part of their social system as is marriage. None affects the inner life of a nation so profoundly or in so many ways, ethical, social and economic.</P>
    <P>Lord Stowell said:</P>
    <P>Marriage as understood in Christendom is the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others.</P>
    <P>In the classical time of Roman law, Modestinus, a very distinguished jurist, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is a partnership in the whole of life.  A sharing of rights, both sacred and secular.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Anything which diminishes the rights which the partners gain by virtue of their union from that union, puts them at risk or at hazard, would have to be very cogently argued for before I would accept it.  The Romans distinguished between children or concubinage, which was a recognised permanent or semi-permanent state and the children of people born outside that condition.  In one case they had no rights of any kind.  Where they were born in concubinage, they had a right to maintenance from the father and a right to the goods of the mother but no other rights to the goods of the father.  You could not have more than one concubine at a time, either, for the position to be recognised as giving these rights.  We <Col N="582" /> have got to look at these distinctions.</P>
    <P>We have got a situation where a man betrays his bond where the husband and wife have been working together building up whatever family estate there may be, whatever family fortune there is, where we do not give by this Bill or our laws generally enough rights to the woman in relation to the fruits of their joint work.  Until we do give that woman more rights than she has, I think if somebody entices her away and betrays her and a child results from that, I am not satisfied that we would be doing justice to that woman in taking from her the children of their union. The newly born certainly should be entitled to claim maintenance, and good maintenance, according to the circumstances of the father, during his life.  I certainly am not convinced that that should be taken from the woman.  The man does not give a damn; he is dead.  If somebody thinks that it is going to be a deterrent to that blighter, it is not.  If he has this delightful experience and a child results, under the provisions of this Bill it is his wife and their lawful children who are going to have property taken from them.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan talked about the damaging effects of property.  We all agree that there are damaging effects with excessive property.  That is a Christian principle.  It is very sad.  We want to start giving it away now, taking it from the legitimates and giving it to the illegitimates.  It is becoming important at this point.  I do not understand what we are running down property for, if you are busy amending the law with regard to property, which I understand is the main object of this proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>I know I have stayed too long but I want to read one more quotation. It is a short one and it relates to the whole question of the religious attitude to life.  It comes, surprisingly, from the Master of the Rolls, Lord Justice Denning.  He ends with something which makes the quotation relevant in the context of an essay on the law relative to marriage.  If the Chair does not see the immediate relevance of my quotation, if I tell him that that is a chapter heading, he may <Col N="583" /> allow me to end my contribution with this:</P>
    <P>Religion concerns the spirit in man whereby he is able to recognise what is truth and what is justice. Whereas law is only the application, however imperfectly, of truth and justice in our everyday affairs, if religion perishes in the land truth and justice will also.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am unashamedly of the view that it is the proper concern of legislators to promote the spirit of religion, and wholly disagree with the view that the affairs of this island are in any way bedevilled by the practice of religion.  It is not the practice of religion, it is the rejection of Christ which is creating the trouble in the northern part of this country.  It is only by religious practice that that evil spirit there rampant will be exorcised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise, indeed, with the motives behind the Bill, and quite agree that what the Bill seeks to achieve is something desirable.  But I have to take issue with the methods employed and say at the outset that I consider the Bill to be an inadequate vehicle to bring about the reforms which are needed.  We have to distinguish between the idea of reform and the idea of change for change sake.  This Bill as drafted would merely bring about a change without necessarily bringing about a reform, which I would define as change leading to a substantially improved and better position in relation to the parties that will be affected by the piece of legislation in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with the idea behind it but I must say at this stage I consider the Bill to be an inadequate vehicle to implement this <i>bona fide</i> and good idea.  I think it is wrong that illegitimate children should be prejudiced. How we remove this prejudice is a matter that will require a lot more thought and a lot more analysis than is available to us in the Bill or than has, indeed, come out of this debate. I say that with some hesitation, having just heard the last contribution, in which the contributor analysed to a very far-reaching degree the difficulties <Col N="584" /> that would be upon us if this Bill were to be passed <i>simpliciter.</i></P>
    <P>That is one side of the case and I think it was a case that was well argued, and is very coersive in regard to the Bill as it presently stands.  It highlights the need to have an equally thorough analysis on the other side before this Bill could be accepted or indeed before the principle behind the Bill, which I feel, not so much rationally as instinctively, is acceptable, but I would like to be able to accept it rationally as well.  The arguments which I have heard so far would not drive me to accept it in that way, but I am emotionally inclined towards the reform that it proposes.</P>
    <P>If this reform is to take place it will require a lot of study, and I am happy to say that these problems are under examination in my Department.  Perhaps the most immediate area of reform and perhaps the easiest to achieve is in the area of maintenance. The present maximum limits on the amount which a father may be obliged to pay, even though they were updated in 1971, are too low.  The same applies to the case of legitimate children, the children of deserted wives.  I am glad to spell it out that the heads of the Bill dealing with these matters and on the question of family maintenance are at an advanced stage of preparation and I am looking forward to introducing it in this session.  It will raise the maximum limits for maintenance and certain other expenses which can be claimed in affiliation proceedings.</P>
    <P>I hoped that I would have had this Bill before Christmas, but there are other matters in it relating to family law, novel matters, and in preparation of them certain difficulties have been thrown up by reason of the analysis which was being done on them, and these have had to be resolved.  I have now resolved them to my satisfaction and I look forward to introducing the Bill.  I have made this point before, that I would rather be slow with a Bill than come in with a Bill that subsequently proved to be inept or defective.</P>
    <P>I think it is common ground now <Col N="585" />&mdash;and I do not think Senator Robinson would dispute this&mdash;that her Bill is a bit narrow in scope, and she did mention the possibility of attending to a lot of details on Committee Stage.  I do not think that that would be a suitable way for dealing with something which proposes such a fundamental change in our law and, as Senator FitzGerald has pointed out, will introduce a very fundamental change in our social relations, in our society.  The broad principles should be settled before the Bill is introduced and be available for debate at its Second Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill as drafted does not obviate the risk of doing an injustice to one section of the community, the legitimate children and the widow, while at the same time trying to remove an injustice to the illegitimate child.  If a provision is to reform it must reform to improve and not just to change.</P>
    <P>Again&mdash;and this is a point which Senator Robinson herself adverted to &mdash;the basis of the Bill, the rights which are given to the illegitimate, depend not on the fact of his birth, on which they should depend, but on a court order, an affiliation order, a court document.  The effect of this is that a child who has been born outside marriage is given no direct right of succession.  He has to depend on the goodwill of his mother or the person who has the custody of the child to institute affiliation proceedings. This would be a reform&mdash; it may be practically the only one &mdash; which would be contradictory of the principle we seek to establish, that the birth as such gives the right to succession.  There is another objection, which is only a minor and subsidiary one to my fundamental objection of making the rights of the child depend on the passport of the affiliation order, that very few affiliation order proceedings have been taken.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the six-month limitation has been a factor in this, in so far as it would militate against mothers, when they would be psychologically and possibly financially in a weak position for taking the proceedings. But again it is common case with <Col N="586" /> us all here that the time limit should be extended.  There may be room for argument as to what the proper extension should be.  If the time limit were to be extended it does not necessarily follow that there would be a universal practice of taking affiliation proceedings, even if this Bill were to be law and all the rights provided by section 10 were to follow from such proceedings.</P>
    <P>Another criticism of the requirement of affiliation proceedings in establishing the rights under section 10 is that, ironically, the type of relationship outside marriage where people are cohabiting in a stable union but not a legalised union and where the parental bond would be at its strongest would not confer any of the rights of the child as proposed by section 10, but the mother of that union would have to go through the legal process of initiating the affiliation proceedings. Possibly she would have to take proceedings against the father in order to establish the property rights of the children of this stable but uncanonised union, and a type of union, which, if the society which exists in the most northern part of Europe starts to spread down here, will become more commonplace.</P>
    <P>If the mother wanted to provide property rights and had to take affiliation proceedings to get them and the father was not in harmony with that line of approach, the fact of having to take affiliation proceedings could cause irreparable harm to what was a stable union, and it could damage that relationship.  It is another consequence of the things that will come up when this Bill is teased out. It emphasises the need for greater care in proceedings to change the present situation.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald referred to the danger of fraud which exists in this Bill.  There is nothing in the Bill to protect against it even though Senator Robinson might feel this is a Committee Stage matter.  I think it is more fundemental than that.  It should be built into the Bill.  It is not reasonable to expect people who draft Private Members' Bills to draft them to the detailed degree necessary to <Col N="587" /> provide for all contingencies, but nevertheless in a Bill which purports to change the law so fundamentally, I think that matter should have had attention.  There is nothing in it to protect against the collusive proceedings to which Senator FitzGerald adverted.  Having regard to the growth in wealth and the changes in our society, the type of hard mentality which would lend itself to such collusion, it might be more common than in the past and could be a real danger in the future.  It is another example of why a Bill which has not had the analysis which the seriousness of the subject requires made in advance could produce dangerous results.</P>
    <P>There are other provisions in the Bill which are desirable.  Section 4 contains provisions in regard to the privacy of affiliation proceedings.  I am fully behind this idea but in my mind the Bill does not go far enough. In the Family Law Reform Bill which I hope to promote shortly I will be going further in this regard, not only in regard to maintenance cases but also with regard to affiliation proceedings. It is a question of having to balance certain interests in deciding how private any court proceedings should be.  This Bill does not go far enough.</P>
    <P>It is essentially a question of balance and, in deciding on succession rights, they have to be very closely examined in order to preserve the balance between the parties.  In the vast majority of cases maintenance and not succession rights presents the real and urgent problem.  By the time succession rights will accrue the illegitimate child has possibly reached manhood or indeed middle age, and the property he may receive or whatever rights may be given to him may be by way of a bonus to his position then rather than something to meet a real financial need.  The time of need is when that person is in childhood. This is the most urgent and real part of this problem.</P>
    <P>The Russell Committee proceeded very cautiously, and this is a signal that this is a subject on which caution <Col N="588" /> is required.  They published their report in 1966 and legislation did not follow until 1969, and even then it was quite limited in scope.</P>
    <P>I have recently come across a working paper from the New Brunswick Department of Justice dealing with the status of children outside marriage. Although the whole tone and theme of the report was humane and advocated reforms and improvements it nevertheless sounded a note of caution in relation to succession rights.  The working paper states:</P>
    <P>While from the standpoint of the child it may seem inequitable to treat a child born outside marriage differently from one born within marriage, yet from the standpoint of the mother and the children born within marriage, to treat equally the child born outside marriage detracts from the benefits accruing to the members of the family.  Take, for example, the case of a father dying intestate and leaving a wife and two children; the family may know nothing of the existence of a child born to the father outside this marriage who nonetheless appears on the scene and establishes that he is the child of the intestate and thus is entitled to share in the portion of the estate going to the children. Surely one must question carefully the social benefit of a law to this effect.</P>
    <P>This is from a report which has adopted an overall humane approach and whose general emphasis is towards reform.  As regards the last sentence I quoted: &ldquo;One must question carefully the social benefit of a law to this effect&rdquo;, we must do that.  I do not think this Bill or this debate has opened the question in sufficient depth for us to be able to say that we need reform and we need reform of the type in this Bill.  All of us emotionally say: &ldquo;We need reform&rdquo;, but in fairness to our position as legislators, we have to be rationally convinced as well.</P>
    <P>I had the privilege of speaking to CHERISH some time ago, and I was very glad to have been able to attend that general meeting and by my presence <Col N="589" /> as Minister for Justice recognise the legitimate status of that organisation. At the meeting I made the point that when an estate is distributed it very often represents not just the efforts of the deceased but the labours of his wife and legitimate children.  One has then to question the rights of the child born outside marriage to share in something in which the father of that child had a minority share in building.</P>
    <P>There is an absence in this Bill of any provision for blood-testing.  We cannot have a physical compulsion to have the test carried out, but a court should be allowed to draw an inference from a refusal to be tested.</P>
    <P>This is not a subject which lends itself to an easy solution.  It has widespread legal and social complications, and a debate on it can become clouded by emotion.  I accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the proposers in this, but I do not think the matter has had sufficient debate in depth for the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage.  I share concern about the need for reform, the need, as Senator Robinson said in her opening remarks, for a balanced appraisal of different rights.  I do not think we have had this yet.  I concede that the law as it stands is unjust because it is totally one-sided.  It will have to be changed, but without emotion and after a detailed study.  Certain changes in regard to maintenance, the privacy of proceedings and the level of the maintenance orders consequent on an affiliation order, are matters I will be dealing with in a Bill in this session. On the more general principle of giving succession rights to children outside marriage this is something which is being examined.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless the publication of this Bill and the debate here will alert the general public to the existence of the problem and will educate the public to start thinking about the problem and considering the pros and cons.  It is a subject that is bedevilled by emotion, and we have to be very careful not to let emotion get in our way. Senator Robinson gave an example of this when she quoted from a legal academician in her opening speech. At column 64, of the Seanad Debates <Col N="590" /> of 4th December, 1974, she quoted, with approval, a statement which said:</P>
    <P>What stands in the way of reform is not a rational argument but public prejudice against illegitimate children based on centuries of unquestioning discrimination. This prejudice, combined with Governmental inertia, has resulted in Ireland remaining a member of that increasingly exclusive club of nations which persist in the persecution of innocent children.</P>
    <P>That is a sound political statement but not a statement that one would expect from a person who would be interested in reform from a legal point of view.  It highlights the dangers of this subject.  Even people with legal academic training can fall into this emotional trap.  That is what we have to beware of and at the same time risk the criticism of appearing to be unfeeling or insensitive to the need of this unfortunate section of our community.  What we want is reform, not just change for change sake.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that I shall have an opportunity of replying to the Minister on the points that he has made but I must ask him for one small point of clarification.  The Minister said that there were heads of Bills on maintenance and later on in his contribution he referred to a Family Law Reform Bill.  Are these the same Bills?</P>

      <P>I was asked on the Order of Business today would we meet tomorrow and I said at the time that it was the intention that we would meet tomorrow if today's business was not finiished.  I understand that at least one Senator who is not here at the moment wishes to contribute to this debate and is under the impression that it will be carried on tomorrow.  Also Senator Robinson has spent three days one way or another listening to discussion of her Bill and she is entitled to reply.  I do not think it would be fair to expect her to do that in a few minutes.  Senator Martin may intend talking for an hour or two.  Even <Col N="592" /> if he talks only for a quarter of an hour he is entitled to the time.  In all the circumstances, I would suggest we should adhere to the arrangement of meeting tomorrow morning at 10.30.</P>
      <P>Senator McGlinchey and others raised the question of motions which Fianna Fáil wished to have given priority to on the Order of Business today.  Those mentioned were Nos.17, 21 and 24.  It may be helpful to the Senators opposite if I indicate that at the moment we hope quite firmly&mdash;I do not want to commit myself&mdash;that Motion No. 17 will be taken on the 20th February.  I want to give that week's notice.  I do not want Senators to think I am taking them short.  I hope it will be taken on the 20th February.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13th February, 1975.</P>
