      <P>I would like if the Leader of the House could give us some information concerning two motions to which I have put my name. One of the motions is No. 25 which is both imperative and important at this stage, and which reads:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes with concern the deteriorating state of the national economy.</P>
      <P>It is now the appropriate time for this House to discuss such a motion.  It may create gloom prior to Christmas to have such a discussion, but I think it deserves the time of this House.</P>
      <P>I would also like to ask when it is intended that Motion No. 36 will be considered?  Motion No. 36 states:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the White Paper on the National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority.</P>
      <P>I asked for an assurance when I put down that motion that it would be discussed in this House prior to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries making decisions on the White Paper. It was then stated that decisions would be made within six months.  That six months has now elapsed and no decision has been made.  This House has not been given an opportunity to discuss this matter.  I think that both motions are very important and deserve the time of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Killilea.  I also have my name to both of these motions.  Motion <Col N="460" /> No. 25 is a very important one.  I think that the Seanad should afford an immediate opportunity of discussing these.  We have heard yesterday and today the Taoiseach's own admission of what the financial position of this country is at present.  The economy is in a deplorable state, with over 109,000 people unemployed.  These are serious matters.  To come into this House and discuss a Wildlife Bill or something else is wrong, in my opinion, in view of the chaos that exists both in industry and in the economy in general.</P>
      <P>I have also put my name to the other motion mentioned by Senator Killilea.  This motion is also very important. No opportunity has been given for discussing either of these motions.  I do not think it is right that we should try to sweep under the carpet this serious situation.  It would be far better to come out into the open and tell the people what the position is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards sitting days, that will partly depend on whether or not Senators want to meet next week to try to arrange for any of the motions.  The Bills it is proposed to deal with are the two we have before us today.  In regard to motions generally, I should mention &mdash;Senator Killilea and Senator Dolan might not be aware of the fact&mdash;that we have, at my request, arranged a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges this evening to review the whole question of motions and to see how the scheme that was adopted some years ago is working and has worked.  We might all be a little more clear in our minds when we have had this discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Leader of the House feel that, as a result of the meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, he will have <Col N="461" /> a recommendation to us?  Surely we are not so naïve as to expect that a clear-cut decision will be made this evening or indeed this evening month. Therefore it still puts in abeyance the question of the agreement that motions should be taken.  Indeed, apart from that agreement at all, I think it is quite proper and appropriate, even if we do have to come to this House next week to discuss the motion on the economy, that we should do so.  To put it in another way, we would be better off here than at home twiddling our thumbs.  It is important to discuss that matter at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan</i>): The House already dealt with similar amendments by Senator M.D. Higgins during the Committee Stage but those amendments were withdrawn.  I regret that, on the grounds already given, I am not prepared to accept these amendments. The amendments, I think, are based on a misconception.  The word &ldquo;land&rdquo; wherever the context admits throughout the Bill&mdash;as this section certainly does&mdash;includes, by virtue of its definition in section 2 of the Bill, &ldquo;land covered by water&rdquo; and therefore it <Col N="462" /> would permit of nature reserves being established on lands which include lakes, rivers or other wet lands.</P>
      <P>Section 15 (1) (b) specifically permits of nature reserves on State-owned foreshore, and section 15 (1) (c) clearly allows for marine nature reserves.  The Senator's point about community recreational interest in amendment No. 2 is not acceptable either, because the criteria in the establishment of nature reserves are intended to be scientific or ecological rather than recreational.  There may, of course, be a community recreational spin-off benefit from such a reserve and, indeed, for that reason among others, I am taking powers under section 59 to regulate public access to and use of such reserves in the interest of conserving the community of flora and fauna for which the reserve is established in the first place.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, I understand that Senator M.D. Higgins has been in communication with my Department in relation to the Bill and that he is now satisfied that the Bill as it stands meets the intention behind his amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his explanation. I do recall when this was being discussed on the Committee Stage that he felt the defination made it unnecessary. I should like to thank him for the further clarification and ask the intention behind his amendments.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, not moved</P>
      <P>Government amendment No.5:</P>
      <P>In page 20 to delete lines 33 to 35 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) to take eggs of a protected wild bird for the purpose of having them hatched out, or, for such purpose, to move such eggs from the nest of such a bird to that of another bird of the same species, or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Section 22 deals with the enforcement of protection of wild birds and provides that, with the exception of the pest species in the Third Schedule, it will be an offence to hunt wild birds otherwise than in accordance with a permission <Col N="463" /> or a licence granted by the Minister under this Bill.  Subsection (5) lists exceptions to the prohibition on hunting which I have just mentioned, and subsection (5) (e) with which we are concerned in this amendment, provides that it will not be an offence:</P>
      <P>to take eggs of a protected wild bird or to move eggs from the nest of such a bird to that of another bird of the same species for the purpose of having them hatched out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment arises from a point of interpretation of paragraph (e) of subsection (5) raised by Senator Robinson on Committee Stage.  The Senator asked whether, as the paragraph stands, it would be possible for a trespasser to take the eggs of a pheasant and transfer them to a tame pheasant to hatch them out. At that time I expressed myself as satisfied that the paragraph was not broad enough to permit a person to do that as he would be guilty of trespassing and larceny.  However, I promised the Senator to have this point looked into.  I am now advised that the paragraph could not be interpreted as a good defence for a trespasser doing what Senator Robinson suggested.  However, Senator M. J. O'Higgins in making his contribution on Senator Robinson's question raised a point which appeared to me to be valid, if I interpreted him correctly, namely, that the paragraph as it stands might not permit a person, where the hen pheasant had been killed by a car, to take the eggs to the nest of a bird of another species &mdash;for example, a clucking hen, as he put it.  On re-examining the paragraph I have some doubt that it accurately reflects my original intention, which was twofold, namely, that it would not be an offence (1) to take the eggs of a protected wild bird to an incubator or to the nest of another bird of a different species for the purpose of hatching them out or (2) to remove the eggs of a protected wild bird to the nest of a bird of the same species where scientific advice or experience dictated that that was the best way of securing the successful hatching in the case of a particular species.  I am <Col N="464" /> satisfied that this amendment is necessary in order to remove doubt as to my intention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to hold up the Bill&mdash;the Minister has been very good in extending himself to meet the points that were raised on Committee Stage&mdash;but I had intended asking about the question of removing eggs for hatching out in an incubator if the necessity arose.  I gather from the Minister's remarks that, in fact, that is covered by his provision.  My only reason for standing up is that I do not see that immediately and I was wondering if he could direct my attention to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for having looked into the point.  In fact, I was not suggesting on Committee Stage that there was any question of a person no longer being a trespasser who would be a trespasser for other purposes. It seemed to me and it still seems to me that a trespasser can remove the eggs and hatch them out under another bird and obviously the person would still be a trespasser.  He would not be committing a further offence but would come in under this formula. It is a very small point, but I would like to thank the Minister for having considered it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Arising out of Senator Michael J. O'Higgins's intervention, I am satisfied that the amendment as drafted will cover the removal of eggs for hatching in an incubator.  What we propose to do is to delete subsection (5) (e), which reads:</P>
      <P>to take eggs of a protected wild bird or to move eggs from the nest of such a bird to that of another bird of the same species for the purpose of having them hatched out.</P>
      <P>and to substitute the following paragraph for that:</P>
      <P>to take eggs of a protected wild bird for the purpose of having them hatched out, or, for such purpose to move such eggs from the nest of such a bird to that of another bird of the same species.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> In reference to these amendments, the Senators will remember that on Committee Stage points were raised in regard to the venue for hearing prosecutions which would be brought under these two sections, that is, section 22 and section 23.  It was appreciated that prosecutions should be brought against the defendant in the District Court area where he resided or in the District Court area where the offence was committed.  The Senators were not satisfied that went far enough because some Senators, notably Senator W. Ryan, pointed out that it might be difficult, if not impossible, in a mountainous area straddling a couple of District Court areas, to say with certainty that the offence was committed in one District Court area or another.  I was asked by Senators &mdash;it was represented to me&mdash;that the <Col N="466" /> Bill should confer jurisdiction on all District Justices to hear the offences under the Act.  I had amendments drawn with that end in view, but quite candidly I am not entirely satisfied with the amendments as drafted and, with the permission of the House, I propose to withdraw these amendments, and I will have the matter further looked into and, if I still consider it necessary, I will introduce suitable amendments to meet the points in the Dáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 24, between lines 34 and 35, to add to section 26 the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  There shall attach to each licence granted under subsection (2) or subsection (3) of this section a condition that the hounds shall wear muzzles of such a design as to preclude their inflicting any injury on or bringing about the death of the hare.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Stage, in making the case against hare coursing, I referred to hunting generally as a very primitive instinct which is in all of us.  The instinct to hunt goes back to earliest times, to the earliest forms of pre-civilisation when the need to hunt, to kill, was essential for survival.  That is an instinct which persists and has been in very many cases, in most civilised and advanced countries, changed into a kind of analogue of itself. The need to hunt and the primitive drive in human beings is preserved. One no longer needs to hunt to live although the way things are going that might change very quickly. At the present time one does not need to hunt to live and, therefore, hunting has been transformed into a sport and the sport has had taken out of it to a very considerable extent, the cruel <Col N="467" /> aspects to which I referred.  This is part of the progress of civilisation and is one that has been welcomed by most people.  We see it in bull-baiting, in dog-fighting, cock-fighting, bear-baiting and many other kinds of sport which were essentially very cruel to the animals involved in them.  We see also the development of clay-pigeon shooting, where people like, say, Senator O'Higgins who likes shooting, can take pleasure in the skill of shooting and of seeing the effect of the bullet or cartridge shooting down the objective without hurting or maiming an animal.  These are quite primitive drives and it is quite useless to pretend they are not there; they are there.  But where they can watch a hunt without the effect of the pain and killing of the animal it seems to me there is not much harm in that.</P>
    <P>I still object to hare coursing because I think there is an enormous amount of fear involved where the hare is concerned.  Quite obviously, nobody could object to greyhound racing which is the closest analogue to this particular coursing.  It is practically identical except that the animals chase an electric hare.  They give an enormous amount of pleasure and sport to hundreds of thousands of people all over the world.  Quite obviously that is useful in its own way in order to help people in their recreation time.  It gives them the excitement and all the thrilling experience of watching two fast beautiful animals competing against each other to try to catch the uncatchable hare.  They can put bets on and win or lose money but that is their own business.  It is part of the average urban recreation.</P>
    <P>We also have the kind of sport to which I referred recently.  I said, in praise of the Taoiseach, that it was a good thing he had given a lead in hunting.  I understand his kind of hunting is restricted to drag-hunting.  I may be wrong on that, but I always gave him credit for doing that anyway. Am I wrong in that?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I see, I might have expected that.  This is on a very narrow issue, I am sure the Seanad will have to agree, and it happens to suit my case.  It occurred to me that similarly with stag-hunting, they do not kill the unfortunate stag they hunt.  They catch it and hunt it again.  So the general trend in the hunting of animals has been towards this appreciation of the fact that killing an animal is a barbarous thing to do, particularly a weak and defenceless animal such as a hare, a stag, an otter or a badger.</P>
      <P>For that reason I wondered whether Senators would accept an amendment which would meet the case.  Many of them were very indignant the other day when I suggested that there was something peculiar about somebody who liked to watch a sport, or call it a sport, a procedure organised at considerable expense and trouble which tended to be directed towards hunting to the kill, very painfully, of a tiny little animal by the wonderful animals, greyhounds.  As many Senators as were here turned on me with great indignation, and I do not mind that at all.  The main point was they do not want to see the animals killed at all.  That was the last thing they wanted.  What they wanted was the marvellous sport of the turning of the hare, the cleverness of the dogs, one outrunning the other and then the fact that one got to the hare quicker than the other.</P>
      <P>As reported in column 64 of Volume 83, No. 1, of the Official Report, Senator W. Ryan said:</P>
      <P>...nobody in this House gets any pleasure from seeing a hare killed at a coursing meeting.</P>
      <P>At column 65 Senator Deasy had this to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator William Ryan has pointed out, Senator Browne made a very incorrect statement in saying that coursing followers enjoy the spectacle of seeing hares killed. <Col N="469" /> This is untrue.  They do not enjoy it.  They are delighted if the hares escape and go free after the coursing meeting.</P>
    <P>I hope that is true.  He then continued:</P>
    <P>There was nothing in the newspapers about a coursing meeting held in Donabate two weeks ago when no hare was killed.</P>
    <P>That is a very important point. Presumably the coursing match at Donabate was an exciting spectacle and gave great pleasure to the people who were there.  The organisers of the meeting were satisfied with themselves.  An ICC speaker on a television programme we were involved in said that young people in rural Ireland derived great pleasure from organising meetings.  The people in Donabate killed no hares, but they had a good meeting.  These people are experts, <i>cognoscenti</i> of the game of greyhound coursing.  They were quite happy that a good meeting could take place and have no hares killed.</P>
    <P>Senator McAuliffe also pointed out that if hares are properly fed with oats, turnips and cabbage they will not get killed.  The implication of his advice to the hare was to feed well and he would not get killed.  Cleary he did not want the hare to be killed either.  He is an expert on this subject and he told us a lot about breeding of hares.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell adopted an Olympian approach, saying he never went to these sports, and he lived near Clounanna.  He said:</P>
    <P>Every sportsman regrets the killing of any animal whether it is a fox killed in the hunt, or a hare killed by beagles, or by dogs....</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might correct the Senator, I did not say that I had never been to a coursing meeting.  I said it was a long time since I attended a coursing meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;It is many years...&rdquo; I beg the Senator's pardon. Lest there be any misunderstanding, I quote from column 67, Volume 83 <Col N="470" /> of the Official Report, where the Senator said:</P>
      <P>... It is true that all sportsmen who go to coursing meetings go to see the dogs.  It is a contest between the dogs and not between the dogs and the hare.  Everybody regrets when a hare is killed.</P>
      <P>Then the Senator continued:</P>
      <P>Every sportsman regrets the killing of any animal... They should remember that the hare is a necessary ancillary factor in the sport of coursing.  The main thing is the dogs.  People bet on the dogs and watch them coursing and applaud when a hare escapes.</P>

      <P>It would have been more helpful if somebody had suggested methods by which the rate at which hares are being killed could be decreased. That would have been a constructive proposal...</P>
      <P>I suggest that I have made this constructive proposal in my amendment which was suggested to me by a concerned individual in County Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In column 69 the Minister pointed out that this was a Bill for the conservation of wildlife.  My amendment proposes to conserve the hare.  This is <Col N="471" /> of assistance to the Minister as well as to other Senators who are worried about this suggestion that I had in some way or other slandered them by suggesting that they liked the killing of the hare, the scream of the hare as he was torn to pieces by the two dogs. They tell us that the last people in Ireland who would like to see the hare becoming extinct are the organisers of coursing matches, that if the hare became extinct, coursing as it is known now would come to an end. That is the case made by the group who met in Strasbourg, the Association for the Preservation of Wildlife: that if coursing continues in this manner it will come to an end.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued in column 70:</P>
    <P>Senator Browne has obviously overstated his case because he said it is deliberate killing of the hare. Deliberate killing is not involved in coursing.  People who organise matches, if they had a choice, would like to see the hare escape.</P>
    <P>There are a number of such people here, and he spoke for them with some authority.  Surely that is a very important observation by no less a person than the responsible Minister.  He continued:</P>
    <P>Matters are so arranged that the hare gets a reasonably long slip and has a chance of escaping.  It has been said that 90 per cent of the hares coursed escape.</P>
    <P>If this is a good thing I am suggesting that we should try and up that 90 per cent to make it 100 per cent. Everybody would then be happy.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued at column 71:</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that hares which are killed suffer...</P>
    <P>That is on the authority of the Minister. That is not Senator Noel Browne being hysterical or overstating his case.</P>
    <P>One lady Senator was very angry because I spoke feelingly about tearing little hares to pieces.</P>
    <P>At column 76, Senator Whyte said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> If I believed, as Senator Browne obviously believes that coursing is purely for the enjoyment of people seeing hares being torn apart, then I would be opposed to coursing.  The Senator has a completely mistaken idea of what the sport of coursing is.  I make no apologies for calling it a sport.  The Senator is quite right when he says there is a certain exclamation when two dogs pass one another and people are concerned with the winning of the chase.  The same applies when an artificial hare is involved.  The same situation applies when a racehorse is involved.  People are interested in the speed of the animals involved, and perhaps place a bet on the matter as well.</P>
    <P>That is quite innocent, quite innocuous, and nobody could complain about that.  Is that what hare coursing is about?  This is what we will find out when we proceed to a vote on this amendment.  If it is as innocuous as Senator Whyte said, then he is quite correct to continue to support it.  He is well aware that, as the Minister said the hare is killed painfully.  Under this amendment the hare need not be killed at all.</P>
    <P>Senator Whyte went on:</P>
    <P>If a hare is killed nobody regrets this more than the people involved in this very important greyhound industry.</P>
    <P>He then went on to accuse me of being unfair:</P>
    <P>We are doing less than a service to the people involved in the greyhound industry when we imply that they attend coursing meetings just to see hares killed or torn apart. This is a mistaken idea and one that ought not be put across in responsible debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Cowen supported the argument that every care is taken at each coursing meeting to see that no hare is killed if at all possible.</P>
    <P>Senator McCartin said, at column 78:</P>
    <P>I do not like the idea of two hounds killing the hare at a coursing match.  On the other hand I do <Col N="473" /> not want to stop my neighbours from coursing.</P>
    <P>He also said:</P>
    <P>I pity the people who seem to enjoy for itself the spectacle of the hare being killed more than I pity the hare.</P>
    <P>How right he is.  As I suggested, there is something peculiar about people who gratuitously take an unfortunate animal such as this and establish this elaborate procedure of a coursing match.</P>
    <P>Here is the amendment I am putting forward to the Seanad:</P>
    <P>There shall attach to each licence granted under subsection (2) or subsection (3) of this section a condition that the hounds shall wear muzzles of such design as to preclude their inflicting any injury on or bringing about the death of the hare.</P>
    <P>This is quite a serious matter.  We have accepted in relation to all the other sports that there was an element of cruelty&mdash;obviously, it was opposed by many people&mdash;and that cruelty should be removed from the various other sports, because people had grown used to them.  These people were gentle people and would not ordinarily hurt a defenceless animal, but because the sport had become a community pastime in a local area they had become uncritical.  All of us who have grown up in our culture have been uncritical.  I myself have been uncritical in my time in relation to cruelty.  It was only as time passed that I gave more thought to these things and realised that it was very wrong for human beings with their great power to take into captivity a tiny animal of this kind and to arrange this terrible amphitheatre, a meeting place, surrounded by fences in which this alleged training is carried out. It cannot be a serious training procedure because the hare does not know what is going on it is so frightened.  It is a slur on the name of our people that we should continue to be among the last people in Europe to perpetuate this kind of what I have <Col N="474" /> described before as a barbarous practice.</P>
    <P>All the Senators who are influential in this sport now have an opportunity to exercise an important moral judgment: to decide that they will contribute what they can in order to reclaim the sport.  I disagree with the coursing part.  It is terrifying for the unfortunate animal.  But at least my amendment makes the compromising suggestion in relation to hunting the unfortunate hare that, as in stag hunting, beagling, clay pigeon shooting and various other sports, the barbarity is removed and the people continue to enjoy the sport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In saying this I should like to make it quite clear that I do not in any way doubt the sincerity or motives of Senator Dr. Browne in moving this amendment. He is being absolutely consistent with the views he expressed on the Committee Stage discussion of the Bill.  So far as Senator Dr. Browne is concerned, he genuinely believes that the solution he has proposed in his amendment is one which should in a reasonable way meet the point of view of those who want to have coursing continued and the point of view of those who object to it as a cruel sport. I should like to assure the Senator that I am not speaking from any Olympian heights in regard to this matter.  I have never attended a coursing meeting and my only knowledge is that which I gained from listening to speakers in this House and from the propaganda material with which I have been furnished from time to time by both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of points which worry me about this amendment.  My basic objection as a Member of Parliament, even though this House does not directly represent the electorate in the same way as the other House, is that we should adopt an attitude in which, rather than representing the people, we should endeavour to impose views, particularly&mdash;although I do not like using the term&mdash;a minority viewpoint on a majority.  No matter how well intentioned, no matter how well motivated one may be in urging <Col N="475" /> the adoption of a point of view which is a minority one, I do not think that a representative in Parliament is acting in his true capacity if his concern is to reflect, not the general view of what is desired by the majority, but purely a minority point of view.</P>
    <P>I offer this as one of my doubts in relation to any effort to amend the law with regard to coursing in a Bill of this kind.  In this I think I reflect a point which was made validly and strongly by the Minister during the Committee Stage debate.  This does not appear to be the type of Bill in which one should interfere radically with the continuance of a system of coursing which has been adopted generally throughout the country.  I could see much merit, at some stage, in Senator Browne or anyone else who would care to do so trying to get an in-depth discussion on this matter independently of this type of Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment itself, despite what I might regard as its face value&mdash;and I am not being derogatory when I say that&mdash;from the point of view of those who regard this sport as a cruel one, I wonder to what extent the amendment as it stands would be practical and workable.</P>
    <P>The amendment seeks to provide that:</P>
    <P>There shall attach to each licence granted under subsection (2) or subsection (3) of this section a condition that the hounds shall wear muzzles of such a design as to preclude their inflicting any injury on or bringing about the death of the hare.</P>
    <P>The first question one must examine in relation to that is: who is going to be responsible for the design? Who is going to guarantee a muzzle of a design which would preclude the greyhound not alone killing the hare but inflicting any injury to it?  I am not an expert on muzzles.  I know from practical experience that dogs do not like wearing muzzles.  I have never come across a dog that gave evidence of being comfortable when wearing a muzzle.  It is natural for greyhounds to follow hares, but I would need a lot of persuasion to <Col N="476" /> believe that it is natural for greyhounds or any other dog to wear muzzles.  The first suggestion made here is that we should fit on greyhounds a device which is not natural for the animal to wear.  By doing that, to what extent are we inflicting perhaps more than discomfort, perhaps pain, on the greyhound?  I do not want to make a joke of this because it is a serious suggestion and deserves consideration, but it seems to me that you cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.</P>
    <P>The question arises on this amendment whether it is fair from the point of view of the greyhounds to muzzle them when they are engaged in something which is for them a natural exercise.  The type of muzzle one finds for sale frequently does not, unless it is badly fitted, preclude the dog opening its mouth.  It prevents the dog from getting a grip on something. Unless you can design a muzzle that will prevent the greyhound from opening its mouth, how can you ensure that the muzzle will be such that the greyhound can neither inflict injury nor cause the death of the hare while coursing?  There is, quite seriously, an enormous practical difficulty there.  If this amendment were accepted it would presumably be an offence not to comply strictly and rigidly with the terms set out in the amendment.  I do not think that is possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne aims this amendment entirely at coursing.  He did, I think, in the course of his remarks &mdash;again a pun is not intended there&mdash; refer to stag hounds and possibly otter hounds.  This amendment does not oblige the Minister, even if it were accepted, to attach any similar condition in the case of stag hounds or otter hounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>We did try to have that abolished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but you also tried to have coursing abolished. I am merely pointing out that, if what is suggested in this amendment is valid and practical, in relation to coursing, it would seem to me that it would also be valid and practical in relation to <Col N="477" /> otter hunting or stag hunting.  But it is not suggested for the latter; it is suggested for coursing.  I do not know sufficient about the subject to know to what extent this or any variation of this suggestion would be practical. I should imagine that a great deal of examination and research would be needed to establish that.</P>
      <P>This House, by its vote on the Committee Stage in relation to the general question of coursing, may be taken as having come to a decision, for the present at any rate, not to interfere with the general position regarding coursing.  If it were required to look at the matter again in the context of the suggestion put forward in the amendment, I would feel that that should only be done following some fairly deep knowledge of the effect on the sport of coursing which would ensue from implementing this amendment. For all I know it would ruin the sport.  For all I know the effect on greyhounds required to be muzzled would simply finish the sport.  I have no doubt that Senator Browne would feel that that would be an additional virtue for this amendment.  But in the context of the decision which the Seanad took on the Committee Stage &mdash;I am not suggesting it is done deliberately&mdash;if it had the result of ruining the sport, it would be a back door method of getting around a decision the Seanad has already taken.  It would be necessary to know the effect of this amendment on the sport of coursing and it would be even more necessary to know the effect of the implementation of this amendment on the general welfare and well-being of the greyhounds involved.  Here we have not merely the question of an emotional reaction.  We are talking about what is a valuable industry.  If, through undoubtedly very sincere feelings, we were to implement an amendment of this sort, which would have a drastically adverse effect on greyhounds, then we would be accidentally having an adverse effect on a very valuable industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I made my views known during the Committee Stage debate and I do not intend to go over the <Col N="478" /> ground again.  I want to take up a few points in supporting Senator Browne's amendment.  These arise from Senator O'Higgins's speech.  If he pushed his philosophical ideas to their logical conclusion, in which he said that essentially&mdash;I must be careful to quote him right&mdash;we must not push minority views in our position as legislators, that the majority rule must hold its way and that we only take the majority view into account, that would not be satisfactory because all government consists of compromise.  As a member of a minority, I know that if my view was not taken into account, if it was disregarded, life would not be worth living.  It is not a question of deciding that it is majority rule.  If you have a sufficiently aggrieved minority and the cause of their grievance is not dealt with adequately and some compromise is not arranged, then life will not be worth living.  To see the extreme result of this logical position one has only to look at the problems of government in Northern Ireland.  However, I know Senator O'Higgins is interested in a more restricted and particular case.  I just want to say that in general I just could not agree with his philosophical views.</P>
      <P>He made some other points which I could not agree with.  First of all, I do not think it would be beyond the wit of man to design a muzzle which could achieve what is aimed in this amendment, the protection of the hare, and would not greatly incapacitate the greyhound.  That would be simple enough.  It just requires some thought and some knowledge of what is going on.  I do not think it would be an impossible task.  He considers it is unnatural for greyhounds to be muzzled.  Lots of unnatural things happen in sport involving animals.  It is natural for a horse to run without any incumbrance, but he usually has a rider.  One can see from the training that is necessary that horses resist the idea of having jockeys on them for a considerable time.  Sometimes they manage to do so during the course of a race.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is dangerous to argue that it is natural to do this or natural to do that.  It is not natural to chase hares inside an enclosed park.  It is natural <Col N="479" /> for dogs to chase them out in the open.  We are not talking about a natural sport and that argument is also fallacious.  It is wrong to pass the buck and say this is not the place to introduce an amendment like this.  I recognise the strength of the vote that occurred on the Committee Stage on the attempts either to abolish or to regulate and restrict coursing somewhat. There was a large majority in favour of maintaining the <i>status quo.</i> That does not reflect the feeling throughout the country on this matter.  The feeling is changing rapidly.  I would be prepared to bet quite a sizeable sum that, within ten years at the outside, we will have legislation which achieves what we are talking about here, and does not decimate the sport in any way.  This will come because public feeling and public opinion are changing concerning coursing.</P>
    <P>I would be quite happy if coursing continued provided some restrictions like this are placed on the dogs so that the hares are not savaged at the end of the race.  As Senator Browne said, it is a very fine thing to see animals chasing each other in the open and in the natural course of events.  Of course, they catch each other and there is cruelty in life.  But this is a man-made situation and it is incumbent on those taking part in the sport to ensure not just a 90 per cent escape of hares but a 100 per cent escape.  It seems to me that none of the arguments Senator O'Higgins has advanced really holds any water at all in this matter.  It would be quite a reasonable thing to do, and a reasonable thing to ask the many people who obviously enjoy coursing meetings and, as Senator Browne has pointed out, who do not like to see the hare being killed.  This would be a cast-iron way of ensuring that and therefore I support his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know what licence is meant in the amendment. Does it mean a licence granted to people who apply for a licence to carry out coursing events, or does it also apply to a person who has a gun licence?  Secondly, the word <Col N="480" />&ldquo;hounds&rdquo; is used here.  Is there any distinction made between the type of hounds, because there are tongue hounds, fox hounds and greyhounds? If this amendment was accepted would it mean that all these hounds would have to be muzzled?  If that were so, how would it affect the many people who follow the hare with tongue hounds instead of greyhounds? Is it not a fact that tongue hounds hunt more by scent and greyhounds hunt by sight?  There is a distinction there.</P>
      <P>I cannot say how practical it would be to have muzzles fitted.  I do not think it would be practical having regard to the various types of hounds. If, for instance, a man goes out fowling with a spaniel, a retriever, or a red setter, would it be necessary for him to have such dogs muzzled if this amendment was accepted?  Of what use would muzzled hounds be to people hunting foxes?  In other words, we might find ourselves causing a lot of trouble to people who enjoy and follow these sports, and interfering with people who go out hunting on Saturday and Sunday each week and who never kill a hare but follow them with the tongue hounds.</P>
      <P>The last point I would like to make has already been made.  It is a very important point.  We will have to be very reasonable about this.  Dogs, hounds, greyhounds and coursing are a very important industry.  Let us be practical about this.  It contributes very considerably to our economy. Much has been said about cruelty. Some complain about cruelty to the hares and others may argue there is cruelty to the greyhounds.  They could have a point.  It could be very cruel to a greyhound to be muzzled and have a hare within killing distance of him in his natural habitat.  If we carried that point further, it would eventually mean we would reach the stage where we would ban all hunting songs and poems and probably prevent Radio Éireann from playing &ldquo;The Fox Chase&rdquo; by Leo Rowsome.  I should not like such things to happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>If this amendment was accepted it would automatically do away with coursing itself. <Col N="481" /> Some Senators said tracking dogs are muzzled.  That is true.  Coursing and tracking are completely different.  At the track six dogs in a race are muzzled.  They are never within striking distance of catching the electric hare.  That keeps up their desire and keeps them chasing the hare week after week.  Experts say they do not reach their full speed at any time while they are following the electric hare.</P>
      <P>In coursing, if you muzzle two greyhounds and they are slipped after the hare and one of the dogs come within striking distance of catching the hare, he cannot catch the hare because of the muzzle.  The hare can come down the field again.  He might not go to escape.  He can go up and down the field perhaps six or seven times.  He can play the two dogs out and finally the dogs will be valuless.  A dog can be gruelled.  There is no incentive for him to keep chasing the hare.  I would say that on the second or third occasion a muzzled dog is slipped after a live hare he will automatically cease to follow.  That is only natural.</P>
      <P>Take the case of a shooting party. You put up a cock pheasant and you use blank ammunition.  After one Sunday you will not have many men out shooting.  Dogs have their own senses. If a dog believes he cannot catch the hare, he automatically turns.  He will not continue.  Somebody talked about open coursing and open hunting. There is nothing more cruel than open hunting.  In open hunting the hare has no chance.  There may be four or five dogs in a hunting party chasing one hare.  At least in the closed park they are confined to two dogs and the hare has a better chance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatBrowne" hpid="Mr. P. Browne Mr. P. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the debate on this Bill I have come to the conclusion that the hare and the greyhound have been singled out.  To my mind the hare is the most respected animal of all.  I carry a shotgun. I have had greyhounds.  I now carry a rod.  My shotgun licence entitles me to shoot a hare.  In fairness to everybody I know&mdash;and I am sure the same is the case in every county &mdash;if you were seen damaging a hare with a shotgun, I am afraid people <Col N="482" /> would be inclined to turn the gun on yourself.</P>
      <P>There are different forms of cruel sports.  Take rabbit hunting, for instance. The rabbit has no chance from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; with three or four terriers and, perhaps, one or two old greyhounds that are used for nothing else hunting him.  If the rabbit escapes the dogs and runs into his burrow a ferret will be put into the burrow and will get him out.  To my mind that could be termed a cruel form of sport.  It may take 40 or 50 foxhounds hunting a fox an hour to catch him.  It is true that he does not last very long with 40 dogs tearing at him.  Again that could be termed a cruel form of sport.  If that fox escaped into a burrow there are always a few little terriers to get him out.  He has no chance.</P>
      <P>There are several other instances. The badger is a beautiful animal.  I do not think there has ever been a dog that was capable of taking a badger from his earth with the result that, when people go hunting for badgers&mdash;I have never hunted them but I have been told this&mdash;they use bars, pickaxes and shovels.  Again the badger has no chance.  The most respected animal of all is the hare. People who drive a car, if they have not killed a hare themselves, have certinly seen a lot of hares slaughtered on the roads by traffic.  Due to the fact that the hare has a tendency to cross the road for grazing purposes at night, quite a number of them are killed on the roads.</P>
      <P>The most cruel sportsman is the person who goes out with a shotgun and a couple of dogs and puts up a flock of grouse and blazes into them with his two barrels.  Some birds fall down.  Others have a lot of lead in them and they travel for about a mile or so and they lie on the ground for days dying.  To my mind that is the most cruel sport of the lot.  I am sure anybody who has gone hunting will agree with me in that respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Section 26 provides essentially for the licensing of otter hunting and stag hunting.  In addition, there is provision in subsection (2) for the <Col N="483" /> Minister to permit, under licence, the sport of beagling and harrying and under subsection (3) the hunting of hares by means of coursing, in both cases during the close season for hares.  It is important to note that we are dealing with licences here issued to permit this sport during a close season and for a very short time only, usually a couple of weeks in the month of March.  A licence from the Minister for beagling or harrying or for coursing will not be necessary during the open season.</P>
      <P>The clear intention of the amendment is to intrude into the manner in which the activities or sports of beagling and hare coursing are conducted.  I hope I have made it perfectly clear on Second Reading that I am not prepared to become involved in the regulation of coursing matches as that duty is in the hands of the Irish Coursing Club by virtue of an existing statute, namely, the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, which is the responsibility of another Department.  In the case of beagling or harrying after a hare, I see no justification for legislating for the muzzling of the hounds inasmuch as there are very few, if any, hares killed in the sport. In any case, subsections (2) and (3) of section 26 deal merely with the licensing of two forms of hunting outside the open season.  In practice, it is intended to cover the few traditional beagling and coursing meetings held in the first two or three weeks of March&mdash;the generally accepted start of the closed season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been arguing since the debate started on this Bill in this House that this is a conservation measure and not a measure to deal with cruelty to animals.  The introduction of this amendment, more than anything else, makes that perfectly clear.  If the House were to accept this amendment, it would be quite legitimate and lawful for those engaged in organising coursing matches, or engaged in beagling, to course hares at coursing matches with greyhounds without muzzles from the month of October or <Col N="484" /> November, or whenever coursing starts, right up to March but, for a very limited period in March, they would be required to put muzzles on the greyhounds.  That is an absurd situation.</P>
    <P>The same situation would apply in regard to beagling.  It would be possible for the owners of packs, or the people who organise packs of beagles, to hunt all through the winter with beagles without muzzles but, come March when they get a licence from the Minister for Lands for a couple of weeks, it would be necessary for them to put muzzles on the dogs.  Again that is absurd.  As Senator Dolan has pointed out, the sport of beagling is a tongue sport.  The hare can be half a mile out of sight.  The dogs continue to hunt by sight and their owners can identify their own dog by his &ldquo;tongue&rdquo;&mdash;as they call it&mdash; and they enjoy listening to the dogs and seeing them chasing after the scent of the hare.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I am not prepared to deal piecemeal with coursing here if it needs to be dealt with&mdash;and I do not concede that it does.  I am merely dealing here with conservation.  I have no evidence &mdash;indeed, I will go further and say there is no evidence&mdash;that the hare species is in danger of extinction.  If that evidence comes to light, I have ample machinery within this Bill to prohibit the killing or hunting of hares altogether by refusing to give any open season.  If I thought it necessary&mdash;and I want to make it perfectly clear that I do not propose to do it&mdash;without this amendment I have power under section 9 of the Bill to impose the type of condition this amendment seeks to impose.  I do not propose to attach such conditions to these licences.</P>
    <P>I do not want to get into a discussion on coursing, but really what is involved in coursing is not an effort by the dogs to kill the hare.  That is not the prime motive.  What is involved in coursing is a trial of the speed of two dogs to see which of the dogs can go up the meadow the fastest.  That is what is involved here. It is true to say that the hare does on <Col N="485" /> occasion get killed.  There is no doubt about that.  I would agree with Senator W. O'Brien that, if dogs were to be muzzled and habitually coursed with muzzles after live hares, they would cease to course.  They would cease to follow.  It could also cause suffering and frustration to the dogs.  I readily concede that the degree of suffering or frustration would not compare in any way with the severity of the suffering the hare endures if she is caught.  Proper coursing matches are run on the basis that the hare gets a fair start, that she has a chance of getting away, of escaping.  Of course, there is the danger that she will get caught and she is caught and sometimes killed.</P>
    <P>I find it somewhat difficult to understand the fierce opposition there is to coursing by a small but powerful lobby while the same people do not seem to object to fowling, as it is called.  They do not seem to object to the provisions of this Bill which permit hunting of animals or birds by firearms.  If they were to be consistent and logical they should include that.  There again there is suffering. If a duck is shot with a shotgun and falls in the reeds and only suffers a broken wing or leg, or both, it can hobble around suffering for perhaps hours or days.  There has not been one word of objection from this lobby against that sport.  You do not have to be consistent when you are opposing. You can be selective and oppose cruelty to animals and if you feel like it, you can close your eyes to the suffering of human beings, to extreme and wanton cruelty.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have gone into a field I did not intend to go into but I want to point out that there is not a lot of logic behind the opposition to coursing.  On Fifth Stage I hope briefly to tell the House what is involved in the Bill.  I candidly believe that all the good points and good and desirable sections in this Bill have been completely lost sight of in the opposition to this particular activity of coursing.  The intention behind this Bill was never to prevent cruelty but rather to conserve nature, to conserve fauna and flora, and the <Col N="486" /> Bill has done that very well.  The absurdity of permitting coursing and hunting without muzzles for three or four months and then putting muzzles on dogs for a fortnight shows that this is not the measure to control coursing; if the House or Parliament want to control it, there is a way of doing that.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe that the vote here on the last occasion which defeated an Opposition amendment dealing with coursing by 30 votes to five&mdash; and another Opposition amendment did not even get sufficient support to warrant a division&mdash;shows positively that there is no measure of demand in this House to outlaw coursing.  I concede that if there were any demand in the country to outlaw coursing, one would expect to find it in this House.  But, I repeat, this measure is purely a conservation measure, not an anti-blood sport measure.  To try and use it for that purpose is really not helping the very desirable objectives behind this Bill.  For that reason, I regret very much that I cannot accept this amendment in the name of Senator Higgins and Senator Dr. Browne.</P>

      <P>Regarding this amendment, the Senators concerned may have been moved by the fact that greyhounds are muzzled in track racing.  We are all well aware that greyhounds follow an electric hare when they are track racing.  The reason greyhounds are muzzled in track racing is to prevent them from fighting with each other.  Naturally they are not going to kill an electric hare.</P>
      <P>I agree entirely with Senator O'Brien and the Minister that if greyhounds were muzzled at coursing meetings it would be detrimental to coursing itself, because the instinct of the greyhound is to course and that being muzzled would prevent this instinct.  I should like to emphasise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to stress upon Senators who oppose coursing is that we are recognised as having the best greyhounds in the world.  The reason we have the best greyhounds in the world is that we have what is called a coursing strain in greyhounds, and this coursing strain crossed with the tracking strain, has produced the marvellous track greyhound we possess.  To interfere with coursing by muzzling greyhounds would be detrimental to coursing itself and, therefore, detrimental to the greyhound industry.  This industry is in a thriving state at present and the attendances at greyhound track meetings are improving immensely.  It is this cross-breeding of coursing and tracking strains that produces the powerful track greyhound.  On that basis alone it would be detrimental to the greyhound industry to interfere with coursing by muzzling the greyhounds.</P>
      <P>Another point I want to make is that the hare may be severely injured through the use of greyhound muzzles.  I imagine something like a wire muzzle would be used, if it did come to pass.  You can imagine a wire-muzzled greyhound hitting a hare at 40 miles an hour.  Naturally, the hare would suffer immense injury. On that basis, too, I feel that this amendment should be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, clearly, as Senator West said, it is going to take some time to educate this Seanad. The points raised by the various Senators are not very convincing. Indeed, Senator Cowen demolished one of Senator O'Higgins's main points about this prospect of the cruelty to greyhounds if they were to wear muzzles while racing, because, of course, it is true that greyhounds wear muzzles while racing in the greyhound tracks and it does not seem to inconvenience them at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the reason they wear muzzles.  It seems that Senator <Col N="488" /> Browne and other Senators did not know they wore muzzles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the Senator gave the reason.  I did know that the hounds in the greyhound tracks are muzzled and I am surprised that Senator O'Higgins used that as a point, because it is accepted by greyhound owners that greyhounds can race perfectly efficiently with muzzles. While I am sure they have a certain sense of frustration, if it does not interfere with their efficiency it seems that that is certainly not a reason the amendment should not be accepted.</P>
      <P>I do not accept Senator O'Higgins's extraordinary proposal, as Leader of the House, that this House should not propose significant amendments to legislation put before it.  What else should we be doing here but putting amendments to the various Bills?  Is it not our exclusive function to make amendments we think are desirable.  I am in favour of the other House having the right to change the Bill again if they wish to.  I would not take that power away from them.  They have the final say in amendments because they are the elected representatives and they must have that power.  But I do not see why we should put forward amendments which we do not think substantially change the proposals in any particular Bill presented to us if we think changes are merited.  I do not think that holds at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deplore, as did Senator West, the suggestion that a minority&mdash;I do not want to overstate the case&mdash;should keep its head down.  This is an extraordinary proposal from the Leader of the Seanad: that minorities should not put forward unpalatable proposals to the majority and expect them to be accepted by the majority.  Surely this is the whole basis of the democratic process, that we put the minority view, which, so frequently, tomorrow is the majority view.  Surely this is the essence, the whole reason why we get up and talk at one another in this way and try to persuade one another in this way? One of the pleasantest experiences in my whole life in politics is that, over the years, I have been able to put <Col N="489" /> forward a minority view.  I very often appear to be putting forward minority views but I have considered it to be one of the fine things about political life here that a member of a minority can get up and put forward points of view, with disagreement by those who do not share those views.  This again is the essence of this general principle of the right of individuals to disagree with one another, to hold majority and minority views.  Anything rather than the other approach of: &ldquo;If you do not share my views then somebody shoots you down, or uses violence, or whatever it might be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think this is a very important principle, the right of the minority.  The Leader of the House should have been more careful before he used that particular argument in talking about the decision of a handful of us to put forward what is an apparently unacceptable view to the majority.  In this question of the minority I have frequently put forward minority views. I take comfort from the fact that in many of the views I have held I have been a member of the minority only in the Republic of Ireland.  If one takes most of the western civilised democratic societies, with advanced cultures and standards and values stemming from those enlightened and advanced cultures, I would not be in the minority at all.  It is the members of this Seanad who are in the minority.  It is the members of the community which so frequently differ from me who are in the minority when one takes the views held on matters of this kind, say in western Europe alone.</P>
    <P>We are the last but one of the western European countries to keep this.  When the British introduce their Bill in the Lords we will be the last. I do not feel as downcast as some people think I should feel on issues like this which is of relative importance only.  But on much more important issues, I get great comfort from the fact that my views are shared by one-third of the world.  I deprecate the fact that an argument of that kind should be put forward: dogs hunt efficiently with muzzles.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators made the <Col N="490" /> point that this might affect the greyhound industry.  I dealt with this on Committee Stage when I pointed out that many countries who have abolished coursing have retained their greyhound industry and had no difficulty in doing that because dogs continued to be used in greyhound racing.  That brings me to the answer to another point raised by a number of Senators. This seems to be shifting across an unpleasant suggestion I made which does not appeal to the Senators.  They do not want to see the killing.  It is the hounds that want to see the killing. It is the animals that want to see the blood flowing.  It is the animals that want the hare to scream and to get the satisfaction of killing the unfortunate animal.  They said they did not like to see animals being killed or hurt or in pain; it is being done for the benefit of the dogs.  If they accepted this amendment and put muzzles on the dogs they would not continue to hunt the hare.  Of course, as Senator Cowan pointed out, night after night all over the country greyhounds continue to hunt hares around the various greyhound tracks.  As far as they are concerned the electric hare disappears mysteriously into a hole in the wall and they can never catch it.  It does not seem to me that that argument holds water either.  The hounds will continue to follow as long as a moving object is put in front of them until that object disappears. They run as fast as they can to try to catch that moving object.  Therefore hare coursing enthusiasts need not deny themselves the pleasure of watching coursing.  I cannot accept that point either.  We are left with the disagreeable conclusion that it is the Senators who want to see hare coursing continued and it is not simply a question of the dogs.</P>
    <P>May I point out the case of the beagles who follow draghunts or hounds who follow draghunts?  The Taoiseach hunts in this way apparently with pleasure.  The dogs hunt the drag, which is a bag of linseed.  Week after week these stupid animals go out hunting the scent.  The people who like following the animals, following the linseed bag at great expense across country on expensive animals, continue <Col N="491" /> week after week at this particular sport.  I understand that staghounds apparently follow this wretched stag week after week across County Meath and at a particular time they call off the hounds, put them in a horsebox and bring them back.  There is no validity in the argument suggesting that greyhounds or any kind of otter hounds or staghounds or beagles would not continue to follow the scent if the scent is put down or it is a moving object.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the Minister's suggestion that the killing of birds was not raised.  It was raised by me, and Senator O'Higgins will confirm that, I am sure.  I questioned Senator O'Higgins about this.  I have objected to hunting all forms of animals.  It is degrading to human beings to do this.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has a point when he talks about this Bill being a conservation Bill.  Essentially the objective of this would be to conserve these beautiful animals&mdash;otters, badgers and hares.  There is no conflict in my mind between the proposal that he should further the likelihood of these animals being conserved by destroying the likelihood of their being killed by organised killings of this kind.  Apparently up to 40 could be killed in any day.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he did not want to intrude into this sport.  He says he only licenses it for just after the close season, a couple of months.  That is why this amendment was put down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Our difficulty is that he would not accept the responsibility of licensing meetings.  This is handed over to the coursing club.  Of course, if the responsible Minister, as a man who knows and would accept that the sport is one which ends up in killing the animal in a painful manner, expressed his disapproval of it, then this would be a guideline to the coursing clubs.  It would then be up to them to take heed of the feelings of this House and, assuming that the Dáil accepted our amendment, it would be accepted as the general practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> Fortunately coursing is not really a widely enjoyed sport, if I can use the word &ldquo;sport&rdquo;.  Therefore it is unreasonable of the Minister to expect a large public opinion on it.  Probably very few members of the public knew what terrible acts were committed by people who hunt hares at coursing matches until they heard the revolting sound of the unfortunate hare being killed in the television programme the other night.  It is interesting to note that the producers had a very good film which they wanted to show on that programme on hare coursing, but the coursing clubs got an injunction against the showing because they were obviously deeply ashamed and felt a great sense of guilt about the horrible performance which is involved in what people call the sport of hare coursing.  The coursing clubs insisted that the public should not see what goes on at coursing matches.  If they were not ashamed of what they were doing at coursing matches, they would be happy to allow the TV personnel to make a complete exposure of the horrible practice of hare coursing. They used a legalistic device to ensure that the public would not be allowed to pass judgment on hare coursing.  At least the public heard the horrible scream of the little hare being torn to pieces by a couple of greyhounds in order to give&mdash;I repeat &mdash;rather a sick excitement to those who enjoy hearing little animals screaming while they are being torn to pieces.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien said there were many very cruel forms of sport, such as rabbit hunting, fox hunting and badger hunting.  We have named all of these sports and have objected to them.  Why is it that Senators, like Senator O'Brien, who recognise cruelty in other forms of sport, do not recognise the same cruelty in the sport which they follow?  We experience the same difficulty when we speak to people who follow fox hunting, badger hunting and otter hunting.  They all feel that their particular little vice is a permissible one.  It is, of course, the mote in the other person's eye; it is the other person who is perverted and likes hunting little animals to a painful death.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> Our special problem here is that we are dealing with a Bill which is concerned with hare coursing.  We are not dealing with a Bill&mdash;as the Minister said, and I agree with him&mdash;concerned with rabbit hunting and the other kinds of open hunting and shooting referred to.</P>
    <P>As reported at column 85, Volume 83 of the Official Report, Senator Walsh said:</P>
    <P>I take great pleasure in opposing this amendment.</P>
    <P>The opponents to this amendment have been depicted as bloodthirsty psychopaths.</P>
    <P>I do not know if these are the exact words, but I do not consider myself to be in that category.  I did not call Senators &ldquo;bloodthirsty psychopaths&rdquo;. I asked why they enjoyed hare coursing. They capture the little animal, arrest it in an elaborate arena, train their animals to be very fast and skilful and then release this unfortunate little animal into this enclosed arena from which there is one exit which the hare might or might not find. They set these highly-skilled animals with powerfully sharp teeth to hunt the hare as long as possible&mdash;that adds to the sport&mdash;to the death.  Senators all denied indignantly that they wanted to see blood spilled.  The best defence today was the one which said it was done for the sake of the dogs, again an evasion.  I have dealt with that particular argument, as with the other ones.  Therefore, I am left to conclude that the majority of Senators who spoke, who continue to support hare coursing and who will not accept this amendment, are behaving in a completely hypocritical way.  I should like to press the amendment.</P>

The purpose of this very minor drafting amendment is to have consistency in the use of the term &ldquo;subject to the restriction contained in section 33&rdquo; with its use in subsections (1) and (2) thereby removing any doubt as to the interpretation in the context of subsection (5).

      <P>I have no objection to the amendment.  I was not here at the time and I do not know whether it was possible to have a discussion on the modification in section 33 on Committee Stage.  As the Minister points out, this is subject to the restrictions imposed by section 33.  The restrictions imposed in section 33 effectively are to limit the use of firearms to firearms where not more than three cartridges can be used.  I think that is reasonable.  But I think the reasons for it should be spelt out by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point, which I think might be of some importance in obtaining goodwill for this measure, that in regard to the restrictions contained in section 33 which are referred to obliquely in the amendment limiting the type of firearm that can be used for game purposes, it should be made quite clear that this is a step which is in the interest of conservation.  The idea is that in future automatic weapons will be limited to three cartridges.  At the moment the usual automatic weapon shotgun has a magazine load of five cartridges and there are a <Col N="495" /> number of these on the market.  I do not know to what extent they are used other than for wild fowling.  They are used normally for wild fowling and I know of at least four types at the moment.  There is the Luigi Franchi, the Winchester, the Remington and the Browning.  The modern Winchester, as far as I know, is already adapted for only three cartridges as against five cartridges for which the Luigi Franchi has provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience of automatic shotguns leads me to believe quite firmly that it is very much the exception that a person out hunting with one of them would get in a third shot even, and, certainly, except in the occasional case where a person is wild fowling and possibly flighting for geese, it would be very exceptional that a person would discharge more than the third shot.  For that reason I think the limit of three which is &mdash;to use the wording that the Minister is now recommending&mdash;not &ldquo;imposed by&rdquo; but &ldquo;contained&rdquo; in section 33 is reasonable, but it is going to have the effect that people who at the moment have automatic shotguns with magazines catering for five cartridges will have to get those adapted or modified so that in future they will carry only three.  I do not think this is going to be a particularly expensive operation, but it is going to be an operation that a number of people in the country will have to carry out.  That will be appreciated once they know quite clearly that this is not something being done to spite them, that it is not being done simply for the purpose of restricting them in the legitimate enjoyment of their sport of hunting whatever it may be, but that it is something that is being done for the purpose of trying to preserve and conserve not merely game stock like partridge or grouse or pheasant but also wild fowl in the country.  As I say, they are used mainly for wild fowl.  I would say that only the very occasional person abuses the position by having the advantage of a five-cartridge magazine and slaughtering a whole flock of wild fowl.  I would say that the person in that position is very exceptional <Col N="496" /> and that it will be understood and accepted, provided it is clearly understood that this is in the interests of conservation and that in the long run it will benefit everyone interested in sport of this type if we do preserve the stock of game and save them from being decimated, as could happen with the automatic weapons available at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As I understand it, Senator O'Higgins finds amendment No. 9, which is purely a drafting amendment, acceptable and there is no question about that, but it is true&mdash;indirectly at any rate&mdash;that the amendment affects section 33.  Section 33 is the section which limits the cartridge-carrying capacity of shotguns to three.  I think most people would believe that the normal cartridge-carrying capacity of a shotgun is two, but shotguns with a cartridge-carrying capacity of up to five are not uncommon.  The proposal in the section is to restrict the cartridge-carrying capacity of shotguns to three. That is a happy medium, one more than the ordinarily accepted number and two less than what would be described as the maximum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restriction on the repeater and automatic shotgun is primarily in the interests of conservation.  The use of these weapons can result in excessive killing of wild birds, especially when they are at rest or feeding.  As I say, some of the shotguns are capable of firing as many as five shots without reloading.  By requiring their modification or adaptation so as to be capable of firing only three shots without reloading we are adapting a reasonable standard and one which goes most if not all of the way, towards meeting the wishes of hunting and conservation organisations both national and international.  I might add that the restriction is more likely to affect the visiting rather than the native shooter.  I can assure Senator O'Higgins that there is no question of putting this into the Bill simply to be awkward or simply to penalise people who have these more elaborate weapons.  It is done simply and solely in the interest of conservation and in order to prevent the wholesale slaughter <Col N="497" /> of wild birds.  I suppose a shotgun with a cartridge-carrying capacity of five might be related to a practice of habitually and all the time giving the hare a very short slip.  It is much more likely that a five-shooter will kill more birds than a double-barrelled gun with a capacity for three cartridges.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Section 38 prohibits the use of lamps, mirrors or other dazzling devices in hunting protected wild birds or protected wild animals except while ringing birds or hunting for educational or scientific purposes under licence. This amendment is consequent upon the Committee Stage amendment of section 32 extending the provisions of that section, which dealt with the licensing of bird ringing, to the banding, ringing, tagging or marking of wild animals as well as wild birds.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Section 65 provides a number of amendments of sections 3 and 12 of the Firearms Act, 1964, so as to extend their application, at present confined to game, to all wild birds and wild animals protected under the Bill. The specific amendment in subsection 1 (b) is to bring section 3 (2) of the Firearms Act into line with the provisions of section 27 for temporary suspension of open seasons in severe weather conditions.</P>

    <P>The table to the section sets out the full texts of the relevant subsections of sections 3 and 12 of the Firearms Act, 1964, as they are being amended under the Bill.  The words now being inserted by this amendment form part of section 3 (3) of the Firearms Act, 1974, and were, I am sorry <Col N="500" /> to say, omitted due to a typographical oversight.

      <P>Could I raise again the question whether a person coming in from the Six Counties needs a firearms certificate as well as a game licence? The point is that if this person applies for a game licence in the Six Counties&mdash;I think he pays £6 for it&mdash;he cannot use it on a Sunday.  Consequently he will be reluctant to take out such a licence.  I think it should be sufficient if that person held a firearms certificate, which is a different thing, and then let him apply for a licence when he comes in here or if he is a member of a gun club here.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The arrangement for visitors who wish to shoot here for this year have been made quite independently of this Bill and are already in force.  They were made under order by me as Minister for Lands and this is the first year that shooting by visitors was tightened up.  Indeed there was quite a volume of public demand that it should be tightened up in order to avoid excessive shooting and abuses.  The arrangements for this year require anybody coming from outside this jurisdiction&mdash; I think that is the best way I can put it&mdash;to have a game licence in the country of origin and to get a permit from me.  That is largely experimental and it will be reviewed next year either, hopefully under this Bill, or under the order.  In the light of representations that have been made and of experience this year we can see what is the best thing to do.  We will certainly bear in mind Senator Dolan's suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the indulgence of the Senators to put on record what changes are brought about by the Bill, but before doing so I should like to deal with two points raised on the Committee Stage which I specifically undertook to deal with.  Senator Mary Walsh raised two points on section 17, which <Col N="501" /> is the section dealing with the designation of areas as refuges for fauna.  She suggested that there should be rights of appeal against the designation order made by the Minister and also in relation to compensation payable following the making of such an order.  I undertook to look further into these aspects and to come back to them on Report Stage.  I have done so and I hope that what I have to say will allay the Senator's worries.</P>
    <P>Let me take the Senator's second suggestion first, namely, the question of an appeal on the compensation aspect.  Section 17, as it stands, provides for the payment of compensation to persons having an interest in land which becomes the subject of a designation order.  This compensation is specifically related to the diminution in the value of the land resulting from the ministerial order or to any loss or disadvantage suffered by what I might refer to as the aggrieved party. That the compensation should be so based is justified by the fact that no question of acquiring the land arises, and I am sure that the Senator will have no fault with that aspect of the matter.  The actual level of compensation will be a matter for negotiation between the Minister and the parties concerned&mdash;and this goes to the heart of the Senator's proposal&mdash;but where agreement is not feasible the amount will be decided by arbitration under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.  I hope the Senator will agree that for practical purposes this is tantamount to providing for an appeal on the compensation issue.  I am sure she will accept on reflection that the section as it stands does, in fact, adequately cater for what she has in mind.  That is the procedure adopted for assessing compensation in respect of land acquired by all local authorities in the country for their various statutory purposes.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to Senator Walsh's first point, namely, the proposal for a right of appeal against the Ministerial order under section 17.  I realise that the position here is not as clear cut as the other proposal. The situation is that, following publication by the Minister of the relevant <Col N="502" /> notice of intention to make an order, including any protective measures in relation to habitat, it will be open to various interested parties, including of course any landowners concerned, to object to the proposed order.  The Minister is obliged to consider all objections lodged and he will then decide whether and to what extent the designation order should be made.  It is at this stage Senator Walsh would like to see the right of appeal provided for and I can readily appreciate her viewpoint.  I should like to repeat, however, that in section 17 there is no question of acquiring land; at most only the user of the land will be affected.  It is true that there are compulsory acquisition provisions elsewhere in the Bill and where this course is followed, the landowner concerned will of course enjoy all the rights of objection and appeal which apply to compulsory acquisition procedure. I must emphasise that section 17 in no way comes into this category. Indeed, the section is designed to meet situations where conservation by the State of some particular wild fowl is desirable, be it a species of fauna or its habitat, it can be effectively carried out while at the same time leaving the habitat involved in private ownership. At the same time, I would be less than candid if I did not say that the section in so far as it does not incorporate a right of appeal against a ministerial order does contain some element of teeth, but since under the Bill the conservation of wildlife will be the function of the Minister and as a proposal for a designation order would be grounded entirely on scientific facts, it would, in my opinion, dilute the Minister's powers unduly if provision were to be made for an appeal.  For the reasons I have just mentioned, together with the fact that no acquisition of the land by the Minister is involved, I am satisfied that the provision for an appeal by objection is not warranted and that any claim should be met solely on the basis of the financial framework envisaged in the section.  I trust the Senator can accept this explanation.</P>
    <P>I might also point out that under the compulsory acquisition, there is, in fact, no appeal to a court unless <Col N="503" /> on a question of law, which means that in effect there is no appeal once the procedure laid down in the Acquisition Acts is complied with.</P>
    <P>The other point was raised by Senator Deasy and I should like to compliment him on his obviously detailed examination of the proposals in the Bill.  He raised the question on Committee Stage as to whether the chough, the raven and the kingfisher should not be included in part 1 of the Fourth Schedule.  I would remind the House that under the Bill all wild birds except those listed in the Third Schedule are being protected.  Part 1 of the Fourth Schedule lists the rare species within the protected category, in other words, those which are to get special protection.  The real impact of this special protection is seen in section 22 (6), which provides that, where an offence is committed in relation to a protected wild bird, it would be a good defence to claim that the capture or killing of that bird was urgently necessary to protect property described in section 42 (1) from damage and that the circumstances made it impractical to get the Minister's permission in advance.</P>
    <P>However, this good defence plea will not apply to a wild bird listed in the Fourth Schedule.  Senator Deasy apparently based his case for the inclusion of the chough, raven and kingfisher in the Fourth Schedule on information contained in a booklet issued by the Forest and Wildlife Service of my Department.  The booklet is entitled <i>A List of Common or Irish Birds</i>.  The full references in the booklet to the three species are:</P>
    <P>Chough breeds mostly on rocky coast from Antrim anti-clockwise to Waterford.  Probably over 1,000 pairs form the total population.</P>
    <P>I would not regard this species as rare or in danger at the moment.</P>
    <P>The raven breeds in cliffs and increasingly in trees thinly distributed in suitable habitats and increasing.</P>
    <P>The fact that this species is thinly distributed throughout Ireland is not to imply that it is in any sense rare. <Col N="504" /> Its numbers, as I have said, are increasing.</P>
    <P>The kingfisher is widespread and fairly numerous.  Found mainly on slow-moving unpolluted waterways and in winter often by the seashore.</P>
    <P>There is no question of this species being rare.  In the circumstances there is no case for putting these three species in the specially protected category in part 1 of the Fourth Schedule at present.  I can, of course, do this, under section 22 (2) of the Bill should the occasion demand.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan</i>): Let me just recapitulate on the main advances which this Bill represents in the cause of conservation of our natural heritage of wildlife:</P>
      <P>It settles fairly and squarely on one Minister&mdash;the Minister for Lands&mdash; statutory responsibility for the conservation of wildlife&mdash;wild birds, wild animals and wild plants.</P>
      <P>It gives statutory power to the Minister to initiate and engage in necessary research into wildlife matters, and to promote knowledge of such matters.</P>
      <P>It provides for the establishment of a fully representative Wildlife Advisory Council to advise the Minister.</P>
      <P>It provides for the first time protection for all wild birds and the hitherto unprotected species of wild animals and marine mammals, with the exception of a few pest species.</P>
      <P>It provides the means to protect our rare wild plant life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time the habitats of protected fauna and flora can be protected. This will be done through the establishment of nature reserves on State-owned or privately-owned lands, the designation of refuges for fauna and by way of formal agreements with private owners on restriction of the management of certain lands having wildlife values.  Here I should like <Col N="505" /> to emphasise for the benefit of Senator Michael D. Higgins, who has shown a commendable interest in the Bill and who had, I think, some doubts in the matter, that the nature reserves can extend to marine or inland water nature reserves, as well as to those on land.</P>
    <P>There will be a noticeable strengthening of hunting laws.  These can be summarised as follows:</P>
    <P>Only qualified persons with lawful access to sporting rights will be entitled to hunt game during statutory open seasons.</P>
    <P>Open seasons can be suspended in the interests of conservation of species.</P>
    <P>For the first time the concept of hunting licences&mdash;as distinct from firearm certificates&mdash;is being introduced for both resident sportsmen and visitors to the State.</P>
    <P>Hunting on State foreshore&mdash;and that is the bulk of our foreshore&mdash; will be unlawful except with the express permission of the Minster.</P>
    <P>The right to hunt on or over the territorial seas of the State will be vested in the State.</P>
    <P>There will be severe restrictions on what might be termed the tools of the poacher or indiscriminate hunter, such as unsuitable firearms and other devices which cause widespread death or injury to wild birds and wild animals; certain traps, snares, nets, decoys and lures including modern electrical instruments and recordings of wildlife sounds; lamps and other dazzling devices.</P>
    <P>Hunting at night will be banned except in so far as licensed researchers are concerned.</P>
    <P>Hunting of protected wild birds and wild animals from mechanically-propelled vehicles, vessels or aircraft will be prohibited.</P>
    <P>The ringing, tagging or marking of wild birds and wild animals will be provided for under licence.</P>
    <P>There will be new restrictions on the burning of vegetation near woods, nature reserves and refuges for fauna. In particular, the person who deliberately <Col N="506" /> and negligently lights a fire or does any other act which causes such vegetation to catch fire will face a claim for the resulting damage or loss in addition to facing a conviction and fine for committing the offence.</P>
    <P>The practice of falconry can be regulated under licence by the Minister, if the occasion demands.</P>
    <P>Trespass laws are being strengthened. It will be an offence to trespass on another's land to trap or shoot any wild birds or wild animals whether protected or not.</P>
    <P>The possession, sale and purchase of protected fauna will be severely restricted.</P>
    <P>The import and export of fauna&mdash; alive or dead&mdash;and flora will be permitted only under licence.</P>
    <P>There will be new powers to acquire land in the interests of wildlife conservation and to establish State ownership of certain inland waters in those interests.</P>
    <P>Other State and semi-State authorities will be obliged to consult the Minister with a view to safeguarding specific wildlife values in the course of their operations.  I think that Senators will agree that anyone who objectively examines that list of new provisions will find that it represents a major step forward in the sphere of wildlife legislation in Ireland.  Unfortunately, during the debate on the Bill a considerable amount of the time of the House was devoted to the controversial matter of hare-coursing.  This is one of the areas&mdash;indeed the main one&mdash;where, as I have said, some contributions veered off course.  This vexed subject was aired at great length on the rather tenuous premise afforded by a few items of the Bill which maintain, in relation to hare coursing, certain exceptions which already subsist in the Game Preservation Act, 1930.  However, let me repeat that the Bill does not introduce coursing, it does not confer any additional benefits or rights on the coursing fraternity nor does it extend the <i>status quo</i> of that activity.  All the Bill does is to maintain certain peripheral exceptions relating to that sport&mdash;a sport which is the subject, <Col N="507" /><i>inter alia,</i> of another statute not administered by the Minister for Lands.  This Bill is not the appropriate place to voice opposition&mdash;no matter how genuinely felt&mdash;to hare coursing and I can only hope that the amount of time given to the subject will not prevent either the House or the public from appreciating the very real progress contained in the Bill in the general sphere of wildlife conservation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most significant advance under the Bill is the attention which is being given to habitat conservation.  This was a major weakness in existing legislation but the Bill will fully remedy the deficiency.  As the House is aware, the Bill contains several provisions aimed at conserving habitat&mdash; for example, the establishment and recognition of nature reserves, the designation of refuges for fauna, provision for management agreements with land owners and so on. All these provisions represent a solid basis for positive progress from now on.</P>
    <P>Speaking of habitat, I might mention that in our particular context wetlands, owing to their importance for waterfowl, inevitably represent a widespread and significant element of it.  I should like to inform the House that the coming year, 1976, has been selected as Wetlands Year for the purpose of the Council of Europe's nature conservation publicity campaign.  My Department are participating in this campaign in a number of ways, but it occurs to me that the enactment of the Wildlife Bill&mdash;hopefully in the early part of 1976&mdash;would be the best contribution of all to a publicity campaign of this kind.  At all events the Bill, when enacted, will put us in a strong position to further the objectives of the wetlands campaign in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains several provisions aimed at unifying in a formal statutory way the services in my Department which deal with forestry and wildlife.  It goes even further by providing a firm statutory <Col N="508" /> backing to modern concepts of the uses to which State forest lands may be applied.  I do not think it is necessary for me here to elaborate on the amenity developments which have taken place so successfully in State forests in recent years.  The results speak for themselves and I am happy to say that as recently as a few weeks ago the Forest and Wildlife Service was the proud recipient of a major award for the contribution made by this amenity development in the sphere of tourism.  The Bill will do much to facilitate an expansion and acceleration of this programme; but it will also go much further by enabling the ecological aspects of our State forests to be further developed and exploited. Irish forestry is now being approached with more and more emphasis on its inherent nature conservation possibilities&mdash;without of course detracting from the economic aspects of timber production which will necessarily continue as the primary objective.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the Council of Europe and one of its programmes. The Council of Europe is but one of many international organisations dealing with game and wildlife with which the Forest and Wildlife Service of my Department has associations of one kind or another.  The Wildlife Bill will enable the service to play a more meaningful part in the activities of these bodies and, in addition, will facilitate the ratification and implementation by Ireland of a number of important international conventions designed to protect and safeguard different aspects of the natural environment.</P>
    <P>These then are some of the more important features of the Bill which the House has been discussing.  There are of course numerous other provisions of less immediate, but nonetheless useful, significance.  It will be clear from what I have said that we are now well on the way towards putting a very important and broadly-based piece of legislation on the Statute Book&mdash;legislation which will help in no small way to safeguard the wildlife heritage of the nation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> We of this generation merely hold this wildlife in trust; the Bill, I believe, represents a vital instrument in honouring that commitment and ensuring that this facet of our national heritage passes unimpaired to future generations.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Seanad for the detailed and patient hearing it gave the Bill.  It has been a pleasure to introduce the Bill here.  I hope I get a similar reception elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purposes of the Bill are, first, to increase from £200 million to £400 million the aggregate amount of Exchequer moneys which may be advanced to and expended by the Industrial Development Authority by way of grants and certain other payments of a capital nature, other than payments against guarantees and, second, to make separate provision that the aggregate amount of moneys guaranteed by the IDA in respect of principal and still outstanding and of payments made by the IDA on foot of guarantees shall not exceed £100 million.</P>
      <P>There is a further provision that the IDA may not, without the prior approval of the Government, give a guarantee of repayment of principal exceeding £500,000 in respect of any undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there is a statutory limit of £200 million on the aggregate of Exchequer moneys which may be paid to and expended by the IDA on their various grant schemes and other capital expenditures.  The Industrial Development Act, 1969, set a limit of £100 million on such payments and, subsequently, this figure was raised to £200 million in the Industrial Development Act, 1972.  Issues to the authority of the relevant capital have now reached this limit and it is necessary therefore that the limit be increased, as a matter of urgency, to <Col N="510" /> enable the authority to continue to discharge their duties.  The present Bill proposes a new limit of £400 million.  Such limits are usually pitched at levels which will facilitate review at reasonably regular intervals and thus afford the House an opportunity for periodic debates on the industrial development programme.  The limit now proposed should come up for review again within a few years, given the present level of capital payments associated with the industrialisation programme.</P>
    <P>The continuing success of the IDA is best indicated by the fact that between 1952 and 1970 68,000 new jobs were approved, while in the period 1970-74 inclusive 78,500 jobs were approved.  This latter figure of 78,500 new jobs at full production relates to a fixed asset investment of over £880 million and a financial commitment by the IDA of over £225 million.  The domestic component in planned investment is very substantial.  For example, in the period April 1972-end of 1974 the planned domestic IDA aided investment was £268 million as against £432 million for the new overseas investment.</P>
    <P>The IDA, as Senators know, are empowered to give guarantees in respect of loans raised for the provision of fixed assets for an industrial undertaking.  Up to now the aggregate expenditure limits have included payments by the IDA on foot of such guarantees.  In circumstances where the authority are approaching or have virtually exhausted their statutory capital expenditure limits the Authority would be unable, without an amendment of the legislation, to meet the liabilities they had undertaken under guarantee, should it be necessary to do so.  To rectify this situation the present Bill has a provision which sets a limit of £100 million on the aggregate of loan principal which may be guaranteed by the authority and of payments in respect of principal under such guarantees.  This provision will leave lenders and their advisers in no doubt as to the ability of the authority to meet their obligations.</P>
    <P>At present guarantees either given <Col N="511" /> or approved in principle by the IDA amount to about £40 million.  Such guarantees are not given lightly and only cases of large investments have been involved, where the provision of a guarantee was the deciding factor in a firm's decision to establish here. This practice will continue and, in addition, section 3 of the Bill requires the IDA to seek the approval of the Government for any guarantee of principal exceeding £500,000.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of the last session I brought another short Industrial Development Bill before the House. On that occasion I indicated that I proposed to introduce more comprehensive legislation in connection with industrial development activities. Work has reached an advanced stage on this more comprehensive legislation, but it recently became clear however that certain measures it was proposed to include were going to delay the preparation of the Bill.  I had no choice but to prepare the present short Bill now before the House dealing only with urgent matters of a financial nature which are necessary at this time.  I would therefore ask the House to facilitate the passage of the present Bill in the light of the knowledge that the further Bill, which I am endeavouring to have finalised as quickly as possible, will afford an opportunity for a further debate on the industrial development programme.</P>
    <P>I accordingly recommend the present Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly not opposing this Bill.  In general the Industrial Development Authority have been doing a very good job.  It will need further funds.  We are entitled to know a bit more about what they need these funds for and what progress has been made with the funds they received up to now.  I say this having regard to the fact that we are in the middle of a very serious economic crisis certainly the worst crisis we have had since the war and possibly the worst in the last 50 years.  We would like to know more about what is happening in the industrial <Col N="512" /> sphere.  We would like to know what is the position in regard to the funds the IDA have spent up to now and what they want the further funds for.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said in his opening statement:</P>
      <P>The present Bill proposes a new limit of £400 million.  Such limits are usually pitched at levels which will facilitate review at reasonably regular intervals and thus afford the House an opportunity for periodic debates on the industrial development programme.  The limit now proposed should come up for review again within a few years, given the present level of capital payments associated with the industrialisation programme.</P>
      <P>It is very necessary and appropriate that the needs of the Industrial Development Authority should come before this House regularly, thus giving us an opportunity for periodic debates.  However, in such circumstances we should be given a little more meat, a little more information, more details, so that we could have a really worth-while debate in this House in regard to what has been spent and why further funds are necessary.  For that reason I am disappointed that the Parliamentary Secretary has not given the House far more information and detail about what is happening in industry at the present time.</P>
      <P>The Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary and other members of the Government have been and will be making many after-dinner speeches at this time.  In many of these speeches they will be probably referring to Government plans concerning industry. This House is the place in which to give details of industrial development, to give us some idea what these funds are required for and how it is envisaged they will be spent.  If this Bill means anything it means that existing funds are, if not exhausted, about to be exhausted.  The House is entitled to some brief review of how these funds were spent in the period between the times this Bill comes to the House and the last Bill came to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that the reason these Bills are regularly brought before the House is to give the Seanad an opportunity to debate the industrial development programme.  Without some help from the Parliamentary Secretary it is very difficult to have such a debate.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is merely taking the view that he comes into the Seanad, asks for so many million and then sits back and waits for criticism and for people to throw questions at him, that is a defeatist attiude.  I would have expected him to take a more positive attitude, to say what has been done, what he proposes to do, and in that way help the Seanad to know what is happening, and also prevent the Seanad from merely making this an opportunity to criticise what has been done and also to criticise unjustifiably the policy of the IDA.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has referred to the fact that a comprehensive Bill is promised and that it will give more detail about the industrial development programme and the IDA. This Bill may not be introduced for a long time.  We are living in very depressing times from the industrial and economic point of view.  We are in a situation where many people believe that our economy is on the point of collapse.  It is an extraordinary situation, that a member of the Government comes before this House seeking very substantial funds in relation to something which is of vital concern to the country, our industrial development programme, and does not elaborate on what the Government intends to do.</P>
    <P>The Government at present, in relation to every problem which arises, make the excuse that world events are the cause of the crisis, that everything that is happening is outside their control. I do not accept that the crisis is outside the Government's control or entirely due to world events.  If the Government really mean that there is nothing they can do about the situation then what they should do is step to one side, resign and let somebody else do something.</P>
    <P>One would think in regard to industrial development that the Government <Col N="514" /> would take the opportunity presented by this type of Bill of telling the House what they are doing about industry; to what extent they think industry can solve the problems we have at present; to what extent industry can get us out of our present crisis; to tell the people what these funds will be devoted to and how that will help to get the country out of its present crisis.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to suggest that, if the Parliamentary Secretary does not take the opportunity when he is introducing a Bill of this kind to say what the Government's plans are, then it would appear that the Government have no plans or policies to deal with the present crisis and, as far as the future is concerned, they do not know what to do.  They are still relying on the fact that the problems are being caused by world events, that the problems are outside their control.  There is no guarantee that the many millions of pounds referred to in this Bill, even when they have been raised and spent, will contribute in any way, as far as the Government are concerned, to a solution of the economic crisis confronting the country at present.</P>

Níl rud ar bith ar na habhair sin sa Bhille atá ós ár gcomhair.  Ba chóir go mbéadh an t-eolas sin againn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator Ryan, I am not opposing this Bill.  We are very concerned that every encouragement and opportunity be given to the IDA to improve the situation in which we find ourselves at present.  Never in the history of the State have the people had so little confidence in the Government as at present.  Especially in the last fortnight we have seen the Taoiseach and other members of the Cabinet on the media preparing us-and <Col N="515" /> this is a change&mdash;for the disaster which lies ahead.  Never before did a Minister for Finance tell the people before Christmas to stop buying spirits, cigarettes, petrol and so on. It seems that these are budget leaks.  I do not know whether he was afraid people might say to themselves: &ldquo;At least we will have one good Christmas before we all end up in the workhouse&rdquo; or whether he wanted to deprive the ordinary shopkeeper of any profit he might make during the festive season.</P>
    <P>We should realise that if this our whiskey potential was developed properly as an industry for export, there are thousands of our own kith and kin all over the world who would be delighted to buy it.  This would keep some of our people in employment here in one of our few remaining viable industries.  It is a deplorable state of affairs that in 1975&mdash;and it is less than three years since this Government took office&mdash;we have 107,000, perhaps 109,000, or 110,000 people unemployed.  I do not like having to repeat these figures here.  I referred to them on a few occasions before when the figure was given at 103,000.  Within a couple of weeks it escalated to 110,000.</P>
    <P>Let us be sensible and reasonable about this.  Politics may be politics, but I can assure Senators that nobody on this side of the House takes any pride in that fact.  We know that the livelihood of our people depends on borrowed money.  Fathers of families are out of work, drawing pay-related benefits and unemployment assistance of various kinds, some of them drawing, perhaps, as much, or maybe more, as if they were working.  This will have a bad effect on future generations.  There were about 10,000, 11,000 or 15,000 school leavers last year, with no hope of a job.  There is no use in saying the Arabs are the cause of this, or that it was caused by world inflation, or any other lame excuse. I can remember 1949 to 1951 when the first Coalition Government took office.  It was the very same pattern then.  When they left office people were out of jobs.</P>

I saw the Tánaiste on television from Wexford telling the people of the tough times that lay ahead.  He asked the workers to stomach the pill he was trying to shove down their throats in 1975. Later on, the Taoiseach came down off his high horse and home from the hunt and made this wonderful statement on television.  He told the people, as a Christmas gift, that there was nothing but woe and gloom and starvation before them and that the Government were not to blame, the Government of all the talents.  The ship of State was handed over to them with her finances in order and with a further £35 million of EEC funds saved on agricultural subsidies ready to be distributed through the social services.  Nobody was unemployed. Nobody was emigrating.</P>

Imagine the Tánaiste, who represents the workers of this country, speaking from his palace in Liberty Hall, or from some rostrum in Wexford, telling the workers there is nothing in front of them.  If somebody from the Fianna Fáil benches said that people would say it was a political speech.  Yet we heard it from the man who is said to have so much concern for the workers.  He was followed by no less a person than the Taoiseach. These are unpalatable facts to the Government Senators.  I am sure there are responsible men over there and their faces should be red because of their performance in Government. When the Minister for Finance was here on a previous occasion I said the five Labour members of this Coalition Government were making a fool of him, that they were trotting over here to Leinster House and talking about pay-related benefits, and so on, and going back to Liberty Hall with a different story.  They met as a parliamentary party on only two occasions, I think, since this Coalition Government were formed.  It is no wonder that we have this despicable performance.  It is no wonder that the people of Ireland are in despair. These are the people who came into office to control prices.  We are now issued with a monthly booklet on prices.</P>

      <P>If I am setting up an industry, naturally I would like that industry to be able to produce a product that would be viable on the market and sell competitively with <Col N="518" /> products abroad.  Surely the price of the product would be one of the first things an industrialist would think about if he was to be successful in his venture.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me the number of industries and the number of people who were put into work in my region. I have been chairman of the Northeastern Development Association since 1973.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to examine those figures and give them to me, and to do likewise with the other development areas.  We could use them as a yardstick to measure the so-called success of this Coalition Government in providing employment.</P>
      <P>I say, without fear of contradiction, that there is no evidence of any improvement. Down the hill has been the story from the day they took office.  That is deplorable in 1975.  If we are ever to get out of this mess the Government should be meeting day and night to try to do something. They should meet with the Industrial Development Authority, and anybody they like, to try to do something to restore confidence.  I do not believe they will ever succeed in doing it because the beaten track is there, the track that was made from 1949 to 1951 and from 1955 to 1957, and again from 1973 to 1975 and maybe into 1976.  These three periods will stand out as the years of lack of progress in this country over the past 30 or 40 years.</P>
      <P>Future generations will not thank us if we do not work night and day to ensure that this Coalition Government are rooted out of it.  Until we get rid of them completely and start on a new base industrialists will not have any confidence in coming here and would-be industrialists who are living here will not venture to chance their money in industries here.  If we look at labour relations we can easily see that the unions are not fit to control their own members.  We have strikes and factories closed.  That is pertinent to industrial relations.

      <P>If an industrialist came to my area to set up a factory, I am quite sure he would ask: &ldquo;What are the labour relations here?  What is the history of unofficial strikes?  What is the history of your workers?&rdquo;  That would be very important to an industrialist. While I admit that unions are necessary, and that organised labour is a good thing as far as industries are concerned&mdash;and I agree wholeheartedly that unions should be accepted&mdash;the day is coming when union bosses will have to be able to control their members.  If unauthorised strikes are allowed to develop it will mean the closing of one industry after another.  Recently I read somewhere that some well-informed person had said that a finished article could be produced for almost half the cost in Germany compared with the cost of production here.  I am not sure how accurate that figure is but it is fairly accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about a serious situation.  We are talking about what the IDA are trying to do in a very adverse climate to get industrialists to come here.  Naturally they will be looking to the IDA to see what grants they will be getting, but they will also have to advert to the fact that they <Col N="520" /> will have to invest a large amount of their own capital.  They will say: &ldquo;We can go to Puerto Rico, or Spain, or somewhere else&rdquo;.  Naturally they will look at our labour relations.  They will look at the skills our people may have and our proximity to markets. These things are all very important. In any industry, labour relations are very important.  I am not slagging the workers in any way.  I am talking about uncontrolled strikes.</P>
    <P>The IDA will also have to take cognisance of the fact that the industrialist or the businessman from abroad, and also the Irishman who has worked hard down through the years and saved a little money will now say to themselves: &ldquo;If I start an industry using some native raw material, such as gypsum in my part of the country, or stone facing, or something like that, I will have to put my money into it&rdquo;.  These people should be thought highly of instead of being slagged and run down.  The wealthy man who has enough confidence in the country to put his money into an industry should not be ballyragged, or exploited by an unofficial strike or something like that when he has the article ready for export. He should be encouraged.  He is a patriot because he is actually risking his own money.  Naturally he deserves a little profit.  The banks made £20 million profit last year and God knows where they put it&mdash;probably in some foreign country.  While I am on that subject, it is a pity something could not be done about that.  However, I am merely saying the industrialist is an important person.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should have a plan for this extra £100 million.  He should tell us where it will be spent.  He should tell us where the last £100 million was spent and how many people it put into employment. There should be some reference to the amount of money it takes to put a man into a heavy industry and that should be compared with the amount of money it takes to put a man into employment on the land.  We often forget our farms.  We have a good climate; we are in the EEC; and there is a good potential.  There is no comparison <Col N="521" /> between the amount of money used to put a person into a five-day week job in a factory and the amount of money a small farmer gets to rear a few sows to increase his income and perhaps, to give employment to one or two people.  I do not know whether that comes under the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  The IDA will have to interest themselves in it because industries based on native raw materials are very important, in particular industries such as the processing industries, milk powder factories, and so on.</P>
    <P>Last year the greater part of our exports was not manufactured goods but cattle and sheep.  A greater effort should be made to ensure that those cattle and sheep are processed here. A very substantial grant should be given to people, if necessary, to set them up in such a way that they will be able to process the various agricultural products and use native raw material and ensure that employment is found for our people.</P>
    <P>Industries have been protected here. This was necessary in 1932 because there was an economic war on.  There were other reasons too, Irish industry was young then.  Down along the line Irish workers and industrialists have improved immensely and their skills are practically second to none if channelled the right way.  Therefore, we have great potential there.  We have a work force.  We have built new colleges of technology.  We have done a great deal to ensure that we have qualified skilled workers.  We have plenty of them now, if we could find the jobs for them.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect which often strikes me, especially when I am travelling through the Parliamentary Secretary's constituency, that is, Tara Mines. There is tremendous potential there. We have heard a lot of talk about smelters, and so on.  If it is, as it is alleged to be, the richest zinc mine in Europe, surely there should be no disagreement on from which port these concentrates and ores should be shipped out of the country.  They should not be shipped out at once.  They should be processed here and then <Col N="522" /> shipped out.  That is something the IDA and the Government should pursue. Years ago in Galway we had the Tynagh Mines and in the early stages many ores were shipped out of there. We learned as we went along.  Tara is a very rich mine and I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary knows far more about it than I do.  The row whether the port should be Dublin or Greenore, or Dundalk or Drogheda, could be settled if the right effort was made to provide a smelter not when the mines are empty, but now.</P>
    <P>The road ahead is very difficult. There seems to be no forward planning. Members of the Government have already said that themselves.  The pigeons are coming home to roost. That is nothing for any of us to boast about.  It is a sad state of affairs that so many people are unemployed.  We have had a spate of borrowing which seems to have run riot and left people so punch drunk that they do not know where they are.  Millions of pounds do not seem to mean anything.  We have to get away from that idea.  We will have to ensure that when grants are given to industries in future there will be a proper hold on those who get them They are now paid on a sliding scale and that is the correct way because this is Government money given to encourage industries.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to enter into the question of oil refineries, and so on, it is amazing the amount of time given on RTE to oil refineries in Dublin and objections to them.  Many people have spent a great deal of time talking about pollution.  A lot of it is nonsense, in my opinion.  The important thing is to get the people into employment.  I think Cork has been decided on as the location.  There should be some finality.  We must stop this shadow-boxing and get down to the business and get the industry in here.  That is what is important. People at work are far more important than scenery, or pollution, or any of the other catch-cries which get far more attention from the media than.  I think they are entitled to. Certain regulations are written into the provision of grants which will cope with pollution.  It should not be <Col N="523" /> used as a delaying method or to keep people on tenterhooks and cliff-hanging for months and months.</P>
    <P>We have no objection to this measure.  Why should we?  The Parliamentary Secretary always seems to say he will be coming in later on with a Bill in much greater detail and he will give us far more information, and so on.  In another couple of months he will come in, probably on the eve of a recess, and we will be told there is something around the corner.</P>
    <P>I would not like to end by not wishing the Parliamentary Secretary a happy Christmas but, if things continue as they are, I doubt that he will be in that position next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as I think, in their hearts, all Members of the Seanad do.  Notwithstanding the little bout of shadow-boxing we listened to for the past 15 or 20 minutes, I feel the Opposition party generally are glad to see this Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>From the brief particulars which the Parliamentary Secretary gave us in his introductory address, all of us would agree that the Industrial Development Authority, over the years since their establishment 20 odd years ago, have a very fine track record. They were set up against considerable opposition.  They were established as a statutory body to encourage industrial development.  The fact that, over that period of years, they have been, by and large, very successful is indicative of the right choice made by the then Government.</P>
      <P>I should like to include in my praise of the IDA's efforts, the record of their arm in the mid-western region, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company who are charged, as Senators are aware, with the development of industry in the mid-western region.  They have done a magnificent job of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that the IDA have been particularly successful in parts of the country which lacked an industrial <Col N="524" /> tradition and where the only alternative to industrial employment was unemployment, or under-employment on small farms, or emigration.  There have been criticisms in recent weeks and months about the type of industry encouraged by the IDA.  This is a very topical matter and one which deserves deep consideration.  It is easy to be wise after the event.  I suppose all of us have the gift of hindsight.  We should recall that the type of industry encouraged in the earlier years of the IDA's development, now referred to as a secondary industry, was about the only type of industry that you could get at that time.  Even if looking back now, it was not the ideal type of industrial development, it did provide jobs and that was the essential thing.  It provided jobs as the alternative to emigration in those days.  It did more than that.  It helped to create an industrial tradition in parts of the country where no such tradition existed.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we are a little too critical of our own efforts, particularly in the field of industrialisation.  We tend to compare our efforts with the efforts of long-established industrial countries like Great Britain, Germany and France.  The mere fact of creating an industrial tradition is a tremendous effort.  It takes a long time.  It takes generations before an effective industrial tradition is created for new industries. Apart from providing employment, if the IDA did nothing else but create this industrial tradition, they did a very good job.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately many of the industries established at that time were secondary industries, in many cases subsidiaries of overseas parent companies and the policy of such industries remained in the hands of the parent companies.  It is not, as I have already said, the ideal type of industry, because it meant that in times of recession or in times of changes of policy it was possible for the foreign parent company to decide to shut down its factory in this country and to leave at very short notice.  This, as we know, has happened unfortunately in certain instances but not in a great many instances.</P>
    <P>We should also remember that <Col N="525" /> when these secondary or semi-processing industries were established conditions were very much in their favour.  Unit costs were low in this country; labour, production and transport costs were low.  A United States or German manufacturer could afford to have materials processed or semi-processed in this country and shipped back to their own markets and still sell at a lower price than the same goods manufactured by the parent company at home.  We were right to take advantage of that situation while it existed, but unfortunately that situation could not last forever and we are now at a critical stage in the further industrialisation of this country.  We are now faced with a situation where unit costs are as high, if not higher, than in other competing countries.  We are operating in a free trade area where export markets are difficult to get and home markets difficult to hold.  Transport costs, particularly to outside markets, have substantially increased and high inflation and shrinking markets make it more and more difficult to maintain factory outputs at an economic level.</P>
    <P>In these changed circumstances the question of the type of industry which should be grant-assisted assumes greater importance.  It is evident that the Industrial Development Authority are alive to this situation.  I should like to quote just a couple of lines from the <i>IDA News</i> of December, 1975, which indicates new thinking on the part of the IDA in regard to the type of industries which should be assisted at this time.  They speak of the introduction of a project identifications scheme as a strategic new initiative in the national industrial development programme.  They go on to talk about the substitution of imports and say:</P>
    <P>In the past ten years, imports have quadrupled in value to a current annual level of over £1,600 million.</P>
    <P>Then they go on to say that, using the initial import substitution market, the new industries being encouraged <Col N="526" /> under this scheme will be well placed to move quickly into the export markets.  That is a development greatly to be welcomed because it means that from now on emphasis will be placed on industries that will use Irish raw materials.  It will also mean that imports which are now running at a fantastically high level can be, or will be, substituted by Irish industries using Irish raw materials.</P>
    <P>A policy like this will of course apply to both established and new industries; and those at present in this country part processing should be encouraged to advance to vertical integration, if necessary by mergers with other companies in this country. In other words, every possible encouragement should be given by the IDA and the Government to industries to establish their bases more securely in this country, to use Irish raw materials from the land, the mines and the seas and to ensure thereby a continuity of establishment which will put them on a firmer base to export to other countries.</P>
    <P>As has been mentioned from time to time by all in this House, the greatest possible encouragement should be given to small industries, even to talented individuals&mdash;a man with an idea, with an initiative&mdash;to expand the manufacture of new and competitive products.  Apart from the extra employment this policy will give, it will also encourage small industries with established local ties to remain on in good times and bad.  I have often felt that perhaps we did not give enough encouragement to the local man, to the man running maybe a small back lane industry with lack of adequate finance, but a man with an idea who could get on and expand with the necessary capital.  These people are now being encouraged; and even more encouragement should be given to them, because they are not the sort of people who are going to fold up shop and run away when times are bad.  They are the people who will stay on.  They have no foreign bosses 3,000 miles away who will instruct them to shut down the factory because an article can be manufactured cheaper in some other country.  They <Col N="527" /> are going to sit it out because their roots are in this country.  They deserve every possible encouragement by the IDA.  Incidentally, I was glad to see recently that that type of encouragement to small industries is now available to small entrepreneurs in any part of the country, which is as it should be.</P>
    <P>Recently we have had some discussions on the respective merits or demerits, as the case may be, of labour intensive <i>versus</i> capital intensive industries. This, again, is a subject which could form a debate on its own and I do not propose to dwell at length on it here.  I should just like to make a few points.  Undoubtedly there are strong arguments in favour of assisting labour intensive industries, but we should be realistic about it. Over recent years it has been shown that the industries that have suffered most are labour intensive industries. Selectivity of this kind, while possibly successful in the short term, would defeat itself in the longer term.  It is very hard to decide where the demarcation line should be between labour intensive industry and capital intensive industry. In this day and age when industrialists are trying to reduce their costs every effort is being made to install new plant and machinery to bring down unit costs.</P>
    <P>Capital intensive industries in this country have, by and large, managed to survive in the current difficult conditions. The competition and the need to lower costs will force more and more industries to install equipment and plant to bring down their costs of production.  We should not forget that capital intensive industries, particularly the larger ones, encourage the development of allied activities, such as service and transport industries, which give considerable employment in their own right.  The ideal to be achieved is a proper balance between labour intensive and capital intensive industries. Priority should be given to industry as a whole, whether it be termed capital intensive or labour intensive, where adequate employment can be given in competitive and efficient industrial conditions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> In the years ahead we face an enormous task.  I do not decry that for one moment and I accept the points made by Senators on the other side.  It was intimated in a recent television programme, and I read about it in recent publications, that in order to achieve full employment we will need to be thinking in terms of providing some 30,000 new jobs per year.  This is a vast task for our small country, when one thinks that these jobs in the main must come from manufacturing industry, as employment on the land is likely to continue to decline, although we hope at a lesser rate in the years ahead.  Employment in the service industries is by international standards adequate or even high at present in this country.</P>
    <P>It is therefore obvious, and I think it will be accepted on all sides, that our future policy to create jobs must be concentrated on manufacturing industry. But manufacturing industry cannot succeed until it, in turn, is efficient and competitive in a free trade area.  Our market should not be the three million people of this small state.  It should be aimed at the 250 million in the Continent of Europe, our partners in the EEC.  It is one thing to aim at it and another thing to get a slice of it.  This is the crunch of our problem.  At present not alone are we not holding our share of our trade but it is actually declining due to high costs of production.  In order to reverse this trend we must invest substantially in new plant and equipment.  We can only do that if industry is allowed to make reasonable profits and if incentive is given to industry to re-invest those profits in new plant and equipment. Borrowing there will always be, but borrowing from abroad in particular can only be regarded as a temporary effort, or should only be so regarded.  The ideal situation would be for industry to generate the type of capital required for reinvestment from its own resources.  This should be the aim of both the Government and the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>We need better management.  We do have good management in this country. There are outstanding examples of highly efficient industries here, but <Col N="529" /> there are unfortunately many examples of poor, ineffective or untrained management. We need good industrial relations, with the full co-operation of the trade unions.  Above all, we need a better and keener attitude to work by all sectors of industry.  We need, in addition, a realistic education system geared to our requirements as a small open-ended economy with lack of industrial tradition in many parts of the country.  In essence what we need is a combined national effort in which each sector of the economy pulls and is seen to be pulling its weight.</P>
    <P>To create the 30,000 jobs I mentioned earlier will cost something like £600 million a year.  The greater part of this sum will have to be borrowed or generated by industry itself.  It is therefore urgently necessary that industry be placed in a position to earn the necessary profits to reinvest the vast sum required.  A combination of IDA initiative and assistance and private enterprise can produce the necessary jobs, but it will be a hard task calling for fairly shared sacrifices by every section of the community.</P>

      <P>This Bill introduced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Keating, is a very strange production, but it is not the first time this kind of thing has happened. When the Minister came into the House towards the end of the last session he said he was bringing another short Industrial Development Bill before the House.  On that occasion he indicated that he proposed to introduce more comprehensive legislation later.  The odd thing is that, in 1972, when the then Minister was introducing a similar Bill, he said exactly the same thing: that he would produce a comprehensive Bill, given time.  Indeed, that drew from the then Deputy O'Leary the remark: &ldquo;The Minister is only a messenger-boy&rdquo; when in a three-page speech he asked for £100 million.  Now we have a two-and-a-half to three-page speech and he is asking for £200 million.  I think it is an extraordinary production by the Minister at a time when most of us, the lay man in the street and the politician, were never quite so frightened of the future, so unsure, so insecure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> Probably the most frightening institution in this very troubled island of ours, North and South&mdash;and this includes the paramilitary organisations &mdash;is the present National Coalition Government.  We are all watching the news on television and radio and in the newspapers never quite sure what catastrophe is next to be unloaded on our already tormented minds as to the level of the state of disaster which they have blundered into in the last three years.  In the context of that, with unemployment the way it is&mdash; 110,000 going to Heaven only knows what figure; most people accept 130,000, 150,000 or more&mdash;and with inflation quite uncontrolled, they give the impression of controlling it with all sorts of cut-backs designed to deal with these terribly serious problems. This Bill is clearly a very important and vital Bill.  It is concerned, or should be concerned, exclusively with the question of providing employment and the Government's terms for doing that.  But it does nothing of the kind. It gives exactly the same short memorandum: &ldquo;I want £200 million. Please let me have it by return and no questions asked.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is very strange that the Minister should behave like this because he is one of the few Minister in the Cabinet for whose intellectual and political skills I have considerable respect.  Therefore it is particularly odd that he should do this.  At the same time as he produced this very short Bill, he upbraided the Deputies in the other House.  At column 1485, Volume 286, of the Dáil Official Report, he said:</P>
    <P>I had thought that we might have developed a national debate about the other aspects and have got a national consensus so that the enacting of further developments of basic industrial policy would have been made easier but we did not have a serious debate on this Bill.</P>
    <P>Why is the blaming the other Members of that House when quite obviously he has made no attempt at all in this speech to initiate a national debate on the important industrial questions in which we are involved at present, in order that we might have <Col N="531" /> some idea of what this politician of certain skill thought should be the guidelines for our people in these very worrying months ahead of us?</P>
    <P>One difficulty with the Minister, Deputy Keating, is that we do not really know what he believes.  We know that at one stage he made some very rude remarks about monopoly capitalism.  He said that capitalism has desecrated the whole of the undeveloped world through imperialism; that the leopard of capitalism had not changed its spots; that it had not suddenly become benevolent and altruistic. He said that people who believed that were too naïve to be given the leadership of any nation, particularly the leadership of a weak nation such as this, which was in desperate peril of its future and of its very existence. That was in 1970.</P>

      <P>I am quoting from a document called <i>The Liaison Bulletin.</i> That is an authentic quote.  If the Minister were here I would be very glad to repeat it for him.</P>
      <P>I am not attempting to score points off the Minister at this stage because I think the situation is dreadfully serious.  We want to get at the truth, if we can at all.  This is a man who quite clearly, in a cold, intellectual way, using the Swiss watch type of brilliant mind he has, came to this conclusion many years ago.  As a serious and deeply-read Marxist, this was his conclusion about capitalism, and I share it; I have shared it for many years.  We find him faced with this dilemma, this disastrous situation, as a key Minister, as one of the two serious politicians in this Coalition, the other being, in my view, the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not an exaggeration.  They are in debt to the sum of £1,000 million.  They have spent money like a band of drunken sailors.  There <Col N="532" /> seems to be very little money left to spend.  There is this terrible conseqential unemployment growing worse. He comes in with this three-page document as his blueprint for prosperity. It is an extremely conservative right-wing document, basing the whole approach to the re-establishment of prosperity here, the movement towards full employment, on monopoly capitalism, private enterprise capitalism.  What has happened to Deputy Keating?  Is he saying this is in order to please Fine Gael?  Does he believe it?  Is he convinced now about the IDA's capacity to create full employment or to deal with the existing unemployment position?  Is he seriously intellectually convinced that this rubbish will solve our problems?  Or is it simply a rather insolvent and impertinent smokescreen in a kind of dialectical game in which he is involved at present with the Fine Gael Party in the Coalition? Is he trying to put them off the scent? Does he still believe there is only one solution to our social and economic problems and that that is a socialist solution?</P>
    <P>He is the Minister who spoke with remarkable eloquence and effect on the question of the Common Market. He forecast precisely this position: the disaster the EEC would mean for this country.  He foretold how foolish the advocates of membership of the Common Market would look, that is the Members of the Fine Gael Party and the Fianna Fáil Party.  In April, 1972, at col. 796, Vol. 260 of the Dáil Official Report, he said:</P>
    <P>Time will tell whether our industry will be able to withstand this free trade.  Personally, I am happy to be in the position of having been with others who oppose full membership of the Community and of having been one of those who sounded warning signals on this issue.  My regret is that the public memory is so short because I believe the leaders of political and economic thought who declare us to be a developed economy, capable of withstanding this kind of free trade, will look very foolish indeed in five years' time. <Col N="533" /> He was referring to the Taoiseach and his colleagues in the Government.  That was 1972.  He was a couple of years out.  We will forgive him that.  These are the colleagues he said are very naïve if they think that capitalism could be made to work and were very foolish for suggesting that Irish industry could survive if we joined the Common Market.</P>
    <P>What does Deputy Keating really believe?  Does he believe in these proposals he is putting before us?  Has he undergone a sea change?  Does he really believe in the IDA?  Does he really believe we can make good within the EEC and that industry can be made to survive in competition with the enormous cartels of central and western Europe&mdash;the Belgians, West Germans, the French?  Does he seriously believe that, having given us a list of the most cogent and compelling arguments against the likelihood of this being so?</P>
    <P>I do not know how many of the Senators have troubled to read this IDA report.  Did Senator Russell read the IDA report?  Phenomenal sums of money have been paid out through the IDA.  The 1970-74 Review of the Industrial Development Authority Ireland contained in their Annual Report, December, 1974, states:</P>
    <P>The IDA from the start established a planning framework for its activities and has continually refined this framework in the intervening years.</P>
    <P>The main features of this approach are as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  Identifying the economic and social needs both at national and regional level which industrial development must aim to meet and setting objectives and targets consistent with meeting these needs.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister seriously believe that the IDA have taken that particular bromide seriously since the State was formed and since their formation? Presumably, the economic and social needs of the community would have been to provide us with enough money for care of old people and so on.  Do they believe this?  This is the great conflict.  Is industry simply <Col N="534" /> an organisation to make profits for the few or is it to create enough wealth, as we socialists would say, for the community as a whole and ensure that they have a high standard of living?  This is what I should like the Minister to explain to the House.</P>
    <P>Have the IDA organised industry so that we could provide a high level of social care for old people, disabled people; a high standard of care in our health services; a high standard of care in relation to education; a high level of housing and supplying the housing needs of our people; provide for&mdash;this last letdown by the Government&mdash;equal pay for everyone, no kind of apartheid in relation to male and female within industry?  Have they done that?  Does the Minister seriously believe that the IDA can do that and will do it?  These are questions which should be asked. Is this pious aspiration worth the paper it is written on?  Has it any meaning or validity?  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>The IDA have been operating up to very recently within the situation in which an in-built platform of all parties&mdash;the two major parties at any rate&mdash;was continued emigration, approximately 50,000 emigrating every year.  This, of course, relieved the pressure on employment.  Therefore, the IDA were working towards a very restricted objective, they were really not applying themselves to the total unemployment or new employment needs in our community because of continuous emigration, which has now ended primarily on account of the great collapse of the British economy.  This creates a completely new situation for the IDA which, in the years December, 1969, to December, 1974, provided the country with a net growth of 5,500 new jobs. It is the one chink appearing in the otherwise wildly euphoric PRO job, which is this report.  This may appear disappointing, and it is.  It is clear, however, that without the substantial flow of jobs mainly deriving from IDA approved home and overseas projects there would have been a severe constriction of the manufacturing workforce in that period.</P>
    <P>Having unloaded heaven only knows how many people on the <Col N="535" /> emigrant market, 30,000, 40,000 or 50,000 a year at the time, they still did not provide the country with anything like full employment or the wealth to make any significant improvement in comparing it to other Western European countries in the social infrastructure in our society. After the years of activity of the IDA the Economic and Social Research Institute survey of industry in October showed that 71 per cent of firms&mdash;this is the wonderful industrial arm of the whole job-creating and money-making activity of the State&mdash; reported production at present to be the same or lower than in previous months.  Eighty per cent of the firms saw no improvement in production in the months ahead.  Ninety-three per cent of the firms saw no improvement in orders.  Ninety-four per cent of the firms saw no improvement in employment. Thirty-two per cent forecast an active fall, while only 6 per cent predicted a rise in employment.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to add to the load of woe which everyone has had to sustain in recent weeks and months, but surely these facts are a particularly grim foretaste of what will happen to Irish industry in the weeks and months ahead.  As a panacea for that disastrous kind of information from Irish industry we receive this silly little inconsequential three-page document from an important development Minister, the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;a Labour Minister, too.</P>
    <P>There is a peculiar finding in the psychiatry courts, <i>belle indifference</i>, which is found in people who are hysterical.  What happens is that they tell you terrifying things about themselves, that they will kill themselves, their mothers or fathers or whatever it may be, and at the same time they sit looking at you with this quiet smile on their faces.  Obviously, what they are telling you does not relate at all to what is actually happening.  One is really reminded of this kind of condition when one listens to the important Ministers such as Deputy Keating and the Taoiseach.  They seem to be totally remote as if there was a thick plate glass window between them and <Col N="536" /> reality.  Then we have the absurd proposals from all sides starting with the CII and the Federation of Manufacturers, with each of the Ministers saying that the real solution to the problem will be either not to give equal pay or to have a wage freeze, when there is an urgent need to try to adapt this particular body in a way that will make it work and make it do the job it certainly has not done up to the present time.</P>
    <P>One of the strangest things about our society over the last 50 years is that the infantile faith that private enterprise capitalism gives us freedom to operate as we wish and we will create enormous areas of prosperity.  I was interested to hear Senator Russell talking about the early days of Irish industries and the inevitable fact that they had to be secondary industries, subsidiaries of foreign industries and so on.  But that was not true.  The whole basis of Irish industry should have been the then raw material&mdash;not to speak of the present wonderful ones&mdash;of land, labour and capital, with the best climate in western Europe.  I remember reading in an emigration report of a New Zealander talking about the grasslands and saying that how wonderful they would be if they were properly developed.  Irish industry should have been based on agricultural food processing industries.  People are now talking about the cattle industry and the chemical industry that can be based on cattle and the raw materials for many other industries.  Instead of that cattle are all exported on the hoof.  We had the primary resources at that time and they were not used.  We exported them to other countries, as we now propose to do with our zinc, lead and copper, and then we bought back the wool and leather products.</P>
    <P>The whole process of Irish industry since the State was formed has been particularly and consistently inept.  The development of the motor car industry, an absurd industry for our society, is now one of the greatest devourers of one of the most expensive of our imports, oil and petrol, as well as absorbing an enormous hire purchase debt&mdash;a useless non-productive outlay of money.  I am not saying that they <Col N="537" /> should be closed down, but I am sorry for the men and women who work in these industries which are obviously now in the greatest jeopardy when one looks at the position in Great Britain in the Leyland and the Chrysler works. What is going to happen to ours here? There is a dreadful insecurity in working in those kinds of jobs.</P>
    <P>The IDA have done nothing significant to change these conditions or reorientate in any significant way this insistence on our acceptance of our role as primary producer in relation to agriculture and fishery, and then, of course, in relation to mining&mdash;zinc, lead, gas and oil.  This is where the Labour Party Minister, Deputy Keating, has failed so dismally and shamefully.  It could be said that his predecessors did not have the same access to the same capital or expert knowledge or technical information.  He has all of these things and for some inexplicable reason&mdash;I do not understand it and I would have liked, if he were here, to have asked him&mdash;he chooses to stay silent on the complete inanity of the proposals included in his three-page Bill and to rely on faith in the IDA to get us out of this very serious economic situation.</P>
    <P>As regards faith in private enterprise &mdash;and we had it here from Senator Russell&mdash;I do not understand these people because they protest their independence and insistence on their continued independence.  They do not want any Government interference.  We have heard that down through the years: &ldquo;We want to run our own businesses our own way and we will be better off that way&rdquo;.  Yet we see this £100 million from the EEC and this new £200 million.  Incidentally, the Minister refers to this small Bill asking for an increase in potential of £200 million, and yet they are lucky if they get £100 million from the new EEC loan, and he calls that a small Bill.  He does not bother to really deal with the implications of this new increase in the loan capacity.  This money will go to provide grants for industry; it will go to build factories for these industrialists, £10 million went on the last lot; it will go to re-equip and modernise machinery, presumably; it will go on <Col N="538" /> rescue activity; it will go for grants for product and processing development; they will be told to get on with modernising their methods, improving their output; it will go on joint venture programmes&mdash;the Irish taking some share in overseas ventures of one kind or another; it will go on establishing overseas industry; it will go on grants under the European Social Fund.  If this money is needed and if all this help is needed, where does private enterprise come in?  Surely this is public enterprise?  We are footing the bill and they take the profit.</P>
    <P>We always hear at budget time: &ldquo;We must have a reduction in taxes as an incentive to increasing production&rdquo;, while they ask for a wage standstill at the same time.  But I always understood that the reason a high level of profits was looked for was so that they could expand their industries, modernise industries, train management, train apprentices, train new staff, enter into negotiations for deals with other countries outside Ireland.  It seems to me that what we do is we provide this money to provide these free industries for these industrialists and that they do very little else except take great profits out of them.  For instance, the IDA paid £13 million approximately to Ferenka which, I understand, is in very serious financial difficulties at the present time.</P>
    <P>However, that is not my point.  We paid £13 million approximately to Ferenka and we own only 7 per cent of the shares.  Why in the name of heavens do we hand away all that money to a foreign-based company, which is not apparently very successful, and have no control whatever beyond this minority shareholding? We have another firm called Snia in Sligo into which we put £7 million in 20 per cent shares.  I understand that the total shareholding of the IDA is £1.2 million in a £100 million investment; those are approximate figures. Surely that is absurd, not to exercise control of the operation of these industries if we put so much public money into them.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Keating, knows as well as I do that the driving <Col N="539" /> force in private enterprise is simply the driving force of making profits. They have no social interest at all. They do not care what the old age pension is or how sick people get looked after or whether working class children get a good education beyond an education in a technical college in order to run their machines for them. You can see that now, the way they have stopped investing in Irish industry because the profits are falling. They do not care what happens to the country as long as they do not get hurt in the process.  Yet the Minister is implementing what are blatantly conservative Fine Gael policies here without any labour socialist content in them at all, in spite of the fact that at the most recent conference the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union and various other unions, moved a resolution that the greatest State control be asserted over the development of our natural resources in the process of industrialisation.  Many of these recommendations were by his own party, by his own union.  What is the <i>quid pro quo</i> of the Labour membership of the national Coalition.  What are we getting out of it&mdash;108,000 unemployed, 130,000, 150,000, inflation and a wage standstill and no equal pay for men and women?  That is all perfectly reasonable Fine Gael doctrine. I know that dogma.  This is common form over the years.  They have never believed in anything else, but this is not Labour Party policy and never was.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Fine Gael people for getting these things for themselves.  That is their business.  I am blaming the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is a member of the Labour Party, not only for the rubbish that he is talking now about the likelihood of our survival within the EEC and the likelihood of private enterprise capitalism solving our problems, but of the fact that he and his Labour Party colleagues are silent within the Fine Gael Coalition about these problems which we should now be talking about. They should all be giving the same kind of advice to the people that I am trying to do here and outside just at this very critical time in our history. <Col N="540" /> Nobody in his senses the most infantile illiterate, seriously believes that this Government are going to solve our social and economic problems.</P>
    <P>I said the other night that this is a completely new situation.  I referred the other night to the new development, the new OPEC-type development in relation to all the other raw materials of industry, manganese, copper, iron ore, phosphates, all these other very important materials.  You cannot run industry without them.  They are all going to escalate too in price because of various cartels which are being developed among these countries.  This is a totally new situation altogether. These old strategems, which never worked anyway even when things were easy to operate, will not solve our problems.  Nobody knows that better than the Minister, Deputy Keating, because, as I say, he is a man who has given a lot of thought to and worked very hard at this whole study of the operation of politics and the conflict between capitalism and socialism, labour.</P>
    <P>This Bill, this three-page document, makes no attempt whatever to introduce some measure of Government planning.  In this three-page document there is no reference whatever to a factor to which the Minister, Deputy Keating, used to refer so frequently when he was a Deputy and when I heard him on many occasions frequently ridicule the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, for his failure to see that one must have a strong public sector in any economy such as ours. In April, 1972, he said:</P>
    <P>In fact we are such a tiny and open economy that if you decide to run it without a strong public sector, if you decide to run it in a <i>laissez faire</i> way as we have been doing, there is little that you can do in regard to most of the significant factors.</P>
    <P>There was very much more on those lines, ridiculing the then Fianna Fáil Government's failure to do anything about their <i>laissez faire</i> policies.  Yet there is not a single word about the Government taking over any kind of control whatever of this seriously ailing economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> Again, on the same occasion, Deputy Keating, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, said:</P>
    <P>The sort of efforts at planning and at trying to direct and organise growth in our economy and to move towards fuller employment that were respectable in the early sixties now seem totally abondoned and we seem to be responding to the shortest of short-term situation and to have no strategy and no planning at all.</P>
    <P>Is it not fair comment to say that this document concerned with the future of employment in our country has no reference whatever to a strategy for planning, a strategy for the introduction of a strong public sector?</P>
    <P>What has happened to Deputy Keating?  This is the question that keeps coming back to me.  Is he on your side of the House or ours?  Has he sold out, or is he playing some kind of long-term trick and later on will he surface again as the serious socialist that I once knew him to be?  He defended the failure to build the new ships for Irish Shipping in Haulbowline by saying that the Japanese were so much more ready for this kind of thing than we were.  As far as shipbuilding is concerned, we should look after our own people in Cork before we consider anybody else.  One of the most important steps that one could take is to look to the next shipyard in Ireland which could benefit fellow-Irishmen. If Cork shipyard could not handle a job of this size, what about Belfast?  The Government does not seem to include that as part of the country at all.  These are the kind of worthwhile gesture which I feel would be of help in dealing with the great differences between us.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary in his reply could give us some explanation for the brevity of his own contribution and the contradiction between his suggestion that we should have a serious debate on the industrial structure of our society and his refusal to engage in that debate himself.  There are three main areas in which the Government should involve themselves. I have no trust whatever in the IDA, as presently constituted.  I do not believe <Col N="542" /> that they see their job as concerning itself with the total national interest in the broad sense I outlined earlier. The Government should, in considering the question of serious industrialisation, have the three main bases in mind.  The first is the base of agriculture, of exporting nothing that is not fully and finally processed.  We are a primary producer.  The suggestion made by Senator Russell that we have to have industries based on subsidiaries of foreign countries is completely false. We always could have been the primary producer in relation to agriculture and fishing.  We heard last night on the &ldquo;7 Days' &rdquo; programme that we fish 10 per cent of the potential of our seas around our coasts.  I remember well 25 years ago, when I raised this matter with Mr. Dillon, apparently the big impediment was the fact that there were 7,000 inshore fishermen.  That was a big lobby then, the preventative to developing a serious trawler fleet. Based on the trawler fleet could be the canning and tinned food industry.  We import enormous amounts of fish, exporting most of ours in a raw state. This is squandering our assets in the most irresponsible way and it has gone on.  The Minister is in office nearly three years.  He had time to do something about it.  He should have done something about it.  If he could not do anything about it because of the conservative intransigence of the Fine Gael Party, then he should resign.  He should not give them the respectability of the Labour component of the present Coalition.  He makes the case always that Labour did not get a majority and therefore cannot implement his policies, but neither did Fine Gael get a majority and yet we are implementing their policies.  Why do we have their policies and not Labour Party policies?  If it is a fact that he cannot get his policies implemented, then he should resign and let us go to the people and tell them that there can be no solution.  Surely that should be clear to everybody by now. How long have we to wait?  Until we have 200,000 unemployed?  Hunger, poverty and our already depressed standard of living&mdash;the lowest in Western Europe&mdash;is obviously going down very rapidly under this new proposal <Col N="543" /> for a wage freeze if the unions accept it.</P>
    <P>Then there is the third matter of raw materials to which the Minister made no reference at all.  The magnificent raw materials which I have been speaking about now for about five years&mdash;mining, zinc, lead, copper, too, but zinc and lead particularly&mdash;what an enormously wealthy country we are now.  There is no need at all for the béal bocht put on by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  For our size, for our population, we are probably the wealthiest country in the world now. Let the Minister refute that if he wants to.  Instead of using the raw materials or, in introducing this Bill, taking the opportunity of saying: &ldquo;We are going to use our raw materials and in order to do that we are going to build two smelters.  Our riches are so enormous apparently that we are going to need two smelters, not one. The downstream industries are a product of these smelters.  We would be like some of the middle eastern States then&rdquo;&mdash; instead of that the Parliamentary Secretary is haggling with the problem as all the successive Dublin Governments have done for the last 50 years.</P>
    <P>On the Labour component in the Coalition Government, but particularly on the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;as I say, Deputy Keating is an erudite politician&mdash;there is a very big responsibility.  If he allows this terrible development towards a massive attack on all fronts on the living standards of the workers which is involved in the wage freeze, plus the feeding into the economy of increased prices for posts and telegraphs, transport, oil, petrol and the various other proposals which they have in mind, it must lead to a very serious depression in the standard of living.  The CII report the other day showed that a man, with two children, unemployed for nine months has already dropped his living standards by 50 per cent.  That is a terrible drop in living standards. People on fixed incomes and pension rates dropped by 25 per cent.  People can be asked to make sacrifices in <Col N="544" /> time of war or in time of famine or great natural calamity, but this is so unnecessary.  Knowing that he is very conservative, I remember asking the Taoiseach&mdash;when he was, I think, Minister for Finance&mdash;why he allowed this situation to remain when we had this enormous amount of raw materials and great wealth, and asking if we were going to export it and then buy it back at prices fixed by some foreign cartel.</P>
    <P>I very much regret not having the opportunity of presenting the Minister with his own comments on industrial organisation in the past.  The Minister is now saying that unemployment will rise unless we have some sort of wage freeze and so on.</P>
    <P>And there are many detriments in inflation.  I am not suggesting that higher wages are not one, but what I am saying is that anyone who says it is the only one is simply a liar.</P>
    <P>That statement is in Volume 262, column 1871, of the Official Report of 13th July, 1972.  There are many more quotations of that kind, quite offensive quotations from Deputy Keating, who is not usually offensive, deriding the naïvete and innocence of the then Taoiseach for suggesting that the workers were the cause of the trouble.  Then it was not a wage freeze, but rather a wage rise which they did not think was high enough.  The situation now is much worse.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Taoiseach are looking for something quite different&mdash; a wage freeze and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is faced with what is undoubtedly a terribly serious situation. It is a situation which has developed progressively and which quite obviously has been influenced by the oil prices. One of the questions that has occurred to me is why we did not introduce oil rationing.  I know it sounds terrible but there is a war on&mdash;a war for people's living standards.  There should be petrol rationing as if in war time. It is such a costly raw material for such a useless exercise&mdash;driving around in motor cars.  Are all of these kind of devices, which could probably be had in a socialist-organised State, forbidden to the Minister for Industry and Commerce? <Col N="545" /> It may interest the House to know that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has produced this three-page document and this absured reliance on the IDA which have so failed the country up to now, while at the same time he is mandated by his own conscience to call for&mdash;the most recent one&mdash;&ldquo;complete public ownership, control and development of all our resources: the planning and development of downstream industries for metals and gas oil processing; all direct and indirect servicing of these industries to be undertaken by Irish personnel; demands that two production platforms for the State-owned gas field off Kinsale be built in Ireland.&rdquo;  Whose side is he on?  What is there in this National Coalition for the Labour Party and for those unfortunate people throughout the country who have the faith in us to vote and support us?</P>

      <P>I am not surprised that Members of the Opposition have used the opportunity provided by this Bill to make anti-Coalition speeches.  However, some remarks were made, particularly by Senator Dolan, to which I object.  I should like to put the record straight.  He made a sweeping, unfounded attack on union leadership. It was unwise in the present economic situation.  If it got publicity abroad it might create the impression in industrialists' minds that industrial relations in Ireland are chaotic.  In view of the efforts of the trade union movement to deal with wildcat strikes and unofficial stoppages, which none of us condone, to say they have not control of the situation is most dangerous.  We are not living in a Communist dictatorship.  When a situation like this arises we must deal with it in a humane manner by negotiation and not work the &ldquo;big stick&rdquo;, which has been tried here before by other administrations and which is never effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Browne deals with the problem in isolation, as if Ireland were a little island around which we had built a little wall and we were living in a situation in which we could develop completely on our own without help from any Industrial Development <Col N="546" /> Authority or help from abroad. He dealt with factories like Ferenka which are in production already in this country.  He pointed to the level of IDA investment in Ferenka.  He ignored the amount of employment that was generated&mdash;industrial employment in the Limerick area&mdash;and the tremendous wage packets being paid by Ferenka.  Any industrial development stimulated by the IDA has had a tremendous impact on rural areas.  Any investment the IDA can put into an area which will attract industrialists from any country, America or otherwise, must be welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>The Opposition say they do not wish to oppose this Bill and they talk about the economic crisis we are in. Surely the setting up of new industries and the resulting new jobs will help towards alleviating our present economic crisis.  New jobs are the responsibility of the IDA.  Their records from 1970-1974 of 38,500 projected jobs at full production is a fair indication of their progress to date.  This is something the IDA should be proud of.</P>
    <P>In a wider field the IDA are not confined to industrialisation in Ireland or assisting people to set up new industries, small or big.  They have a broader policy of development with industrialists from overseas.  I saw recently in America the hard work that the IDA team there have put into the task of encouraging foreign industrialists to come to Ireland.  In view of the worldwide economic crisis this task is now very difficult.  I was very impressed at the calibre of the IDA team, all Irish lads.  I was proud of them.  They are excellent ambassadors of Ireland in America.  With their help Ireland will become industrialised.</P>
    <P>Senator Dolan mentioned pollution and I agree with him that objectors can frighten away industrialists.  People have their constitutional right to object to what they believe will spoil the area they live in.  They did that in Tipperary. But they can intimidate industrialists intending to come to the country. Statements that the trade unions have lost control of their members, or the actions of people who go too far in their objections and do not accept recommendations <Col N="547" /> from the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, can create animosity in the minds of industrialists who are then dissuaded from coming here.  They go to Puerto Rico or elsewhere to set up their industries. I am pleased to say that, with the withdrawal of the objections in Tipperary and with the assistance of the IDA and the county-development team, my area will benefit from the new industry which is about to come on stream now as well as from the 1,000 new jobs in the construction of the new industry.  This will mean £100,000 a week in salaries and wages for workers in the construction and £50,000 a week in industrial wages when the factory is in production.  This is what the IDA means to the ordinary people in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I wish that Senator Browne would look at that aspect of it and not just the narrow, ideological aspect concerning what particular Ministers can or cannot do in economic situations.  What is important is what the IDA can do for us at this particular time.  This is not a blueprint for prosperity.  This is a Bill to enable the IDA to continue their excellent work.  Through their efforts I look forward to assistance for small industries in Ireland, assistance for any clean and pollution-free industry which will have the added advantage now of being able to export to the Common Market.  I would welcome at some future date, as has been promised in the speech by the Parliamentary Secretary, an opportunity for a full discussion on industrial development in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to welcome this Bill.  Senator Noel Browne has referred to the three-page document as a demand for payment of £200 million. I listened to him attentively and I heard a dissertion on his own unique ideology, his own unique form of socialism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important Bill because it ultimately deals with people and the lives of people.  It is being introduced to provide the means by which people will live in the not too distant future. The provision of jobs has direct economic consequences.  There are also <Col N="548" /> the social and educational aspects which are the broader issues involved. We often seem to overlook the broader aspects of employment and industry and the way they should be approached.</P>
    <P>Anybody conversant with current IDA thinking must welcome that body's new approach.  They have stated that their new initiative will be directed towards giving assistance to Irish industries where they find them viable and in a healthy state.  In the IDA <i>News Sheet</i> of December, 1975, they have outlined broadly the three main aspects of Irish industry at which they are looking at present:</P>
    <P>(1)  the spin-off opportunities to supply goods to the growing population of new industrial concerns creating manufacturing facilities in Ireland as well as in many Irish firms expanding their production capacities;</P>
    <P>(2)  the industrial construction sector where activity is currently pitched at a high level mainly because of the national industrial development programme;</P>
    <P>(3)  the general area of import substitution.</P>
    <P>They go on to give figures for the past ten years.  The figure in the case of import substitutions has been quadrupled.  This is a very welcome trend.</P>
    <P>The idea has been abroad for many years that in order to get a grant from the IDA you must speak with either a Continental or an American accent.  This of course is not so.  The position that has obtained heretofore is that there was a concentration of effort on promotions abroad to induce foreign industrialists to come here with foreign capital.  The consequence of that has been that we have a much higher proportion of IDA money involved in the assistance of foreign industrialists than is involved in the assistance of Irish industrialists. Economists tell us that this approach is the proper approach, and has been in the past in the financial climate then obtaining But now that we have <Col N="549" /> reached a certain stage in our development it is seen to be the correct approach to turn to our home industries and our Irish industrialists and see what can be done for those people who have viable projects on hand and who are prepared to look to the future with confidence and expand their projects <Col N="550" /> and, therefore, expand their exports.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18th December, 1975.</P>
