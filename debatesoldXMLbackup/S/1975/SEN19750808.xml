      <P>Recommendation No. 1 deals with the provisions of section 3 <Col N="1816" /> of the Bill relating to the deeming of domicile, if I may use that phrase. The general theory of domicile, as I understand it, is that a foreigner becomes domiciled in this country if he makes a definite decision to reside here permanently.  In the Bill there is a procedure by which a foreigner can be deemed to become domiciled in this country.  As the section stands he must be here 183 days, that is, at least half a year, immediately preceding the valuation for the purposes of this Bill, and 183 days in each of six or more of the nine years immediately prior to that year.  As this is very much an exception to the universal international rule about domicile, I feel it should be drawn a bit more tightly.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that under United Kingdom tax arrangements a person is only deemed to be domiciled there if he has been resident for a considerable period, something like 18 or 19 years.  The procedure here would have the effect that if the residence here was for the minimum laid down in the Bill, you could be resident for only three-and-a-half years out of the previous ten and still be deemed to be domiciled.  Of course, if you have been three-and-a-half years out of ten here you have been six-and-a-half years somewhere else.  Under such circumstances it seems unreasonable and potentially confusing for all concerned in different countries to establish domicile with such ease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the point as to how one is going to prove these facts, but assuming that these matters can be settled, I think there ought to be a somewhat narrower interpretation of this.  I have suggested in these two recommendations that instead of 183 days, which is half the year, the figure &ldquo;240&rdquo; which is eight months, two-thirds of the year should be inserted, and that instead of it being for six or more out of nine years immediately prior to the valuation year it should be eight out of eleven.  The general principle set out in the section has preserved the deeming of a foreigner to be domiciled and so on.  There would be a better chance then that the person concerned had really made a conscious decision to become domiciled here.  I <Col N="1817" /> would suggest to the Minister that he would be wise to provide for this whenever he comes to make changes in this legislation.  It is unreasonable to suggest that somebody can be domiciled here when he has only been here for three-and-a-half years out of ten.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to accept these recommendations. For income tax purposes, six months residence is the qualifying period both here and in Britain and indeed in most other countries with which Irish people have association. I am not aware of any eight-month period for tax purposes in any tax law in any country.  That in itself of course would not be sufficient reason for rejecting the suggestion if the suggestion had sufficient merit.  But there are obvious advantages when introducing a new tax in not complicating the matter and the problems with which people have to deal by introducing new concepts and new qualifying periods.  The Bill as drafted has the effect that the global wealth of a person who might loosely be described as a foreigner is not liable to wealth tax unless he has resided in the State for at least six months in a year ending on the valuation date and, in addition, he has resided here for six months in each of six years or more of the previous nine years.  I think, by any standards, that is a very generous provision. It is not unreasonable to treat any person who has spent more than half a year or seven out of ten years as being liable to the same wealth tax as an Irish person.  It would be a cause of irritation to Irish people if foreigners who have spent so much of their time here did not pay a comparable amount of wealth tax as an Irish person.  In no other European country would a foreigner be treated as favourably as he would be treated under our wealth tax code.  The general rule for wealth tax purposes is that an individual, who is resident for income tax purposes, and, accordingly liable on his world income, is also resident for wealth tax purposes and is liable accordingly, to pay wealth tax on his world assets.  Residence alone is the criterion for liability and no question of domicile as we understand <Col N="1818" /> it arises in other countries. Generally speaking, in Europe, six months' residence in the country qualifies for residence for this purpose and in some cases the period is less.</P>
      <P>Apart from these reasons, which show that there is no comparison between our favourable position here and the situation elsewhere, the suggested eight months is unacceptable for the reasons which I mentioned at the beginning, the complexities which it would generate. Foreigners who are liable to income tax and who reside here and in other countries keep their accounts and their diaries very carefully adjusted for these six-month periods, and it would be making life a little more difficult for them and for the Revenue Commissioners if we were to have different qualifying dates and periods for wealth tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Really there is not much between the Minister and myself. The Minister in paragraph (a) of subsection (5) has said that people who had resided in the country for these various figures as laid down in the paragraph would be liable to wealth tax.  I would not quarrel with that.  The problem I have been raising is that he has not merely said they would be liable for tax but that they should be deemed to be domiciled.  I am no expert on these matters of nationality and international law, but it seems to me that a basic proposition can be laid down with regard to domicile that you can only be domiciled in one place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If someone has been resident in this country for the equivalent of three-and-a-half or four years out of the past ten years he is deemed, for the purposes of this Bill, to be domiciled in Ireland.  Quite obviously he will remain domiciled in whatever country he comes from because he will have been six or six-and-a-half years back home.  As far as the law of that country is concerned he will remain domiciled and would, therefore, be domiciled in two places for tax purposes.  This seems to be a clear breach with all the normal tenets of international law with regard to such matters.  That is really <Col N="1819" /> the burden of my objection to this.</P>
    <P>It is not that I feel that it is in any way unjust, leaving aside the economic aspect of it which we have discussed from time to time, to tax foreigners who come here to live for these periods in Ireland.  I cannot see why the Minister could not have said : &ldquo;They shall be liable to wealth tax in this event&rdquo; and not have gone through this rigmarole of saying that they should be deemed to be domiciled, which does not make sense at all if they are still domiciled somewhere else.</P>
    <P>Recommendation, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 2 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 21, to delete &ldquo;three&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;two&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This deals with the reverse procedure where an Irishman goes abroad.  Under the Bill, in section 3, subsection (5), an Irishman who leaves to train or take a job abroad, perhaps in the EEC, is liable to wealth tax for three years after he has left Ireland, notwithstanding that he ceased to be domiciled in the State after that date, he shall be deemed to be domiciled in the State on the three valuation dates next following that valuation date after which he left.  Here again we have this deeming of being domiciled.  There is the almost <i>non sequitur</i> that notwithstanding that he ceased to be domiciled he shall, in fact, be deemed to be domiciled.</P>
      <P>This could, obviously, cause problems with people taking jobs abroad.  It could make more difficult the problem of recruiting people for these important positions abroad.  It could also involve them in problems with wealth taxes abroad.  As the Minister has pointed out in a number of cases you become liable to wealth tax after residence of six months and would, therefore, be liable to wealth tax in these countries, in so far as they have it.  You would certainly be liable to other taxes.  All the time for three valuation dates, for three years&mdash;four years is the maximum&mdash;he may be abroad, still be domiciled here and still be liable to wealth tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1820" /> Even though in due course there will be double wealth tax agreements and so on so that it will only have to be paid once, in the interim period there may not be.  Even if there are it involves the people concerned in all the paraphernalia of the wealth tax twice over and then they have to try to find out from whom they will get their wealth tax back.  It seems unnecessary. I am not proposing in this recommendation to abolish it altogether.  Obviously there must be some type of leeway.  You cannot have a man leaving on a Monday and ceasing to be liable for wealth tax on a Tuesday, but I suggest that two years is a reasonable compromise&mdash; three is too long&mdash;and would be quite sufficient as a safeguard to the Commissioners here and would be less actively discouraging for those who are being recruited for jobs abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Senator to observe that the question of residence has to be looked at as well as that of domicile.  Paragraph (5) (a) (ii) provides that:</P>
      <P>an individual who was domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State on a valuation date shall, notwithstanding that he ceased to be domiciled in the State after that date, be deemed to be domiciled in the State on the three valuation dates next following that valuation date.</P>
      <P>If a person claims to have abandoned his domicile here, but is still ordinarily resident on a valuation date, to say the least of it, some question would arise as to the <i>bone fides</i> of his claim that he had, in fact, abandoned his domicile here.  The mere absence of somebody from a country, even for a long period, is not in itself evidence of the abandonment of domicile.  I would not go so far as to say that anybody who wished to enjoy the great Irish blessing of bás in Éirinn had not abandoned domicile but it is pretty close to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person could be absent, as the Senator visualises, working on the staff of the EEC in Brussels or elsewhere but still maintain domicile in Ireland. The practice has been for a large number of people at that level to maintain <Col N="1821" /> their domicile here and not to effect any change in it.  The provision is essentially an anti-avoidance one to discourage the making of insincere claims and, in the circumstances, at least three valuation dates would be necessary to ensure that people would not abuse the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has pointed out&mdash;of course he is right&mdash; that a great many people who go abroad to take jobs in the EEC or elsewhere, particularly if they go abroad for extended training, maintain a domicile here.  Then this sub-paragraph does not apply.  It says:</P>
      <P>an individual who was domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State on a valuation date shall, notwithstanding that he ceased to be domiciled in the State after that date, be deemed to be domiciled in the State on the three valuation dates next following that valuation date.</P>
      <P>This implies that he ceased to be domiciled.  If he did not cease to be domiciled there would be no problem. So long as he remains domiciled here he can be 20 years abroad and still be liable to a wealth tax.  There is no difficulty at all.  The problem arises under the Minister's sub-paragraph where he has ceased to be domiciled. Therefore, he does not maintain a house here or anything of that kind. He has ceased to be domiciled but the Minister is deeming him to be domiciled for three successive valuation dates.  That is the problem that is raised here.  Under these circumstances, where he has cut himself off and has no domicile here, he is specifically recognised, I take it, by the Revenue Commissioners for this purpose to be no longer domiciled but there is this artificial deeming of domicile for three years.  I agree that there must be some leeway here.  Three is too much, and two would be sufficient.  I am not pressing the matter.</P>
      <P>Recommendation, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 16 to 19.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This recommendation relates to this <Col N="1822" /> curious, extraordinarily 19th century &mdash;one might almost say 18th century &mdash;provision in connection with husband and wives.  The Minister who, at an earlier stage on this Bill prided himself on how he was treating women in this Women's International Year, has provided in this part of subsection (2) that in a case where a wife owns all the property of the family&mdash;she is a business woman; the husband, on the other hand, has no property or assets at all; he may perhaps own the family dwelling-house but he is exempt as far as taxable assets are concerned, they belong to the wife&mdash;the husband can apply to have the tax apportioned as between them.  In other words, the tax is completely apportioned on the wife; she is the only one who has taxable assets and all would seem to be well. It is a sensible arrangement as the wife is the businesswoman; she knows where her assets are and is dealing with them every day of the week. Therefore, it is only reasonable that she should be the one liable for wealth tax.  But what do we find in the proviso at the end of subsection (2)?  It provides that the &ldquo;individual&rdquo;&mdash;that is the husband; the &ldquo;person&rdquo; is the wife; it is curious terminology but that is what it means&mdash;shall remain primarily accountable under section 14 for the payment of tax on the taxable wealth aggregated under this section notwithstanding any apportionment made under this subsection.</P>
    <P>It says specifically and categorically that even where the wife owns all the property, even where it has been apportioned between them so that she is assessed for her property and the husband has no property to be assessed on, nonetheless, in this International Women's Year, the husband is the person who is primarily accountable, under section 14, for this tax.  It also works in the reverse order, but one must think of the position of the wife where she has all the property, the husband has none, yet he is primarily accountable. It is difficult to understand the reasoning behind this provision; it is more 18th century than 19th century. <Col N="1823" /> I do not mind how many precedents there are in other taxation law; if there are, which I doubt, it is time they were dropped.  I think the Minister would like to be progressive in these matters and he should make up his mind that the time has come to do away with this kind of lunacy and in such a case as I have mentioned, allow the person who has the assets, is assessed for the tax, pays the tax to be primarily accountable also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This recommendation proposed by Senator Yeats is in line with a number of other recommendations to the section which were put down on Committee Stage. All the recommendations on Committee Stage and this recommendation were put down to emphasise the quality, both in regard to liability and every other aspect of tax payments, which should exist between the sexes in 1975.  There are even more glaring examples of inequality than this particular one elsewhere in the section but they were dealt with on Committee Stage.  Recommendation No. 4, put down by Senator Yeats, highlights the fact that in this section the Minister for Finance is not in tune with the rightly growing independence of women.  In this part of section 4 Fianna Fáil are seeking to avoid the situation where primary accountability still lies with the husband even though the wife may be the person who counts as regards business and assets.</P>
      <P>It seems a very strange section, apart from the fact that it is out of tune with modern thinking and that of this particular year in which we are seeking in every aspect of policy to emphasise the importance of women's rights; there is a worldwide drive in this direction in the current year and we should be part of it unless we are merely paying lip service to the principle rather than being realistic; we have seen the Government's failure to face up to the pay issue <i>vis-á-vis</i> women in the public service but I do not want to go into that matter here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1824" /> The drafting of these lines which Senator Yeats seeks to delete is symptomatic of an attitude of mind which has not caught up with the fact that, although the whole world is trying to achieve equalisation of rights between the sexes, although lip service is being paid by the Minister for Labour to women's rights in this particular year, not only in this legislation but right through legislation in general the fact has not percolated through to the Government that this equalisation must be brought about. This section is riddled with the feudal, old-fashioned attitudes which regard women as chattels.  Nowhere is this attitude seen more clearly than in this subsection which does not link accountability with responsibility and which this recommendation of Senator Yeats seeks to delete.  The wife is being discriminated against.</P>
    <P>The logical and correct thing to do would be to have an equation between responsibility and accountability.  The person primarily accountable should <i>ipso facto</i> be the person primarily responsible and <i>vice versa</i>.  Senator Yeats' recommendation is logical and I would ask the Minister to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must resist the efforts of the Fianna Fáil Party to break up marriages; it is anti-social and against the interests of married women as well as the husbands and children.  The Opposition must live in a very unreal world, or they choose to ignore the fact that property tends to be managed in family situations by the family for and on behalf of the family.</P>
      <P>There are some fortunate spouses where each individual spouse has substantial property in his and her own right, but they are not the norm.  Even where such cases exist it is necessary, for the purpose of the administration of the wealth tax, to aggregate the property in order to operate the marriage threshold of £100,000 exempted property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the rate the Opposition are going now I would expect them to ask that in respect of a married couple they should have exempted not merely one principal private residence but two principal private residences so that each <Col N="1825" /> could exercise an individual right to live apart from the other.  That might be interpreted as a breach of the marriage obligations but, apparently, the Opposition seem to visualise that spouses in 1975 and in future will want to live apart, to manage their affairs without consultation with one another. I would be sorry to think that that day had arrived.  I do not think it has.  We prefer to deal with the real situation rather than with imaginary ones which the Opposition are putting forward.</P>

      <P>It should not be necessary in most cases to rely upon a statutory right to make appropriate family arrangements.  They have been made by normal healthy partners to a marriage among themselves because of the natural love and affection which they bear for one another; they would want to share the burdens <Col N="1827" /> as well as the blessings.  But, nonetheless, we must provide in a Bill that where people require information in order to correctly arrange their affairs that the Revenue Commissioners would furnish that information to them.  The proposals in the Bill for apportionment are for the convenience of the parties themselves. I cannot accept that the Revenue Commissioners should be obliged to make several different applications and collections from different people in respect of a tax which is, as it were, a tax on family wealth.</P>

      <P>There would be no question of apportionment if the wife only is the owner of wealth because one does not apportion 100 per cent of nothing.  Apportionment presumes that both parties have individual taxable wealth.  There cannot be any apportionment in the case in which one party owns all the wealth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not follow the Minister down these curious family channels that are provided for in this Bill where husband and wife spend their time, apparently, claiming back tax that the other has paid.  It raises prospects of family life at which the mind boggles.  I will stick to the simple situation I raised in this recommendation, where the wife has all the property or, if the Minister prefers, nine-tenths of the property and the husband one-tenth.  If apportionment is made, according to what the Minister said yesterday, the Revenue Commissioners will, in fact, send assessments to the wife.  She is a businesswoman. She has the property and she will be the person they will deal with from the point of view of getting the tax from her and sending her the <Col N="1828" /> assessments.  This proviso, at the end of the subsection says that even in this case the husband, who may be a man of straw in economic terms, he either has no property or very little, is in the true principle of the hierarchy of the male, the man is the boss and so on and so forth, the person who is primarily accountable.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that family life is not an unending battle, at least it certainly ought not to be.  It is a team affair.  The family stand together.  In real life the property is aggregated. One does not have financial disputes of that kind going on inside the family, certainly one ought not to.  I accept that in the vast majority of cases it will probably be the husband who has all or most of the property and the vast majority of cases probably all concerned are perfectly happy that the husband should be the person who is primarily accountable, fills in all the forms, deals with the Revenue Commissioners and so on.</P>
      <P>In these cases, which after all are those provided for in this subsection in relation to apportionment and so on, where the wife is the businesswoman, has the property, it seems altogether outrageous that this ancient tradition should remain that even in this case the husband is the boss, the husband is primarily accountable, something that is laid down solemnly in this proviso. The Minister has made no effort at all to deal with the point I raised. He has raised all kinds of other issues, and he appalled me by his interpretation of his own subsection.  He should accept this principle; it is not a difficult one to follow.  It is perfectly obvious that in 95 per cent of the cases life will go on on the basis that the husband is the person who has the property and fills up the forms.  However, in this day and age to say that a wife who has all the property or a greater part of the property, is a businesswoman in her own right, and that she should be in the position to pay the tax, is assessed for the tax, but we still have this statement that the husband is primarily accountable.  It just does not make sense.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(g)  the right to receive any benefit or any annuity or periodic payment which, when added to any such right, if any, under any of the schemes, provisions or arrangements referred to in any of the subparagraphs of paragraph (e), other than subparagraph (iii), would yield an entitlement equivalent to the superannuation entitlement of a Civil Servant having a similar income and contribution record;</P>
      <P>(h)  the property of any scheme or arrangement assuring or supporting the right to receive any benefit, annuity or periodic payment referred to in paragraph (g).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is another effort to rectify a glaring omission in the provisions of section 7 (1) (e).  This paragraph provides exemptions for pensions and annuities and lists a number of situations in which a person in receipt of a pension or superannuation which will not be caught by wealth tax, and the property which funds it, will not be caught for wealth tax.  The omission is the self-employed man, the professional man or business man, who is not fortunate enough to be employed by a large firm having a pension scheme, or to be a civil servant, or to be employed by a semi-State body.  He is a person who possibly had it hard in the early part of his working life and was not able to make proper arrangements by way of an insurance premium.  Let us look at the man who has been in insecure employment for the best part of his working life, has experienced the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, but in spite of this managed to put aside some money for his retirement. When he reaches retirement age, he has this sum to give him an income, the equivalent of a pension. <Col N="1830" /> He does not qualify for exemption under this section.</P>
    <P>It is an injustice that provision has not been made for the man who has not had an easy life, who had not the protection of working for a large firm, knowing that at the end of his working life he would have a pension. He had to do everything the hard way, and put away the money for his retirement as I said.  This man is not provided for under this section.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that it would create administrative difficulties and, in certain circumstances, would be regarded as a loophole, something the Minister is reluctant to allow.  Nevertheless, that is not a good excuse for not making an attempt to provide for this situation.  Provision should be made for a scheme to allow for it.  I am not suggesting that if a man at a certain age said he had a sum of money which is to provide for his retirement that he should automatically be provided for.  He would have to make a case and give a few years' notice of his intention to retire and that he wanted to put aside certain sums for his retirement.  Naturally, it would have to be a genuine retirement situation.</P>
    <P>A case would have to be made and approved by the Revenue Commissioners. Some provision should be put in the Bill to enable the Commissioners to accept such case where they were satisfied that a legitimate case has been made.  This is not possible at the moment and it is a serious and glaring omission.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on what paragraph (e) provides but the omission I mentioned is very serious and should be rectified.  Facing the reality of the position here today, I realise that the Minister is not going to accept this recommendation but, nevertheless, I am asking him to bear it in mind and see whether it can be incorporated in the Act as soon as possible in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had this recommendation on Committee Stage and the Minister indicated that there was some merit in it.  I should like to repeat what Senator Ryan said.  It is a <Col N="1831" /> matter which should be borne in mind for future legislation.  It is a serious omission from the list of exemptions. The recommendation seeks no more than exemption from tax of an annuity, an insurance policy of a self-employed person, a person who has been in a hazardous position all his life, who has not been under the umbrella of a superannuation or pension scheme.  We seek to have such person exempted, with a reasonable ceiling&mdash; being entitled to the equivalent of a superannuation entitlement of a civil servant with a similar income and contribution record.  Whether on the income side or whether it is capitalised, the recommendation seeks that the person in that category should receive the same exemptions as those set out in subparagraph (e).  The subparagraph provides for various annuities and benefits being exempted from the provisions of this Bill.  It would appear to be a logical sequel to that desirable and proper list of exemptions that the category we are discussing should equally be exempted.  The ceiling is a reasonable one.  We ask for no more for these people than the exemptions being granted to a civil servant in similar circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exemption in the category of self-employed persons bears most heavily on the people who have taken risks in life, people who have not been in a sheltered occupation, people who, through their own energy and enterprise, have made money and have, at an early stage, looked after themselves by taking out an insurance policy or some form of annuity.  These people are outside any organised superannuation scheme and have sought to help themselves towards making provision for their retirement.  They are in the risk-bearing and risk-taking stratum of our society and should be given every incentive possible.  I am sure the Minister will agree with my statements.  The omission does not appear to be one of intent; it is just something that appears to have been overlooked.  Looking at it on the basis that it is merely an omission, it is one that I would ask the Minister to rectify in his next financial measure.  It is one that we feel strongly about.  I <Col N="1832" /> have had views and representations from outside on this matter.  It is one where the Minister could, in his own time, whenever the next financial legislation is prepared insert as an addition to the desirable exemptions which are set out in subparagraph (e).</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear Senator Eoin Ryan say that.  I must quote it in defence of the Government's attitude when I am explaining the difficulty of producing a suitable regulator.  Of course there are great problems in it.  This provision is open to the private individual to make his own arrangements regarding a pension, not dissimilar to what people may get in the public service.  We are <Col N="1833" /> not exempting the right to a future pension, because that is not taxable. You do not exempt something which is not taxable.  The only wealth that is being taxed is a right which is in possession&mdash;a present right.  The only exemption is the right to receive the benefit when one is qualified to receive it.  There is no discrimination against people simply because a public servant or somebody else may have the foresight to arrange an insurance policy.</P>

      <P>Perhaps people would be better advised to listen to their insurance adviser and to act upon advice which they receive.  People can feel that they are not in a position to pay an insurance premium but in the light of experience people tend to laugh in later years at the small size of the premium which they paid for insurance cover because inflation is inclined to erode the burden of the premium which has to be paid.</P>
      <P>I do not accuse Senators, and Senator Ryan in particular, of any sense of envy in moving this recommendation but there has been a great deal of unpleasant and abusive criticism of the public service by people who have put forward ideas similar to the one advanced in the recommendation here. It has been wrongly founded.  Every country that has a wealth tax has the exemptions which we are providing here for superannuation schemes.  No country allows an alternative exemption to somebody who has not got a superannuation scheme.  We live in a free society; people can make their own arrangements and there is no compulsion on anybody to hold his wealth in any particular form.  The law may encourage people to hold it in certain forms in the future which they might not have thought of in the past, but they are still free to make their own arrangements.  It would be wrong to provide&mdash;as the recommendation would provide&mdash;an additional benefit or exemption for certain people.  I do not think that would be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there is <Col N="1834" /> no intention to reflect on civil servants. They are merely mentioned in this recommendation as a comparison between the pension rights they have and the exemption they have for these, and others who are not lucky enough to be civil servants.  I do not suggest that civil servants are not very hard-working and worthy people but the important advantage they have is that they have a very good pension scheme.  This is something they can look forward to during their careers, that when they retire they will have this scheme.</P>
      <P>All that is asked here is that in the case of a person who is self-employed, who builds up a business or who works in a profession and has no provision of that kind built into his employment&mdash;perhaps he was not able early in life to take out some kind of insurance annuity scheme&mdash; if, towards the end of his life, he has managed to make some money and wants to provide himself with an income when he retires, it should be possible to do so.  It should be possible under the Bill to make a case for special schemes, in circumstances which would give such people a pension based on earnings over ten years, to equate that with civil servants.  The only reason civil servants are mentioned is to provide a yardstick of the extent of the exemption which should be provided.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not yet provided an adequate answer to the case which I have made and which several others have made.  I know he is not going to admit that this recommendation is fully justified but he has, in the past, defended himself on occasions in the Seanad and subsequently adopted recommendations made here&mdash;at least, adopted them to some extent.  I hope that on reflection he will agree that there is some merit in the recommendation I put forward and the case which others put forward and that at some time in the future he will modify the Bill so as to provide something on the lines which is provided for in this recommendation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(k) property in the State (other than agricultural property) which is used directly in the provision of employment in the State and stocks and shares of a trading company trading in the State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should say straight away that the substitute recommendation which had to be submitted for technical reasons was to ensure that it would be in order to exclude agricultural property. I should make it clear that as far as we are concerned we would believe agriculture ought to be, in practice, included in paragraph (k) that we seek to insert in this section.  The purpose of this recommendation is to add to the list of exempted assets property in the State which is used directly in the provision of employment in the State, and the stocks and shares of trading companies trading in the State.  This reiterates our belief that in the circumstances of this country it is madness to be taxing productive assets in this way.  The essential point in the Irish economy is the provision of employment.</P>
      <P>The late Seán Lemass was right when he said the success of any Government must be judged by the number of people they put to work.  We have at the moment more than 100,000 unemployed and the employment of thousands of others is threatened.  It is obvious that between now and next spring large numbers of additional workers will go on the employment register.  There is likely to be an addition of 20,000 to 30,000 between now and February next. Other workers are on short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the long term situation that the provision of employment in Ireland is not easy.  We had for about a century and a half very heavy emigration from Ireland.  This flow ceased only in the last five or six years.  We <Col N="1836" /> have the built-in difficulty of generating sufficient investment in this country to put all our people to work and get the kind of full employment that in normal times exists in other countries.</P>
    <P>These difficulties are inherent to a considerable extent in our geographical position, the fact that we are on the fringe of Europe, that communications are long, transport expensive, that we lack the great industrial centres of other countries which attract industry, that we lack capital and industrial expertise.  We are heavily dependent on outsiders to come here and set up employment-giving projects.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to generate employment in this country.  We have had a considerable amount of success, leaving aside the immediate problem of the present crisis but even in our best years the proportion of workers unemployed has been very high by international standards.</P>
    <P>For these reasons what the Government ought to be doing is taking every possible conceivable step first of all to help actively the provision of employment and secondly to do nothing in their governmental and financial and taxation policies to discourage in any way the provision of employment.  The trouble with this wealth tax is that it is not the rich it will hit.  In so far as it does hit the rich they will not lose very much.</P>
    <P>We have no objection to the taxation of people who have a great deal of money which they do not use for the provision of employment. The trouble is that this tax will hit the workers of Ireland because it will make it more difficult to provide employment for them.  That is the basic objection we must have to this Bill.  It is an objection which would be eliminated altogether if the Minister would accept the principle of this recommendation that the property in the State to be taxed is non-productive property and that the property used for the provision of employment should not have this additional taxation imposed on it.  Not only do manufacturers, millionaires, farmers <Col N="1837" /> and workers pay the highest direct taxation at every level of income in Europe and possibly in the world, but for those whom this Bill affects you have an addition to this very high rate of direct taxation.  Including income tax and wealth tax anybody who is affected by this Bill will come off vastly worse than those in other countries.</P>
    <P>The people who come under this recommendation are persons who provide employment.  We do not want to do anything which would make more difficult the provision of that employment. It is madness to be imposing taxation in this way on productive assets.  If the Minister would accept the principle laid down here, 99 per cent of the objection to this Bill would disappear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The paradox in the Minister's consistent refusal to have an amendment of this kind incorporated in this legislation is that at this time his colleague, the Minister with Labour, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, is in the course of implementing the employment premium grant scheme which was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in the past two weeks.  The purpose of that scheme is to provide 10,000 new jobs in the next 12 months.  This is a scheme which will involve payment from the Exchequer of £12 per head for each new employee brought into manufacturing industry up to a certain date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time as the Government brought in this legislation, which is defective in many ways, the Minister refuses to incorporate an exemption under the wealth tax legislation for the same purpose, the maintenance and growth of employment.  The purpose of this recommendation is to exclude from the wealth tax property that relates to the provision of employment and to stocks and shares of trading companies trading in this State.  The area the Minister for Labour is trying to help with a grant scheme is the area that the Minister refuses to exempt under this Bill.  I shall quote from the issue of 29th July, 1975 of the <i>Newsletter</i> of the <Col N="1838" /> Confederation of Irish Industry in which they very categorically state the nub of our present economic situation. I quote:</P>
    <P>Ireland depends primarily on the growth of manufacturing industry for the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>Nobody could disagree with that statement.  It is a statement of fact. The next sentence again is fact and I quote:</P>
    <P>Investment in manufacturing industry has always been and will remain far below requirement in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Private investment is an important source of funds for the development of industry</P>
    <P>Again they say and I quote:</P>
    <P>The introduction of a Wealth Tax on productive assets at this time is damaging because it reduces the attractiveness of industry for private investment; it forces the withdrawl of private funds from the manufacturing sector; and it discriminates against private Irish investment in favour of foreign company ownership.</P>
    <P>The Confederation therefore remains strongly opposed to the application of a Wealth Tax to private investment in manufacturing assets which are essential for the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>There is no question about it; the category we want exempted from wealth tax is the same category on which this nation at present depends totally if we are to get the economy moving again.  It is ironical, paradoxical, contradictory, call it what you like, to bring in a grant scheme on the one hand to stimulate the creation of employment and on the other hand to refuse to exempt that same category from the provisions of this tax.</P>
    <P>I have no objection, in principle, to a wealth tax.  I want that made loud, clear and plainly known.  A wealth tax that taxes dormant wealth, dead or non-productive wealth, assets that are of no value in this community in the sense of community or productive value and a wealth tax that relates to property that does not make any contribution <Col N="1839" /> to the national economy is fair enough.  There is no reason why there should not be a wealth tax on dormant property, on dead property, on assets that are making no national contribution, on assets that are solely stacked up for particular private gain without any relevance to the development of the economy or the improvement of the community.  I have no objection to wealth tax on foreign assets that may be owned by people here&mdash;assets and property held abroad by citizens of this country and making no contribution whatever to the national economy.  But I violently and strongly object to a wealth tax on productive assets in this country that at this moment are making a positive contribution to the economy and which represent the only hope the economy has at present in regard to getting out of the unemployment mire.  It is people who will be caught in the wealth tax net who are making a contribution of that order to the economy and have an investment of the order that it comes within the wealth tax.  People of that category are making a strong contribution at present to the economy.  They must be because if they are putting assets of the order to come within the ambit of the wealth tax to productive use and giving employment, they are making a real contribution.  That is the sort of contribution that should be encouraged, developed and stimulated further.  It is the most enterprising people who are making a contribution of the order to come within the wealth tax who <i>per se</i> because by reason of the fact that it comes within the wealth tax, the investment must be of a substantial enough nature to be giving substantial employment and to be a highly productive utilisation of the asset.</P>
    <P>It is the most enterprising, the most able, the most far seeing, the best investors, the best <i>entrepreneurs</i> in this country who will be caught by this provision, precisely the people on whom we depend to make the decisions that will lead to further expansion and greater employment, the very people on whose brains, and capacity to invest and on whose vision we <Col N="1840" /> depend to make decisions, to expand their production, to extend their factories, to expand their plant, to take the risks and decisions that are needed.  These are the only people who can pull us out of the recession.  It is on their decision-making we depend. It is the people who have the capacity to take a chance, invest, reinvest, expand in times of recession who say: &ldquo;We do not want to know about recession; we want to make plans now to pull out of recession; even though things may appear gloomy, we feel we can expand our plant, our factory space and we can build new factories; we can invest, reinvest and borrow to invest and reinvest; we have hope in this community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is the Minister at this stage, in regard to the individuals of whom I speak, going to say: &ldquo;Do not expand; we will put this regressive overhead on your business enterprise; we will put this regressive overhead on you as an individual for what you take from your business enterprise and on your investment in Irish stocks and shares; we will discourage you from going into Irish stocks and shares to a greater degree; we will discourage you from investing more in order to draw more from whatever enterprise you are interested in; we will discourage you by cutting a lump sum off your income in Irish industry and employment, an income probably obtained by such a person by reason of his or her investment in Irish industry or Irish stocks and shares?&rdquo;  Every one of us should be glad to have even a percentage of people of that category at present but they are the category who will be affected if this recommendation is not adopted.</P>
    <P>We are seeking in the recommendation that property in this State which is used directly in the provision of employment in the State and stocks and shares of a trading company trading in the State should be exempted from wealth tax.  We are seeking this for the reason given by the Confederation of Irish Industry, that the all-important need at present is to stimulate investment in Irish manufacturing industry, that it is in that precise area we will get the extra jobs in time of recession.  In fact, it is the <Col N="1841" /> only area where we can get extra jobs in our community at present but the people on whom we depend to give that extra employment are being penalised under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The energetic, enterprising people who are investing and will invest in Irish industry and particularly manufacturing industry are being put under this Bill in the same category as the immoral holders of accumulations of dead or dormant wealth in any and every form.  These people are being put in the same category as those who are living here and have accumulations of wealth gathered in the Bahamas, the Channel Islands or anywhere else.  The people who are investing in Irish industry, giving employment to Irishmen and women, are being put in the same position as far as wealth tax is concerned as those who have escaped with their package to a funk hole in the Bahamas or Channel Islands.  We should be making dynamic efforts to encourage people to invest here.  What we are doing is proposing to penalise them.</P>
    <P>I am not objecting to the wealth tax principle as such, but it is wrong to put people who invest here into the same position as the accumulators of idle wealth who make no contribution to the Irish economy.  The Minister is very obtuse if he does not see the logic in this recommendation.  Not alone should taxation bring in revenue, not alone should there be a socially valid redistribution of wealth, but taxation must also be used as an economic regulator.  It should be used as a mechanism for stimulating the economy, a mechanism for the creation of more wealth to give more employment.  The first two objectives should not be allowed impinge on the third.  The objective of just collecting for the revenue as such and the objective of the redistribution of wealth for social purposes should not in any way frustrate the basic objective of all, which is to create more investment and more wealth and make the cake bigger so that everyone gets bigger shares.  The most important element of all is the proper regulation of this tax, and its operation.  As the Bill stands, from the economic <Col N="1842" /> point of view it will discourage and deter the people we require from the point of view of investment and reinvestment in Ireland.  It is deflationary in the economic sense.  It is discouraging people who would make the investment decisions to expand and give more employment if they got the required encouragement.  By not agreeing to this recommendation the Minister is, in effect, saying to these people that he regards them in the same category as the idle and immoral accumulators of wealth.  We are telling the enterprising people in the community that that is the situation under an Irish Minister for Finance. A Minister for Finance should be exempting these people.  These are the people whom we depend on to put the economy on its feet.  They are being put in the same category as the idle accumulators of wealth.  Nothing is being offered to the people who count in the community.  The Confederation of Irish Industry in a cold, calm editorial on 29th July put this matter in perspective.</P>

      <P>I support this recommendation. In my constituency there has been an unemployment problem for many years but we were very fortunate in attracting some industries to the area.  We are very grateful to the people who established those industries.  Cavan County Council, in their wisdom, decided they would give an exemption from rates for three years to people who introduced industries into the county.  By law they were allowed seven years' remission and we extended that to ten years because we knew employment was needed.  That was away back in the good years.  We are now in 1975 with 103,000 unemployed. There is a very serious situation. When many people are unemployed discontent reigns.  All they have to look forward to is dole queues and pay-related benefits.  They do not want these hand-outs.  They would much prefer to be gainfully employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This recommendation is a very sensible one.  Both Senator Yeats and Senator Lenihan have made strong cases for it.  The Confederation of Irish Industry's pronouncement on <Col N="1843" /> 29th July is one that should be studied closely and the Minister and the Government should study it carefully.</P>
    <P>There would not be many people in my county affected by wealth tax legislation.  Perhaps, with the continuing inflation, we may soon be in the net.  I certainly like to see people paying their fair share of taxation.  At the moment we have our hand in the lion's mouth.  We are, on the one hand, encouraging industrialists to come here by issuing grants to them and, on the other, we are imposing a tax on them.  One of the methods used to encourage investors was to exempt from taxation people who were using their wealth to provide productive employment.  There is a vast difference between them and people who have wealth accumulated in foreign banks where it is of no benefit to the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>We now need to try to instil some confidence into the people.  We have now reached the month of August and the dole queues are as long as ever.  The test of any successful Government is the number of people employed.  We see the number of unemployed increasing every day.  That should bring home to the people whether or not Fianna Fáil were too long in office.  Those who were clamouring for a change then have got their answer now.  It is a sad answer, unfortunately, for the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister is trying now to tax these industrialists who have provided employment for many people. Many industries are based on native material.  That is what we should encourage.  It is time enough to tax people when they are well established. The Government would gain if they put people into employment because they would save on the pay-related benefits and in many other areas. They would also gain money from those who would be brought into the income tax net.  These are things that should be considered.  The Minister thinks he will gain from this Bill but he will lose money because people will not be employed and they will have to be paid pay-related benefits and various types of social benefits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1844" /> The majority of the members of the Government never believed in industrial expansion.  We in Fianna Fáil have been saying for years that we would like to see industries provided in every area in the country, in every town and village, if possible.  We established the Shannon Industrial Estate and various other industries with that object in view.</P>
    <P>At a time when we should be expanding in that direction the Minister brings in this Wealth Tax Bill and he will not accept this recommendation. Thus he will frighten and scare off people who are anxious to invest here.  We send Industrial Development Authority representatives and people like that overseas.  They do not go there on holidays.  They go for the sole purpose of trying to meet wealthy people, people with capital who would be willing to come here and avail of the facilities we have here and set up an industry, an industry which would make money for themselves and their shareholders&mdash;we have to be realistic about that&mdash;an industry which would provide employment for our people rather than asking them to go to America or elsewhere where these millionaires live and where they have the industries.  We are not inviting them here to exploit our workers. We have good efficient unions here who have always dealt with those problems.  Many of the industrialists who have come here are happy to be here.  They find the Irish workers equal to the task.  These things should weigh heavily with the Minister and with the Government.  If Fine Gael are not too fond of industrial expansion, the Labour elements in the Government should be directing their attention to that sphere.</P>

The Minister is making a hames of the task of creating employment for our people.  The <Col N="1845" /> dole queues are there to prove it.  We should be doing our best to encourage our own people who have money to put it into productive use.</P>
      <P>To encourage our own people who have money to sneak that money into foreign banks and, on the other hand, to discourage foreigners from coming in here is a totally irresponsible attitude because of the conditions in which we find ourselves today.  There are many industrialists who accumulated money through hard work.  These people have to be admired.  They had a good national outlook.  They had faith in our own people and tried to do something for them.</P>
      <P>The Federation of Employers' statement referred to by Senator Lenihan should be read very closely.  Without people with wealth, we cannot have factories.  The State cannot provide all the employment.  Whether we like it or not, we are in the unenviable position of having 103,000 people unemployed. The Government should be crawling out to the capitals of Europe, as they have done already, trying to get sheiks, or Arabs, or anybody else, to invest here and provide employment for our people.  That is the way to do it.  The Minister for Finance is scrounging around looking for a few pounds from them, by taxing them before they even arrive here.  That is not the way to encourage them.  Our primary objective is to get these 103,000 people off the dole queues and into employment.  The Minister should realise that.  He knows the figure is increasing from day to day. He should encourage everybody with money to invest here and set up factories.  The Minister should accept this recommendation.</P>

      <P>People who read this recommendation will say to themselves: &ldquo;Now we know what Fianna Fáil think of agriculture.&rdquo;  Senator Lenihan talked about dormant and dead industries and dead investments. I am glad Senator Yeats believes agriculture is not a dormant industry. Reading this recommendation one would think Senators on the other side of the House think agriculture is a dormant industry.  I am glad Senator Yeats explained himself.  We believe agriculture is the greatest employer in this country.  More people are employed in agriculture than in any other industry.  We also believe that there is greater productivity from the agricultural industry than from any other industry.  Agriculture is the greatest employer and the greatest industry for productive purposes.</P>
      <P>Senator Yeats has helped clear my mind in that he contends that agricultural property should be included in this recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard much talk of dormant wealth here.  I do not believe we have dormant wealth and, if we have, it is so small as to be negligible.  Irish people are not fools.  They will invest, and have invested, their wealth in this country.  We have heard statements to the effect that wealth has been moving out of the country since this Bill was introduced.  Wealth has not moved out and there is no proof that it has.  There is more wealth here <Col N="1847" /> now than before the introduction of this Bill.  In the years to come there will be even more wealth here.  This Wealth Tax Bill will not prevent people investing because its provisions relate to such a small number.  Having read the statements made by the Minister for Finance, people know now that there is no danger to our ordinary men and women investing in companies here.</P>

They can only stand or fall on the basis that the non-inclusion of this would be an impediment to people investing in Ireland, particularly our own people, as has been stressed by the opposite side.  In recent days the IDA have made announcements of the number of jobs that have been created. This is an indication of confidence in the Government and that non-inclusion of this section would not constitute any impediment to people making investments here.  This type of exemption is not included in many Wealth Tax Bills in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the plea of Senator Yeats that agriculture is exempted from the benefit he seeks to confer for purely technical reasons. The fact is that Fianna Fáil have tabled a recommendation which seeks to grant total exemption from wealth tax for all productive assets in Ireland with the exception of agricultural <Col N="1848" /> property.  I know that Senator Lenihan has abandoned all hope of obtaining support again in rural Ireland and has transferred his political ambitions to the urban belt of Dublin.  But really he does not have to trample on his erstwhile supporters in the midlands by tabling a recommendation which singles out agricultural property for wealth tax and exempts all other forms of productive assets.  I am appalled that a Senator, with the backing of his party, could table a recommendation that is so selective.</P>
      <P>Agricultural property is treated by the Government in an especially favourable way because of our realisation that the return on investment in agriculture is low and because of the great national need to promote agricultural expansion and efficiency.</P>
      <P>The whole approach of Fianna Fáil on this Bill has been to get more and more exemptions, but the least worthy arguments have been advanced in relation to this recommendation.  There have been suggestions that the Government's wealth tax will discourage investment from abroad.  That is unmitigated rubbish.  If anybody took care to study the nature of investment in manufacturing industry from abroad they would know that it has all come in in the form of companies. Why?  Because the exemption which is enjoyed from income tax liability on goods manufactured for export is available only to companies, and those companies are still coming. Such diminution as there has been in the rate of investment here is nothing compared with the fall-off in industrial investment in the western world.  Notwithstanding the fact that our industries, in many sectors, are working below capacity industrial investment is still proceeding.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties which exist in acquiring funds to match the amount of foreign investment coming here the Government, in 1975, are providing more capital for industrial development than was ever provided before.  We have to do it because investors from abroad are coming in; we have commitments to them, we are honouring them and will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1849" /> I have pointed out until I am tired of pointing out that we are the only country with a wealth tax which gives favourable treatment to productive assets.  No other country gives any concession to productive assets.  Yet we are told by CII and Fianna Fáil that there has been no encouragement for investment in industry. There is every encouragement; if a man wants to get the benefit of the lower rate of tax; if he wants to be paying tax at 0.8 per cent instead of at 1 per cent then he will put his assets into productive forms to provide employment here.  The Confederation of Irish Industry pleaded for provisions in the wealth tax that would ensure that foreign companies would not fall off in their investment in Ireland.  They did not have to make that plea to us because we were convinced of the necessity to encourage foreign investment in Ireland.  Now, having done it, they fault us for having done so.  The CII should make up their minds where they stand, should take the trouble to read the Wealth Tax Bill instead of listening to the political, partisan comments of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>The recommendation has no merit. It runs against the whole spirit of the Bill and its intention is quite clear&mdash; to prevent Ireland having a wealth tax at all.  I will conclude by quoting from the Green Paper in Britain on their proposed wealth tax.  It says at paragraph 35:</P>
    <P>In the Government's view it would be wrong to exempt business assets or farms from the tax or to calculate liabilities on such assets on specially favourable terms.  The wealth tax would lose much of its desired social effect if a substantial proportion of those who are among the wealthiest in the country were not to come within its scope.  Moreover it is a matter for argument whether the sale of a business or of part of a business would lead to a loss of efficiency from a national point of view or the opposite.</P>

We are the only country to have done this.  Therefore, there is no need for this recommendation which is designed obviously to frustrate the wealth tax which Fianna Fáil oppose tooth and nail and have been doing so ever since the White Paper was published in February, 1974.</P>

Our neighbours in Britain are a classic example of a Government who are flying in the face of rational economic thinking, and we know the appalling results which have ensued.  Unfortunately, these results are making our own position a great deal more difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must mention the question of agriculture.  As the Minister will be aware&mdash;and as I hope Senator Butler will become aware&mdash;Senator Lenihan's recommendation No. 7, which is on the main yellow sheet does mention agriculture; indeed, agriculture is included in that recommendation. The Minister and the House will appreciate that these recommendations <Col N="1851" /> had to be prepared with great urgency and it was not possible to give them the kind of consideration which would normally be given to recommendations.  This proved to be out of order, as we were informed by the officials just as the meeting commenced.  They pointed out that the amendment on the white sheet would be in order; therefore, we decided to go ahead with this strictly on the basis that it was needed in this form to enable it to be discussed today.  Our real thinking on this question will be found in recommendation No. 7 on the yellow sheet, which includes the question of agriculture. I will leave the matter at that. Nobody is in a position to say that our attitude was to ignore agriculture. That is not so, and I want to make that absolutely clear.  We believe that agriculture is the most important productive industry in the country and that, along with the other industries mentioned in the recommendation, it should be excluded from the effects of the Bill.</P>

I must seek the leave of the House to withdraw it, and that leave has not yet been given, so it is still before the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister looks upon the CII apparently as some kind of political hacks to whom he need pay no attention. This is extraordinary language the like of which I have never heard from a person in a principal position in Government.  The Minister for Finance is the second most important member of the Government after the Taoiseach; he has the principal control over the economy.  To go round suggesting that one ought to ignore the views of the Confederation of Irish Industry, on the grounds, apparently, that they are political hacks, is extraordinary. However I propose to quote&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that obviously they had been listening to the wrong people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance might give sufficient credit to the principal industrial confederation in this country for knowing their own business, that they do not issue statements on the basis of what they hear from other people, politicians or otherwise. <Col N="1853" /> I shall quote from their statement of March 4th last:</P>
      <P>The Confederation finds it difficult to understand the introduction of these proposals at a time when unemployment is at almost record levels historically and investment growth needs to be greatly accelerated. The proposed legislation would have three major undesirable effects.  It would dissipate the amount of money invested in assets which are used in the provision of employment.  It would directly discriminate against Irish family ownership of such assets in favour of foreign company ownership, and it would discourage private foreign investment in Ireland.  The Government had said that they would give particular consideration to reliefs for productive investment.  The reliefs proposed in the Bill are completely inadequate.  Priority should be given to the maintenance of employment through investment in productive assets.  The Confederation therefore repeats its earlier recommendation that all assets used in the provision of employment be exempted from the application of the proposed wealth tax.</P>
      <P>These are the views the Minister describes as rubbish.  These views do not come from Fianna Fáil; they come from people who are directly concerned, through their members, in the provision of employment, jobs and investment here.  They say that the Bill should be withdrawn on the ground that it will damage these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem really is in all these discussions of the Bill that the Minister has quoted other countries.  He has quoted socialist Governments in England.  He has quoted all kinds of political reasons for bringing in this legislation.  He has even contradicted his own White Paper by suggesting that it might lead to the redistribution of assets here, though his White Paper said that it would not.  He has never&mdash;I asked him to at an earlier stage of this Bill&mdash;once produced one single simple coherent economic reason for bringing in this tax at this <Col N="1854" /> stage.  He cannot.  There is no single, simple, economic reason for bringing in this legislation at this stage.  The reasons, such as they are, may be political&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but there are no economic reasons.  There are no economic reasons in favour of it and there are a great many economic reasons against it.  These people in the Confederation of Irish Industry, not Fianna Fáil, have put some of these reasons.</P>
    <P>For the Minister to say that this recommendation is mere rubbish is simply not good enough.  You do not answer arguments by saying that they are rubbish.  You answer arguments by counter arguments.  You answer arguments by saying how in the Minister's view, if he really thinks it, this Bill will encourage investment, will put people into jobs, will reduce inflation. He knows it will not.  He knows that, in so far as it has any effect, it will be discouraging rather than encouraging.  It will not increase confidence.  It will reduce it.  It will not create jobs.  If it has any effect it will be to increase the number of jobless.</P>
    <P>These are the plain facts of the matter.  Everybody in the country can see it apparently except the Minister. The Confederation of Irish Industry, the Federated Union of Employers, the Irish Farmers Association, the ICMSA, chambers of commerce all over the country, economists, financial experts of all kinds, all the advice to the Minister is against these proposals.  All this advice he discards as rubbish.  All I can say is that the Minister is wrong. One hopes that the damage will not be too great.  I will withdraw this recommendation.</P>
    <P>Recommendation, by leave withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 9, after &ldquo;subsection (1),&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;when required by the Commissioners,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say, straight away that, like the other recommendations, this was drafted in very much of a hurry.  I would like to explain to the Minister <Col N="1855" /> precisely why I put it down.  Under the provisions of subsection (2) of section 7 all these exempted items, houses, normal contents of a house, bloodstock, livestock and so on must be returned for wealth tax purposes exactly as if they were not exempt. Had I more time to draft this recommendation in a more detailed form I would have accepted, of course, that there are many things such as for example, superannuation benefits, emoluments of this kind, perhaps bloodstock and livestock, where it is clear they ought to be returned in the fashion suggested by subsection (2).  My main reason for putting down this recommendation is to make the point that, at least as regards dwelling-house and the normal contents of a dwelling-house it ought not to be expected of a taxpayer to have to give a detailed valuation of these to the Revenue Commissioners except in cases where they ask for it.</P>
    <P>The problem is that under a strict reading of this subsection&mdash;of course, one has to read Acts of Parliament strictly&mdash;anyone who makes a return for wealth tax purposes ought to get a valuation of the value of his house, a valuation of the contents, list the contents and so on and send them in to the Revenue Commissioners. This, clearly, would place a very great burden of time and considerable expense on the people concerned. It would be a terrible nuisance to the Revenue Commissioners to have endless stuff coming into them which is of no value because, whether a house is worth £20,000, £50,000 or £200,000 is irrelevant.  So long as it is a principal private residence it is exempt.  I hope that the Revenue Commissioners will adopt the practice that they will not require details beyond the fact that the assessable person had one principal dwelling-house and normal contents. I hope they will accept this and then if they have any reason to believe that the so-called normal contents included vast sums in jewellery, very valuable paintings or investments of that kind, that he might be collecting as investments <Col N="1856" /> and not as normal contents, then they can come back and say: &ldquo;Will you please list these and give us a valuation.&rdquo; Of course, in extremity, they have the power to come along and look at them.  I suggest that this ought to be the practice adopted, in spite of the wording of the subsection, so that as a matter of course the assessable person would simply, as I say, write in and say; &ldquo;I have one house with normal contents.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The recommendation is concerned with subsection (2) which requires that:</P>
      <P>such particulars and information in relation to the property referred to in that subsection shall be furnished to the Commissioners as would be required if such property formed part of the taxable wealth of the assessable person.</P>
      <P>The subsection which deals with information relevant to the taxable wealth of an assessable person is subsection (6) of section 14.  This latter section states that such information shall be disclosed to the Commissioners, as they may require in writing, for the ascertainment of liability to or the collection of tax.  The two subsections use respectively the words &ldquo;required&rdquo; and &ldquo;require&rdquo;.  The requirement is in writing and, therefore, there is no necessity for the recommendation. The requirements must be made in writing.</P>

      <P>I would be happy to think that the Minister was right.  I refer him to subsection (1) of section 15 which states:</P>
      <P>a person who is primarily accountable for the payment of the tax by virtue of section 14 (1) shall within three months after the valuation date deliver to the Commissioners on a form provided by them a return of all the property comprised in the taxable wealth of the assessable person, stating the market value thereof on that date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  You first of all have to make a return of all the property, stating the market value thereof on that date.  Then, later on, if you are required in writing, you have to give a statement verifying such particulars together with such evidence, statements, documents and so forth, as they might require.  That is merely the documentary evidence, but you have to start off, at least in theory, by valuing your house, the contents and so on, and delivering this to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Then, if they want further information, they come back at you, but your initial obligation under section 15 (1) would definitely appear to be that you have got to get your house valued and the contents valued.  I know you could write in and say: &ldquo;I have one house worth £X and contents worth £X&rdquo; but that will not be any good to anybody.  Anyone can do that.  If there is to be any validity in this process at all you should get them valued.  If people merely write down whatever figure appeals to them then there is no point to it at all.  It would be much better to adopt the practice I suggest where you say: &ldquo;I have one house with contents&rdquo; and let the commissioners come back if they want more information.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have a great deal of information about property and they would not, in many cases, require separate valuations to be done.  The ordinary stamping branch where deeds are stamped has a system of collecting information.  The law requires that when a transaction takes place the vendor must furnish figures to the Revenue Commissioners relating to it. That means that the Valuation Office has perhaps the most up-to-date index in relation to legal persons and property as well as land in the country. They would not require a detailed valuation.  It is only when a valuation would be put in which seemed to be extraordinary, having regard to the general pattern of valuation in a particular location for a certain type of property, then additional information would be sought to justify a valuation which appeared to be out of <Col N="1858" /> line.  We would not expect that there would be many cases of this kind.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 13, lines 56 and 57, to delete &ldquo;and which is situated within one mile of an urban area&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is really a case on which there should not be any basic disagreement between the Minister and ourselves. We feel that the proposals in the Bill are unnecessary complications.  The Minister pointed out that it is in ease of the farmer concerned that where a farmer's land has high potential for development so that it thereby becomes more valuable if put on the open market&mdash;that instead of raising the market value for tax purposes by four or five times, which could easily happen, the maximum increase sought by the Revenue Commissioners will be only 25 per cent.  But there is the limiting factor that it only applies where the land is within one mile of an urban area.  There is a rather odd definition of an urban area which says it includes a town or village which <Col N="1859" /> are concepts that do not exist in law.</P>
    <P>It would be simpler to forget about the one-mile provision.  If a man's land is within a mile of an urban area, he gets this concession.  If he is a mile-and-a-half away he does not and, at least in theory, the Revenue Commissioners could increase his valuation by 400 per cent, which is obviously not what the Minister wants. It is not correct to say that land will only have high development potential if it is within a short distance of an urban area.  Frequently, housing estates are built quite far out&mdash;particularly around the Dublin area.  They could be built in an area where there was no urban development at the moment and the land concerned would have a high potential value once it became clear that development would take place within five years.  In addition, the Minister's concession to farmers does not relate merely to house building.  It relates also to the building of factories.</P>
    <P>Frequently, a factory could be built away out in the country.  It would be known in advance that this was about to happen and consequently land in that area would increase considerably in value.  In everyone's interest, including the easing of administration problems, the Minister should consider as soon as reasonably possible abolishing the provision regarding one mile.  It involves endless calculations such as the location of the urban area, what constitutes an urban area, what distances are involved.  There could be endless complications, and they are quite unnecessary, because all the Minister wants to do is to ensure that where the commissioners are satisfied that a particular farm property has high development potential they will raise the valuation by 25 per cent.  It should not cause unnecessary problems once the question of what constitutes an urban area is eliminated.  Land could be situated close to an airport and have a high potential for building houses or factories.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This appears to be an eminently sensible recommendation. <Col N="1860" /> Again, it is in ease of the Revenue Commissioners and it would facilitate easier administration.  The limitation of one mile will lead to all sorts of anomalies.  There is nothing sacrosanct about one mile from an urban area when urban area is defined further on in the section as meaning a country or other borough, an urban district, a town or a village. When a definition urban area goes down to including a crossroads with a pub at the corner it enters the area of the ridiculous.  We know what the Minister wants to do but I think he is merely circumscribing the Revenue Commissioners and going into very dangerous terrain as far as litigation is concerned by quoting one mile.  It is not defined as a mile from any particular point.  It could be a mile from a village which might consist of a pub on a corner or at a crossroads. Much of this section borders on the ridiculous.  In the interests of good administration I would suggest it would be a far cleaner and clearer situation merely to have a person prove to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that the land had a high development potential.  That would be a question of fact and if anybody wished to dispute the commissioners' decision the matter could be assessed by a court.</P>
      <P>The variations of this and the many circumstances under which it can happen are innumerable and surely it is an area of definition that should be left open for examination on the facts of a particular situation.  There is no legal definition of &ldquo;town&rdquo; and certainly no legal definition of &ldquo;village&rdquo;. The definition in the Bill is vague and unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>I can see the merits of having an enhanced market value placed on land with high development potential.  That is perfectly legitimate, but the valuation should depend on the facts of each individual situation.</P>

      <P>I would not disagree with many things which have been aired in relation to this recommendation but I would prefer to make a decision on the matter in the light of experience.  When we have a year or <Col N="1861" /> two of the operation of the tax and of people's use or non-use of the particular option, then we might look at it again.  We ought to express it in metric measurement and not in miles and that is a reform we can bring in whenever we are amending the Bill. We have gone some way to meet the points raised by introducing the word &ldquo;village&rdquo;.  Senator Lenihan is right in saying that is not defined.  &ldquo;Town&rdquo; is well defined in the Interpretations Act, but &ldquo;village&rdquo; is not.  &ldquo;Village&rdquo; has a broad meaning in Ireland, and its understanding can vary from area to area.  In some locations scattered houses in a townland might be called a village, whereas in other parts of the country they must all be joining one another.</P>

      <P>That tends to attract people.  It is an option which is available to a taxpayer.  Like any other exemptions or benefits that one confers, one has to put a limit on it or it might be abused.

If some extraordinary case of hardship or difficulty arises, we will not be unprepared to extend the distance.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister that he will keep it in mind. It is a matter of administration. They would save themselves a lot of trouble.  Even if we get a village which everyone agrees is a village because it has a fair number of houses in it or, perhaps, even a small town, as everybody knows at first there are a few houses stuck together, a few more scattered ones and then they get a little more scattered.  As to what stage he decides the edge of the village for the mile to begin, I cannot understand.  At what stage does one stop and say: &ldquo;That is the end of the village and from now on we will count the mile.&rdquo;  I have a feeling that a section will appear in some future Finance Bill which will eliminate this so as to save the commissioners these esoteric problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 9, to delete &ldquo;premises&rdquo; where the word secondly occurs and to substitute &ldquo;hotel premises, and of guesthouse premises with more than ten bedrooms,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a simple issue on which we had some discussion.  The concession given to hotels of 50 per cent or £100,000, whichever is the lesser, covers hotels which are defined as the bedroom part of hotels that are in the register of hotels of Bord Fáilte.  Guesthouses, at least those of ten bedrooms or more, are hotels. There is no practical distinction.  I can see that the many small guesthouses of three to seven bedrooms are more akin to private houses.  In many cases they may be people's principal private dwellings, and therefore, they would be exempt anyway.  There are difficulties and, indeed, possibilities of evasion, if the small guesthouses&mdash;those under ten bedrooms&mdash;were included.  I suggest to the Minister that he should look on guesthouses with ten bedrooms or more&mdash;and they go up to as many as 88 bedrooms&mdash;as hotels, in most cases small or medium hotels.  The principle which impelled him to give this concession to hotels, particularly in the light of the difficult tourist seasons we have been having recently, apply equally to guesthouses and he should, therefore, consider including, at least, the larger guesthouses as suggested here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust the Senator would accept that most guesthouse owners would not be in the wealth <Col N="1863" /> tax bracket considering that the thresholds of exemption are so large.  Large numbers of guesthouses are also probably, in part anyway, the principal private residences of the guesthouse proprietors.  What we are arguing about is more a matter of theory than of practical interest.  There are certain obligations on hotel owners which do not rest on guesthouse proprietors. They must, for instance, provide meals, they must be open to the public and there are certain standards that they have to maintain, which are far above those of guesthouses, even registered guesthouses.  It is because we had regard to the high capital investment that has to be made in hotels, some of which does not yield, directly, a return, but nevertheless, it must be done in order to maintain the overall high standards of hotels, that we gave favourable treatment for hotels.  I do not think it would be justified in the case of guesthouses, and in reality, it would not have much practical effect.</P>
      <P>Like so many other matters, if in the light of the information collected through the operation of the tax, we find that there are a number of substantial guesthouses making a serious contribution to the tourist industry which have capital difficulties comparable to those of hotels we would be prepared to have a look at it.  We would be better to move in the light of knowledge rather than in speculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his assurance.  As I mentioned when I first raised this issue, I was not too clear as to whether they ought to be included or not.  The Minister mentioned that very often they do not have restaurants or bars but in the case of hotels it is often those that make the money.  Perhaps, it is not so much that they lack this obligation but that they lack this opportunity of making money.  That is one point he should consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing I notice in the Minister's replies to points on the Bill, is that one cannot look at a single asset, such as a guesthouse, and say <Col N="1864" /> this is not going to be beyond the threshold.  One has to remember that it will frequently be part of somebody's total assets.  In other words, in the case, say, of a guesthouse, one could easily have a farmer whose wife owned a guesthouse, and this could have the effect of bringing the aggregated wealth of the family over a threshold.  One cannot look at a single asset and say it, in itself, will not normally go past the threshold.  It will not, but frequently, it would be the straw that broke the camel's back or at least brought them beyond the threshold.</P>
    <P>I have no strong views on this.  I have raised the issue and I am happy to have the assurance of the Minister that he will keep it in mind.</P>
    <P>Recommendation, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">

      <P>I move recommendation No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 16, line 53, to delete &ldquo;£100,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£140,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have had discussion from time to time on this subject so I will make the point briefly again, that the Minister would have done well to have followed the good example that he has given, after a considerable number of years of effort by various people, in the income tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the income tax code the Minister has, rightly, provided that a man and wife will have allowances equal to two single people.  This is eminently fair because two people not only cannot live more cheaply than one but two people with their family commitments in general, live more expensively than two single people would. If the threshold for a single person is to be £70,000, the threshold for a married couple should, undoubtedly, be £140,000.  It is clear that whatever considerations apply in allowing a threshold to a single person of £70,000, those same considerations apply doubly in the case of a married couple.  I appreciate that the Minister is not going to accept this now.  It would <Col N="1865" /> be fairer and more just to have in this legislation the income tax proposal that a married couple have double the single allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice a married couple will have a higher threshold than the £100,000 because the principal private residence and its contents will also be exempt.  It is not unreasonable to assume that there will be more married people with a residence which will qualify for exemption than bachelors of either sex who, in only a very small number of cases, would have proprietory rights in a house.  In most cases they would be living in rented accommodation. When one considers the £100,000 available to a married couple, plus the fact that the dwelling in which they live is also exempt, there will be many cases where the exemption will mean up to £125,000 or £150,000, more than twice what a single person will get.  There are no universal rules. Mankind does not operate according to a common pattern.  There are variations, some will lose, some will gain. We have given rather exceptional preferential treatment to married couples in Ireland.  Most countries with wealth tax, as I pointed out, do not give any additional exemptions to a married couple.  We gave them an extra £30,000.  A married couple would also get the advantage of a dwelling and its contents, whereas a single person would rarely enjoy that exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>As with so many other things in life, there are different ways of looking at things.  The Minister pointed out that a married couple will usually have a principal private residence on which they are happy to be able to claim exemption, whereas a single person does not.  That is one way of looking at it.  The other way is to look at it as I did.  A married couple have considerable expenses beyond those of two single people. That is one of the things I had in mind.  They had to scrimp and scrape, set aside savings and collect money and borrow money to buy that principal residence.  A single person frequently is happily able to spend his <Col N="1866" /> income travelling to Majorca and such sunny places.  It all depends on which way you look at it.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious that the Minister will not accept this but I can only hope that at some time in the future it will be possible to establish a principle similar to that in the income tax code, that is, that the married allowance should be double the single one.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be returned to the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reiterate that we on this side of the House are opposed to this Bill in present economic circumstances.  We are not against this or another kind of taxation in situations where the economic situation of the country justifies it.  Indeed, we urged the Government to tax speculators at a higher rate than they intended in the Capital Gains Tax Bill but they refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We feel the whole policy of the Government should be to create and preserve jobs and we believe this Bill will do the opposite.  Economically speaking we think it is crazy to bring this Bill in at this precise moment. This is the moment chosen in the life of this country to bring in a Bill to tax what is euphemistically called wealth, to which one can only answer &ldquo;what wealth?&rdquo;  At a time when inflation and unemployment are at an all-time high and confidence is at an all-time low, the provisions of this Bill will undoubtedly further reduce confidence, will do nothing to increase employment and to reduce inflation. The amount of revenue that will be collected will do nothing to fill the enormous budget deficit the Minister faces.  In other words, this Bill will <Col N="1867" /> do nothing to redistribute wealth which is the ostensible reason for it.</P>
    <P>It was admitted by the Minister in his White Paper that this wealth tax will do nothing to redistribute wealth.  While the Minister says he has no idea how much money will be collected under it, the universal assumption&mdash;an assumption shared by the Minister&mdash;is that the amount will be, relatively speaking, so small that it will do nothing to help the budget deficit.  When one considers that the budget deficit will be in the region of £300 million this year, this £1½ million or £2½ million the Bill will collect will barely dent that enormous deficit.  It will further damage the economy and further reduce business confidence.</P>
    <P>One of the most important points one can make against the provisions of the Bill is that it will hit hardest where profits are lowest.  In other words, it will hit hardest those very companies, businesses and employment-giving projects which we should try to maintain and support.  A business that is making good profits can face a tax such as this with equanimity. A business which is finding it difficult to keep its head above water is the one which is hit most badly by a tax such as this.  In certain cases this could be the straw that broke the camel's back.  The provisions of this Bill will result in yet further company failures.  Even where it hits the so-called wealthy, whether their assets are productive or not, it will be handed on to other people.</P>
    <P>Over the past few days we have asked the Minister to produce even one economic argument in favour of the provisions of the Bill.  So far he has failed to do so, nor has any Member sitting opposite on the Government side.  They have produced a few vaguely political arguments but not one single economic argument has been produced in favour of one single section, subsection or paragraph of this Bill.  We have had a totally unjustified allegation that the Bill affects only the very rich and that we on this side of the House are defending their interests.</P>
    <P>We are defending the interests of <Col N="1868" /> the workers who badly need employment. These workers badly need an economic edifice, a degree of investment to put people to work.  We are defending the industrial workers, the jobless, working farmers, workers in the tourist industry and those who are dependent on a high level of prosperous investment.  These people are affected by the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is obviously no objection to taxation of non-productive assets. The circumstances in this country as compared with those in the countries quoted by the Minister&mdash;Luxembourg, Germany and Scandinavia&mdash; are very different.  They are vastly more prosperous and developed than we are.  In our circumstances, further burdens on productive and employment-giving assets are crazy.  In successive weeks we have dealt with a Bill to provide a premium of £12 for workers restored to employment and now we have a tax on those who will get this premium.</P>
    <P>The wealth tax will not be confined to the wealthy.  It will be passed on to everybody, and will ultimately be a tax on everyone.  Confidence here is at its lowest ebb since the 1950s and the provisions of this Bill will lower that confidence still further.  It contains some concessions to employment-giving assets which are reasonably adequate in the case of farming, fishing boats and hotels.  In other cases of other productive assets, the 20 per cent relief given is completely inadequate and in no way sufficient to remedy the damage that can be done by this new tax.</P>
    <P>Inflation at the moment stands at 25 per cent.  The likelihood is that in years to come a higher rate of inflation will prevail, perhaps 10 per cent or 15 per cent more, in other words, it will run at a rate higher than has been the norm in the past.  In these circumstances, the thresholds contained in this Bill&mdash;which as they stand are relatively adequate and undoubtedly exclude those who are not in reasonably comfortable circumstances&mdash;as inflation develops we need have no doubt that the thresholds will be lowered. This Bill, as the years go by, will be applied to a much greater proportion <Col N="1869" /> of the population in exactly the same way as income tax affects ever greater proportions of people.</P>
    <P>We oppose this Bill not because we are against the concept in principle of taxing the wealthy who own non-productive assets but because of the present economic circumstances we are living in.  We have urged the Government to deal more firmly with speculators. They have refused to do this. For purely political reasons they are setting out on a course which they know in their hearts will do further damage to the already shaky economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all it is right to say that we have had a valuable debate.  The Minister has agreed to look into some points raised by Senators on this side of the House and perhaps incorporate them into future legislation.  We have disagreed in principle with the Bill because it applies to productive assets in the same way as it applies to non-productive assets. While we are in favour of a wealth tax on non-productive assets, we have sought to offer constructive suggestions which will help the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners in both the administration of this financial measure and in regard to future legislation designed to improve it.</P>
      <P>Fundamentally, there are two issues on which we totally disagree with the Minister in regard to this Bill.  First of all there is the issue of the timing of this measure.  At present, we are in a serious economic recession.  This is the worst time in which to embark on a disincentive measure of this kind. The recession that we have now will continue for the next six to 12 months and Government policy should be geared to helping industries rather than cause a further set-back.</P>
      <P>I am not being a prophet of doom. I am sure we have the capacity to pull ourselves out of this recession, but the Government must set the lead.  The Government must point the way, particularly to the investing sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real way out of our present situation is to get investment going, to get the investing public to have a degree of confidence in the future of the economy that will enable them to put more money into this community. <Col N="1870" /> By saying that I mean Irish money and world money.  I am talking about the investment public throughout the world because investment moves where investors, rightly or wrongly, see the climate right.  That is a <i>sine qua non</i> so far as investment is concerned. Our paramount need at present is for more investment because as a result of more investment more employment is generated and we can get the economy moving.  I am not dealing with inflation here because inflation is not central to the argument that I am making on this Bill.  It is, of course, a very serious problem and we have had it in relation to other measures.</P>
    <P>There are two problems basically facing the economy.  One is to tackle inflation and the other to encourage investment.  The problem of tackling inflation lies with the Government but recent actions do not encourage one to the view that it will be tackled seriously.  The other problem is the investment problem&mdash;to ensure that we have here a climate in which investment feels a certain confidence. It is on this second point that the Bill is a positive discouragement.</P>
    <P>In a period when investment is urgently required we have introduced this Bill which, on the Minister's own figures, having regard to his own thresholds as of now and his own exemptions, will yield very little money, something like £1½ million to £2 million on a per annum basis, an infinitesimal figure when one relates it to a total current situation of more than £1,000 million, being the Minister's revenue requirements, a situation where he is already on his own admission in a £240 million budget deficit situation.  Probably the real figure is in the region of £300 million. Why this measure at this time?  I realise the potential of it in the future when the thresholds come tumbling down and when everybody will be caught in the net but, now, when the yield is so miserable why bring in a measure, the only effect of which is to frighten people away?  If this measure were to yield benefit to Revenue, it would be understandable, but it is yielding no appreciable <Col N="1871" /> benefit to the Revenue and will frighten people away because of the regressive nature of the taxation involved if the thresholds come tumbling down.  This would mean a far wider scope of people being brought within the ambit of the measure.</P>
    <P>In our present economic circumstances it is a highly unreal form of legislation.  It is totally removed from any aspect of dealing with the current economic situation.  It will have the effect of discouraging people from investing in this economy.  The Confederation of Irish Industry have completely borne out the point of view that I am putting here.  That point of view leads me to the second aspect.  The timing is wrong generally but it is particularly wrong when there is no distinction drawn in the Minister's legislation between productive and non-productive assets.  I welcome the wealth tax as it will apply to non-productive assets and by non-productive assets I mean non-productive assets in Ireland.  I welcome the wealth tax in so far as it applies to dead and dormant assets held in this country.  I welcome the wealth tax in so far as it deals with the immoral accumulation of wealth that is not put to any productive use.  I welcome the wealth tax in so far as it deals with people who are accumulating wealth in the Bahamas, in the Channel Islands and in any other area of investment where they push their money out of the country.  I welcome the wealth tax in so far as it deals with that situation.  But I deplore the wealth tax as it stands, a wealth tax that will apply the same standard, the same yardstick, to people who hold productive assets in this country, people who are contributing to employment in this country, be it in agriculture or in industry as will be applied to the people who put their money into some funk hole in the Bahamas.  The people who are creating employment in this country have got the same treatment from an Irish Minister for Finance as the people who have accumulated wealth but who are not making any contribution to production in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1872" /> The entrepreneurs and the enterprisers, the people with the capacity to make the right decisions, the people who want to expand and improve their own situation and the situation of their enterprises so as to give greater employment, are being put into the same category as the collectors of idle wealth.  That is the situation which we deplore totally.  I do not think this point has been made sufficiently strongly.  In so far as the Minister is going ahead with this Bill he is doing a massive disservice to the growth of the economy at a stage when he and the Government should be seeking here, there and everywhere to apply every possible stimulus to get the economy moving again.</P>
    <P>It is a complete contradiction in terms to have had the Minister for Labour here a few weeks ago with an employment premium measure designed to give grants to employers in manufacturing industry who are proposing to raise the number in employment over a certain level and to have the Minister for Finance refusing to acknowledge in this measure that the very people whom he wants to expand and invest and create more employment are not being recognised in his Bill.  There is a big difference between the idle rich and the productive rich but the Minister has lumped both together in this Bill.  That is the situation we sought to remedy in recommendations, both on Committee and on Report Stages.  What we want to do is to exclude the productive rich entirely from the provisions of this Bill.  The Minister may say that he has given certain exemptions to them as against other categories but they are still within the provisions of the Bill.  He has adopted the very same attitude despite recommendations put down by us to the hotel industry, another industry where very obviously by immediate stimulus and help there could be a very rapid increase in employment to deal with largely unused plants and premises that are there already.  This industry, even though there are certain concessions, is not excluded from the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In regard to agriculture, we have the same situation, working agriculture <Col N="1873" /> is included in this Bill.  What we have sought from the Minister to do right through this Bill is to exclude the productive elements in agriculture and industry&mdash;in particular, manufacturing industry&mdash;and in the services, particularly the hotel industry, where there is need for expansion and increased employment.  Individuals who benefit from expansion in these three areas that generate employment should be exempted from wealth tax.  We should concentrate on the idle rich who accumulate idle assets both at home and abroad.  That is our consistent attitude throughout this Bill. The timing is wrong.  No distinction has been drawn between the idle rich and the productive rich.  The ordinary people depend to a very great extent on what are called the productive rich and on the brains and the capacity of such people to make decisions, think up ideas for investment, re-investment and expansion, and it is the generation of these ideas by such people that expands the workforce and leads to a greater degree of employment.  This should be the main target of any thinking people at the moment.  This measure produced by the Government, particularly at this time, when we are at a nadir of recession, when we want to stimulate and get things going, hitting the very people who can make a productive contribution to the economy and so expand its rate of progress and give employment is all wrong and shows a lack of appreciation of the overall economic need.  The present economic need surely demands, in so far as you can encapsule what is required in the way of economic policy, encouragement of investment and greater employment parallel with tackling inflation.  That is what economic policy should be about at the moment.  This Bill, dealing with the productive sector of the community without drawing a distinction between it and the non-productive sector in regard to the imposition of wealth tax, does a great disservice to what ought to be the objective of any sensible Government at this stage of development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what has been said by my colleagues, Senator Lenihan and Senator Yeats, so far as <Col N="1874" /> this wealth tax is concerned.  The Confederation of Irish Industry have a reference to the wealth tax.  The Minister may have heard it already, but it is no harm to repeat it:</P>
      <P>Ireland depends primarily on the growth of the manufacturing industry for the creation of employment. Investment in manufacturing industry has always been and will remain far below requirements in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>This is a tremendously important quotation.  The CII are very responsible people with an interest in industry. They are anxious to see that industry thrives because if it does well they will naturally do well themselves. They are not in it for the fun of it. They are doing a useful service so far as the citizens of this country are concerned. They are creating employment for the people in their own country.  That should be of paramount importance and the yardstick by which we should measure the capabilities of any Government is by the number of people they can put into and sustain in employment.</P>
      <P>Using that yardstick in relation to the present Government they fall very short of an adequate measurement because we have now 103,000 people unemployed.  We must ensure that the people on the other side of this House are aware of that figure because some of them apparently think we are exaggerating when we mention it.  These are the published figures and the Government must understand that they are in existence.  This problem must be tackled.  The Minister should know that no Government can go on indefinitely paying out pay-related benefits, social welfare and so on, and be able to balance their budget at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>We are heading for a £300 million deficit at the end of this year.  That is well known.  Economists are well aware of it.  Some of the industrialists on the other side of the House know it and should be men enough to admit it.  It is a very serious situation for any manufacturer or industrialist to find himself in the position that, if he works hard and expands employment, he will be taxed.</P>

      <P>I would just like to intervene.  While I appreciate that the Senator is endeavouring to discuss the Bill in the context of the desirability of employment, he should be a little more careful in relating his remarks to the Bill.  We are now discussing the contents of the Bill on Fifth Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was adverting to the situation that exists at present and, in particular, in my own area where the IDA recently issued a report regarding the three or four counties in the north eastern region where unemployment has risen.  More than 1,000 people have lost their employment during the last 12 months in that small area.  That is a serious situation and one which must affect any elected representative and, indeed, any citizen. Any Minister who introduces a Bill which will ensure that that situation will not alone continue but will escalate out of all proportion is not acting responsibly and we will reach a situation in which we will have not 103,000 unemployed but, perhaps 150,000.</P>
      <P>There is another disastrous aspect of this Bill.  People are being scared away from small farms and they are coming on to the live register because of the Government's policy regarding the small farmer.  They are frightened off because of this Mansholt idea.  They believe they will be all wiped out and they are coming on to the labour market now.  The Government must be raving mad if they think that this is the right cure for the ills that affect the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to point out that, because we had 103,000 people unemployed, it was a very serious situation and the Government should take cognisance of that salient bald fact.  It should have sunk in by this time if they read their own published <Col N="1876" /> documents.  I was respectfully suggesting that while we on this side of the House are in favour of wealth tax, we believe this is the wrong way and the wrong time to introduce legislation such as this because they are frightening off the people upon whom we depend for the establishment of industries.  In my constituency we do not have very many wealthy men who would venture to set up an industry. The published figures of the IDA show that it takes about £8,000 to put a man into a job.  That is an enormous amount of money.  When this is multiplied by 500 people or the 1,000 people in my area who lost employment during the last 12 months the magnitude of the problem will be seen.  We must add to that the amount the Government will pay out in pay-related benefits and the amount they are losing in income tax because these people are out of work.  A Government concerned about the state of the country would realise that the unemployed are not so foolish as not to know that the day of reckoning is coming.  The situation cannot go on as it is.  No bank will allow you to overdraw and get into the red year after year.  No Government can expect to do that.  They are wiping out the confidence foreign investors had in Irish Governments in the past.  Not too many people are now saying Fianna Fáil were too long in office.</P>
      <P>I would not mind where investors came from so long as they had the necessary capital to invest.  If they came to my constituency, I can still guarantee them the extra three years exemption from rates we have given to industrialists already there, so that people will have reasonable prospects of living on the farms in rural Ireland in jobs which enable them to maintain their families and themselves.  The Minister seems to be saying he does not like wealthy people, especially foreigners, the sheiks among whom he has travelled so often recently.  He comes in here and says he does not want them.</P>

      <P>They could use a little of their wealth to create some employment. Why should people who could create employment be taxed?  Why should they be encouraged to leave the country?  A highly-respected Fine Gael Deputy, one who gives employment, was not anxious to go into the lobby and vote for this Bill because it hurts him.  If people with wealth are driven out of the country, there will be nobody left to start new industries. If the Minister makes inquiries, he will find that a good deal of money left the country in the past 12 months. There are secret bank accounts in other countries.  People know where to go when they have their wealth accumulated and they pay nothing to the State.  The Government should encourage these people to remain here and put some of the 103,000 unemployed in productive employment.</P>
      <P>The Government are trying to pretend that the Fianna Fáil Party are in favour of rich people.  The Minister knows the Fianna Fáil Party were always in favour of a wealth tax.</P>

      <P>We do not want something which will keep 103,000 people unemployed.  There is no confidence in this haywire Government from the Minister for Defence to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries said today that we should have confidence in the farming industry.  We would love to have confidence in it, but how can you have confidence in a Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who could not prevent the meat factories from using the money coming from intervention which was intended for the farmers <Col N="1878" /> last year?  He could not do it and he will not be able to do it this year either.</P>
      <P>The Government are not doing anything to cure the greatest headache the country has experienced.

      <P>Many things have been said on the Bill.  Valuable contributions have been made from this side of the House.  Recommendations have been put down, but all in vain. It would appear that the Minister's attitude is that he will not accept anything proposed by this side of the House.  The Minister is not prepared to say he made a mistake.  It would be interesting to know when it was decided to have such a Bill and under what circumstances.  Promises were made during the last election.  They were hastily made.  The Government could, perhaps, be forgiven for not keeping them because they were immature promises, made by irresponsible people who believed at the time that they would never be called upon to fulfil any of these promises.  By some freak result, the Coalition Parties found themselves being asked to govern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the promises made dealt with death duties.  The Government realised that the promises made were not practical and, as politicians rather than as people who were asked to govern, they decided they must do something to save face.  Having examined all the implications of death duties, they decided they would have to come up with something else.  At this stage, the junior or the senior partners&mdash;I am never sure which role the Labour Party play in Government &mdash;said: &ldquo;You destroyed us in the last Coalition Government.  We will not allow you do it this time so we want something, anything will do, so that we can appear on the election platforms at the next election and say `Look what we did.&rdquo;' That is how the wealth tax was conceived.  The <Col N="1879" /> Labour Party are in a position where they can claim responsibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I must intervene.  We are concerned at this stage with what is in the Bill.  Any discussion on the motives for the introduction of the Bill are no longer appropriate for debate.  They were properly matters for debate on Second Stage.

    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Forgive me, but I felt it was necessary to make those points because I was leading up to the reasons why certain sections formed part of the Bill and why the Bill itself was so described.  The Bill is described as a wealth tax Bill.  A more fitting name for the Bill would have been an achievement tax Bill because that is what it boils down to.  We had members of the Labour Party make excellent speeches, one in particular.  That particular member's command of the English language was praiseworthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope I will be forgiven if I attempt to reply to points made by him.  Unfortunately, I was not present when he made them.  But I would ask him or other people here of the same mind to compare the death duties tax and now the wealth tax or, as I would describe it, achievement tax.  Under the previous tax people born in privileged circumstances and who inherited wealth or property created by other people were taxed on that inheritance.  I thought that would be the type of tax that would be pleasing to people who claim to be socialists. Instead of that tax we now have what is described by the Minister as the wealth tax, a tax that will be imposed on people who may not have been born in the privileged circumstances I have described, who may have been born in very poor circumstances, who have worked hard all their life, used the talents God gave them, used them well and, all through the earning period paid all sorts of taxes they <Col N="1880" /> were required to pay.  Rather than squandering his money or spending it in some form, he chooses to build up his business, and, therefore, his resources, and is taxed on them.  That is tax on achievement and nothing else. I cannot understand how the members of the Labour Party or the great socialists can say: &ldquo;Yes, we must tax him rather than the person born in the privileged position and who has inherited wealth; we must tax the person who has worked hard all his life, paid his taxes, built up resources.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other times there may have been justification for a wealth tax.  I do not accept that this is the time.  All the time this debate took in the other House and has taken here is merely pure politics and nothing else.  The Minister himself said that the number of people it will affect could be seated in the Seanad.  I think he said that they would not even fill the Seanad.  I do not know by what amount of money the Exchequer will benefit but I am sure it will not be much.  I think I heard the Minister say: it may not be a great amount.</P>
    <P>That is why I took so much time and went to so much bother to point out the reasons for the tax measures being placed before the Houses, all the time being wasted, all the staff working into the summer.  Then we had the Leader of the House, quite irritable at the beginning of the week, blaming the Opposition for delaying business and so on.  Let me point out to him that he must have acquired very bad habits when he was on this side of the House. When we were in Government and they in Opposition, they did not take time to do their homework and prepare contributions. That is no reason why the Fianna Fáil Party will do the same. While in Opposition we will protect the interests of all our people.  If we see anything that we feel is not for the good of the people, we will at all times oppose it in an intelligent and constructive manner, no matter how it irritates the Leader of the House, and we shall do so particularly dealing with this Bill because it is merely presented for the purpose of platform politics where the Labour people can say: &ldquo;Look what we did for you; we taxed the rich.&rdquo;  But <Col N="1881" /> they will not go any further than that. They will never be able to say: &ldquo;We taxed the rich for the benefit of the poor,&rdquo; because it will be a lie.  This Bill will not benefit the poor; in the long run it will do them harm.</P>
    <P>All sorts of people may well be taxed under the provisions of this Bill.  This year it is one thing to say that the number of people to be taxed under the Bill will or will not fill all the seats in this House but there is next year.  In fact, it may not even go to next year, perhaps a few months time.  More and more people will come into the net. There will be people with property, perhaps office property, people who have worked hard, invested wisely, saved their money and built office blocks.  I am talking of the Irish recession. I am not talking of the world recession about which the Minister and everybody else on that side of the House speaks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us get back to the Irish recession for which the Government are responsible.  There is the case I have illustrated of the man who works hard <Col N="1882" /> and pays all his taxes.  He saves, he borrows and builds his office block. During this Irish recession he cannot get tenants.  He will be taxed on that property&mdash;an investment without any return.  Take the case of the man who has a shop in the best centre.  It would be valued highly but he has a small clientele because the customers have not got the money to pay for the goods he tries to sell.  He will be taxed under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Then there are people with shares in companies.  A man may have a large block of shares.  He will be taxed on the figure that may be quoted on the stock exchange that morning.  If he sold his block of shares, their value would drop immediately, as anybody who understands the working of the exchange would know.  Their actual cash value would be less than their share value.  If he sells, he will be taxed on what appears to be the value at the time.</P>
    <P>It took courage on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party to oppose this Bill because we are as wise, and time will prove how wise, politically as any Member on the other side.  We realised, in starting our opposition to this Bill, that we were leaving ourselves open to the charge of being the rich man's party, because we are supporting the rich man.  But we felt, as a responsible Opposition, no matter how it may be used or misused against us, that we would have to point out the flaws as we saw them and seek to amend what we believed was unjust and point out at all stages that the timing was so incredibly wrong that it was disastrous.</P>
    <P>I heard the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Lenihan, say here that it was the duty of the Government to be unpopular. That was a strange observation but yet when one thinks about it one realises how true it is.  When Senator Lenihan made that comment he was thinking of the experience he had with a responsible Cabinet who were prepared to be unpopular for the good of the country.  He was right in pointing it out, but he was wrong if he thought anyone would take any heed of it.  It is the duty of the Government to be unpopular if harsh measures are called <Col N="1883" /> for.  If harsh measures are needed, it is the duty of the Government to take an unpopular stand.  But the Government are not prepared to do this because they are divided in such a fashion that we cannot expect responsible government.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate Senators spoke about the Minister borrowing at the present time and the sources from which he borrowed.  Some flippant and irresponsible remarks were made about the Gulf States where the Minister is seeking money.  I congratulate the Minister on having the wisdom to go to the right source.  This Government so seldom do what is obviously the right thing that I feel obliged to congratulate the Minister when he does something good.  He is dealing with people who are very wise, who have the money, and who are prepared to lend it.  But the first thing any banker will examine is the risk content, and this country is a good risk.  I commend the Minister for going to the proper source but I will be very critical of him if he fails.  The goodwill which exists for this country should make it possible for him to succeed.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to observe that one Senator from the Labour benches who devoted some time to speaking about socialism also indulged in making flippant remarks about the Arab States. May I point out to that great socialist that the Arabs were robbed from 1934 up to the 1960's by the British during a period of socialist government in Britain, a government he referred to several times here?  They were given no facilities for education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept that.  I wish to refer to some remarks that were made.  I am not going to deal with them in any detail.  It seems to be the popular thing now to clap yourself on the back and say: &ldquo;I am the great socialist&rdquo;.  I know people who may be affected by this Bill, big employers in the town of Thurles, people who are in the mineral water business, and these are the type of people who were criticised by the great socialists.  These employers are the real socialists because they took on staff which they did not really need to give work to local people who were in bad circumstances. I do not wish to bring the wrath of the Chair down on me, but one could be forgiven for getting slightly irritated at this talk about socialism as if it were reserved for a small section of the community. I am annoyed with people who say &ldquo;We are right; everybody else is wrong.  We are the great socialists&rdquo;, and so on.  One gets tired of it.  I know a lot more about what socialism really is than some of the people who are pontificating about it here and who never saw a poor day in their lives. They would not know what to do about it if they did.</P>
      <P>The point was made by the Leader of the Opposition that there is a difference between taxing the productive rich and the idle rich.  We need people with money, as the Minister well knows.  We need people who are prepared to invest their money, people who get great satisfaction from achievement. Sometimes it is no longer necessary for them to make more money to maintain the standard of living they are enjoying at the present time; yet they have this wonderful sense of achievement. Their happiness is in achieving things so that others may benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Senator to point out how anyone could benefit if the people who are capable of achievement stand still. Achievement is a wonderful thing. Some people have this sense of achievement, others have not.  It has <Col N="1885" /> always been Fianna Fáil policy to help people to help themselves and to help other people.  I am dealing with a rare breed and people should appreciate that there are people whose enjoyment is achievement and helping other people.  Now they will sit back and say: &ldquo;Why am I bringing all this responsibility on myself?  Why am I bringing all this worry on myself?&rdquo;  It is not because he will make any more money but because there is, apparently, no appreciation of the effort that he is prepared to put into helping the country and the people who need his help.</P>
      <P>One thing I would like to mention is that it is the duty of the Government to encourage investment.  A considerable amount of money is spent every year trying to encourage investment through the IDA.  Promotions by them in trying to influence people to come to this country cost a lot of money, time and effort.  All this is being wasted by introducing this tax at this time.  All the incentives should be held out to those people, all the encouragement should be given to them.  On the one hand, we are inviting them in and on the other hand telling them: &ldquo;Come by all means but we will take whatever it is you have from you.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have seen a case of this quite recently where people in an industry outside the country were influenced by the campaign of the IDA to come and set up a factory.  They set up a factory. I know it well because it is in my own town It produces calculators and cash registers, yet, not one order has been given to them by the Departments for calculators that are being used in the offices every day.  The calculators that have been bought are ones that have been imported.  That statement is not mine.  It was made by the managing director.</P>

      <P>I have not spoken on this Bill since the Second Stage.  I had hoped that, in the interim period of some weeks, we might have got what an Opposition is there to provide, constructive <Col N="1887" /> opposition to this Bill.  There is plenty of scope in it for an effective opposition, but so many wild irrelevant, exaggerated statements and charges have been made that the whole value of the Opposition is completely lost.</P>
      <P>A lot of play has been made about the impact that this wealth tax will have on certain people.  It is very interesting to note, and I am sure other Senators have noted, the changing emphasis from the Opposition benches from the Second Stage to this Final Stage.  I recall in the earlier speeches the vehement all-out opposition in principle to the Bill.  That has been subtly altered because it was very evident to the Senators opposite that they were getting themselves into a very awkward situation of being dubbed the Party of the rich and privileged. It was obvious that some hard thinking was done.  A very significant but, nonetheless, subtle change has taken place, particularly in the contributions from the opposite benches today.</P>
      <P>As I understand it&mdash;if I am wrong I am sure that my fault will be pointed out in subsequent speeches from the other benches&mdash;we are all in favour of a wealth tax provided it is a selective wealth tax and that people in various categories are excluded from the list and only people living in the Bahamas and the Channel Islands and those other unworthies who will come under the umbrella of this extraordinary wealth tax, which I understand, is now being favoured on the Fianna Fáil benches will be included.</P>
      <P>I do not know what kind of a Bill that would be.  I do not know how many gentlemen have amassed their wealth in this country and have deployed it in some unknown bank in the Channel Islands or in the Bahamas. I know&mdash;I am repeating what I said on the Second Stage which I think I am entitled to do in the context of this Bill&mdash;that whatever else the Government may be accused of, they were not dishonest with the electorate at the last general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They said they would abolish death duties and they would replace them <Col N="1888" /> by a tax on the wealthier people.  That is what they are doing.  Whether you agree with the introduction of it or not&mdash;there are many arguments that could be made against it; I am not out of sympathy with some of the points put forward, particularly by Senator Lenihan and Senator Yeats being a businessman and probably one of the people who will be affected&mdash;the gross exaggeration which has taken place today and on earlier days, has done away with any useful contributions that could have been made from the other side.</P>
    <P>As a businessman, an employer, an industrialist, a manufacturer, a wholesaler or retailer over many years who happens to have a family business, who cannot if he wanted to do so, leave the country because everything he has is in bricks and mortar what concerns me is the fact&mdash;and this gets to the core of the criticism made: I hope when the Minister is replying that he will repeat what he said already in the Dáil on this point&mdash;that the introduction of this Wealth Tax Bill has not discouraged investment in this country and is not responsible for our present high level of unemployment.  Statements were made by Members on the front bench opposite&mdash;not today, but earlier&mdash;that the reason we had 103,000 people unemployed was the introduction of this Bill.  That is gross exaggeration. That is irresponsible talk.  It may be useful political talk but it has no basis in either honesty or fact and should not be made.</P>
    <P>I know of no instance where a potential industrialist, Irish or foreign has been discouraged from coming into this country because of this potential wealth tax.  I hope that some of the Senators opposite after this debate can give me such a list: I would be very interested to get it.  If I was convinced that there was a definite danger to investment in this country by outsiders or native industrialists, I would oppose this Bill. I remained for this debate today at great inconvenience&mdash;I am sure other Senators are in a similar position&mdash;to vote for this Bill.  I am an industrialist &mdash;I suppose I will be called a capitalist in some quarters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe the cock and bull stories that have been trotted out about the effects this Bill will have.  As I said on the Second Stage, everybody is against taxation.  I invited any Member to stand up and say he was in favour of any form of tax.  Every tax that was introduced since Pitt introduced income tax a good many years ago has been opposed for one reason or another.  Taxation is a fact of life whether we like it or not. Whether you tax income or whether you have indirect taxes such as Fianna Fáil brought in on food, or whether you have a wealth tax, to my mind what is essential is to balance your taxation in such a way that you do not do the things that Senator Lenihan and Senator Yeats fear that this Bill will do, create a disincentive to people of enterprise, hard work and initiative.</P>
      <P>I do not believe this Bill will do that. It has been said, and there is a certain amount of validity in it, that the sort of Wealth Tax Bill we should have is one that would discourage accumulation of non-productive assets and encourage the <i>entrepreneur</i> who is prepared to go out and take chances.  I do not believe that will be the outcome of this Bill or that you could devise a Bill that would tax only what are described as &ldquo;the idle rich&rdquo; in the Bahamas and elsewhere and exempt all other productive assets.  Such a Bill, to my mind, is impossible.  We are introducing a Wealth Tax Bill.  Wealth taxes are not new; they exist in most of the European countries.  The argument has been made that their terms are worse, that they are offsetting advantages in general income taxation.  That may be valid.  This point should have been developed to a greater extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has pointed out, this Bill is a mild measure and has been considerably altered since the date of the White Paper due to submissions, not only by professional and commercial bodies but also by members of my own party and of the party opposite.  The Minister has gone a long way to meet a number of objections. The Minister can claim that he <Col N="1890" /> has been co-operative.  This Bill, which began as a Bill which was opposed in principle is now being opposed as not being a selective Wealth Tax Bill.  I think that argument fails.  I do not believe the measure will have the appalling consequences envisaged by some Members. I do not believe the gloom and doom that has been preached from the opposite benches.  When Members opposite are talking about the mass unemployment which is going to follow as a result of this Bill they should be more specific and give us details of how this will come about. They should tell us what industrialists have turned aside from this country because of the Wealth Tax Bill.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael and Labour Parties have done their part in trying to promote industrial development in Ireland.  The Industrial Development Authority was set up under the late Gerry Sweetman as Minister for Finance and opposed tooth and nail by the party opposite.  We also had the Undeveloped Areas Act, The Industrial Grants Acts and the incentives to mining.  All these were brought in when the &ldquo;terrible Coalition&rdquo; were in office.  I do not believe that the present Minister or Government would bring in a measure that would have the dreadful results that have been suggested from the opposite benches.  If that were to happen I cannot imagine a Bill like that being kept on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>Our whole tax system requires radical alteration that I hope will come over the years.  Our whole base of taxation up to now has been too small.  The number of taxpayers up to recent years has been tiny relative to the working population of the country and small in comparison with tax bases in other countries.  That is changing now; with incomes going up, more people are being brought into the tax net.  The present Minister, as Senator Hanafin pointed out, did take the first positive steps to ease the burden on the general body of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>It was a tentative step: I do not think he intended it to be any more than that.  The Minister has tied up a <Col N="1891" /> lot of loose ends and made the whole taxation code simpler and he took many people out of the tax net at the time.  The whole question of national and local taxation is one that I hope will receive the earnest consideration of the Government over the years so that in the end we will, for our peculiar and particular circumstance, evolve a taxation system that will do what the members opposite want and that is, encourage the man of enterprise, the <i>entrepreneur,</i> the man who is prepared to take a chance and at the same time penalise the person who is prepared to let things slide or slip.  I said that on the Second Stage and repeat it now to make it quite clear where I stand on this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the awful effects held out by the Opposition for this Bill will ensue in the months or years ahead.  Wealth tax, whether we like it or not, will be a fact of life. Some of us do not like it&mdash;I do not like it&mdash;but it will be a fact of life.  I hope it will introduce a further measure of distributive justice.  I hope the funds that accrue from it will be used for social and other desirable purposes.  At the same time, I hope we will continue to do as successive Governments have done&mdash;let me pay tribute to all Governments in that regard&mdash;to encourage the <i>entrepreneur,</i> the hard worker, the skilled man, whether he is Irish or one of the little Arabs Senator Dolan talked about, to invest his money and know-how here and to give employment in the years ahead to Irishmen and women in their own country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1892" /> This Bill will raise taxes, a necessary part of the Government's activities, but we are not quite sure how much it will raise.  On the one hand, some of the time we are being assured it will raise a lot of taxes because it is being alleged that this will redress the balance and those who are paying income tax and so on will not have to pay as much in the future because of this Bill.  If it will make any real contribution to that, it will raise a lot of tax.  On the other hand when we talk about the people who will be affected we are told it will not affect anybody very much.  In any event, it will raise some taxes.  Any tax Bill is designed to do that and in that sense it is achieving what it sets out to do.</P>
    <P>The Bill will redress the balance between those who are paying tax on income and those who, under this Bill, will be paying tax on property.  In so far as there are any people with a lot of property not already paying quite a lot of income tax&mdash;it is difficult to see how that kind of situation exists&mdash; and this redresses the balance between those who are paying too much tax on income and those who are paying too little on property, one must accept and approve of the objectives of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a case on a few occasions that this will force those who have unproductive property to have a look at that property again and ensure that it becomes productive. That is a plus factor in regard to this Bill.  If it manages to do that it will be playing a useful purpose.  At that stage, one begins to run out of arguments in favour of the Bill.  It does a lot of other unfortunate things at present.  It is necessary to remind ourselves&mdash;in other contexts we are reminded of it very often by the Government&mdash;that we are in the middle of an economic crisis and it is in that kind of situation we have to look at this Bill.  If we are to be realistic we have got to look at everything done by the Government and the Oireachtas, at every Bill brought before us and ask: is this Bill in the present unusually severe depression going to contribute anything to the situation <Col N="1893" /> we are in?  Will it help the economy in any way?  Will it give one extra job? Will it save one industry or bring back one industry that is gone?</P>
    <P>We have been asked by Senator Russell whether we can name a single industry that will be affected by this Bill.  All we can say is that many industries have collapsed in the last 12 months and many more are on the brink of collapse.  We cannot pinpoint at this stage whether any in the future will collapse as a result of this Bill, but, without trying to make any political point, I believe there are many small industries which are on the point of collapse and for which this Bill will be the final straw.  If we debate this Bill again in the future perhaps we will be able to name several industries the collapse of which will be due to this Bill.</P>
    <P>If one is willing to ignore what is going on around us, if one is willing to look at this House for a moment as a debating society and look at this Bill as an interesting exercise in tax legislation, it is a very interesting Bill.  In most respects, it is a very well drafted Bill and one which has a lot to commend it.  In so far as it should have been brought before us at all, it should have been brought before us on the basis of a Bill, which the Minister and his staff having done a lot of work on, would like to go through the motions of having it passed but are then going to put it on the shelf until the time is more appropriate to put it into operation.</P>
    <P>The more one looks at the present situation, one is impressed and convinced that the Bill is completely irrelevant at present.  It is inappropriate and as time goes on and the depression gets worse, it becomes more and more inappropriate every day. Apart from the harm the Bill will do or the lack of contribution to the present crises it will make, it reflects the Government's attitude to the position here at present.  There is a lack of real contact between the Government and the people when we have such a Bill before us.  There must be an extraordinary lack of realism that the Government should spend so much time in these two Houses, and so much of <Col N="1894" /> their own time, on a Bill of this kind which becomes less and less appropriate every day that passes.</P>
    <P>A famous general in the United States many years ago said that strategy was the art of having the most troops in the right place at the right time.  This Bill is a lovely example of the exact opposite.  There is nothing about this Bill which could be said to be the right Bill in the right place at the right time.  It is the wrong Bill at this time.  It is making no contribution. It is distracting everybody concerned from getting down to the real problems that face us.  It is entirely inappropriate and out of touch with what we need.  One cannot help feeling that it is more than a lack of touch on the Government's part, it is more than a lack of reality, it is a deliberate red herring produced by the Government to distract people from the realities of the economic situation, and from the fact that the Government are failing to face up to their problems.</P>
    <P>Criticism of the Oireachtas, the Government and politicians has appeared in various journals.  It has been said that they have become more and more irrelevant, that the real events are taking place outside Leinster House, outside Government circles.  People have been said to take events into their own hands because they have lost faith in the political system.  To what extent that is true would lead to a wide discussion on which I will not embark.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill at the present time bears out to a very considerable extent the criticism that has been levied by political commentators and by the public that the Oireachtas are inclined to lose touch with the real issues of the day, that they do not face up to them and that they spend a lot of time on things that are irrelevant.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill, amended in certain respects so as to have more regard to productive assets, will have a relevance in the future.  I hope the economy will recover from the present depression which is due partly to world events but, to a very considerable <Col N="1895" /> extent, to the lack of action by the Government, to the tendency to talk about irrelevancies, to introduce Bills like this instead of dealing with the depression.  When we return to the prosperity which was beginning to emerge in the five years up to 1973, and when sufficient time has elapsed with that kind of prosperity to have real wealth in the country, to have people with sufficient property to justify a Bill like this, then this Bill will be relevant and worth while producing and operating.  The unfortunate aspect of it is that by that time&mdash;because of the lack of reality about inflation&mdash;this Bill will be again subject to criticism because sufficient allowance will not be made for inflation.</P>
    <P>My criticism of this Bill is that it is entirely irrelevant to the needs of the country at present.  It makes no adequate provision for inflation and makes no adequate allowance for productive assets.  I hope the country will return to prosperity which would justify a Bill of this kind.  Having regard to the extent to which Government action is irrelevant and to which they do not take any worth while action in important matters, it seems most unlikely that that situation will be reached under the present Government. I hope the country will get back to the kind of situation which would make it appropriate to have a Bill of this kind in operation.  When that time comes it will certainly have the wholehearted support of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to repeat what I said on the Second Stage.  I will endeavour to stick to the contents of the Bill.  In passing, I will try to indicate the attitude of the Labour Party on this wealth tax, in so far as it relates to the Labour Party being part of a Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party entered into a bargain with the Fine Gael Party.  One of the inducements was that the Government would have aims of reform. The two aims which applied most to us were the guarantee that there would be greater equality in the distribution of wealth. and an endeavour to see that the burden of taxation <Col N="1896" /> would be spread more equitably. Neither of those aims could have been realised if the wealth tax had been omitted.  We were dealing with a package of taxes and unfortunately they had to be taken one by one&mdash;the tax on farmers, capital acquisitions tax, capital gains tax, the wealth tax and so on.  In order to demonstrate that a more equitable system of taxation was in existence wealth tax could not be excluded.</P>
    <P>When dealing with taxation, we are dealing with a most important source of State income.  Because if its confiscatory nature, no matter which section of the community is affected, there is bound to be a certain amount of resentment. At the same time, a Government must take the necessary steps to demonstrate that they are endeavouring to cherish all the people of the nation equally.  If the Government had not come into line with other European countries in regard to taxation, I think they could never convince people that they were genuine in their statement of intent which partly induced the Labour Party to join with Fine Gael in Government.</P>
    <P>Taxation must be imposed on all people in an acceptable and fair way. I am quite satisfied in the final analysis that Senators Yeats, Lenihan, Russell, A. FitzGerald&mdash;the main contributors to this debate&mdash;realise that in a society like ours where we are continually endeavouring to try to get away from the tag of a class society it is necessary to have taxes that are seen to be distributed and applied equitably.  While they may differ on a lot of points of approach, they may have thought some amendment should be made, in the final analysis I do not think they are really in principle opposed to the idea. There were possibly some fears, and they were mentioned by Senator Hanafin, that the best way to deal with the advocating of socialism is to argue on the basis of class.  Of course, this is not correct.  The genuine socialist does not talk about the class, he talks about the system.  We live in a society where we cannot decide by one Act of Parliament that we are going to convert to socialism.  Consequently, the constructive <Col N="1897" /> thing for the socialist party is to work within society and with whichever party will come along the road towards reforms in that system, that will make it a more just and equitable sort of society in which to live.</P>
    <P>I do not want anyone to take exception to the term &ldquo;working class&rdquo;.  I consider a man who works with his hands and brains, who receives a salary for that is part of the working class.  I do not consider the fellow who plays golf in South Africa, who does not know what a company is making except profits, as someone who works with his hands and brain.  That is the distinction I would make.  Even though the previous Government made some changes, the workers never could see it clearly demonstrated that there was any attempt being made to apply taxation equitably.  They could see one group of capitalists trying to put the burden of taxation on to other groups of capitalists and when it became so bad it was necessary for both groups to combine and the real effect of taxation was on the lower working classes. The net result of that in the minds of the workers, whether we like to accept it or not, was a reduction in wages.</P>
    <P>If people did back into history far enough, and even in the debates here, they will find that when various measures were introduced over the years, no matter which Government were in power, when certain business people saw they were going to be taxed they found some way of passing it on to someone else and finally they combined to transfer it onto the backs of the workers.  Naturally there is going to be great resentment when that happens.  Anybody who offers a method of reform will most certainly be welcome.  Good socialists should not talk about classes.  They should work within the system to see reforms within the system and not talk about pulling down classes.  If the country did convert to socialism, the doctor would be paid higher than the labourer, as would the dentist.  Let us not get confused.  It is the system we are concerned with.</P>
    <P>When the Government impose taxation, they have got to see that it is broad and general and that it is not <Col N="1898" /> resisted.  I do not believe that all the recommendations that were put down by the Opposition were a real attempt to resist it.  I think they agreed in principle all along but they had to be seen to be pushed into it rather than going along with it.  To that extent I would accuse them of a certain amount of politics.  Nevertheless there were some very worth-while and detailed endeavours by them.</P>
    <P>We had the argument that the wealth tax may not be remunerative. That may be true taken on its own. Because it may not be remunerative it was said it was not a good measure by the Government, that they were just picking on one particular section of society.  If the other taxation packet was not embodied with it, if it was standing alone and was not something that was obtaining in other European countries, I agree it would be wasteful. But I do not think that is the case.</P>
    <P>When the Government are looking at a taxation system and trying to make an equitable assessment of how people should be taxed, they cannot overlook the fact that to take £1 from a poor man and £1 from a millionaire has different effects.  There is no question about it.  That action may diminish the well-being of the worker in some cases, although not in all cases.  I am glad to say that some of the workers were caught for the 38 per cent tax.  That is a welcome sign and it is indicative of how workers look at taxation.  We did not have a &ldquo;bellyache&rdquo; on the recent occasion that it was necessary to add the 10 per cent in the recent budget.  The &ldquo;bellyache&rdquo; was in another area over the national wage agreement.  That is indicative of the mentality of the working classes when they see a genuine attempt to spread the burden more evenly across the broad spectrum of society.</P>
    <P>I look on this as part of a package and not just a wealth tax on its own. There is no uncertainty because it is clear what it will yield.  It is a good sign in the implementation of taxation to know what the tax will yield and what each individual will have to pay. There is no ambiguity about it. When we come to the question of <Col N="1899" /> exemptions, I do not think that a man who has a total value of wealth in the region of £815,000, where the effective rate of tax on him is going to be 0.46 per cent, has a lot to complain about.  Let us take the example of a farmer with an 800-acre farm who is allowed £100,000 of the market value of his land, £50,000 for machinery and £50,000 for his personal wealth.  In a case like that where the man's gross wealth or the total value of the wealth is £850,000, I think the percentage being applied, 0.46 per cent, is not very extravagant.  So we can go on down the table.  Members have heard them already from the Minister and I do not intend to deal any more with them.  The table is worked out and all the exemptions are there.</P>
    <P>It has been said that a tax may be unjust.  Considering the lengthy discussion that has taken place, the Minister has cleared this point.  Every speaker who endeavoured to prove that this tax would be unjust failed to establish it.  The Minister quite clearly established the fact that it was not unjust.</P>
    <P>I would say to Senator Yeats and the other Senators concerned, including Senator Alexis FitzGerald, that it is possible that a tax could be just one year and not just in another year. Having regard to that, the Minister made it clear that the question of taxation must be subjected to reconsideration from time to time.  That was a very fair admission by him and it is a natural one.  The Fianna Fáil Government would not have said or done anything different when they had a Minister over here answering the same type of questions.  The tax may be productive in one year and not so in another. That is not a reason for not introducing it.  Having regard to the other points I mentioned earlier, the case is not defeated in any way by making that point.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave the undertaking that it must be admitted to reconsideration from time to time.  I do not want to praise that point of view on the one hand and then to say anything that might prejudice that undertaking. <Col N="1900" /> It would not be right for me not to say that I consider this is another step in regularising the tax situation.  The twin aims of the Coalition Government are being pursued and there is a possibility, by the type of steps that are being taken in the various taxes introduced in the package, that there will be reform in the shape of equality in the distribution of wealth.  We are working in that direction.  There is a need to police the system of taxation so that the burden is spread more equitably across the board.</P>
    <P>The question of the IDA grants was mentioned earlier.  Only a couple of weeks ago people on both sides of the House welcomed a measure here and the praises of the IDA were sung very highly, but there was some fear expressed that the nature of the tax would get people to shy off.  This has not been the experience of the countries in Europe that have a wealth tax. There may be reasons why people do not invest and it is not necessarily because of the wealth tax.  If people do not invest in Germany it is not because of the wealth tax but because of some other reason.  In the case of the IDA, we heard in the last few days an announcement that they have projects under way at present that will realise almost 800 jobs.  The confidence seems to be there to invest. Those people had approached the IDA and made their endeavours towards generating wealth through the setting up of industries and so on in the lifetime of the debate on the wealth tax, and the arguments that it was something that would pick on one particular class.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the IDA are coming regularly to the Government but as I understand it the IDA, when the grants exceed a certain figure, must call fairly regularly to the Government to see that they can pass on that type of grant.  There does not seem to be any great shying away from that in the sense that the IDA are being pressed.  So, while the jobs are not coming up as quickly as they might, the confidence is there and people are prepared to invest money and the wealth tax will not be a factor in whether they come or go.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1901" /> There was concern about small firms.  I would be a fool to stand up here and say that someone in a small firm will not be hurt.  I do not know, but when we were going into the EEC and the decision had to be taken in the interest of the country as a whole, it was a known fact that small firms might go to the wall.  The trade union movement was very disturbed about this and in particular the motor assembly industry.  We were &ldquo;bellyaching&rdquo; quite a lot about it and were trying to hold back joining up with Europe, but in the long run the democratic voice of the people won out.  It can be admitted now that the cause of our present troubles is not merely because we entered the EEC.  There are many other contributing factors throughout the world.</P>
    <P>On the question of timing, we had the argument that the business people, the <i>entrepreneurs</i>, are people with vision, imagination and perseverance. These are the qualities that realise wealth.  In the mind of a man like that, there is no such thing as a right time. The man makes up his mind and the right time is when he makes up his mind; the time is now.  That is the way they operate.  I have not got into the minds of any of the wealthy men, despite my close proximity to some of them, but this seems to be what makes them move.  The time is right when they say it is right and not any declaration on the part of a Government, particularly if you take the wealth tax and make that an argument.  This debate has been going on for many months and all possible arguments have been dug out of the bag.  In the Seanad, where Senator Yeats has displayed a very fertile mind and has brought up every avenue it was possible to explore, he has explored it and put it on the floor for debate.  When this is coupled with what happened in the other House, and conscious of the activities of many <i>entrepreneurs</i>, particularly those who invest with the IDA, the argument falls down that the wealth tax will discourage people from investing.</P>

      <P>The architect of industrial Ireland, the late Seán Lemass, must be turning in his grave this evening as he watches an incompetent <Col N="1902" /> Minister for Finance and Government deal another death blow to his and Fianna Fáil's achievements so far as the industrial development of this country is concerned.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to what Senator Harte had to say.  We hear of the bargain with Fine Gael, of the promises of greater equality and distribution of wealth and that the burden of taxation should be more equitable.  As I listened to Senator Harte, I wondered if he is as innocent as he would have us believe.  Has he really been fooled by the financial wizards of Fine Gael?  Have the Labour Party been fooled by them? Senator Harte talked about a good socialist.  I do not believe that Senator Harte is a good socialist.  Neither do I believe that he is a bad socialist.  I simply do not believe that he is a socialist because any man or party who supports these taxation measures and claims that they are to provide greater equality for the distribution of wealth could not possibly be a socialist.</P>
      <P>When one considers that the family of a millionaire, under the inheritance tax, will save £500,000 in taxation, or when one considers that 5 per cent of the Irish people control something like 80 per cent of the nation's wealth, the first question which must be asked is what effect will the Wealth Tax Bill have on them?  Will they suffer a lot? Bearing in mind that the Minister for Finance has provided for them adequately under the inheritance tax, bearing in mind that he will save them hundreds of thousands of pounds, is it not very easy for them, the 5 per cent, to pay 1 per cent of their wealth under this Bill?  These 5 per cent are not suffering under this measure.  If one groups the two tax Bills together, they are benefiting, they are saving money. The great socialist Senator Harte and the Labour Party are helping them to save money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who is suffering under this measure &mdash;the small businessman whose total business wealth may amount to from £150,000 to £250,000.  The small businessman who has already paid his income tax, who has already paid a profit tax on his business is now being asked by Senator Harte and the Labour <Col N="1903" /> Party to pay a second tax.  That is what the Wealth Tax Bill is all about.  If Senator Harte tries to persuade the people that this wealth tax will bring about a greater equality of the distribution of wealth, then he is talking through his hat.</P>

They will learn that, taking the two taxes, that family will pay far less in taxation than they are paying at present.  If the people go to the trouble of getting the truth, they will then be convinced that the Labour Party and the Coalition Government are trying to fool the Irish people once again.</P>
      <P>The small businessman is paying income tax.  One would think, listening to Senator Russel and Senator Harte, that they do not pay tax.  We were told that this Bill was making a good endeavour to cherish all the people equally.  Do the Senators believe that the people are being cherished equally? Should they now be asked to pay a tax on the value of their property, whether it is making a profit or not? Senator Harte told the House that taxation must be imposed in such a way as to be generally accepted as fair. Does the Senator believe that the small businessman, the valuation of whose property may be £150,000&mdash;and in these days of inflation it is not too difficult to have a property worth £150,000 &mdash;who may work seven days a week, 15 hours a day, should now have to pay a second tax in addition to his normal and proper income tax?</P>

      <P>Senator Harte told the House that a £ off a poor <Col N="1904" /> man and a £ off a millionaire has very different effects.  I agree with him entirely but in this legislation a businessman with a property valuation of £250,000 will pay the same percentage wealth tax as a businessman with a property valuation of £250 million. Yet Senator Harte tries to justify this legislation.</P>
      <P>Great play has been made of the bargain with Fine Gael.  We must remember that of the 5 per cent who control the nation's wealth, the vast majority are supporters of Fine Gael. It is understandable that the Minister for Finance and the Fine Gael Party, regardless of any bargain with Labour, would look after the interests of these people.  They have done this in a way that seems to have bluffed the so-called socialists of the Labour Party.  If one Labour Party member can stand up here and tell me that the family of a man worth £2 million will not pay an inheritance tax worth almost £1 million, then I eat my words.  That is the position.</P>
      <P>There is a tail to this National Coalition Government.  The Labour Party must ride along with it in State cars, driving around the country, and they are prepared to save the really rich millions of pounds in inheritance tax, knowing perfectly well that 1 per cent of wealth tax to a man worth £10 million is only a drop in the ocean while 1 per cent of wealth tax to a man worth £150,000 means an extra taxation of £8 to £10 a week on a small business.  That is what this measure is all about.  There is no point in the Senator Hartes in this House standing up, with their hands on their hearts, to use a pun, and saying &ldquo;We are good socialists.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;I am a good socialist.  I am taking only 1 per cent of wealth tax from the small businessmen but the big men, the multimillionaires, I will save them millions in inheritance tax because they support Fine Gael and we must keep the show going.&rdquo;  That is what Senator Harte is doing when he supports this <Col N="1905" /> legislation.  I am sick listening to talk about socialists because there are no socialists in this House or in the other House.  There is no such thing as a socialists, thanks be to God.  This could be described by the small businessmen as the August budget.  We had the July budget.  We had the June budget and this Wealth Tax Bill can be described as the August budget.  It will not mean a big imposition on the wealthy but it will mean an extra taxation of £10 to £15 a week to the small businessman.  For months past, as a result of the taxation policy of this Government, with all their socalled talents, more and more business people have been going to the wall. When they digest this latest budget, the wealth tax, I greatly fear many of them will say: &ldquo;We have had enough.&rdquo;  Many of them will cry &ldquo;halt, bring in the liquidator&rdquo;. Because if anything has increased since this Government took office it was the visits of the liquidators to the business community of this country.</P>
      <P>Today we saw a deputation in this building, not in the Chamber, to the Minister for Finance, trying to save yet another viable business that has had a visit from the liquidator.  Only this afternoon I was surprised to learn of yet another business which has cried: &ldquo;Halt, we have had enough of the Minister for Finance.  We have had enough of this Government, who care very little about the economic development of this country.&rdquo;  That man has also called for the liquidator. I believe this measure will mean that many businessmen will become more convinced still that the only aim of the National Coalition Government is to bleed them white.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Never, never before in the history of this country was it so necessary to interest the business people in further development.  Never before was it so important that the Minister for Finance and his Government should be asking our industrialists: &ldquo;What can we do to help you?  What can we do to encourage you to keep the show on the road?&rdquo;  That is not the story.  Every week the Cabinet meet it appears to me that what they are asking is: &ldquo;How will we hit them this week?&rdquo;<Col N="1906" /> The Minister interrupts one of his many begging trips abroad to come back to this House to bleed the worst paid section of our community and it is not the really wealthy he is hitting.  It is the small businessman employing five to ten people.  That is the man who is getting it from the Minister for Finance and this National Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>I believe that, when the opportunity presents itself, the business people will join the Garda, the Army, the civil servants and the farmers and give their verdict on the record of this Government. I said in my Second Reading speech, to my mind by introducing the Wealth Tax Bill the Minister is in fact killing the goose that lays the golden egg.</P>

      <P>I am greatful to Senators for this debate.  I have become somewhat weary of the wealth tax debate.  A great deal of what was said since lunch time today had nothing whatsoever to do with the wealth tax and, on that account, I found it very stimulating. The truth is the wealth tax has no more to do with the present state of our economy than the interlocking of the United States and USSR spaceships has to do with the spate of fine weather we have been experiencing.  But the Fianna Fáil Party, true to form, have wallowed in mischief-making and have suggested that Ireland's troubles stem exclusively from the wealth tax. Deputy Haughey is on record in the other House as saying that the economic decline only began on the 28th February, 1974, when the Government published their White Paper on wealth taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is related to capital taxation.  But does this not show the depths to which they sink when they have to make arguments of that kind?  We have heard from Fianna Fáil today, and on other occasions. impassioned orations about the need to exclude productive assets from taxation.  Did they ever apply the theory about which they now wax so <Col N="1907" /> eloquent to income tax and, if not, why not?  Did they do it in relation to estate duty and, if not, why not? Did they do it in relation to corporation profits tax and, if not, why not? All those taxes&mdash;estate duty, income tax, and corporation profits tax&mdash;bear much more heavily on productive assets than the proposed form of wealth tax.  The truth is they never even thought of the need to give special treatment to productive assets until they saw the words in the Bill. When they recognised that the Government saw a need to give an incentive to people to switch their investments from non-productive assets to productive assets it suddenly dawned on them that here was a wonderful idea.  Senator Russell correctly reminded us today that it was the parties on this side of the House who in Government provided the principal benefits which are enjoyed by Irish industry today.  Exempting profits on manufactured goods which were exported from income tax was a decision of the Coalition Government. The encouragement industry gets and which has conferred benefits has come from Coalition Governments.  Fianna Fáil's attitude towards industrial development was shown in the Act which kept out billions of pounds of foreign investment for over 30 years. It was not until we showed the folly of the chauvinistic approach of Fianna Fáil to industrial development that we began to develop an industrial arm in a serious way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Had I closed my eyes throughout this debate I would have thought I was sitting in an 18th-century Parliament before the French Revolution where the princes of wealth and property were convinced they had all virtue and they alone made efforts and that the underdogs were not as worthy members of society as the people of property and substance. That has been the ethos behind the Fianna Fáil comments on wealth taxation. We heard it here today.  We have given arguments in favour of excluding assets from wealth tax.  Is that argument not equally valid in relation to labour which is productive?  The <Col N="1908" /> only wealth some people can apply to production is their labour and their skills.  If property is to be exempt from wealth tax because it is productively used, surely labour should be exempt on the same grounds.</P>
    <P>What would happen to the coffers of the State?  They would become impoverished if all effort which was deemed worthy was to be exempt from tax.  Notwithstanding our individual inclinations sometimes to be lazy, to take things easy, and go for the soft option and the easy way out, most people are happier when they are working.  Most people who have money are happier when they are making more.  All the arguments about wealth tax are as valid in relation to other tax.  Tax has always been alleged to be a disincentive, but tax has existed ever since man came together in society and man has continued to improve his lot because he has been anxious to make more profit and he has been ready to work.  This will continue in Ireland in the future as in the past.</P>
    <P>There has not been any fall off in investment as a result of the Government's capital taxes.  Why should there be?  Senator McGlinchey reminded us of how well off many property owners will be as a result of the new wealth taxes because they will not press as heavily on them as death duties. Death duties were a stupid form of taxation as well as being grossly unfair. The tax applied unevenly.  If people were not well up they were caught by it and if they were well up they avoided it.  The millionaire class, about which Senator McGlinchey spoke with such vehemence, in the main, have avoided estate duties.  This is common knowledge.  They have avoided estate duty through the creation of trusts, companies, and a multitude of legal devices which were permissible under the law.  Perhaps the anger of those people can be explained by the fact that these avenues of avoidance will not be available to them in the future.</P>
    <P>That is the principal reason for the vehemence and the bitterness of the criticism levied against the Government's capital taxes.  To anyone who <Col N="1909" /> was caught in the past for capital taxes, to wit, estate duty, the Government's new package will bring relief.  To those who were fortunate enough to be able to avoid capital taxation in the past, the new taxes will mean that they will pay their fair share in future.  That is what we should be endeavouring to achieve.  The new taxes will not mean confiscation, but they will mean a better policing of the whole property situation so that taxation will be paid according to the capacity of people to pay and not by reason of caprice.</P>
    <P>The Government's capital taxation package is only one of many taxation reforms which this country has experienced since the National Coalition Government took office.  As I said when I gave the outlines of the Government's package of taxation reform, taxation reform is not an easy job.  It is a thankless one.  It is one that is invariably misunderstood by people who are well-disposed, and it is an activity which is misinterpreted by those who are not so well disposed.  Of course, there are risks as one goes about changing the taxation system which is known. There are the risks of imperfection. There are the risks of creating possible anomalies and injustices, but we have shown ever since the publication of the White Paper on Capital Taxation, and in the various legislative measures which we have brought before the Oireachtas on taxation, that we can listen to people and we can learn from people.  We are humble enough, having listened and learned, to adjust our proposals to take account of good advice when it has been offered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The task of reforming taxation has imposed tremendous burdens on many people.  Like many of the best heroes <Col N="1910" /> in the world, they are unknown and their work is unsung.  I would, therefore, crave the indulgence of the House to express my appreciation and, I am sure, theirs, to the officials in the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the parliamentary draftsmen, and the staff of the Dáil and Seanad for the tremendous volume of work they have put into the taxation legislation.</P>

It has produced a package of legislation of which this country can be proud technically, whatever may be the points of disagreement on the economics or politics of it all.</P>
      <P>We are breaking new ground because we are introducing a wealth tax for the first time in a common law country.  In countries where wealth tax and other forms of capital tax have existed for over half a century, forms of property holding like trusts and discretionary trusts are unknown. In Ireland we have to make a very deep study of this totally new field. We have produced, in our Capital Gains Tax Bill, in the Wealth Tax Bill and indeed in the Bill yet to be discussed, the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill, forms of taxation which will be used by many other countries as guidelines in their move towards taxation reform.</P>

    <P>I am greateful to the Seanad for the speed with which they are dispatching this Bill and for the manner in which they debated it.  The Wealth Tax Bill has now been debated in the Dáil and Seanad for more than 140 hours.  No Bill that has gone through the Houses of the Oireachtas, certainly in my 16 years here, has been debated for so long.  As I said, at the commencement of this Bill in the Seanad, never were there so many words spoken on a matter which is going to affect so few.  But that is parliamentary democracy working.  It has its suitable <Col N="1911" /> moments and does impose its pressures on many people.  I am glad that these pressures are now going to be removed from the people, not least the staff of both Houses of the Oireachtas and the Members.  May I <Col N="1912" /> wish you all happy holidays and may I wish you also beyond your holidays many prosperous years in which you will all accumulate so much wealth that you will be subject to wealth tax?</P>

      <P>It is proposed to adjourn <i>sine die</i>.  For the information of Senators, I should say that the Minister for Lands hopes to be in a position to proceed with the Wildlife Bill sometime in October.  I would expect that we would resume about mid-October.  I do not want to commit the Minister to that.</P>
