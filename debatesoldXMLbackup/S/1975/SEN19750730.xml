      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 2, 3, 1, 5 and 4.  As regards the Justice items, Nos. 1, 5 and 4, if No. 2 is concluded, it is proposed to interrupt No. 3 at 2.30 p.m. in order to take Nos. 1, 5 and 4.  It is suggested, in order to convenience the Minister for Justice who will not be in a position to start until 2.30 p.m., that we take the lunch break from 12.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>Before we take up consideration of the Committee <Col N="1076" /> Stage of this Bill, I should like to indicate that I have ruled that amendments Nos. 4, 6, 7, 10, 10a and 15 standing in the names of Senators Yeats and Dolan are out of order on the ground that in each case the amendment involves a potential charge on State Funds.  The Senators have been notified accordingly.</P>
      <P>For the information of Senators, amendment No. 10a appears on the Order Paper, not on the list of amendments.</P>
      <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 11 are related and it is suggested that they should be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 19, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;by order.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 1 and also the consequential amendment No. 11 is to try to bring some legislative order into the chaotic situation which exists.  Under this Bill the Minister has <i>carte blanche</i> to frame this premium employment programme, called the scheme in the Bill, in any way he likes without any reference to either House of the Oireachtas.  He can fix the amount of the premium or the way in which it is to be paid.  He can decide on the people who are to receive the premium, the workers in respect of whom it will be paid and the employers to whom it will be paid.  Having decided that a certain category of employer or worker shall be entitled to benefit from this scheme, he can modify it so that in specific cases he can remove them from or add them to the schemes.  He can decide that industries are not to benefit for any reason he feels like, including the reason under section 4, that they are receiving benefit from the IDA, Fóir Teoranta, or any other body of this kind who give assistance on behalf of the State to industries.  All these things can be done by the Minister by ordinary administrative decision with <Col N="1077" /> no reference to either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>We are happy to pass this Bill in the sense that, while we are not certain how effective it will be, the action being taken will benefit industry and agriculture and, to some extent, it will help employment.  We are happy to help in passing this Bill pretty rapidly but, nonetheless, it seems that there ought to be some provision for ensuring some kind of legislative supervision over what will be going on under the Bill.  Without derogating from or reducing the Minister's powers, I propose in these amendments merely that the Minister should do these things by order, not as is proposed here, by some sort of administrative practice in his own Department.  The order should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas with the usual provision that within 21 days either House can invalidate an order, without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under the order.</P>
    <P>The Minister should accept this amendment.  It would be good parliamentary practice for him to do so.  It would not in any way cut down his powers under the Bill.  He would be able to do precisely the things he wants to do, but he would have to do it by order and these orders would be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  It would be open to anyone who wished to discuss the details to put down a motion to revoke the order.  It would enable a parliamentary debate to take place.  As I said, it would not in any way reduce the powers of the Minister.  Therefore, in accordance with hundreds of precedents, this is the type of scheme that ought to be brought in by order and I would urge him to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point here is that for a scheme of this kind and for this programme we would require the minimum of delaying procedures.  I do not wish to take from the point of having good parliamentary practice wherever possible, but very often it is a choice between good parliamentary practice <Col N="1078" /> and efficiency in operating a programme designed to meet varying circumstances of need.  If I accepted the amendment we would be taking on the problem of procedural delays in an area where the utmost despatch could be required.  This is why in other programmes and national schemes of one kind or another which involve disbursement of Exchequer moneys, we find that this disbursement can be proceeded with despatch and efficiency to the areas of need without any statutory basis, without that procedural requirement of laying an order before the House.  The technical systems, the grant schemes, administered, for example, by the Department of Industry and Commerce operate on the same basis.  We have to remember that the Senator's amendment is tied to that later amendment of his under section 5 which would require that the order:</P>
      <P>...shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
      <P>I would agree with the Senator in most circumstances but, in the circumstance of assessing the need of a particular industry, and ensuring that aid goes to an employer who may take on fresh workers on this month or on that date, all we require here is the general permission of both Houses on the criteria to be adopted in the disbursement of funds.  There is, of course, the added built-in safeguard here, that I hope I will be back very early in the autumn to both Houses&mdash; or to the other House&mdash;for additional funds in aid of this scheme.  I am in sympathy with the Senator on the general lines of his argument but I suggest to him that in this case what we require is speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not greatly impressed by the call for speed.  It does not seem to me that any delay is involved. <Col N="1079" /> The Minister, obviously, has to prepare a scheme.  The scheme can be amended from time to time and I presume from the way in which this Bill is framed, it is envisaged that there will be considerable amendments from time to time.  The initial scheme has to be prepared in some form.  I take it that an hour's work also by somebody could put it in the form of an order rather than whatever administrative procedure the Minister envisages. I cannot see what the delay involved there is.  These orders, I take it, are put in a very simple stereotyped way.  It is simply a matter of ensuring that they comply with whatever the procedure is required for an order.  I cannot see that it would involve more than a hour's delay on somebody's part, even if as much as that.</P>
      <P>As regards the further procedure in my amendment No. 11, that does not cause delay in any way.  It may be that the matter would never be debated but if it were debated it is a matter in each House of persuading the Government to allow time for the debate to take place, and so on.  It is made quite clear, as with all provisions of this kind, that should the order be annulled it is without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done.  Of course, the Government having a majority in each House, the possibility of this happening is remote.  As far as the law is concerned the Minister can carry on, even in the light of the possibility of a debate in either House, without paying any strictly legal attention to this fact.  He is perfectly entitled to carry on with his scheme without worrying about the possibility of its being annulled.  Even if it should be annulled, which is highly improbable, nothing he has done under the scheme would in any way be vitiated or prejudiced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that in the autumn he hopes to be back with a Supplementary Estimate for more money.  He just caught himself up in time.  This only applies to the Dáil and it is no help to us in the Seanad.  We would not debate such a Supplementary <Col N="1080" /> Estimate.  As far as this House is concerned that is really no help.  I do not think even a Supplementary Estimate is an adequate alternative to this proposal.  I am unable to see how the delay could arise.  It is easier to do these things without bothering about an order.  Under the circumstances I should have thought that any delay there was would be absolutely minimal.</P>
    <P>It is bad practice and the fact that it may have been done in other cases does not really help.  That is one of the great troubles with the legislative process.  There seems to be a constant duel between each House of the Oireachtas and the worthy persons behind Ministers who seek to put these schemes through and Ministers, of course, are the ones who are responsible.  There are Ministers who, in accordance with the best advice available to them, are always trying to arrange these matters so that as little recourse as possible is had to further parliamentary discussion.  It is bad practice.  One can see that from a Minister's point of view it is a convenient way of doing it.  The fact that other Ministers, and even this Minister, have got away with it on other occasions is really no reason for us to follow this precedent now.  It is a bad precedent which the Minister has quoted and it should not be followed. It is a vitiation of the democratic process.  However, I will not press the amendment further.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 2, 5 and 14 are related and it is suggested that they should be taken together.  All of these amendments are concerned with the scope.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete lines 26 to 28 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Scheme shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  so far as it applies to agriculture (including horticulture), come into operation on the 3rd day of August, 1975, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  so far as it relates to manufacturing industries, be deemed <Col N="1081" /> to have come into operation on the 29th day of June, 1975,</P>
    <P>and shall cease to have effect on the 26th day of June, 1976, without prejudice to any conditions of the Scheme which continue to apply after that date.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to bring agriculture within the scope of the Bill.  As I pointed out in my statement yesterday, the brunt of the increase in unemployment has been borne by the manufacturing sector.  Agriculture remains a major industry and on its continued prosperity depends the possibility of retaining purchasing power throughout the country.  One of the relatively bright spots in the economy this year continues to be the condition of agriculture by contrast with the situation in industry.  Our membership of the European Community assists here.</P>
      <P>We felt that with better prices for agricultural products the need might arise this year for farmers to take on extra employees to do all the jobs connected with farming, farm buildings and so on, and that farmers might be making plans for this year and next year.  We decided to extend the scope of the scheme to ensure that, where such additional employment could be given in the agricultural sector, the benefits of this scheme could also be afforded to the farming industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to avoid normal seasonal increases in unemployment in that sector, the scheme will provide that, to qualify for a premium, employment will have to continue for a minimum period of nine months, that is, the employer will only receive the premium at the end of the nine months' period.  This is the difference from the industrial sector. The premiums payable in respect of agricultural and horticultural workers will be the same as for manufacturing workers except that they will be paid in lump sums at the end of the nine months' period.  That rate, I repeat, is £12 per week per eligible employee from 3rd August, 1975, to 27th March, 1976, and thereafter £6 per week per eligible employee until the <Col N="1082" /> termination of the scheme.  That is, briefly the purpose of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally one welcomes any amendment or device that would succeed in one way or another in reducing this enormous number of 103,000 people unemployed.  I assume the Minister has this in mind.  I respectfully suggest that this is just pure lip service to the agricultural community.  This amendment is just an afterthought.  This Dublin-based Government realised they were leaving the agricultural sector out of the scheme and they decided to throw in a sop to try to appease the farming organisations and the farmers in general and pretend they were coming to their assistance.  The statement made by the Minister clearly indicates to me how far he is removed from the realities of the agricultural position.</P>
      <P>I wonder is the Minister aware that in the past two years the price of a dropped calf went from £73 to 73p. I wonder is the Minister aware that the charge for the AI service is £3 and £4.  I wonder is he aware of the disastrous situation in the cattle industry and, indeed, in all sectors of the agricultural industry.  Is he suggesting that the farmers are in a position to take on extra employees from the month of August?  People should realise that agriculture is more or less a seasonal occupation and the most of the work on the farm is finished at present as the hay and silage have been made.  What does the Minister expect a farmer would be doing taking extra people into his employment during the winter season when the days are short and he himself has very little to do around his own farm? How could he expect farmers in the present economic situation to pay agricultural wages on the small farms of Ireland during the winter period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a realistic approach. Some time ago the Government were asked to increase the £17 paid to farmers as relief from agricultural rates paid to the county council.  That figure has not been changed for the past ten years despite drastic inflation. I cannot see how this amendment <Col N="1083" /> could be of any assistance to farmers and I should like the Minister to explain exactly to whom it would be applicable.  If a farmer who was rearing chickens took on an extra man, would he be eligible?  If a farmer decided to employ nine or ten men cutting turf on his farm, would they be considered for premiums?</P>
    <P>If because of the oil shortage and the necessity to produce some of our own energy, a farmer employed nine or ten men to cut turf on his farm, would those people qualify for these benefits?  I am not suggesting they would cut turf in the middle of winter.  If this scheme had come into effect in March it might have had some relevance, but so far as the turf is concerned it has no relevance at present.  If the farmer was engaged in producing vegetables, as naturally many farmers would be, would he qualify for this payment if he took on extra people?  These are a few points I should like the Minister to answer. So far as I can see, it will not cost the Exchequer much money and will not be of any benefit whatever in reducing the mountain of 103,000 unemployed.</P>
    <P>The House should be aware that our farmers have had four extra taxes imposed on them within the last two years, together with the disastrous situation which has developed in agriculture because of the incompetency of the Government and of the Minister for Agriculture, in particular, in handling our case at EEC level; indeed, even on the home front where he was unable to ensure that the intervention moneys were paid to the farmer and producer.  Farmers have no confidence whatever in the Government. This type of gimmick will not work either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the previous speaker, I do not think this is a sop, but a very welcome amendment to the scheme, to extend it to what we in the country consider a very important sector, the agricultural community. Certainly I hope this amendment will <Col N="1084" /> create an impetus to employment in this very important sector.</P>
      <P>The Minister states that this is operative for the six months up to the 27th March, dated from the 3rd August, 1975.  If an agricultural employer considers it is not feasible for him to employ a man before, let us say, the 3rd October, would the higher rate of premiums extend for the six months from October or would they terminate in March?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last point made is a very valid one.  Indeed, the points made by Senator Dolan are very valid also, in this respect, that while nobody has any objection to the inclusion of the agricultural industry from the point of view of employment premiums, the reality will be something very different.  The reality is that the scheme is operating from now through the winter months.  With the agricultural wage now running at about £30 per week&mdash;and that during the winter months when everybody knows there is less need for labour on the land&mdash; this scheme, while welcome, and we have no objection whatever to its inclusion, will not be heavily used, to put it mildly.  It will have nothing but a very marginal effect on what the Minister is trying to do.  However, it is a welcome improvement.  There may be particular cases of industrialised agriculture, particularly in the horticultural field, in eastern counties where it may have value.  It may have certain value in very large milk farms also.  The winter months are coming in.  They are months of low agricultural production.  It will require some stimulation and persuasion to ask a large industrialised farmer, or a large farmer, to take on men on the basis of a promise of £12 per week related to the agricultural wage which he would be obliged to pay during the same period.  That is the backdrop of reality to the matter.  It is worthy of inclusion even if it only employs a comparatively few number.  Anything in this direction is welcome at present.  For that reason, there is no objection to the inclusion of the agricultural industry.  All I am saying is that it is very marginal to the overall objective of achieving an extra 10,000 <Col N="1085" /> jobs by this time next year.  That is a fair comment on the situation.</P>
      <P>The more serious aspect is the omission in the Minister's amendment of any reference to the service industry generally.  While I appreciate that the Minister, naturally, could not deal with the seasonal situation such as operates for example in the building trade, I can see that&mdash;were he to cater for seasonal rises and falls&mdash;the Minister would be getting into a very dangerous area of expenditure.  In a Bill which I feel should be as flexible as possible&mdash;and to this extent I go along with some of the sentiments made by the Minister&mdash;I fail to see why the Minister has restricted himself to a limited range of manufacturing industries which are all that are proposed to be brought within the ambit of the Bill.  At the other extreme there is the agricultural industry, the wide area of the food-processing industry, the building industry, the hotel industry, the whole area of transportation, all of these areas are excluded for the purpose of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister cogent arguments as to why areas of the service industry have been excluded.  I appreciate that there are seasonal problems in regard to many service industries, and indeed most of the industries I have just mentioned. But, let the flexibility lie with the Minister to decide&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to intervene for the purpose of saying the Senator has raised the point of service industries and other industries. The concern of the Chair is that we should not have this question debated more than once on Committee Stage. If the House is agreeable, perhaps any discussion on the question of scope might be discussed with these amendments.  Then it would be perfectly in order for the Senator to continue but, of course, the matter could not arise later on the section or on the Title.  It is a question of when the House wishes to have the debate on the question of the scope and excluded industries.</P>

      <P>I am obliged to the Cathaoirleach, because that clarifies the matter.  At least it is a warning signal to the Minister that this is of very real concern, because it is in this area too that the £12 per person would be of greater value.  Particularly in the hotel industry, that is of more real value to a hotelier who is usually paying lower rates than other areas of manufacturing industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was proceeding to make the valid point, when the Cathaoirleach interrupted me, with all due respect, that in regard to manufacturing industry there are high wage rates involved.  Therefore, the £12 a week is not nearly as effective in an <Col N="1087" /> area of employment where there are high wage rates as it is in one where there are lower wage rates involved. That is where the service industry point comes in.  As the wage rate goes up, the £12 a week incentive diminishes in value as far as employers are concerned.  But where the £12 per week is more accurately related to lower wage rates, then it is of real value to the employer concerned. This applies to areas of manufacturing industry too.  I note&mdash;which bears out my point&mdash;that the textile industry has been a very large applicant to the Minister for the £12 per week under the manufacturing industry side.  This is rather significant in that it is precisely in the textile industry, by reason of its high competitiveness over the years, where there are lower wage rates, than in other areas of industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The point again applies in regard to agriculture&mdash;and this is the point I was making initially&mdash;that where there is an agricultural wage rate at about £30 per week, it will be very difficult to stimulate a large number of farmer employers, over the winter months, to take on employment when they work out the sums, of £12 per week against £30 a week, of what productive work is available during the winter/spring months; the total effect of adding this area to the Bill&mdash;while even if it employs only one person we will not oppose but welcome it&mdash;is very marginal and we could add it without any great fuss.  But, in the context of stimulating 10,000 jobs over the next 12 months certainly it is not very important. There are other more important areas to which the Minister could have addressed himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment. The reason I do so is that, since the Bill was published I have been approached by representatives of the farming community asking why <Col N="1088" /> they were not included.  Now that they are included I welcome the amendment.  Farmers are interested, even at this time of the year, because we are now coming into the harvest season.  From the 3rd August on farmers will be very busy during the harvest season.  Usually they employ extra manpower during that season and retain them into the beet season. In itself that is a great help to farmers, if they are getting the £12 per week extra from the Exchequer. Even if they are paid £30 per week, as Senator Lenihan said, £12 from £30 leaves £18, and it costs the farmer only £18 to employ those extra people.  They would be employing some of them during the harvest and beet seasons.</P>
      <P>It gives them an opportunity to prepare for the spring season and for production the following year.  It also affords them an opportunity to reorganise their farm buildings.  I welcome the Bill.  I welcome the amendment because, as I have said, the farmers themselves want it, need it and are grateful to the Minister for this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is understandable that Senator Lenihan would want to play down the inclusion of agriculture and horticulture in the Bill.  But there was very great pressure on the Minister in the other House and from outside organisations to include agriculture and horticulture. We should be grateful that he has brought in an amendment to do so. Even if it results only in the employment of quite a small number of extra men it is a very welcome development. I think it will prove a very effective instrument in easing the unemployployment situation in rural areas.</P>
      <P>It is a very difficult thing to legislate for farm employment in view of its seasonality.  It is difficult to devise a scheme that will cover all eventualities.  The Minister has probably done the best he can in his nine months' period out of 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to suggest to him, however&mdash;in view of the uniqueness of this type of employment that varies all over the country in various farming <Col N="1089" /> avocations&mdash;that he leave himself flexibility in regard to the term during which an extra man or men will be employed.  In other words, rather than have the farmer waiting until the end of nine months to get his £12 per head, possibly there could be some interim payment, say, at three months or six months to encourage the farmer, first of all, to take on the extra man or men and, secondly, to keep him for the full period of nine months, allowing for the fact that there will be seasonal unemployment. I do not know if there is flexibility in the Bill to do this.  But I would suggest to the Minister, having regard to this type of industry, which is so important in the country&mdash;on which we all agree&mdash;and offers the greatest scope for further development in the years ahead, every possible effort should be made to encourage farmers to take on extra men even in the short term. That would be the wish of the House.</P>
    <P>But generally the Minister has done his best to meet what is a difficult case and for which there is no complete and absolute satisfactory answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Lenihan has said undoubtedly we welcome the addition of agriculture to this Bill. The Bill was limited in form when it arrived before us.  It will now be slightly less limited with the approval of these amendments.  Nonetheless the change is not really one that will bring about much additional employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Russell pointed out that we, on this side of the House, should not be carping about this since we called for it in the other House.  We did.  I can assure the Chair that I am not going to go into detail on the subject, but we called for the addition of other things also to the Bill.  The Minister has rejected our call for these other items to be included&mdash; building, service industries and so on. We will come back to that at a later stage in the Bill.  He rejected these, which could have provided considerable additional employment, and has agreed only to add agriculture and horticulture.  It seems quite clear that the amount of increased employment <Col N="1090" /> given will be very small.  I do not know how much, whether it will be 50 or 100 men but it will be something very small.  Indeed the total number of paid agricultural workers in the country is, in itself, small and a decreasing one.  It is probably approximately 25,000.  But there are many more people employed in other sections of the economy than there are in agriculture.  I am talking about people who are employed for a wage. Nonetheless, in so far as it goes, we approve this.  One wonders, though, why this sector was chosen by the Minister.  I wonder would it be unfair or unreasonable to suggest that the choice of agriculture to be added at this very late stage to the Bill is related to the strange situation that arose and caused considerable ill-feeling where the Government, having been persuaded by the EEC to accept a further devaluation in the green £, turned around and said that the cost of this to the consumer was to be paid by agriculture.</P>
    <P>That rightly caused a great deal of ill feeling amongst the farming organisations.  I suspect that that ill feeling was reflected very strongly in communications to the Government by these organisations and had a considerable amount to do with the sudden last minute addition of agriculture to this Bill, an attempt to pursuade our farmers that they were getting something to make up for the outrageous performance of requiring them to pay the cost of the green £ to the consumer.  Two-and-a-half million pounds is being taken from them, in some manner as yet unspecified. I am afraid that the amount that will be returned by means of this addition to this Bill will be very small indeed and in no way compares with the two-and-a-half million.</P>
    <P>However, so far as it has much meaning, we welcome this addition. There are certain questions we must ask the Minister about its operation. I am not at all clear about how it is proposed to extend this premium scheme to agriculture and horticulture. First of all, who is entitled to get the premium, that is, which employer. <Col N="1091" /> I take it that the provision of the base date that applies in industry will not apply, that any farmer or any horticulturist, no matter how many he employs, or whether he employs anyone, will be entitled automatically to receive the premium if he employs someone extra for nine months.  How will the Minister deal with a situation where someone is dismissed?  Is 3rd August the base date by which there has to be a net increase in employment?</P>
    <P>More important than that: how will the Minister decide what workers are entitled to have the premium paid in respect of them?  For industrial workers we understand that premiums will be payable in respect of full-time employment of persons who are in receipt of unemployment benefit at any time after the 20th June and, in addition, they must either have been on the live register for four weeks or attending an AnCO training centre full-time immediately preceding their first employment under this programme, or they must be employed by the same employer on a shorttime arrangement in the PAYE week beginning on 15th June, 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is related strictly to agriculture, unlike services and so on.  Therefore, it would be more convenient to discuss it now.  After all, if we are to decide whether to accept these amendments, we should have some idea as to what they involve.</P>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister what the provisions are going to be.  What particular workers will be enabled to be given employment by farmers or horticulturists and receive the premium?  Must they have been in receipt of unemployment benefit? Surely a great many people who work in agriculture will be on unemployment assistance rather than on benefit? It seems to me that the rules laid down for employment of people in industry do not apply to this particular situation.  How is the Minister going to lay down in the scheme for both the people who will get employment and those who will give it?  The problem is that this Bill, in so far as it lays down anything at all, is related exclusively to industries.  We have these amendments brought in at the last minute and the Bill, as it stands, is incapable of dealing with this addition.</P>
      <P>I should be glad to hear from the Minister how he proposes to amend the proposed scheme in order to allow that these new employees be brought in.  A whole new section of the scheme needs to be laid out.  We have not been told what it is, except for the bare point that the premiums will be paid in a lump sum at the end of nine months.</P>
      <P>I should be glad if the Minister could give us some enlightenment on these points.</P>

      <P>While I welcome the Bill I am not too sure about its suitability.  If a farmer employs somebody for the nine month period and after three months discovers the employee is unsuitable&mdash;that can happen in agriculture more so than any other <Col N="1093" /> field&mdash;or if, after three months, the employee decides to leave and the farmer finds it difficult to get another employee&mdash;it might take a month to get another man&mdash;what happens in that case?  If somebody has worked for three or four months and then becomes ill for three or four months, in that case would the farmer qualify at the end of the nine months for the premium?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">

      <P>Just another question: supposing a farmer employs somebody because he has decided to remodernise his whole farm outfit.  He might want to lay silage pits, concrete yards or perhaps repair his outhouses or dwelling house.  Would the man that farmer would employ qualify under the £12 scheme?  If a farmer was doing some drainage and, say, employed somebody to do the job&mdash;take the case of a county council worker who might have lost his job in the county council&mdash;would he be eligible for such employment and would the farmer benefit from the £12 premium?</P>

      <P>I think it was Senator Lenihan who raised the question of hotels and service industries. Our big problem there will be their seasonality.

Obviously the hotel industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I will obey the ruling of the Chair.  Various questions were raised.  One could lose oneself in the details of such a programme.  One could be here a great length of time asking detailed questions of application. Senator Dolan wanted to know whether chicken factories, or farmers who engage in chicken farming, would qualify under this scheme.  I do not think they would qualify, but this <Col N="1094" /> would have to be investigated case by case.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan said little or no workers were needed on farms at this time of year.  There is always the spring and extra workers will be needed then.  Of course, there is still the harvest and, with the expansion occurring in agriculture, there is probably a far greater possibility of employment being offered to workers in rural areas than Senators opposite seem to think.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Brien asked what would happen if a worker became ill and there was an interruption in the permanency of his employment.  If the farmer employs a replacement within three weeks he will qualify.</P>
      <P>Senator Yeats asked if farm workers must be in receipt of unemployment benefit for four weeks, as required of industrial workers.  The answer is yes.  That is a general qualification for all workers.  Senator Yeats asked who is entitled to the premium.  Any farmer who takes on extra eligible employees after 3rd August&mdash;which differs from the date of industrial commencement&mdash;is entitled to the premium.</P>
      <P>The question of which workers will be eligible in agriculture was raised also.  The same principle applies, as on the industrial side, that workers must have been in receipt of unemployment benefit last year, and must have been on the live register for the preceeding four weeks.</P>
      <P>Senator Russell asked about the possibility of consideration being given to an interim payment for farmers. We are trying to arrange for as much permanency as possible in employment. If we started breaking it up into interim payments the criteria of permanence would be interfered with. That is why we have brought in the change in agriculture to avoid administrative difficulties.  There are a far greater number of individual employers who might benefit from the scheme in farming.  We hope to arrange for this permanence in employment to overcome the seasonality associated with the industry.  But we would have to have this requirement of a nine month period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ferris asked if the higher <Col N="1095" /> rate of premium terminates in March. It will terminate in March because it is our objective to phase this out at the start of next summer.  We hope this legislation will do major work in the period up to next summer and that its need from then on, with the general recovery taking place, will no longer be as acute.</P>
    <P>I think those are most of the questions which were raised.  Senator Dolan asked whether a worker employed around the farmyard would qualify under this scheme.  All cases will be looked at on their merits, but the worker must be engaged in agricultural work, because we do not wish to see perhaps general workers who may be unemployed in the nearby town being kept out of employment which may be theirs.  I know there is a thin line, that we cannot go with a bureaucratic rule of thumb to the public and say: &ldquo;This is agricultural work and this is not agricultural work.&rdquo;  We shall have to look at those cases on their merits, but it would have to be general agricultural work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last comment of the Minister makes the Bill even less effectual than we thought it was. Indeed our whole criticism is not in anyway carping.  It is about the reality of this and even if it results in only one extra person being employed we are not against it on this side of the House.  If the objective of the Bill is to stimulate 10,000 extra jobs between now and next June, it is totally unreal to talk in terms of adding agriculture and not adding the service side of industry.  Senator Dolan raised a very valid point and it has just been answered now by the Minister, that along with the obvious limitations of encouraging employment in the farm sector, we now have the Minister saying there will be another division within farm employment as well, and that the scheme, as he envisages it, is confined entirely to agricultural work. The very work that might be stimulated and might encourage farmers to come within the scheme and take on extra people is precisely non-agricultural work on the farm.  Over the coming winter months it is quite clear <Col N="1096" /> that the whole pattern of farming will change.  In the nature of things there will be a reduction in the employment on any farm and for the farmer himself or whoever he employs a reduction in activity on strictly agricultural work.</P>

He can build extensions to his creamery accommodation.  He can build an extension to his stocking accommodation, improve his yard, improve his house.</P>

The Minister went through an area here that he obviously knows very little about, because most of the people who will be taken on by the farmer in that type of situation also in winter months <Col N="1097" /> will not be in receipt of unemployment benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has no sense of the real situation in rural Ireland.  I am not including here the industrialised farms of the eastern part of the country.  I am talking about the whole of the midlands, the north-west, west and south of Ireland. The sort of employment that might be stimulated in these areas is extra employment which would cater for small farmers on unemployment assistance, casual workers, all those within the unemployment area.  If the Minister is going to restrict this measure further to farmers who take on people in the neighbourhood who for four weeks prior to being taken on have been in receipt of unemployment benefit, then he is restricting the scheme to practically zero, because the expanded employment in this area relates largely to people in receipt of the dole, in receipt of unemployment assistance not unemployment benefit.  It is good that we have that clarified at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point&mdash;I think it was <Col N="1098" /> raised by Senator O'Brien&mdash;lights up the unreality of the continuous nine-month period of employment as regards farm work, again, excluding the industrialised type of farm, the huge milk production farmer, the huge horticultural type of farmer. What we are talking about is the majority of farms where the nine month period running through the winter includes three months in which there is no farm work as such and in which the only work possible is the work I have mentioned and about which the Minister has reassured us, that is, work in and around the farmhouse and the outoffices and work again where the farmer would take on people, and it would be far more productive if he could take them on outside the UB register.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now running into the period of low peak farm employment. Senator O'Brien's point is very valid, that the nine-month continuous employment is unduly restrictive in terms of our agricultural situation. This is an area where the Minister must be more flexible.  Senator Russell also made this point.  Certainly if for three month spells over the next nine months farmers could be stimulated to take on workers during that period for a three-month period, that would have some validity.  But I do not see any farmer carrying a man who was on unemployment benefit at the full agricultural rate over the months of November, December and January, or at any other rate, if he has to pay more than the agricultural wage if he is doing some tradesman's or quasitradesman's job in and around the farmhouse itself or the outoffices.</P>
    <P>The unreality of the scheme is heightened by the Minister's reply that the same period of reduction from £12 to £6 will apply in respect of agriculture as well.  You have a situation where, through the months of winter when there is very little work to be done, the farmer will just get £12 per person recompense, but in the final three months that £12 will be cut to £6, including, say April, May and June, the precise period when the farmer might be taking on <Col N="1099" /> some extra personnel and when it would be good economics for him to do so, and when there would be jobs available in the agricultural sector: that is the period in which the employment premium will be reduced from £12 to £6.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that all these matters add up to a sense of unreality as far as this extension is concerned.  The Opposition welcome the Bill; they are not opposing it; it is worthwhile inserting this amendment if it will mean that one extra person will be employed.  The most important way in which this Bill can be related to reality is by providing for longer continuous periods than nine months, to provide for three-monthly periods within the nine months as coming within the scope of the Bill.  Even though the Minister may say&mdash;and I agree with him&mdash;that extending the Bill beyond unemployment benefit recipients is not the purpose, the reality of the situation is that in rural Ireland those people who might be taken on in fairly large numbers under this Bill are people who are on unemployment assistance.  That slack could be taken up by farmers during the winter months.  The Minister says this does not come within the scope of the Bill and I understand that, but it further restricts the objective of the Bill as far as the rural areas are concerned. The Bill will, in effect, apply only to industrialised agriculture and is unrelated to the rural areas.  Basically, it will apply only to the horticultural-type 400-or-500 acre farms. We do not object to the Bill, so long as its limited nature is recognised.  It is not a panacea, by any means, for agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Senator Lenihan I am a little perturbed because it is during the slack time of the year that farmers have an opportunity to prepare for the coming season.  As Senator Lenihan said, there will be no work for three months.  In the area I come from there is a slack period but there is still plenty of work to keep extra people employed.  A farmer who employs a person from the live register <Col N="1100" />&mdash;only a person completely unemployed should benefit from the scheme&mdash;will have this premium of £12.  He will be able, during this slack period, to programme for the coming season.  It is only during a slack period that a farmer can do this.  If he wants to be productive the farmer must consult with his agricultural adviser and draw up a programme for the slack season.  As a result, he will be able to employ men who the Minister feels should be employed.</P>
      <P>The farming season does not end on 1st November and start again on 1st March.  The farm work continues for the 12 months but there is a slack season, and this Bill will give the farmer the opportunity of employing extra people to prepare for a more productive season in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to understand that farmers are hardheaded businessmen.  They do not enter into a commitment lightly.  If a farmer feels like employing a man he must know what it will cost and what the benefits will be.  This is only natural.  It is all very well for Senator Butler to talk about slack periods.  We must admit that there is a fall-off in agricultural employment in the winter season.  There is not the same amount of activity in the creameries.  They are not open the same number of days and there are not as many people employed as during the peak summer period.</P>
      <P>If the farmer wants to improve his farm by erecting new buildings, draining the land and so on, he would want to be assured that the people he employs for these tasks will qualify for the £12 premium.  As Senator Lenihan rightly pointed out, there are many areas where the number of people on unemployment assistance is not so high because unemployment such as in factories, does not exist. According to this Bill these people will not qualify.  Therefore, the neighbouring farmer cannot employ them.  That is a defect in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House has had ample evidence of the haste with which agriculture was included.  I agree with Senator Yeats that the reason was that farmers were asked to pay an extra £2,500,000. <Col N="1101" /> Creameries, cattle marts and so on will soon be issued with instructions to deduct from the farmers the premiums necessary to provide the £2,500,000. That will be about the fifth taxation imposed on farmers during 1975.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have provided for a period of three months, in view of the seasonal aspect of farming during the winter period when farmers are not inclined to employ extra men. At present on large farms we have reached a stage where one man can take charge of 60 or 70 cows.  The farmers are endeavouring to cut down on the number of employees.  If this Bill were to encourage them to keep men employed, we would welcome it. I do not think the Minister has sufficient knowledge of farming or of the hardheadedness of the farmers, who have been overburdened in the past three years, who on many occasions have been fooled when selling their cattle; even the co-operatives have extracted the maximum payment from them, no matter what their financial position.  Many of these co-operatives are now looking for store cattle.  They realise that the small farmer will be ruined.  If the people whom the farmer wants to employ, in order to carry out improvements on his farm, do not qualify for the premium it will result in no extra people being employed in most rural areas.</P>

      <P>The longer this section is being discussed the more confusion is being created, and there is the danger that we will lose the point of it.  As I understand it, it is the type of employer who is concerned, not the employee.  If any employer who is not in a processing or service industry employs a person from the live register he will qualify for the premium.  My reading of the Bill is that it is the employer who is important, whether it be an employer in the agricultural sector or in other industries apart from the service industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed that it did not extend to the food processing industry. It is the employer who is the criterion for qualifying under the Bill.  I was surprised to hear that a chicken farmer would not necessarily be an employer in agriculture, because in a <Col N="1102" /> fairly well-known court case the producers of eggs were deemed by the High Court to be agricultural employees within the meaning of the Social Welfare Act and their employees were deemed by court order to be subject to the payment of agricultural workers' unemployment stamp.  Therefore, even a chicken farmer would be a suitable employer under the Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Butler that it is at the slack time, when a farmer is unlikely to want a man, that the Bill is of most benefit, and that that is what will build in a certain degree of permanency into the employment that will be stimulated by it, and not at the very busy period in the spring next year when employment will be necessary anyway.  When the premium will taper off, that is the time when a farmer will really have a man whether he has a premium or not.  Senator Lenihan's argument under that score is not valid.  Whether an agricultural employer employs a man to do renovations and improvements on the farm, the important thing is that he is an agricultural employer; he is employing a man off the live register and provided he pays the man on a weekly basis and not on a contract basis, he should qualify.  I am pleased that the Minister specifies that anybody engaged on any activity on the farm is eligible to qualify for this premium.</P>

      <P>I do not think this amendment will be of much benefit to the farming community.  In my estimation it is only going to satisfy a certain type of farmer whom we, in the west, would classify as a rancher. I cannot see the logic in the argument put up by Senator Butler that it is in the slack period that the farmer is going to employ men to carry out farm improvement schemes.  The type of farmer this amendment relates to will have a difficult time during the slack period which this amendment covers, to find enough work for the regular staff on his farm, be it farm improvements of any description, drainage, buildings, land reclamation and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the step of employing more people mean that he is going to dispense <Col N="1103" /> with the service of the people who have worked over the busy period and then take other people off the live register?  I do not think he qualifies for a premium then.  What do they intend to do?  It will be very difficult for the big farmer to whom this Bill relates to find work during the slack period to which this amendment also relates for the regular farmhands who are working on his farm during the spring and harvesting of the crops. The amendment is a small bit of appeasement to a certain type of farmer, but it does not apply at all to the small farming communities of west Cork, Kerry, Clare, Galway, Donegal, Mayo and all the western coast.  It is a very slight improvement to include the type of farmer that this amendment is going to bring within the scope of the Bill, that is the rancher, who does not need any premium to give employment.  As far as I can see, at the rate we are going on and with the hand outs of about £70 million to £75 million a year in public assistance, home assistance and unemployment assistance, and handouts now to the rancher to give a couple of men employment, I do not know where this Government will finish up or where they will find the money to do all the things they are supposed to do.</P>

      <P>While no Bill is perfect, this will act as an incentive for people to return to the land.  In the immediate future we may not get the desired effects as regards employment, but each year for the past 20 years, the number in the agricultural sector has been decreasing.  The farmer could not afford to pay and as a result no worker was prepared to tie himself for an uncertain period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is some sort of a guarantee to the worker that he will be kept for nine months.  If we succeed in getting the workers to realise that agriculture is as good a job as industry, it will be a good day for this country.  Up to now, no incentive has been given by any Government to the farmer to give security to the employee. This will bring people back to the land.  While we hear a lot about <Col N="1104" /> industry and the advantages for the worker, many rural people would be willing to work in agriculture if there was some guarantee of security.  This, at least, gives security for a period of nine months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>When I asked the Minister how he was going to fix the categories of workers who could benefit from these premiums in agriculture, it never occurred to me that he would reply that he was going to stick to the rules laid down for industrial workers, including the basic requirement that every worker to benefit from a premium must have been four weeks on the unemployment register.  As has been pointed out, this simply means that in large parts of the country there will be almost nobody who can benefit from this scheme.  The number of paid agricultural workers who when unemployed can get unemployment benefit is very small.  I mentioned a figure of 25,000.  I am not sure if it is even as high as that now, but it would be in that range, restricted to fairly limited areas.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Brien asked a very valid question: what happens during the nine-month period if the worker concerned leaves?  The Minister replied that the farmer would have three weeks to find someone else.  In very many cases, if the farmer is to be limited to a person who is not only receiving unemployment benefit but is an agricultural worker receiving unemployment benefit, he might find, having employed this man for six months, that he was unable to replace him and might lose the entire premium. As I understand what the Minister has said, approximately the same provisions will apply in the case of agriculture as in the case of industry: the worker concerned must be four weeks on unemployment benefit and on the register on 3rd August. Therefore, in relation to Senator O'Brien's very good point, if a farmer must employ a man for nine months, and if the scheme ends on 26th June, 1976, the farmer must take on the man on or before 26th September next; otherwise there will be no nine months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has me there.  Then, as far as farmers are concerned, they can take on workers up to, shall we say, the 26th day of June, 1976, for nine months.  This further heightens the point I was about to make that the workers concerned must have been in receipt of unemployment benefit on the 3rd August. It seems, to put it mildly, unreasonable that a farmer who is perhaps taking on a man for a nine month period in June, 1976, must find someone who is actually on the unemployment register on the 3rd August, 1975.  The Minister had better vary this because otherwise it would be an impossible hunt.  If he insists that the only people who qualify are those who happened to be on the unemployment register for a four week period up to around the 3rd August, 1975, it will be utterly impossible for farmers to find people once you get into the autumn, winter, spring and next summer.  Some new thinking must be done there.</P>
      <P>I should like to raise a point with the Minister on his amendment No. 5.  I have looked at his amendment several times and I am unable to find out why it is being made.  I am sure there is a reason but it escapes me. As a result of the adoption of amendment No. 5 the first subsection of section 3 will read as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, so far as the Scheme applies to manufacturing industries, determine (and shall specify in the Scheme) the industries or the activities in specified industries to which the Scheme applies and the persons or classes of persons to whom it applies.</P>
    <P>This section is the only one in the Bill under which the Minister can lay down these matters, the industries and so on to which the scheme applies and the persons or classes of persons to whom it applies.  Nowhere else in the Bill has he this power.</P>
    <P>On a reading of this amendment No. 5&mdash;I have read it several times and I cannot do any better with it&mdash; it seems to me that the Minister is deliberately excluding agriculture from the scope of this section.  I imagine there is a reason for it, but he appears, on the face of it, to deprive himself by means of this amendment of the power to decide the persons or classes of persons in agriculture to whom it applies and the employers and so on to whom the scheme will apply.  If he leaves the subsection alone and does not move amendment No. 5, he has all the power he requires already in the subsection, which refers merely to specified industries which quite clearly, can also include agriculture and horticulture. The only boundary fixed for his powers under that section would be the Title of the Bill, which he proposes to amend.  I am unable to see the point of amendment No. 5 and in particular I am unable to see how, in the light of amendment No. 5, he proposes to fix these matters for agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to answer Senator Yeats, we do not have this requirement that he must be on the unemployment register before August. The criterion is that he is continuously on the live register for not less than four weeks immediately preceding the first employment under this programme, any period up to the close of the scheme.  It has that flexibility in it.  It is not simply that we are imposing the penalty on the farmers <Col N="1107" /> of Ireland to search the country looking for somebody who has been on that register for a period before August of this year.  It is throughout the scheme for any period of four weeks.</P>
      <P>It might be difficult to find people who are unemployed.  Regrettably, it is not a difficult task at present with the present high rate of unemployment. It seems that there must be many workers in rural Ireland with knowledge of agricultural work who may have left that particular work but who are there over this period in between jobs.  As Senators have pointed out, there has been a great drainage from the land in recent years, of manpower, womanpower, farmpower.  That has been going on for many years now.  This is the first time the State has directly intervened in this area.  We now here assist farmers directly in augmenting their work force in this period of extreme recession.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan makes the valid point that it is no panacea for unemployment or recession.  I accept that. Nobody is claiming that this legislation is the panacea, the cure all for unemployment.  That can only come about when conditions of general recovery are evident in our main export markets and here at home.  This programme is designed to induce employment in areas where but for this legislation extra employment would not occur.  It is designed to take people off the live register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arguments can be made that agriculture has difficulties.  The position is that, relative to the position of industry at present, agriculture has a very secure future.  It could be said also that our agricultural prosperity is of tremendous importance to the entire economy because the purchasing power of those engaged in agriculture is essential to the recovery of industry in general.  The bright spot this year is the relatively secure position of agriculture.  We have, as a result of our membership of the Community, gained acceptance of the needs of Irish agriculture and we have had the energetic leadership of our own Minister for Agriculture and <Col N="1108" /> Fisheries in making sure that that acceptance was gained in Europe for Irish agricultural objectives.</P>
    <P>We believe that this inducement to farmers over this period of slackness, this subsidy by the State to bring people into farm employment, can be used to solid advantage by the farmers of Ireland.  We will look at every case.  The question has been raised about the kind of work that could be regarded as agricultural.  One could lose oneself in semantics here. We are concerned about work on a farm in a recognised farm context. We hope this programme will be taken up fully by the farmers.  I believe it will.  Senator Garrett was concerned about whether it would only help out large farmers.  Any farmer who is about his business, who sees the possibility of getting extra help on his farm during this period for any plan or project he may have in mind, when he sees there is State money available for such a scheme, he would need to be very soft headed indeed not to take up that possibility when it is there.  Unemployment is such at present that there must be many people in rural areas who would be ready to take up such farm work.</P>
    <P>Overall, the scheme was designed to assist initially manufacturing industry because that is the area of the nation's life which has been most affected by the present recession.  The greater amount of unemployment has occurred there.  There is a great underused capacity in Irish industry at present.  This, we hope, could be relatively improved by the passage of this Bill and that is primarily what it was designed to do&mdash;to help our industry in taking back workers so that when conditions of more general recovery take place next spring and early summer in certain industries, where workers might have been let go, they will still be available to the employer.  Our objective, as I said at the outset, is 10,000.  That is a target we will work very hard towards achieving.  The extension of the Bill's provisions into agriculture will help us materially in that task.</P>

      <P>I do not believe this Bill will mean ten extra people employed <Col N="1109" /> on farms in County Cavan. There seems to be an uncertainty as to how people will qualify for it.  I would like the Minister to let us know immediately how a farmer contemplating employing somebody would be sure that those he was employing would be eligible for this grant.  He would want to know this beforehand. Who will give him the required information? Because of the long period of nine months there is not much encouragement in it for farmers.

They will be working closely in liaison, naturally, with the agricultural officers but these will be the formal administering agencies.  Of course, since this is an extension into agriculture, they would have at local level to consult with agricultural officers.</P>

      <P>There is a problem here too because the farming community are divided into three sections &mdash;transitional, development and the commercial farmer.  All these things will come into play in this matter. Consequently, the farmer who is thinking of taking on somebody during the winter, if he fully understands this scheme, will still be hampered because of the administration of the traditional, the development and the commercial farmer.  He will want to know in what category he is classed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Several points have been raised about what would qualify under the agricultural heading and what would not.  I should like to get back to the point Senator Yeats raised and which the Minister did not deal with.  Under amendment No. 5 the Minister seems to have confined himself even more than section 3 already confined him to deal in the scheme only with specified industries.  The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, determine and shall specify in the scheme the industries or the activities and specified industries to which the scheme applies, and the persons or classes of persons to whom it applies.</P>
      <P>He proposes to confine himself even further by saying &ldquo;so far as the scheme applies to manufacturing industries&rdquo;.  It seems to me that section 3, which is the key section in determining the application of the scheme, as it stands at the moment states, the Minister may not put anything in the scheme or may not specify or confine or determine in any detail in the scheme what areas of agriculture would qualify and what areas would not.  As the position stands at the moment anybody who is engaged in agriculture appears to have a right under the Bill as it stands to qualify for this premium.  The Minister would be acting <i>ultra vires</i> if he tried to confine it to particular types of agriculture, to particular employers or to particular employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, having enlarged the Bill to include agriculture in so far as the Title is concerned and in so far as section 2 is concerned, the Minister does not appear to have done so in section 3.  He does not appear to have given himself the power to include in this scheme regulations and details of who shall be included in agriculture. In fact by amendment No. 5 the Minister has excluded himself from this rather than making some allowance for it.  As it stands at the moment <Col N="1111" /> there are two possible interpretations: that nobody in agriculture can be specified in the scheme and nobody will qualify, or, alternatively&mdash;I think this is the proper interpretation&mdash;that, having provided in the Bill that those working in agriculture and horticulture are to be covered, anybody in that category may apply and the Minister is not entitled to confine himself in any way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite follow the Senator.  The provision of powers as arranged under the section is such as to permit me the widest flexibility, which I thought was the desirable thing in this area of selection, subject to the criterion that applies to the unemployed to whom the Bill is directed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that as the section stands the Minister is perfectly right.  Under the section the Minister has power to decide the people who will receive the premium, the workers in respect of whom premiums will be made.  He has complete <i>carte blanche</i> and indeed, with the subsection as it stands he can include agriculture.  The subsection at the moment speaks of the industries or activities in specified industries, which includes agricultural, horticulture and so on.  Once the Minister has changed the wording of the Title of the Bill, then he is empowered to extend these industries to agriculture if not to anything else.  He does not need this amendment.  If he want to move this amendment and have it passed, the problem arises that he has limited the extensive powers given to him.  Instead of giving him power to determine the activities in specified industries to which the scheme applies and so on we find that it states that &ldquo;the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, so far as the scheme applies to manufacturing industries, determine and shall specify in the scheme the industries or the activities in specified industries&rdquo; and so on.  The Minister is limiting himself, so far as one can see, to manufacturing industries and specifically excluding agricultural industries from this subsection.</P>

      <P>Surely the distinction is that in one case I am consulting with the Minister for Finance.  Opposition Senators pointed out that this was possibly a restricting influence, although, as I have already explained there would be no ceiling on expenditure in this area since all expenditure in this area is in a sense a saving to the Exchequer.  There would be no ceiling whatever in respect of the expenditure in relation to the scheme in general.</P>
      <P>The criticism was made that so far as there was restriction this consultation with the Minister for Finance was such.  In the agricultural area this figure, the Minister for Finance, does not appear at all.  I would have thought the criticism could be made that there were even wider powers available to me in agriculture.  How would one say that there is restriction? In agriculture it is the Minister for Labour alone who will determine the persons or classes of persons in the agricultural and horticultural sectors to whom the scheme will apply subject to the criterion mentioned elsewhere in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The heading of section 3 is: &ldquo;Determination of application of Scheme.&rdquo;  Subsection (1) seems to say quite clearly that the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, so far as the scheme applies to manufacturing industry, and in that respect only, shall specify in the scheme the industries or the activities in specified industries to which the scheme applies and the person or classes of persons to whom it applies. I am not trying to make a legalistic point but it seems to me that as it stands the Minister may not say anything about agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, of course, is looking at it in one way.  Anybody who applies can say: &ldquo;I am engaged in agriculture and I am in the situation envisaged by the Bill, I am taking back a man who is unemployed and I want the premium.&rdquo;  There may be a snag for the Minister and his Department, that if anybody just makes that flat statement he must be given a premium because the Minister cannot say: &ldquo;You are not covered by the scheme. <Col N="1113" /> The scheme says you are not covered because you are in this aspect of agriculture&rdquo; or something else.  As it stands, anybody who is covered by the basic provisions of the scheme must get the premium.  The Minister has no power to stop anybody in agriculture from getting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister a few further questions on this? I know it is not easy for him to adjudicate on every individual case that might arise but one has come to my mind, that is, the case of a farmer who during the winter period decides that there is some future in the tourist industry and applies for permission to build ten chalets on his farm.  Would he qualify for the £10 if he took on some handyman to assist in doing that particular job during this period?  Suppose we had a farmer who decided he would go into greyhounds, that he had 30 or 40 greyhounds over the winter period and he took on an extra man to take care of them, would he qualify for the £12? Suppose the man had a rabbit farm&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question for the draftsman so far as this is concerned. Lastly, especially in the western counties and in the north western areas, farmers purchase harvesters for making silage and they do ploughing by contract for their neighbours and so forth. If a man such as that decided in the winter period that he would do ploughing for his neighbours and so on and had a few extra tractors and a few men doing that, would he qualify?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We can stretch these possibilities and take special cases out but I think greyhounds in general, nurtured in care, would come under the general heading of agriculture.  In relation to the building of chalets and so on, it is up to the farmer concerned <Col N="1114" /> to state what agricultural purpose they serve.  The general criteria is that the person comes off the unemployment register and that he is engaged in employment connected with an agricultural holding or work of that nature and I think within those broad parameters you can see the possibility of workers being taken on by farmers for the period specified.  In all cases the National Manpower Service will be in consultation with agricultural interests in an effort to see that the benefits of the scheme are spread most widely.</P>
      <P>In relation to the other question raised by Senator Ryan I explained that we have this provision of consultation with Finance but in agriculture the fact is that we do not have such consultation on the basis, I suppose, of the number and multitude of individual decisions to be made there.  In the other case it is quite simple because there is consultation over a sector.  I do not see the difficulties he raises there, nor is that the advice available to us.  Under the scheme with this amendment I will have the power to say what classes of people will be entitled to the premium and what conditions will apply.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister to consider the case of the small farmer whose 18-year-old son is signing on for the dole and is on the live register.  His dole money amounts to something like £8 per week as a single man.  Is the farmer entitled to the £12 per week if he employs that son, which will mean an extra £4 of an income into the house. Is he entitled to the £12 per week to take that young man off the live register and off the dole?</P>

      <P>One last query about the Minister's amendment No. 2. The Minister pointed out to me&mdash;I regret to say that I had not noticed it&mdash;that there is a last sentence to it which provides that certain conditions of the scheme continue to apply after the closing date of the 26th June, 1976.  This is obviously intended to mean that where a farmer has started on his nine months of getting the premium, say next June, that he can continue on to the following March.  Am I also right in saying that this would also give the Minister power, if the circumstances should warrant it, to say to manufacturing industries, who may be benefiting from premiums, that they can continue getting the £6?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We ask in agriculture for this nine-month period to preserve continuity.  In industry it comes to a full stop next summer at that date.  In agriculture it does not because of the difficulties associated with agriculture.</P>

      <P>The Minister misunderstands me.  I am not saying that that is the Minister's intention.  I accept at the moment that obviously it is not but I think he is giving himself power to do so in this.  The section states that it will cease to have effect on the 26th day of June, 1976, without prejudice to any conditions of the scheme which continue to apply <Col N="1116" /> after that date.  This certainly gives the Minister power to continue to pay premiums.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that there are so very few large farmers in many of the north western and western counties and in view of the very few one envisages will be employed as a result of this, would the Minister consider the case of four or five small farmers who might be grouped together, and one man taken on by the first farmer would find continuous employment if he was able to go from Mick to his brother-in-law and right around the ring for the winter.  Five small farmers would be able to keep one man in constant employment for the nine-months' period whereas any of them individually would not be able to do it.  Consequently they would not qualify for the scheme.  That would also promote the meitheal idea, the idea of co-operation among small farmers.  They could hold machinery in common and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (3), the net additions of employees to whom the Scheme applies made by an employer to his total insured workforce shall be measured by reference to the level of the workforce on the 20th day of June, 1975, provided that a date which is later than that date may be specified in respect of certain industries or activities.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an important amendment.  It deals with the date of 20th June which does not appear in the Bill at present but which appears in the various indications that have been given by the Minister and by the Government Information Service with regard to the manner in which the scheme will be prepared.  The Minister says the scheme will be governed by the work force in respect of any particular industry.  This does not apply, of course, to agriculture, but in any particular industry the work force on 20th June will be the governing factor.  After the scheme comes into force an employer will be entitled to get a premium in respect of a worker and any employer who makes a net addition of eligible full-time employees to his total insured work force will be entitled to a weekly premium and the net additions to the work force will be measured by reference to the level of the work force on 20th June, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem here is that a factory, for example, which employs, say, 200 workers on 20th June, 1975, should it let off workers, or close down altogether in September, October, <Col N="1118" /> November, or at any time after 20th June, when it reopens and starts to take on workers it will not be in a position to benefit from this scheme. That would be all very well if one could be sure, not merely in relation to the country as a whole but in relation to each particular factory or other unit of industry taken individually, that June 20th, as it were, was rock bottom and that after June 20th things could only improve.  Unfortunately, it seems only too likely that matters will not improve.  They may in certain instances, but the overall position is only too likely to be that the number of unemployed between now and, say, next February or March is likely to increase perhaps by as much as 20,000 or 30,000, but certainly it is likely to increase rather than decrease.</P>
    <P>This is likely to happen for various reasons.  First of all, home demand for Irish produced goods has been going steadily downwards.  There is no particular indication at the moment that there is likely to be a change there.  Secondly, exports so far this year, which take approximately half of all Irish industrial production, have been well below the figure for last year in volume and the indications are that it will become in the coming months still more difficult to export than it has been in the past.  This is likely to be so because of the continued weak demand in the various countries on the Continent of Europe and elsewhere to which we export but, in particular, because of the position in Great Britain where more than half of our total exports go.  Under the recent Government steps the average rise in wages over the next 12 months or so will be about 10 per cent only to meet a rise in living costs of 26 per cent or more.  The result obviously will be highly deflationary.</P>
    <P>The result will be a very considerable fall in purchasing power on the part of the British public.  The result will be that it will be far more difficult than ever before in the past for us to export to Britain.  On the other hand because of the deflationary aspects of the British proposals, if they can be made to stick, and it seems <Col N="1119" /> they will be made to stick to a considerable extent, the extent of inflation in Britain is likely to fall considerably, perhaps to as little as half of the present figure inside the next 12 months.  Costs in Britain, in other words, are likely to go downwards much more rapidly than here and, for this reason, not only would it be difficult for us to export to Britain because of lack of purchasing power, but we are likely to be costed out of the British market.  Our exports will become less and less competitive.  On the other hand, because British industries' costs will be falling, they will find it easier to export to us, thereby still further reducing the home demand for Irish-produced goods.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, and because of the fact that from 1st January next there will be a further cut in tariffs between us and the old countries of the Common Market, the likelihood is that Irish industries will find it still more difficult to sell over the next 12 months, and certainly over next autumn and winter.  Therefore, unemployment is far more likely to go up than to come down.  In these circumstances it is difficult to understand the Minister's purpose in fixing one single date, June 20th.  Even though he says he may vary this by a day or two on each side, apparently he is not willing to make it infinitely flexible so that it will provide for a situation where a company in the autumn or winter is taking on extra workers unless in doing so it was passing the figure it had at work on June 20th, 1975.</P>
    <P>This scheme is dealing with past history rather than with the months and years to come.  In view of the fact that the Minister has complete power under the Bill to decide to apply the scheme practically any way he likes, both in regard to conditions for payment of the premium and the amount of the premium, it is difficult to understand why he is being so rigid in this matter.  We seek to insert this amendment to make it clear that this date of 20th June which the Minister has in mind will not be an inflexible date. <Col N="1120" /> The Minister has the power in the Bill already but we want to add the words: &ldquo;...provided that a date which is later than that date may be specified in respect of certain industries or activities.&rdquo;  This makes it quite clear in the Bill that the Minister has the power to fix different dates.  We feel he should accept this amendment.  He would probably be willing enough to accept it unless he is being urged from some other source not to take such a step which could involve him in spending more money.  If ever there was a scheme which ought to be an expensive one, this is it.  We should be in favour of anything which could lead to greater use being made of the scheme and greater funds being required to implement it.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the actual cost to the Department of Labour it is difficult to see how there can be much cost to the general Exchequer because any additional workers employed must be taken off the Unemployment Register.  Therefore, while £12 a week and later £6 a week will be paid in respect of them, there will be a far greater saving in respect of unemployment benefit which will not need to be paid.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment. He will have terrible problems if he tries to adhere rigidly to 20th June.  Undoubtedly, there will be many cases in the coming months and year of industries either closing down or letting off workers.  There will be great disappointment and disillusionment if people find&mdash;as they will under the Minister's present scheme&mdash;that they can benefit in no way from these premiums.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>A similar point was raised in the other House by a number of Opposition spokesmen.  This amendment, if accepted, would permit me to set different dates for assessing the base levels for different industries for the implementation of this programme. Of course, a date for a temporary programme of this kind must be selected and the date selected is 20th June.  This would obviously include certain industries on either <Col N="1121" /> side of that date for which a case could be made by saying that their predicament would be worse if I had chosen that particular date and that they would not benefit from the scheme.  That is why there is this flexibility in setting a notional figure for the number of employees in a particular firm.</P>
      <P>A case was mentioned in the other House of a firm in County Louth where approximately 600 employees were working on 20th June.  That was the maximum.  Arrangements had already been made with Fóir Teoranta for a reduction in that work force. In that case, I would be able to fix a notional figure.  I have that discretion and that flexibility to provide for situations of real hardship and to ensure that the employees of such firms can partake of the benefits of the scheme and even where the work force was reduced after the coming into operation of this programme, they will benefit from the scheme where such a reduction had already been decided upon in consultation with a State agency.</P>
      <P>If we start shifting around the actual date we will be trying to achieve the same thing but in a much more messy fashion.  It will be the subject of much greater argument and much more interpretation and unsatisfactory in every sense.  I believe the date of 20th June should remain unaltered.  Deviations from that date could result in different firms, within the same industrial sector, having different base levels assigned to them. It could lead to different industries pressing to have different base levels assigned to them.  It could lead to all manner of confusion.  I have sufficient discretion in deciding on the complement of workers in a particular job and therefore I believe the date should remain unchanged.</P>

      <P>I would be in favour of the Minister being left a discretion if he proposes to use it in any real sense of the term.  As I understand the Minister now, the only way he intends to use his discretion is in respect of decisions which have already been taken, perhaps in collaboration with Fóir Teoranta, to run down a factory's work force.</P>
      <P>I will put it to him this way.  An industry or factory has, say, 200 workers.  It closes down next September.  In the months after that it will be endeavouring to find markets to open up again.  I take it I am right in saying that the Minister does not propose to apply the premium system to that factory?  In other words, no encouragement whatever will be given to a factory under these conditions to open up again and take on more men.  The scheme will not apply.  Of course, the Minister has the power to do that under this Bill but, from what he says, I take it he does not propose to use that power in this respect.  Am I right in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the discretion, even outside State companies, where a case is brought to me.  I have the discretion to decide on a notional base level of employment on that date.  Where a firm had, perhaps the day before, employed workers they could easily have employed the following Wednesday I have discretion. One cannot set down in statutory form the extent of that discretion. That would have to be examined by the local manpower officer.  If it were a case of people being employed three months before, that would fall outside the ambit of discretion.  We all wish to see that genuine cases are not excluded from the benefits of the scheme.  The concept of a notional base level of employment on that date gives us that flexibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about the day before or about industries that may be in the process of closing around the period of June 20th.  I am talking about an industry that lets off workers in September, October, November or December.  In that case, <Col N="1123" /> the Minister does not propose to apply the premium scheme as an encouragement to get those workers back.  Is that not the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme comes into force on that date in June.  The scheme's benefits are designed to assist those employers who increase their work force from that date onwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, leaving aside marginal cases around the last half of June, in the case of factories that let off workers or closed down, during the autumn, winter and spring, the Minister does not propose to pay premiums to them as an encouragement to get workers back.  That is clearly the position.  Now we know where we are.  This seems to me to be quite wrong.  A worker is unemployed or on the register, irrespective of the fact that the work force in a particular factory may have been such-andsuch on June 20th.  Many industries have been able to resist so far the problems facing them and they have been able to keep on their workers. Some industries have kept on workers past June 20th at a loss to themselves because they were unwilling to let workers go until it became absolutely clear that they had to.  Industries of this kind may well find themselves having to let workers off in the autumn and winter.</P>
      <P>I am unable to see why, under these circumstances, the Minister cannot agree to use the powers he undoubtedly will have under the scheme to pay premiums in such cases.  I can see that there could be possibilities of evasion but, after all, the Minister is specifically giving himself power in section 3 to decide not merely the industries that will benefit but individual premises, individual factories, inside each industry.  He is empowered to say this worker will get it and that worker will not.  He has absolute <i>carte blanche</i>.  It is perfectly open to him to say: &ldquo;On my honest assessment of your claim for a premium, I do not think it is justified.  This is a fiddle.&rdquo;  He need not put it that way. He can say: &ldquo;I will pay the premium here and I will not pay it there.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> I can see that the Minister might feel he had a problem in deciding whether an industry had genuinely let people off during the autumn because they simply had no work for them, or whether they were letting them off with a view to re-employing them and getting the premium.  After all, he has the power to decide off his own bat whether or not a case is justified.  In addition I would have thought he has the guideline of redundancy payments. If someone has been let off in industry during the autumn or winter, if it is a case of redundancy as opposed to merely somebody being sacked for some other reason, if he is in receipt of redundancy payment, I should have thought the Minister was perfectly safe in assuming that it was a genuine case of redundancy.  After all investigations are made before he is allowed his payments.  In that case the Minister could pay premiums as an encouragement to that industry to open up.  If an industry lets off workers or has to shut down, the time comes when markets have improved a bit, or stocks have been run down, and the manufacturer may say: &ldquo;Perhaps I could open&rdquo;, and then he thinks: &ldquo;It is a marginal matter and I am afraid I will continue to lose money.&rdquo;  In such a marginal case &mdash;it inevitably arises sooner or later&mdash; the payment of premium could be the thing that decided an industry to start up again in November rather than in January or February.  It could make all the difference and would be a considerable help to employment.  Limiting it to either 20th June or a week, perhaps, one side or the other, will simply mean that any further falls in employment in industry during the autumn, winter and spring, will not qualify for premiums under the scheme.  As I said, it is entirely past history and does not cover future events.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to this matter on Second Stage.  In the Minister's reply on Second Stage I presumed that he was referring to the cases mentioned by Senator Yeats.  I am appalled that the flexibility he talks about, and which should be enshrined in the Bill, does not cover <Col N="1125" /> cases that may arise in the autumn and winter of this year.  If the Minister is only referring to marginal cases in and about the end of June, that is not enough.  We are into an economic crisis now that will not blow away in a matter of weeks.  We are into one that we will have to live with for at least a year.  We will have this type of situation arising throughout the autumn and winter.</P>
      <P>I presumed from what the Minister said in reply to Senator Yeats' amendment that he has the statutory flexibility not to tie himself to 20th June, or thereabouts, and that he can, as he said in relation to the agricultural sector this morning, deem any other day, from now until the scheme finishes on 26th June, 1976, to be an operative day for the purpose of the functioning of the scheme.  There is no need for the Minister, or the Minister for Finance, to be apprehensive about any abuse of the scheme because we have the Minister's own manpower service; we have the criteria on which redundancy payments are established; we have ample scope.  Tied in with the flexibility of the Bill which appeals to me, the discretion is his on the information available to him from existing State agencies to decide whether or not there is a <i>bona fide</i> case arising in September, October, November, or December, to whom the scheme should apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am thinking in particular of the efficient industrialists who have so far weathered the storm, the industry that has lasted through the economic storm of the past nine months, and is still there, maybe at a loss but still functioning.  If such an industry, in face of a rising economic blizzard, finally goes under in September or October for the most genuine reasons &mdash;reasons that can be assessed by the Minister and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;in that situation cannot the Minister exercise the wide powers he has under the Bill and regard the date the industry finally runs into trouble as the operative date?  It floundered for genuine reasons and if it wishes to restructure the company and get going again, <Col N="1126" /> surely it should get the employment premiums set out in the Bill.  That is the purpose of our amendments.</P>
    <P>The last two lines of Senator Yeats' amendment referring to the level of workers on 20th June, 1975, reads: &ldquo;...provided that a date which is later than that date may be specified in respect of certain industries or activities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Surely there is no man better equipped than the Minister, with the information available to him from State agencies, to specify a later date in respect of specific industries or activities where he is satisfied the case is completely <i>bona fide</i>.  I am only pleading in respect of <i>bona fide</i> industries who may wish to re-start after being forced to stop at any date between now and the end of the scheme.  It is not enough that the Minister will limit his flexibility to marginal cases in and about 20th June.  What we are seeking is that he would apply himself under the scheme envisaged in the Bill on an ongoing basis to troubles that might arise in areas of industry between now and the expiration of the scheme.  I should like to hear the Minister on that aspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Bill refers to all cases after its start in June.  Firms or industries that bring on any increase in their workforce after that date will benefit from the scheme.  Firms such as the Senator mentioned which are encountering difficulties now, in the autumn or at any time during the duration of the scheme will benefit from it if they bring on any extra workers.  The scheme is intended as an aid to industry over the months of waiting until the general economic recovery takes place, which is expected by economists in most countries to take effect next summer.  The effects of that general economic recovery will be slow in reducing unemployment.  But we hope to see the first effects of the unemployment reduction becoming more marked in the early summer months of next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> The legislation is designed to bring us to that point.  It is not designed at all nor do we claim it to be designed as a measure to assist industries closing and opening.  Obviously, the industry in the kind of difficulty mentioned by Senators would be that ideally suited for purposes of this legislation, the small firm or industry which has been undergoing considerable difficulties and which believes that there is a possibility of doing extra work during the coming months and which the State can now assist in bringing on extra workers.  That is really the purpose of the legislation.  I understand the feeling of Senators that it should face in all directions, considering the industrial difficulties that may arise at present.  The Bill can only succeed by adhering consistently to the objectives set out for its success, namely, inducement to industry to take on extra employees over these ensuing winter months or early spring until the general recovery itself is sufficient inducement for industry to take on workers who have been let go.</P>

      <P>The Minister is simply not correct in saying that this Bill will cover industries that take on workers in the autumn.  It would cover them in the single case&mdash;and indeed the somewhat likely case in most cases&mdash; that they are in a position during the autumn to take on workers beyond what they had in June.  That might be so if, say, an industry has closed down on June 20th.  Obviously, anything after that is sheer gain.  Any workers they take on from then on obviously will rate for the premium. But a firm that closes down in, say, September is in a totally different position.  If a firm with 200 workers closes down in September the Minister says it can benefit from the premium.  So it can, provided it goes past 200.  In respect of the first 200 workers it takes back it gets no premium at all, because it had 200 on June 20th.  It closes down in September. It has to take back 200 workers with no assistance whatever from this scheme.  Only then, if it manages to get the 201st or 202nd worker, does the premium system begin to apply. <Col N="1128" /> That is not realistic in present-day terms.</P>
      <P>How many industries will be in a position in practice to increase their activities under present economic conditions?  That is not really the problem we face at all.  If an industry's export markets are such that it is in a position to expand, I should think it would find it very profitable to expand, irrespective of this scheme. I would not have thought that was a problem with which we should be dealing at all.  I am sure it is not what the Minister had in mind in introducing this Bill.  The problem with which we are dealing in this scheme is quite different.  It applies where an industry is working at well below its maximum possible output, has had either to close down altogether or to reduce its workforce and I should have thought, the aim of these premiums was to encourage them to take back people. This is what happens to firms around June 20th.  A firm that was working with only half its workforce on June 20th which takes on anybody beyond that figure will get the premium, whereas a firm that closes down or cuts its workforce in September, October, November, December, January, right through to spring, gets nothing at all until and unless it gets past the figure for June 20.</P>
      <P>The only argument one can see against the Minister exercising the flexibility we ask is the possibility of evasion, that a factory might sack people in order to take them back and get the premium.  With the ample powers the Minister is taking in this Bill I should have thought it would have been perfectly possible to weed out such cases, particularly if the Minister were to go by the figures for redundancy payments.  If a firm was behaving in the way I have suggested, quite obviously the people concerned would not be awarded redundancy payments.  But where redundancy payments are in force it would seem very simple for the Minister to deduce therefrom that there was a genuine case of redundancy and that, therefore, the premium ought be payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By limiting it in this way the Minister is very greatly limiting the number <Col N="1129" /> of people who could benefit from these premiums.  It becomes a kind of a lottery.  Even if a factory closed down, shall we say, last May, opened up briefly in the second half of June and then closed down again in September it would not benefit from these premiums.  It is mere chance as to the number of people a particular industry happens to employ around the second half of June.  The Minister is limiting it, for whatever reason, in such a way that the scheme will benefit fewer people that it could otherwise benefit, in particular the 20,000 or <Col N="1130" /> 30,000 people who lose their jobs between now and the spring.  For practical purposes they will not benefit at all.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 4 has been ruled out of order. Amendment No. 5 has already been debated.  I understand there is a textual correction to be made.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 5:</P>

      <P>There is a question here of perhaps an extra comma.  The intention of this amendment is to provide for consultation between myself and the Minister for Finance in determining the manufacturing industries and activities in those industries which will be included in the scheme.  As regards agriculture, including horticulture, the intention is that determinations <Col N="1131" /> under the scheme should be my sole decision, without consultation with the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The amendment, as it appears on the list of amendments, contains a comma after the word &ldquo;industries&rdquo;.  That comma should not have been inserted. I have consulted the parliamentary draftsman.  His advice is that I refer to this typographical error that a comma appears in the amendment which would result in a duplication of commas.  Therefore, the amendment to be passed should not include the comma.  Unless anyone feels very strongly about the question I will, with the permission of all, drop the extra comma.</P>

      <P>I would hate to have a duplication of commas.  But I feel that the whole meaning of this important amendment is changed because of the non-existence of a comma.  It makes life rather difficult for anyone in future years trying to understand what this is about.  I suggest that it might be possible on Report Stage to make a rather more specific amendment to this subsection which would make it quite clear what the Minister intends to do without relying in this way on commas.  I might try and draft something for Report Stage which would, without altering in any way the meaning as intended by the Minister, make it considerably clearer because I hate the thought of a section changing its meaning utterly because of the non-existence of a comma or the duplication of commas.</P>

      <P>I shall not go into <Col N="1132" /> the technicalities of the amendment just referred to, but the basic thinking behind the Minister's decision is to exclude the agricultural sector from the necessity on the part of the Minister for Labour to consult the Minister for Finance and get his consent.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that under this section the consent of the Minister for Finance is still required in respect of manufacturing industries.  In the amendment the Minister has correctly, although it may not be clear, excluded the agricultural sector from the need for this consent.  The Minister said this morning that the reason he did that was that the various applications from the agricultural sector would be many, varied and of different categories.  I would suggest to the Minister for Labour that he consider seriously, between now and Report Stage, extending the principle he adopted in his amendment <i>vis-à-vis</i> the agricultural sector to manufacturing industries as well.  The Minister still has around his neck the albatross of the consent of the Minister for Finance written in to subsection (1) of section 3.  I fail to see the need for it, particularly in the context of what the Minister is doing in this section.  What the Minister is doing, in effect, amounts to a relief as far as the Exchequer is concerned.  If the Bill is being confined to people on unemployment benefit going out of benefit&mdash;£12 to be diminished after six months, £12 being paid to the employer&mdash;there is a net gain to the Exchequer in that situation.  Therefore, every person taken out of benefit, provided they come within the scheme will, in effect, cost the Exchequer £12 only, which would be a saving when related to benefit and in particular in relation to pay-related benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that is the situation.  In that type of situation&mdash;and I am open to correction if I am wrong in that <Col N="1133" /> analysis&mdash;I fail to see the need for the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance is necessary in a Bill of this kind to curb a Minister who engages in excessive expenditure to the detriment of the Exchequer.  Here is a case where the Minister for Labour is being obliged to operate the scheme on certain criteria, the main criteria being that the employer takes on people who are in benefit.  By reason of taking on people who are in benefit, he, the employer, then benefits to the extent of £12 for each such employee.  It is not a situation where there is any danger of the Minister for Labour exceeding his mandate in regard to expenditure.  It is a situation where, within the ambit of this scheme, the Minister for Labour will be giving the Exchequer a net gain in the balance between premium payment and benefit.  Surely it would be, in the interests of expedition and of flexibility to ensure that the matters designed to be cured by this Bill are dealt with as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider between now and the passage of this Bill, either in this or the other House, asking the Minister for Finance to delete the words &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;, thereby having a section that would be totally flexible, giving the necessary authority to the Minister for Labour to deal with this matter in a flexible, open and, above all, urgent and expeditious manner. I am certain that he, as Minister for Labour, would welcome a section of that kind.  I would urge him to get his colleague to agree to that deletion. The deletion has already been adopted by him in respect of applications from the agricultural section. I am saying that a much greater degree of urgency and immediacy exists in regard to the applications from the manufacturing industry sector, because obviously the great weight of the Bill is directed at relief in that direction.</P>
    <P>This is the area where the Minister requires flexibility, requires a mandate to act in an immediate and urgent <Col N="1134" /> manner.  He is restricting and inhibiting himself by incorporating in this section the consent of the Minister for Finance.  In particular, I do not see its necessity in a Bill of this kind which represents an overall benefit to the Exchequer, apart from being of benefit to the economy, socially and economically, if it is successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is no defence to say it is just usual.  But in any expenditure at all it is customary to have consultation with the Minister for Finance.  I do not see any possibility of difficulties arising here because the point has been made repeatedly that there would be no ceiling to expenditure under this Bill. On the other hand, it would be a mistake to think that expenditure in this area must not be carefully scrutinised because it is designed to induce employment where it would not have occurred other than through the inducement offered in this legislation.</P>
      <P>We do not mention the necessity of consultation in the case of agriculture because that is a generic name for an entire industry.  That does not hold for the industrial section.  There are subsections of that industrial sector.  Therefore, we think it tidier to refer to consultation in that context. There is no particular limitation seen on the success of the scheme because of the necessity to consult the Department of Finance in general.  It is a necessary dimension in all legislation of a spending character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was using the words &ldquo;consult the Department of Finance.&rdquo;  If that was all that was involved we would not really worry about it.  Unfortunately it is not &ldquo;consult&rdquo; that is involved at all.  It is to get the consent of the Minister for Finance, which is quite a different matter.  Because of the insertion of these words in this subsection it means that, in so far as it relates to manufacturing industry, not one single penny can be spent by the Minister, nor indeed any other arrangements made for the implementation of the scheme without the <Col N="1135" /> actual consent of the Minister for Finance, with all that that involves.</P>
      <P>I attempted to put down an amendment to delete those words.  I was told that in accordance with precedent and so on I could not do so, on the grounds that deleting these words imposed a potential charge on public funds.  The implication is very strong there that the consent of the Minister for Finance is a method of saving money.  I have no doubt at all that the Minister is more than willing to carry through this scheme with the utmost effectiveness.  Unfortunately, I am equally certain that the Department of Finance, or I suppose the Minister for Finance is the man we must refer to in this House, will inevitably, and particularly in the light of the present budgetary situation, be trying to cut down as far as possible on expenditure. It is all very well to talk about open-ended expenditure, but the extent of the open-ended expenditure will depend on the manner in which this scheme is framed.  I fear that because of the words &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo; the arrangements made in this scheme will be as limiting as is reasonably possible for the Minister for Finance to devise.</P>
      <P>It is particularly difficult to understand the continued insistence on the insertion of these words in the light of the fact that the Minister had specifically and rather ambiguously removed the Minister for Finance from the proceedings with regard to agriculture.  His point appears to be that because of the numerous employers involved in different parts of the country in agriculture it could be difficult and time-consuming to bring the Department of Finance in on every case.  Once the decision has been taken in principle to exclude any reference to the Minister for Finance and exclude the necessity for getting the consent of the Minister for Finance in respect of agricultural matters, it is difficult to see in principle why the same could not be done in relation to the manufacturing industry. It is hard to see why this should be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> I feel&mdash;I hope I am wrong&mdash;that the Minister for Finance has insisted that this should be inserted and retained in the Bill and that he does not feel the same urgency about the agricultural aspect of it on the grounds that the amount of money that will be involved will inevitably be relatively small.  The Minister feels that the main bulk of expenditure will be in industry rather than agriculture and he wants to keep his hand in there.</P>
    <P>There are other matters that arise under this section.  First of all a small point: I attempted in an amendment to delete subsection (3).  It was out of order on the grounds that there was a potential charge on public funds.  I sought to delete subsection (3) because I am not clear why it is necessary to have it.  It is not that I object to what is in it but it seems unnecessary and tautological.  We are told in subsection (1) of this section that the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, determine the activities and specified industries to which the scheme applies.  Further down in subsection (3) it is stated that the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, specify the industries and classes of persons to which the scheme does not apply. This, I have no doubt, is in accordance with some obscure tradition of the parliamentary draftsman.  It seems eccentric and quite unnecessary that in the first subsection you say the Minister can set down precisely what the scheme applies to and in the third subsection he can also say what it does not apply to.  If one eliminates the things to which it has not been applied by the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a normal convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems a bad convention. If you eliminated subsection (3) not even a comma of this Bill would be changed.  However, I am not going to fight over it.  I mentioned it because it is one of these conventions of the parliamentary draftsman that we could do without.  Bills are complicated enough without adding subsections that have no meaning at all. <Col N="1137" /> There is a far more important point on subsection (2).  At lines 36, 37 and 38 it states:</P>
      <P>...in respect of such a determination of a person or class of persons the Minister may include a requirement of a specified minimum period of unemployment.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said he proposes in his scheme to require that before a premium can be paid in respect of any person he shall have to be continuously on the live register for not less than the four weeks immediately preceding his first employment under this programme.  This seems quite unnecessary. The feeling apparently is that if a person were to be given a job and had a premium paid in respect of him inside the four-week period he could be merely changing jobs.  I cannot see that that matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Senator will accept that there is a necessity for a period of unemployment before the person can benefit from the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I am making.  I do not accept that.  I will explain why.  The aim of this scheme is to put more people at work and off the register.  If a factory is taking on workers in circumstances in respect of which the Minister is prepared to pay a premium, they are taking people off the unemployment register, people probably that they would otherwise not take.  Whether they take a person who is three days unemployed or six months unemployed is of importance to the worker concerned, but in so far as the Minister's aim is concerned to get people into extra employment, the situation is unchanged either way.  One must look at the industries concerned.  Maybe they had let off workers or closed down altogether and were therefore below their normal level and are now taking people on in circumstances under which a premium can be paid.  The aim is surely achieved if they take on extra workers, with the encouragement of these premiums.  Whether the <Col N="1138" /> worker is unemployed for a short or long period does not seem to me to effect the matter in principle at all.</P>
      <P>The danger is that if you have in a small country town a factory which lets off workers on a Friday and the other factory in the town is hoping to be able to increase its work force beyond the 20th June level, it will offer the job to one of the people who became unemployed on the Friday to start on the following Monday.  Under the Minister's scheme as it stands, they cannot do that because they will not get the £12 premium.  They might have to go 20 miles before they would be able to get somebody who would qualify under the scheme.  The local worker who is going to be on the register with everybody else will not get the job because of the absence of a premium around his head.  I do not think the Minister's point is a good one.  We must think in terms of the overall number on the register and not the actual length of time the workers have been unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator and I disagree again about the need for a qualifying period of unemployment.  It would be a mistake to think that one should not have criteria.  One of the criteria of the Bill is that it should assist those rendered unemployed as a result of the current recession, mainly in manufacturing industries, but there is a possibility that workers may be usefully re-employed in agriculture. The main brunt of the legislation is directed towards the manufacturing industry&mdash;textile and footwear and all the industries which have suffered most grievously over recent months.  These are the industries which require some form of inducement to bring back workers.  We therefore had to establish a genuine basis of need to ensure that that criterion is fulfilled in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consent of the Minister for Finance puts no limitation on the effectiveness of this legislation.  I accept the Senator's sentiments as being genuinely meant, but I am satisfied with the section as it stands.  I do not see that the amendment suggested, <Col N="1139" /> which has already been discussed, would add anything to the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a further point I would like to make.  What is the position of someone who has been in receipt of unemployment benefit for the maximum 312 days and who then has to go over to unemployment assistance?  Is the Minister saying that under his scheme such a person will not qualify for the payment of a premium?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme as I understand it was that premiums would be paid in respect of full-time employment of persons who (a)&mdash;and this is the essential point&mdash;were in receipt of unemployment benefit at any time after 20th June, 1974.  I am speaking of a person who has been out of work for maybe a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me from looking at the weekly unemployment figures that come to us that about 3,000 people, on June 20th, had been on unemployment benefit for the full 312 days and had gone over to unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>312 days would bring us back to 1973, so, in effect, the Senator is giving an even longer payment period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear from the figures that come to us weekly that, while the overall figure of 101,000&mdash;102,000 remains the same, there has been an increase of about 3,000 in those on unemployment assistance and a fall of about 3,000, inside the overall figure, on the number on unemployment benefit.  It would appear, therefore, that there <Col N="1140" /> are at least a couple of thousand who are now on assistance who had formerly been on benefit.  I should have thought that it would be pretty easy to arrange the scheme in such a way that such people who were on assistance only after June 20th, provided they had exhausted their unemployment benefit, would qualify.  I am not suggesting the Minister should bring in people who are on assistance simply because they never had stamps. I am talking about a case where somebody had been on unemployment benefit and was on assistance on or after June 20th.  I would have thought the Minister really should allow for such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

      <P>I think in that case he would be all right, because he would at least have one day's benefit in the period in question.  The whole purpose of the Bill is to tide us over the present recession.  As we pointed out at an earlier stage in this discussion, always in this country unhappily we have lived at the best of times apparently at peace with the world in which we had over 7 per cent of our insured population unemployed. All through the sixties we lived with that extraordinarily high unemployment rate.  As I said, no other European country would tolerate such a figure.  We did tolerate it throughout all those years. Now in the present recession superadded to that chronic unemployment situation which this country has always suffered we have extra thousands of workers unemployed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Senator may cite this or that example, but the fact is that in most cases the unemployed person will have drawn one day's benefit and any of these men and women would qualify under the section.</P>

      <P>I could follow the Minister down the political path of past history he has taken, but as I am interested in the production of a good Employment Premium Bill I do not propose to do so.  I should just say I do not accept his interpretation and leave it at that.  Again on this question of unemployment assistance, if any person has exhausted his unemployment benefit before June 20th, under the Minister's scheme he does not qualify.  It is no use telling me that if he even has one day after June 20th he will qualify.  I am well aware of that.  I am not talking about that case.  I am talking about a case where somebody has exhausted his unemployment benefit before June 20th. That person will not qualify for a premium.  The Minister may tell me that no one before June 20th has exhausted his unemployment benefit. If he says that, that is all right but I believe there are at least 2,000 or 3,000 who before June 20th had exhausted their unemployment benefit. If that is so, they should be in a position to qualify for premiums.  It is as simple as that and there is no problem involved.  The Minister could with the greatest of ease arrange in his scheme that such persons would qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting, as I say, that the ordinary recipient of unemployment assistance should qualify under this scheme.  I am not talking at all about people who are on unemployment benefit on June 20th and who went on to assistance after that.  I am talking about the people who went on unemployment assistance before June 20th.  The Minister may tell me there are no such people, but I suspect there are.  My own interpretation of the figures is that there are probably 2,000 or 3,000 but whatever the number, even if there are only a <Col N="1142" /> couple of hundred, they should certainly be brought in under this scheme.</P>

      <P>If the Minister tells me there are no such people then that is all right.  I will accept that.  If there are no people who have exhausted their 312 days unemployment benefit before June 20th the point does not arise.  If there are such people then it is not a matter of disagreement.  It is a matter of bringing them under this scheme.  The Minister for Labour in any Government should certainly regard it as outrageous that a man who has been unemployed since 1973 and has exhausted his 312 days on unemployment benefit, is unable to qualify for a premium because of a technicality.  We must get an answer on this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will have the answer.  I am satisfied with the scheme as it stands here.  That is the answer.  The position is that a person who first lost employment in July, 1973, as far back as that, would not exhaust his unemployment benefits until June, 1974, and he would qualify.  It would be a very small, unrepresentative group indeed who would fall into the special category mentioned by the Senator.  I do not propose to deal with that category. The section is satisfactory to me as it stands.  That is the answer the Senator has from me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>At least we know where we are.  The Minister for Labour, in other words, says that if there is somebody who has been two years on the unemployment register before June 20th, who has exhausted his unemployment benefit and gone on to a much lower level of unemployment assistance, in fact, himself and his family suffering considerable deprivation, he does not propose to include such a person in the scheme.  He has the power to amend the scheme.  In fact there is no amended scheme.  He has the power to frame this scheme in such a way that without the slightest difficulty such people, be they many <Col N="1143" /> or few, can be included.  The Minister has stated categorically that he does not propose to include such people.  I can only regard that statement as outrageous coming from a Minister of Labour.</P>

      <P>All I can say is that whatever other gifts he may possess, the Senator does not know very much about the statistics of unemployment. One cannot be an expert in every area. The State has amply provided for unemployment in social welfare benefits.  The Senator may have noticed the changes which have occurred in social welfare generally. This Bill is designed to bring people, out of work due to the present recession, back into gainful employment. A person who was unemployed for the length of time for which the Senator is concerned would be unemployable under this scheme.  That person's needs would be totally different; he would need a long training course. The Senator may know that this year the Government are spending almost £9 million in the expansion of their training programme.  I answered Senator Ferris on this point yesterday. Never before in the State's industrial training history have the Government spent more in the expansion of training resources.</P>

If the Senator wants these global answers on sections of the Bill I am prepared to give them.  I can assure Senator Yeats that the needs of the minority he mentions are looked after by a different approach entirely; either in retraining them for industrial employment at some stage or, if they are totally unsuitable and regard themselves psychologically unsuitable to re-enter employment, then they are looked after by the Government's unemployment schemes.  In general <Col N="1144" /> their problems are much more deepseated and serious than those of the newly out of work for whom this scheme is primarily designed.  For the longer-term unemployed it is a question of retraining; they will be given new skills so that they can enter the work force at a higher wage than they had when they left.  It belongs to a different department.  I would refer the Senator back to the Bill and this section with which I am totally satisfied.</P>

      <P>Surely Senator Yeat's point will become increasingly valid over the next 12 months if unemployment continues to rise at the same level as over the last 12 months. What the Minister has just stated in relation to the difference in category between people who are on quasipermanent or permanent unemployment assistance&mdash;the Minister has a valid point there&mdash;refers back to 1972 when there was reasonably full employment. The Minister is talking about a permanent unemployed force who are in receipt of unemployment assistance.  Senator Yeats was talking about the situation over the past year and in the coming year, where capable working people will go from unemployment benefit to unemployment assistance by reason of the long period of their enforced unemployment. These people do not fall into the category covered by traditional unemployment assistance.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 8:</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) empowers me to make amendments to employment premiums.  The payments will be made to an employer who is eligible under the scheme and in respect of employees who are also eligible under the scheme.  In case there is misunderstanding, I have suggested the deletion of the word &ldquo;weekly&rdquo; as a drafting amendment to avoid confusion between the rate of the premium proposed, which is £12 per week, and the actual method of payment of the premium which will be four-weekly in arrears in the case of industry and by way of a single payment in the case of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I was under the impression when I saw this amendment that it was to cover the agricultural situation where they are to be paid in nine-monthly lots.  I suppose it becomes even more necessary because of the change in the agricultural position.  I should like to inquire about the method of paying the agricultural premium, but I probably could do it on the section rather than on the amendment.  We do not have any objection to this amendment as it stands.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), line 6, to delete &ldquo;amount&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;percentage of applicable wage rates.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem here is that the Minister's figure which he intends to pay under the scheme of initially £12 and after next March £6 is geared to the lower-paid workers, particularly female workers in textiles who because of the delay in industry of introducing equal pay are still grossly underpaid in many areas of the economy.  Any resulting increase in employment will be welcome.  But in <Col N="1146" /> many other sections of industry, particularly where skilled workers are involved, bearing in mind that the average male industrial wage is approximately £45, the amount of the premium&mdash;£12 or £6&mdash;is inadequate and will not have more than a marginal effect.  The Minister would achieve a much more effective result by fixing some kind of percentage on the wage and this would greatly help the skilled workers&mdash;earning approximately £50 or £60&mdash;who, as the scheme stands, will derive very little benefit from these premiums.  It will not be any incentive to an employer to take on additional workers.  On the other hand, in the case of textiles, particularly in the case of female workers, a £12 premium will be a considerable incentive.  This scheme will have an unbalanced effect.  The Minister should have more flexibility in regard to the fixing of these premiums.  As it stands, the Minister will not get the full effect which he would get if he accepted this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>For a programme of this sort, even in the sense of perhaps not being totally sensitive to the individual problems of a particular firm or sector, it is better for its success and ease of administration that the rules are simple and easily comprehended. This is the basic argument for the payments we have devised on a flat rate.  Premiums differentiated in relation to wage rates would give rise to very serious difficulties and would mean that the Government would be forced to adopt a very cumbersome administrative machine to implement the provisions of this legislation.  It is my intention to keep the administrative side of the programme to the bare minimum; to operate the programme directly for industry and see that its benefits go directly to industry; to avoid as far as possible the establishment of yet another body of inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to have a percentage rate such criteria would have to be brought into effect as wage rates that are based on such a great variety of factors, the nature of the employment, <Col N="1147" /> skills involved, what the particular wage rates were in relation to the skills, the time work and the piece work element, duration of the employment, which would have such elements as service pay, location of the employment, regional differences and so on.  All these matters would be part of the criteria which would have to be taken into account if we were to adopt a percentage approach.  Then there would be different rates applying to different industries, from textiles to engineering.  There would be possible allegations between one employment or another, of one group saying that X got more than we got. For all these reasons, and certainly for ease of administration, the flat rate is preferable.  I take the Senator's point that ideally, perhaps, percentage might have some arguments behind it for a programme that was to operate for the period of this recession, to answer its problems and to aid those industries which would be most affected.  The flat rate seems to have the better of the argument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's point.  Undoubtedly the flat rate idea eases the administration of the scheme.  Senator Yeat's amendment is the right one in principle, that it should be varied as a percentage of the wage existing in particular industry. I can see a whole area of industry where this £12 premium will not be sufficiently attractive, particularly with the diminution after next March. The Minister will find himself tied to low wage rate industries where it may be attractive.  I am thinking particularly of the textile industry.  From his own statement that would appear to be already the case.  The textile sector has been a major applicant so far in regard to the applications received in his Department since the announcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think tying oneself to the particular varied aspects of the textile industry, the making-up sector, which has traditionally been a sector of low wage rates, by reason of a fairly low flat rate, having regard to wage rates that existed in more sophisticated <Col N="1148" /> industries that the Minister will reach his target of 10,000.  When one considers the limited number of industries,&mdash;the textile and the shoe industries are two obvious ones&mdash;and when one considers that this low flat rate diminishes after nine months would be largely applicable to these low wage rate industries, I fail to see how the Minister will get his target of generating 10,000 jobs when he is confined to this area by reason of the low level flat rate.  The Minister may be able to convince me otherwise, but in any area where the wage rates are running beyond £40 per week the £12 premium is a diminishing incentive as far as the employer in that area is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Senator's point but experience will bear out one or other interpretation.  I have already indicated the reason that inclined us to the flat rate argument.  Only experience will show if we reach the target and whether this flat rate constitutes a bar to reaching it.</P>

I hope the Minister will keep an open mind with regard to the possibility of changing the rates of premium and having higher rates of premium for specific industries.  He may well find that industries that have been hard hit are simply unable to make any use of the scheme.  He has given himself the power in the scheme to vary rates of premium and I hope he will keep an open mind as to the possibility of having higher rates for certain sections.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, with regard to the nine month payment to farmers who take on extra workers or indeed to horticulturists, I take it that if the nine months begin, say, at the beginning of January next, there would be three months at the £12 rate and the remaining six months would be at the £6 rate.  Is the Minister reasonably sure that this wait of nine months will be already an incentive to farmers?</P>
      <P>One of the Senators opposite suggested that there might be payments on the way.  I know the danger with payments say, every three months, is that a farmer might let somebody go.  If a farmer knew that he was liable to be sued by the Department of Labour for repayment of the sum, that would be a disincentive to behaviour of that kind.  It would be a considerable incentive to farmers if they could feel that they would be paid something along the way, perhaps a quarter of the total after three months and again up to six months. To ask a man to wait nine months before he gets anything is a discouragement. After all, who knows whether any of us will be alive in nine months time?  One likes to see something in the hand straight away. The Minister should consider this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a more important point under subsection (3) where the provision is that: &ldquo;the Scheme may provide for the reduction or non-payment of an employment premium in a case where the Minister is satisfied that the employer concerned is in receipt of, or has received, moneys by way of a grant or loan from any body established by statute for the purpose of promoting, encouraging or assisting employment or industry&rdquo;.  The two <Col N="1150" /> bodies one thinks of in this connection are the IDA and Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>I take it the Minister can hardly have Fóir Teoranta in mind because it would be unreasonable, to put it mildly, to say to industries which are suffering from unemployment and which in many cases are being helped by Fóir Teoranta that they cannot get premiums.  I take it that the IDA is intended.  I would be glad to hear from the Minister what exactly he has in mind in this regard.  The fact that an industry is being helped by the IDA is irrelevant in this context. Surely the point is that the industry is not doing well.  It has had to let people off.  We all want to encourage the taking on of extra workers, and the fact that they may have been paid money by the IDA, or are still being paid by the IDA, should not affect the basic issue, which is, getting as many people back to work as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to go some of the way in supporting Senator Yeats.  I have in mind Shannon Airport Industrial Estate, where almost all the industries there have been given grant aid or were aided through other State sources.  I am aware that this is an enabling clause, but I would like to have the Minister's assurance that it will be used with discretion, particularly having in mind industries which have received grants through the IDA and are giving substantial employment and for reasons completely outside their control are going through a very difficult period just now.  As I said, I have in mind Shannon Airport, which is suffering from reason that are well-known, but are mainly due to falling off in export markets for which most of which were established some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This discretion is mine under this section.  The point had to be made that where moneys were coming from another State agency, maybe for a conflicting reason&mdash;very often grants come from Fóir Teoranta for the purpose of reducing the work force to ensure that there is greater security in extra efficiency resulting from the reduction of the work force <Col N="1151" /> for those remaining behind.  That is a factor maybe of Fóir Teoranta's work.  At least one instance, which I mentioned earlier today, indicates the kind of discretion permitted me and the discretion we are using positively where, in fact, that firm did not qualify in terms of the starting date, where Fóir Teoranta were already in and where we have already come to a decision that they will qualify.  That should be ample confirmation to Senators to realise that I will use discretion here in this area always on the side of assisting genuine cases, even where such firms are in receipt of moneys from other State agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see all right that where Fóir Teoranta have actually made arrangements with a firm to run down their workforce and they are paying them money as part of this general arrangement, one could put up a case for saying that no additional State funds are necessary since Fóir Teoranta have, presumably, made arrangements to provide enough cash to keep the operation going.

      <P>Take an example, say, an IDA grant scheme.  Say that we had such a scheme for provision of employment for 40 employees on the 1st October next.  Under our scheme it would not be proposed to give premiums to that employer in respect of those workers.  At least, I would not envisage that that would be something we would do.  If the employer, as a consequence of the scheme, could show a few days later that he employed extra workers then he would qualify for those extra workers.</P>

The Senator will appreciate that seasonality is one of the things that kept us away from certain industries, their seasonal nature and the doubt that the employment would have occurred in any case without the scheme.  We want to ensure that funds here go to the areas where employment would not have occurred.  The possibility is that the benefits of this programme have brought about more speedy entry into the workforce for people who are now unemployed and, to avoid this seasonality problem we have to ensure, we have to insist on, this nine-month period.  That is why the provision is there.</P>

The offences in that particular case&mdash;of <Col N="1153" /> course it was the same Minister who was involved&mdash;were in respect of similar types of offences where an employer was suspected or accused of employing some unfortunate youth of 14 or 15 years for 50 hours a week and refused to produce records or gave false information and so on.  In that case the penalty was only £100 and £200.</P>
    <P>This seems to be a typical example in this Bill of where the Revenue was involved, where the Department of Finance and its minions come in and start worrying about their money being mis-spent, the penalties in such cases go up.  The position of some unfortunate youth who is being maltreated, made work for excessive hours and so on, should be at least as important or more important than the minor financial worries of the Department of Finance and the State in general.  I simply put down this amendment because, on principle, it is unreasonable that the fines in this case, simply because Revenue is involved, should be so much higher than where young people, who were being employed for excessive hours, were involved.</P>

      <P>We consider that the fines proposed are aimed as a deterrent course against the presentation by employers of fraudulent claims which could be very substantial because the premium in respect of any single worker could amount to £400.  We believe the fines we have imposed here are appropriate for that kind of offence.  I believe if we reduce those fines it would seem to indicate approval of that kind of offence. Therefore, I would not accept the amendment that we would reduce the fines in the section.</P>

      <P>What I have to say relates not only to section 6 but to section 7 also.  Anybody turning to this Bill to see the sanctions and penalties for breaking its provisions would find that the offences are stipulated opposite section 7 and would be forgiven for taking that the only offences created by the Bill are in section 7.  Nevertheless, section 6 also creates an offence and says there is a fine of £300.  It is really only a drafting point, but section 6 should have dealt with inspectors, and section 7 should have dealt with furnishing false information.  There should have been a separate section dealing with offences.  As it stands at the moment section 6 partly deals with offences and section 7 partly deals with offences.  It is a rather sloppy drafting, and it would be better to group the offences, who may prosecute, the time for prosecution and so on under a section dealing with offences generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Title, this concerns the principle to which I have already referred in the course of several amendments earlier.  I should like to have a definitive statement from the Minister on this aspect.  In my view the Bill, as framed, particularly in regard to its Title, confining it to manufacturing industries and agriculture, which will contribute only in a negligible way to employment, but largely confining it to manufacturing industry, is too narrow and too restrictive.  I feel very strongly that the whole range of economic activities, particularly the service industries, should be included here in the Title of the Bill, that the Title should not be just confined to certain manufacturing industries.  The Minister's amendment means that employers engaged in agriculture are added in, but we should also have our other economic activities.  I am thinking primarily in terms of the service industries in this respect.</P>
      <P>I do not have to tell the Minister for Labour the important segment of our economy that comes under the heading of service industries, the building industry, hotel industry, transportation industry, to mention just three very large sectors.  It is an area of industry I feel would respond very quickly to the stimulation of the employment premium system.  The whole food industry is also excluded from the employment premium system as well.  The Minister is in reality confining himself to a very limited range of industries.</P>
      <P>Indeed, what he had to say to us in his opening speech rather confirms what I have been saying.  He talked about the 400 inquiries that have come into his Department since the announcement of the scheme.  I take it that these inquiries can be regarded as a fair straw gallup poll of the type of industry to benefit under this scheme over the next twelve months. The Minister said:</P>
      <P>The largest volume of inquiries so far received came from the textile sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that inquiries have also been received from employers in such sectors as plastics, footwear and engineering.  That represents a reasonable <Col N="1156" /> cross-section of the 400 inquiries the Minister has received in his office so far.  It is reasonable to assume that that will represent the range of industry that will be helped by this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting very strongly to the Minister that that range of industry is too narrow if he is to generate 10,000 jobs by reason of this Bill over the next 12 months.  For practical purposes I will disregard the agricultural sector, in any sort of real employment increase.  It is only marginally important in the context of generating 10,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>If we are to achieve the target of 10,000 new jobs we will have to be realistic and deal with manufacturing industry.  The Minister has circumscribed himself to basically the textile industry, the plastics industry, the footwear industry and some forms of light engineering.  These are all areas where low wage rates obtain, particularly in the textile area.  It is an area where you will get some people, hopefully, back to work.  By reason of the oil problems these are three industries where the whole trend of economic development appears to be running against them, industries where certain low wage rates obtain and where they might be marginally helped by the £12 premium.</P>
    <P>But the whole range of sophisticated industry on which we are hoping to build a growing industrial base will be outside this employment premium system.  The one industry of potential real growth, the food processing industry, is outside the scope of the Minister's field.  The industry that we will be largely dependent on to revive our economic state of health, the building industry and the construction industry, is outside this scheme.  The transportation and tourist industries are outside the scope of this scheme.  Even if the Minister says that many of the industries I have mentioned are seasonal surely it is not beyond the wit of the Minister's Department, the National Manpower Service, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the expert agencies attaching to the two Departments to draw the appropriate distinctions between the degree of seasonality involved in regard to the base <Col N="1157" /> date of late June and any application that may be made subsequent to that date in respect of a particular employer.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to say that these industries have been excluded because at the end of June this year there may have been a degree of seasonal employment which may not have been there three or six months after and the Minister would have difficulty in applying the scheme to any industry where there was a degree of seasonal employment.  That is not enough.</P>
    <P>There is sufficient expertise available to the Minister to distinguish between what is seasonal employment and what is real employment within the context of a particular industry or sector of industry.  It should not be beyond the wit of the Minister's advisers to assess the content of seasonal employment.  It would then be left open to the Minister to have these industries within the ambit of his Bill.  This is designed to provide the Minister with a more flexible instrument. Why should he eliminate from the Title of the Bill the possibility of these industries other than manufacturing industries being included by him over the course of the next six or nine months?  He rightfully, claimed that his whole objective was to secure a flexible instrument. Indeed, I would go along with much of what he said in that direction during the course of the debate. Why then should he circumscribe himself in the Title, by not including these industries?  By including them in the Title he is not being compelled to help the whole lot of them. It is a matter again for the discretion of the Minister within section 3, where he can determine to what industries and to what activities in specified industries the scheme should apply.  He has a very wide discretion, subject to the consent of the Minister of Finance, under section 3, to determine what range of industries, and what activities of industries should receive help.  In that context the Minister can reject applications from tertiary industries, from food processing industries, from the building industry, if he regards them as having <Col N="1158" /> a seasonal content and as not meriting help under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister can separate the wheat from the chaff and decide in this area what industries or activities or aspects require help.  In the interests of giving the Minister the widest possible degree of flexibility I would suggest that he widen the restriction he has here in the title to manufacturing industries and widen it to every form of economic activity in the State. Giving the Minister that power, he can pick and choose what he thinks desirable.  Whether within the manufacturing area or this service area, or in the food processing area, he can pick and choose himself where he can stimulate employment over the next three, six or nine months.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the low rate of premium of the flat rate of £12, I would think another industry, like the textile industry which is not noted for its high wage rates, to which this would be immediately attractive, is the hotel industry.  I mention that industry straight away.  Whereas a £12 a week employment premium to employers in other industries with high individual wage rates might not be attractive, a £12 employment premium would be very attractive in the hotel industry.  It is just one example that I take.  It is an industry, rather like many aspects of the textile industry, where relatively low rates have always obtained and where the £12 would be highly attractive in stimulating expansion and employment. I just mention that as one example where this premium could be a very real stimulus.  The Minister may say there is an obvious seasonal content in employment in hotels at the end of June in a particular year, but surely it is not beyond the wit of the expertise at his disposal to separate the seasonal content from the permanent content and do the sums accordingly.</P>
    <P>Short of hearing a very good reason from the Minister, I do not see why he does not extend manufacturing industry to cover the whole range of economic activity.  It is no answer for the Minister to say that brings in a whole <Col N="1159" /> range of seasonal employment, the building industry, the hotel industry, and all sorts of difficulties.  Of course it brings in difficulties but the Minister is not compelled to say that every aspect of economic activity should be automatically helped.  As set out in section 3, this is very much a flexible discretionary measure.  The Minister is not obliged, because these are contained in the title, to help every service industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister can plead that there is a seasonal content in A, B, C, D aspects that may come to him for help.  He and his advisers can separate the wheat from the chaff.  I would suggest that there are <i>bona fide</i> cases within the service industry area that could be considered on their merits by the Minister's advisers where economic stimulation providing employment could very quickly be obtained.  The Minister is circumscribing himself from moving into that area at all by reason of not having a broader definition in the title of economic activity, and by restricting himself to manufacturing industry he is needlessly and to an unnecessary degree binding himself in regard to really stimulating the economy towards the target he aims at, and with which I agree, of getting 10,000 extra jobs through the mechanism of this measure over the next 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confident that even on the Title and the direction so far in the legislation here, we can in fact achieve the target of 10,000 people being returned to work.  The Senator has mentioned textiles.  That is certainly one of the areas interested from inquiries made so far.  There are metal work, electrical appliances, domestic appliances, plastics, the furniture industry, the footwear industry, engineering, paper manufacturing, and so on.  I am reasonably convinced from the range of industries interested in this programme that we will be able to achieve that figure of 10,000 people returned to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to only low wage industries being interested. When you consider a wage of £60 a <Col N="1160" /> week a premium of £12 a week is quite a sizeable help to any employer bringing a man back into employment. The range is there.  Such are the straits of much of the industry I have mentioned here that I am convinced that the industries are there with the vacancies which can be filled from the unemployment register to help us reach the target of 10,000.</P>
    <P>It is better that we should direct the main emphasis of this legislation into the area of most need, that we should not lose sight of the fact that this programme is designed to help industry which has been suffering grievously under the present recession. It is not there to assist the entire range of industry.  It is especially designed to give much needed aid at this period of recession to those industries which, hopefully, will resume full economic activities in the spring and early summer of next year.  We must not lose sight of the fact either that it is of temporary duration.</P>
    <P>I am confident that those conditions of recovery are even now present in some of the major industrial countries and will become even more evident here in the home economy during the course of next year.  This legislation can assist us materially in retaining workers in jobs until that recovery takes place.  Therefore, in that spirit I think the title gives me ample room to ensure that people can get the jobs and be brought off the unemployment register. The premium is satisfactory. The direction of aid mentioned in this legislation is satisfactory.  The addition of agriculture will assist us also in reaching the target of 10,000.  All I can say is that it will not be the fault of myself or my officials if we fail in that objective of bringing back 10,000 people to work.  Indeed, we will not consider the target of 10,000 as our ceiling.  We will try to go far above that if we are given the needed co-operation from employers and I am confident we will get it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 19, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;by order&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a further effort to persuade the Minister to make his regulations by order and lay the regulations before the House.  If ever there was a Bill in which regulations should be made by order and laid before the House this is the Bill.  As we complained in the course of the debate the Bill is vague in the extreme.  Nobody is quite sure what the regulations will be.  There will be considerable confusion as to the extent of the regulations which the Minister may make under section 3 and, generally speaking, it is a Bill in which regulations should be made and should be subject to the approval of both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case for this seems to be overwhelming. As the debate on the Committee stage went on in regard to the power of the Minister to make regulations, it seemed to be more and more important that we should know exactly what regulations were to be made and that we should have an opportunity of seeing them and raising points if necessary.  I have never come across a Bill where there is such a crying need for regulations to be made by order and for an opportunity to be given to both Houses to see these <Col N="1162" /> regulations and find out exactly what scheme is proposed by the Minister. In almost every Bill of any complexity there is the provision that the regulation should be made by order and should be available.  These are Bills where the details are spelled out very fully, and where it is quite clear in the course of the Bill what is proposed by the Minister, what he can do, what he cannot do, and where it is quite clear exactly what is proposed.  In these Bills the regulations are made by order and laid before both Houses.</P>
    <P>There is an overwhelming case for that in this Bill.  I cannot understand why the Minister was reluctant on Committee Stage to agree to the request for making regulations by order. Having regard to the course of the debate on Committee Stage, the case for it is much stronger now than it was even a few hours ago.  I ask the Minister to agree to this amendment. If he is not disposed to agree to it, I ask him what case he is making against it.  Why should he object to making regulations by order and laying them before both Houses?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator says, there is quite an amount of discretion permitted to me under the Bill.  We had this discussion on an earlier stage this morning.  It does not detract from the importance of what the Senator feels about the necessity of parliamentary reporting on matters of expenditure in a Bill of this kind.  I remarked in reply to the debate this morning that when looking for extra money for this purpose I will be reporting to the other House.  Quite a valid point was made by Senator Yeats that a similar procedure does not apply in reporting to this House. All I can say in defence of the lack of a necessity to have it by order is that the legislation must be so framed that there is the minimum of delay involved in the implementation of its provisions.  Of course I am answerable to both Houses on the general direction of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suggestions have been made about changes.  Senator West made the point about some further extensions in this legislation.  I declare an open <Col N="1163" /> mind.  He spoke about community employment.  That would require a return to this House.  In general, my feeling is that, subject to the control of the Oireachtas on all measures of this kind, I have laid down here the criteria and the objectives of this legislation.  Senator Lenihan made the point that I should have given myself wider terms of reference which would have permitted me unstated powers in the matter of the industries to be assisted.</P>
    <P>Senators will note I have bound myself to spelling out which industries should be assisted.  Throughout the debate on this legislation, I have been as specific as possible in saying which were the firms and what were the kinds of industries and which were the categories of unemployed we wish to assist.</P>
    <P>These are my main points in defending my position of not including the &ldquo;by order&rdquo; provision.  By order is, in general, a good procedure to follow.  It is not possible in the press of events in carrying out a programme of temporary duration to fulfil all the niceties of parliamentary usage.  It is impossible.  This is a question all democracies and parliamentary institutions have to face from time to time.  The pressure of executive business is such that one may not, down all the avenues of decision-making, report back to Parliament.  I take the Senator's point and these are my own points in reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister is not willing to accept this amendment. He is under a misapprehension in thinking that there would be a necessity to carry out all the various functions under the scheme by order. All the intricate details inside the scheme&mdash;the selection of particular employers, the selection of particular employees and workers, the small details of the scheme to which we have had a good deal of reference in the discussion&mdash;would not need to be done by order.  It would only be the original scheme and amendments to it.  As I mentioned on Committee Stage, I do not think there is any real <Col N="1164" /> delay involved in this, certainly not as much delay as is likely to be involved in the constant requirement to obtain the consent of the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan referred to the Minister acting by regulation.  I am not sure that he needs to do anything as formal as a regulation.  The whole thing can be done by some sort of administrative arrangement.  I do not think a regulation is needed.  It is outside the ordinary formal channels of ministerial activity.  I do not think the amendment would in any way reduce the possibilities of carrying out the scheme.  The Minister is perfectly right in referring to what Senator Lenihan said.  We would be willing to give him greater powers if he would take them.  Subject to the matter being laid before each House of the Oireachtas in the manner suggested by these amendments, we certainly would like to see him taking considerably greater power than he has in this Bill.</P>

It makes the matter clearer than in subsection (1) of section 3 as amended on Committee Stage, where the Minister sought to delete the necessity for the consent of the Minister for Finance in the case of payments to agriculture.  It is not clear precisely where the commas fall.  It depends entirely on the placing of a comma.  To that extent an element of ambiguity creeps in which is unnecessary.  Linguistically speaking, the amended subsection does not read well.  It is cumbersome. I would suggest to the Minister that he should accept this amendment on the grounds that it is clearer drafting and somewhat less cumbersome in style, I hope.</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1975, which I ask the House to approve, provides for a minor addition to the Garda Síochána Pensions Orders which govern the award of pensions and gratuities to members of the Garda Síochána on retirement and <Col N="1167" /> to the widows, children and dependants of deceased members of the Force.  The order before the House provides for a relatively minor amendment in the conditions governing the payment of allowances for children.</P>
      <P>The pensions orders provide for the payment of allowances up to the age of 18 in respect of children of deceased members who are receiving full-time education.  The Order now before the House raises this upper age from 18 to 21 years.  In so far as these children are concerned, the order brings the Garda scheme into line with an improvement granted in the Department of Social Welfare contributory pensions scheme, under the terms of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1969, which came into operation on 1st August, 1969.</P>
      <P>The existence of this improvement did not come to the notice of my Department, or the Force or, I must assume, the persons directly concerned until the end of 1973 when a claim was received to have the improvement applied to the Garda Síochána.  While the improvement was subsequently approved in principle, statutory effect was not given to the change because other amendments in the Garda pensions scheme were under consideration and it was hoped to incorporate them in one amending order.  Because of difficulties which are largely of a technical nature these other changes have not yet been finalised and, in the circumstances, in order to avoid any further delay in applying the improved conditions for payment of children's allowances, I have agreed at the request of the Garda Pensioners Association to proceed with this amendment, leaving the other matters to be attended to later.</P>
      <P>I commend the Order for the approval of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> In subsection (1), line 19, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;by order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment, although it is to the definition section, of section 1, relates really to the situation which arises where an accused person is undergoing the process of the evidence in his trial being heard on commission.</P>
    <P>It is provided, in section 11, that where a court, which would be in fact the Special Criminal Court, makes an order for the hearing of evidence on commission in Northern Ireland, the accused will be informed by the court that among other things subsection (d) states:</P>
    <P>while he is in custody in Northern Ireland for the purpose of the taking of the evidence, he will be immune from detention, and any kind of suit or legal process, in respect of any cause or matter, civil or criminal, arising before his arrival in Northern Ireland for the purpose aforesaid.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal of discussion of this matter on Committee Stage. We on this side of the House attempted to persuade the Minister to add to the prohibition of any kind of suit or legal process the interrogation of the accused.  We were afraid that, under the kinds of conditions which unfortunately obtain in Northern Ireland, the police or military in whose charge the accused was, could well take the opportunity of interrogating him about his activities.  These persons are, rightly or wrongly, essentially people who are accused or suspected of being members of illegal organisations, organisations dedicated to the use of violence in various forms.  Such a person on his arrival in Northern Ireland would obviously be of great interest to the security forces.  Indeed any person in charge of them who failed to take such a step would be, from the point of view of his superior officers, failing in his duty.  It would be an obvious opportunity for such people to embark on <Col N="1169" /> a process of interrogation of the accused.</P>
    <P>When I raised this matter with the Minister he said he did not think this would happen.  In that respect perhaps he is a little innocent.  Besides that the Minister suggested this could not happen because interrogation would be included in the phrase &ldquo;legal process&rdquo;. I am not sure that that is so. But, if it is so, it would seem desirable to state that fact.  Therefore, I propose that a further definition should be added to section 1 saying &ldquo;In this Act, `legal process' includes interrogation.&rdquo; It would then be made absolutely clear that in the case of an accused who travels to Northern Ireland to have the evidence of his trial heard on commission he could not be interrogated either in respect of other matters outside the scope of the trial, or in respect of the matters concerned in the trial itself.  It seems to me that as the Bill stands, the accused would be open to such interrogation, whatever form it might take.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, in order to ensure that his intention is achieved, he should accept this amendment, which would mean that an accused in such a case, could not be interrogated.  It would have the effect also under section 12 that where an accused from Northern Ireland was present in the Republic for the hearing of evidence on commission, he could not be interrogated here either. It works both ways.  This is an amendment which the Minister could very well accept and which would make absolutely clear what he intends should happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with Senator Yeats in what he is trying to achieve.  I submit that what Senator Yeats is trying to achieve is unnecessary and probably would only confuse the issue.  Perhaps I may put it this way.  Senator Yeats is worried about the possibility, the danger, or, as he sees it, the live probability of a person being questioned while in the custody of the other jurisdiction for the purpose of hearing evidence on commission.  How <Col N="1170" /> do we protect against such a situation arising?</P>
      <P>This questioning can be of two kinds only.  It can be either compulsory or non-compulsory.  There can be occasions when a person is compelled to answer questions.  We have examples of it under the Offences Against the State Act.  When a person is in such a position, such questions are part of the legal process.  Immunity from any part of the legal process is already written into the Bill.  Therefore, to add the phrase &ldquo;legal process includes interrogation&rdquo; in the case of compulsory interrogation is unnecessary and merely adding superfluous words which do not mean anything because immunity from legal process is already guaranteed.  In the rare cases in which questioning is part of the legal process, then immunity is already guaranteed.</P>
      <P>We must then consider the other area in which questioning might arise where it would be non-compulsory. The amendment would be superfluous in that case also because it does not arise.  If there is no compulsory legal right to ask questions, there is no obligation to answer questions, and no protection needed.  If there is to be abuse of that position, merely having words inserted in a statute will not alter the position one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest there is no need for this amendment; it would only add confusion to the scene.  If the odd case arises where there is a compulsory right to ask questions&mdash;a right to engage in compulsory questioning&mdash; that is part of the legal process.  It cannot arise except by specific legal process and immunity from that is guaranteed.  The only other way in which it can arise is where there is what might be called casual interrogation but that is non-compulsory. A person cannot be interrogated against his will and need not answer any question against his will.  Therefore, it would be inappropriate to provide that nobody should be allowed to ask the accused any questions at all during the time he is in the other jurisdiction because that person is <Col N="1171" /> under no obligation to answer them. If there is a mind to engage in something unlawful or not quite correct mere words in a statute here will not change that position.  I am perfectly satisfied that what Senator Yeats wants to achieve is achieved already by granting immunity from legal process. The law, as it stands at present, grants immunity from non-compulsory questioning or interrogation that does not form part of a legal process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister says.  But I am not clear as to how this legal process will operate. What guarantee will any accused in the custody of the other jurisdiction have that he will not be tortured and information compulsorily extracted. After all, we have instances of people being left standing at walls for 24 hours, being tortured and information extracted from them.  Can we guard against such a situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister takes too lightly the strong prospect that accused person who are brought to Northern Ireland to have evidence heard on commission at their trial may be cross-examined by the police or military authorities in what the Minister would describe in a non-legal way as not part of any particular judicial process.  The Minister says that in such a case an accused need not reply.  It is all very well to say that but for an accused person who is put into a room surrounded by policemen, skilled cross-examiners, throwing questions at him from all sides, it is not easy for him to remember that the Minister who introduced the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1975, says he need not reply.  His position is a little more difficult than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the point also that we discussed on an earlier stage, to which the Minister agreed on at least one occasion, that there can be situations in which under this Bill a refusal to reply could be an offence.  It is not good enough simply to say, as the Minister says, that after all if he is questioned he need not reply.  His problems in not replying could be very great.  We know the extent to which <Col N="1172" /> interrogation can take place in Northern Ireland.  We know the problem in any relationship between an accused and the police, the difficulty he would have in just sitting there and refusing to reply.  One can be absolutely certain that if the Northern Authorities did get in their temporary possession an alleged well-known member of the IRA, we could take it certainly that they would endeavour to get as much information out of him as they could before he went back across the Border.  It is one of the reasons why it seems absolutely clear that no one will exercise the choice, so-called, of travelling North in order to have the evidence heard. On the basis that they do go, they would certainly be questioned.  The Minister ought to accept this amendment in order to guard against that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dolan asked a specific question about what happens to a person who may be subjected to unlawful procedures when he goes North.  This ignores the fact that a person going North is going North on behalf of the court down here.  It is inconceivable that such a person would be subjected to any improper procedures.  As I have indicated the operations of this Bill depends on its being worked properly and in a truly reciprocal way.  There will be administrative sanctions available should there be any abuse of a person who is going North for the purpose of attending at the taking of evidence on commission. That person is in the custody of the court here, temporarily in the custody of the other jurisdiction for this specific purpose.  It is inconceivable, with the glare of publicity that would be on that person, that anything improper would be done in relation to him.  It does not make sense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 19 and 20, to delete &ldquo;does without reasonable excuse any act with intent&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;endeavours without reasonable excuse&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The aim of this amendment is not, in any way, to change the direct meaning of the text of the Bill.  It is intended to cover an unintended effect, shall we say, of subsection (2), section 1. This subsection says:</P>
      <P>Reference in this Act to an act include reference to an omission and references to the doing of an act include references to the making of an omission.</P>
      <P>We had discussion at an earlier Stage about these omissions when the Minister introduced a metaphysical concept of a positive omission and so on. I was satisfied from what the Minister said that, in certain instances&mdash;in the case of, I think he mentioned, man-slaughter&mdash;there can be certainly omissions which, in themselves, are a criminal act.  In certain other sections &mdash;the ones I seek to amend&mdash;there can be an unintended effect which one certainly would not like to see introduced in the Bill and which I think the Minister does not intend.</P>
      <P>Section 2, subsection (4)&mdash;one of the ones I seek to amend&mdash;reads:</P>
      <P>Where a person has committed an offence under subsection (1) or section 3 or attempted to commit any such offence, any other person who, in the State or in Northern Ireland, knowing or believing him to be guilty of the offence or attempt or of some other such offence or attempt, does without reasonable excuse any act with intent to impede his apprehension or prosecution in the State or in Northern Ireland shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1174" /> In other words, if one attempts to impede the apprehension or prosecution of any other person whom one believes to be guilty, if one does any act with this intent, one will be guilty of an offence.  We do not object to that.  Allowing for the context of the Bill it is a necessary section to have. The problem is that because of the Minister's definition that the meaning of the Act includes the word &ldquo;omission&rdquo; we have to read, therefore, into subsections (4) and (6) of section 2 that where anybody does, without any reasonable excuse, any omission with intent to impede the apprehension or prosecution of somebody, they shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>In the course of Committee Stage I suggested that this could mean&mdash;and certainly under certain circumstances would mean&mdash;that where the police came up to a man and said &ldquo;Do you know where So-and-So is,&rdquo; or asked him other questions related to somebody who was accused of some offence, I said refusal to answer would be an omission which, under this subsection, would justify his arrest for an offence on the ground that because he refused to answer these questions he had done, without reasonable excuse, an act with intent to impede the apprehension or prosecution of someone.  I do not think this is what the Minister intends. Certainly one would not like to see it happen.  As the Minister knows, and it is a matter that one must regret, there are, in certain parts of Northern Ireland&mdash;one thinks, for example, of parts of Derry City&mdash; there is a situation where, much as we may regret it, large sections of the local population simply do not recognise the authority or indeed the existence of the police forces.  The likelihood is that if a member of the RUC went into this area and asked somebody questions about other people who were accused of offences or who have been known to commit offences and he got the dusty answer that he would be likely to get, in certain circumstances, a refusal to reply, or perhaps even a refusal to talk to him, under these circumstances under these two subsections, he could be <Col N="1175" /> guilty of an offence.  He would not have committed an act but he would have committed an omission which is inserted into the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; by the definition clause in section 1.</P>
    <P>I sought to re-write the wording of these two subsections in a manner which I hope leaves them with precisely the same ultimate result but omitting the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; so that there should be no question of a possibility that somebody can be guilty of an offence merely because they had refused to reply to questions by the police.  To say the least of it there is some doubt in the matter.  It is a doubt to which the Minister, on a previous occasion, subscribed. Under these circumstances, the Minister would be well advised to accept these two amendments.  It does not alter the wording of the two subsections. But it makes it absolutely clear that a mere omission, a mere refusal to answer questions, would not render one guilty of an offence on the ground that one had impeded the apprehension or prosecution of someone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We debated this at considerable length on earlier Stages. I suggest that Senator Yeats's worry is unnecessary.  What he is worried about cannot arise because it is well settled that mere refusal to answer a question is not an offence.  It is not the positive omission&mdash;if I might revert to the realm of metaphysics&mdash; that might arise under the definition section.  There is a leading English case which I have no doubt will be followed in this country, a binding precedent to the effect that a refusal to answer a constable's questions, though it would undoubtedly make it more difficult for the police to carry out their duties, does not amount to wilful obstruction and therefore does not amount to an offence.  There is no doubt that this is the position.  To go further and ask what would be the position of a person who, when asked a question, gives a misleading answer, the law on that is not settled, although the burden of the authorities is that that would be a wilful act of obstruction <Col N="1176" /> and therefore an offence.  It is well settled that mere refusal to answer a policeman's question is not an offence even though the person refusing it might be expected, in the context of the question, to be able to answer it, and to be able to answer it accurately and fully and in such a way as to lead to the apprehension of a criminal or even to the prevention of a crime.  Mere refusal to answer a question is not obstruction and, therefore, is not an omission and cannot be an offence under the law, or indeed under this Bill.  Therefore, Senator Yeats can be assured on that particular point.</P>
      <P>I do not like Senator Yeats's amendment because it introduces what I might call a non-legal word into a statute.  It introduces the word &ldquo;endeavour&rdquo; when what is meant is &ldquo;attempt&rdquo;.  It is not a good principle to introduce new words because they leave themselves open to interpretations. They lead to a certain amount of uncertainty on the part of lawyers and courts as to what precisely is meant by the word in question.  I do not see any good reason for substituting the idea of &ldquo;endeavouring to impede&rdquo; for &ldquo;doing an act with intent to impede.&rdquo;  To do so would introduce confusion into the criminal law because this word &ldquo;endeavour&rdquo; would be a new word.  The idea of &ldquo;doing an act with intent to impede&rdquo;&mdash;which is what is in the statute&mdash;would be wider than the general concept of &ldquo;endeavouring to impede.&rdquo;  For example, to arrange in advance for the provision of a car to enable a fugitive from justice to escape arrest might not be sufficiently proximate to the offence so as to amount to &ldquo;endeavouring to impede&rdquo; his apprehension but it would certainly be &ldquo;doing an act with intent to impede.&rdquo; That is an example of how confusion could arise.  It would be a question of judicial subjective interpretation.  So far as possible we try to have the law objective in its interpretation and application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding this question of omission, perhaps I might take another example, a good example and a thing that one could envisage happening, to show <Col N="1177" /> what &ldquo;omission&rdquo; is meant to cover here.  Take the case where it is a person's duty to shut a particular door or gate at a particular time. If a person had a positive duty to shut a door or gate at a particular time as part of his duty and that person deliberately left the door or gate open so as to facilitate an escape that clearly would be an omission.  I think I could call it a positive omission without offending against language.  Of course it would have to be done &ldquo;with intent to impede&rdquo; in accordance with the wording of the subsection.  A person might refrain from opening a gate at a level crossing which was his duty, for the purposes of say, &ldquo;impeding pursuers&rdquo; so as to aid an escape.  Again, this must be done with an intention. It is not sufficient that the duty to close or open the gate, as the case might be, was accidentally overlooked. It must be done with the intent to impede.  Again, that is a matter for the prosecution to prove.  Therefore, one might say there is no burden or great hardship imposed on any person as a result of this definition.</P>
    <P>If I may repeat it, it is quite certain that a refusal to answer a question is not an omission so as to constitute an offence.  That is well settled.  There is the further point which Senator Yeats raised.  Where a person remains silent, even in the absence of a question, even in the absence of any deception, could this be an act done with an intent to impede apprehension?  Again, having regard to the authorities, mere refusal to answer a question, a <i>fortiori</i>, where there is no question, a mere silence could not possibly be held to be an offence of omission with intent to impede apprehension.  A person has no legal duty to give information to the police.  It is so fundamental a rule of law that there is no duty to give information to the police&mdash;it may be a rule of good citizenship to do so&mdash; that there can be no question of subsections (4) and (6) changing that fundamental legal position, worded as they are.  It would take a very specific and clear-cut provision in the subsections to ensure that the change <Col N="1178" /> was being effected before it could be brought about.  For an offence of omission to be within these subsections it must be&mdash;to get back to this &ldquo;metaphysical&rdquo; thing&mdash;positive, in the sense of leaving the gate shut or, alternatively, leaving the gate open, because, before an offence can be prosecuted, there has to be an indictment and, to be a good indictment, it must be specific as to the act or omission at a particular time which impeded the arrest.  You could not have an indictment that &ldquo;AB omitted at all times, when such information might have been available to him, to give it to the police.&rdquo;  That indictment could not stand.  To illustrate the point by attempting to frame an indictment shows how the matter could not arise in practice.</P>
    <P>Therefore, Senator Yeats can be reassured that the inclusion of &ldquo;omission&rdquo; under the definition of &ldquo;act&rdquo; will not lead to any hardship as a result of mere silence <i>per se</i>, a mere silence in the face of a question. There is no legal obligation to answer a question.  There is no legal obligation to volunteer information.  The omission before us to be an offence under this Bill must be something of the type of a person with a duty to do something who fails to do it.  Mere accidental failure is not sufficient.  In the context of subsections (4) and (6) the failure must be deliberate &ldquo;with intent to impede&rdquo;.  Mere accidental failure, in the context of man-slaughter&mdash;if the negligence was of sufficiently grave a nature&mdash;might sustain a charge of manslaughter.  But that does not arise under subsection (4) or (6).  They are quite specific. They deal with interfering with a person escaping and impeding the apprehension of a person escaping.  Therefore, there has to be not merely the omission but the omission must be with intent.  Senator Yeats can be assured that the position he fears&mdash; that mere silence could lead somebody into an offence under this Bill&mdash; cannot possibly arise.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the full reply he has given to this point.  He has clarified considerably <Col N="1179" /> the state of the law as to positive omissions.  I raised this point originally not thinking there was any substance to it.  I was considerably worried by the Minister's first reaction to the position on Committee Stage when he suggested, at column 904 of the official Report of 10th June, 1975, that one could be convicted of an offence for refraining from disclosing one's knowledge. Later on he suggested that one could be convicted of an offence for saying nothing at all.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 48, to delete &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the custody of the police&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This deals with the situation which we considered on various occasions during the Committee Stage of the custody of the accused while in Northern Ireland for the purpose of hearing evidence in accordance with the provisions of section 11 of this Bill.  It has been our constant worry on this side of the House and, indeed, that of independent Senators also that, while in Northern Ireland, the custody in which the accused is held for the taking of evidence might not be that of the police in Northern Ireland at all&mdash;not that we stand over everything the Northern Ireland police may say or do on occasion&mdash;but of the military forces of various kinds and stamps that exist in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I do not need to remind Senators that there have been many fully justified complaints about the behaviour of certain military forces in Northern Ireland and, indeed, the Minister's Government at present are actively conducting proceedings in Strasbourg in connection with these activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been concerned all along that, under this Bill, after the accused is delivered into the custody of the police of Northern Ireland he would be transferred either immediately or in due course into the custody of the military or some other force.  Our suspicions about this are particularly strong because the British parallel legislation, which is supposed to be on identical lines to this, says nothing about the accused being held in the custody of the police.  It says merely that he should be held in custody.  The Minister's own Bill is quite specific on these matters.  In section 11 subsection (2) <Col N="1181" /> it provides that where the Special Criminal Court decides to send an accused for trial and some of the evidence is to be taken in Northern Ireland,</P>
    <P>Where a court makes an order under this section, it shall inform the accused that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and it is in paragraph (a)</P>
    <P>he has a right to be present in the custody of the police of Northern Ireland at the taking of the evidence... and if he exercises the right he will be delivered in custody into the custody of the police of Northern Ireland,</P>
    <P>Then at the end of this same subsection:</P>
    <P>... if the accused indicates to the court that he wishes to be present at the taking of the evidence, the court shall make an order directing that the accused be delivered when and so often as may be necessary into the custody of the police of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Again in section 11 subsection (4):</P>
    <P>A person in whose case an order is made under subsection (2)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) shall be brought when and so often as may be necessary by the Garda Síochána to some convenient point of departure from the State and there delivered into the custody of the police of Northern Ireland...</P>
    <P>The intention right through the Bill and the expressed intention of the Minister is that, not alone should the accused in such cases be delivered into the custody of the police of Northern Ireland but that, while in Northern Ireland, he should be held in the custody of the police.  Unfortunately, as I said, the British Bill which is supposed to be identical with this Bill before us today does not say this.  It is at pains in several sections to say merely that the accused shall be held in custody, and I do not think this is only a chance.  Be this as it may the intention certainly is that the accused should be held in custody.  It is stated in the Bill that he is to be delievered into the custody of the <Col N="1182" /> police and the Minister has expressed full confidence that he will, in fact, he held in the custody of the police.  Now we get to the section that we seek to amend, which is, subsection (2) of section 3 which says:</P>
    <P>A person who escapes from lawful custody while in Northern Ireland pursuant to an order under section 11 (2) shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>We seek in this amendment to change this to read&mdash;</P>
    <P>A person who escapes from the custody of the police while in Northern Ireland pursuant to an order under section 11 (2) shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>As this Bill specifically states that the accused is to be delivered into the custody of the police in Northern Ireland, as the accused is told by the court of trial that, while in Northern Ireland, he is to be held in the custody of the police in Northern Ireland, and as the Minister has made it clear on a number of occasions that, in his view, the accused must be held in the custody of the police in Northern Ireland, I cannot see why an offence should be committed if, under subsection (2) for example, a person escapes from the custody of the military in Northern Ireland.  In such a case I do not think that this is an offence we should try in this State. The circumstances will be this, that the accused had been told by the Special Criminal Court that he had a right to travel to Northern Ireland to hear the evidence, that while there hearing the evidence he would be in the custody of the police.  The Bill further provides that he is delivered by the Garda Síochána into the custody of the police of Northern Ireland.  Under these circumstances if he is transferred to military custody and escapes from military custody we should not, under this Bill, try him for an offence.  As far as we are concerned, the only custody the Bill recognises is the custody of the police of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The subsection we seek to amend refers specifically to an order under section 11 (2).  What is this order <Col N="1183" /> under section 11 (2) to which it refers? The order is at the end of the subsection&mdash;</P>
    <P>...if the accused indicates to the court that he wishes to be present at the taking of the evidence, the court shall make an order directing that the accused be delivered when and so often as may be necessary into the custody of the police of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is the order of the court, not that he should be delivered to the military or anybody else but that he should be delivered into the custody of the police in Northern Ireland. This is the order that he is, in effect, in breach of should he escape and in accordance with subsection (2) of section 3.  If he is transferred to the military and escapes from military custody he is not, I would maintain, in lawful custody as far as we are concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I think this should be made clear.  This is a point that the Minister has not referred to on previous occasions.  The Minister has expressed confidence that he would not be transferred to the military, but I am not certain.  It seems to me at the very least ambiguous. Bear in mind that essentially the offence of escaping from custody is not committed here but in Northern Ireland.  Therefore &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo; in this case would relate to the law of Northern Ireland, which, of course, is the British Bill which only provides custody and under which, he could be transferred to the military.  If he escapes from military custody, he commits an offence under British law in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as we are concerned he has been transferred under section 11 (2), to the Northern Ireland police, and if he is taken over by the military and escapes from them, I do not think we should consider him guilty of any offence.  I think the matter can be dealt with very simply by the insertion of this amendment, so that if his <Col N="1184" /> escape is from the police, to which we have delivered him, to which the court has ordered him to be delivered, in that case he is guilty of an offence. I would suggest to the Minister that it would be very wise for him to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I wish to support Senator Yeats on this amendment. The Minister and the House are well aware of my views on this difficult section, more particularly in regard to how it relates to section 11 (2).  We have discussed all this on Committee so we cannot go back into that area. What we are seeking to do on Report is to help the Minister by introducing a degree of logic in the treatment of this offence under section 3 (2) as it relates to section 11 (2).  The logic is quite clear and has been spelled out by Senator Yeats.  Section 11 (2) is the governing section and subsection in so far as section 3 (2) is concerned. The House is entitled to a reason from the Minister why the wording is different in the two very closely related subsections of the respective sections.  Section 11 relates to the court in the Republic making an order providing for the accused being present in the custody of the police in Northern Ireland at the taking of evidence against him.  That is a basic human right.  At least an appearance of giving the accused that right had to be written into this Bill.  The appearance is quite clearly set out in section 2 generally.  Where, under subsection (2) of section 11, the court makes an order it shall inform the accused that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) he has a right to be present in the custody of the police of Northern Ireland at the taking of the evidence referred to in the order and if he exercises the right he will be delivered in custody into the custody of the police of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is envisaged quite clearly here is that the police force of the Republic, the Garda Síochána will exchange the prisoner into the custody of the police force of Northern Ireland.  Section 11 goes on consequentially to enumerate the various <Col N="1185" /> rights the accused has at the hearing on this handing over from one police force to the other.</P>
    <P>It is rather interesting that right through the whole of section 11&mdash; Senator Yeats referred to this&mdash;the phraseology used in dealing with the accused's rights at the hearing and his rights in being brought back to the Garda Síochána to a convenient point of departure is the phraseology which we have incorporated here in this amendment.  Apart from subsection (2) (a) of section 11 which is directly related to the amendment where the phrase is used &ldquo;to be present in the custody of the police of Northern Ireland&rdquo;, it is repeated right through the section.  It appears again in subsection (2) (d) of section 11.</P>

      <P>What I am talking about fundamentally here is the exchange arrangements between the respective police forces.  It is quite clear from 2 (a) and 4 (a) that what is envisaged in regard to the accused in this situation is that he will be passed from the police force in this jurisdiction to the Northern Ireland police force.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins is technically right.  I was reading it with subsection 2 (d).  The point is valid that in section 2 (a) the reference is to the custody of the police in Northern Ireland and in the conclusion to subsection (2) the reference is to the custody of the police in Northern Ireland and in subsection 4 (a) the reference again is to the custody of the police in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>We have this phrase used consistently under the only section of the Bill which has a colour of human rights about it.  The phrase used right through is the phrase which we have incorporated in this amendment. &ldquo;The custody of the police,&rdquo; we say, in order to provide for a situation where it might be the Garda Síochána. I know if this amendment was rejected on Committee, it might hopefully be the Garda Síochána.  If not, it is the custody of the police in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment proposes that the accused, whether under the Garda Síochána, the police force of the Republic or the police force of Northern Ireland, will be in the custody of a police force rather than &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo;. <Col N="1187" /> I will go back to the relevant subsection to which the amendment relates&mdash;subsection (2) of section 3.  It says:</P>
    <P>A person who escapes from lawful custody while in Northern Ireland pursuant to an order under section 11 (2) shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>We have a situation here where we are putting an accused person here into custody in Northern Ireland, the custody of the police of Northern Ireland. It is specified three times in the section &mdash;so there is no doubt about it&mdash;that in regard to the taking of evidence in Northern Ireland or in a criminal trial in this State the accused, and rightly and carefully so if he is going to be put into that jeopardy in going into Northern Ireland, while he is in custody is in the custody of the police in Northern Ireland.  If that person who is in the custody of the police in Northern Ireland escapes from that custody, which is described in subsection (2) of section 3 as &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo; he shall be guilty of an offence.  There is an obvious lacuna or gap here.  It is quite clear that the subsection we are discussing relates to a person escaping from custody.  Why is there a different description in this subsection?  Under section 11 if he goes to Northern Ireland, he goes into the custody of the police in Northern Ireland in order to hear the statements that are being adduced against him in court or on commission, but under this subsection it is &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The whole logic of the situation would appear to be strongly in favour of using the very same phraseology in this subsection as exists right through section 11.  Why &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo;? Surely it is not just slavishly following the relevant section in the British Act? That is not good enough because we all know the various security and military forces that operate at the moment and have operated for some years in Northern Ireland that do not come under the umbrella description of the police of Northern Ireland.  On the record so far of the military and security forces of the Crown and against whom we have charges pending before <Col N="1188" /> the Commission on Human Rights in Strasbourg, I would hesitate to regard them <i>prima facie</i> as representing lawful custody.  Indeed, our whole case is that their actions in regard to a number of specified and itemised cases amount to an attitude towards and an administration of custody that is a frustration and a perversion of the whole civilised idea of lawful custody. If we put ourselves into the contradictory position of incorporating as lawful custody, in a section passed by this Oireachtas, these particular forces, military and security, against whom we have as a State very sustainable allegations which have been so proved heretofore, I think we are bringing this Oireachtas into disrepute and giving away our own case in Strasbourg before the Commission on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister has a better explanation why lawful custody is included here while the police of Northern Ireland is included in the basic governing section, I can only surmise that he is either (1) slavishly copying the British precedent and the British Act without any thought or (2) does not view this situation with any alarm. That &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo; might include and does include if this subsection is passed forces other than the Northern Ireland police force.</P>
    <P>I do not have to envisage a situation where a person going to Northern Ireland is handed over, under section 11, from the Garda Síochána here to the Northern Ireland police force, finds his way by one route or the other by deliberate omission into the hands of other security forces than the Northern Ireland police force and may become subjected to the same sort of treatment about which we have made allegations against the same security and military forces before the European Commission on Human Rights.  If this particular person lawfully tries to escape from that sort of treatment, he thereby commits an offence under subsection (2) of section 3 because he is escaping from what is euphemistically called &ldquo;lawful custody.&rdquo;  Lawful custody is a very global phrase.  I do not have to <Col N="1189" /> emphasise that here.  Such phrases are used by police states all over the world.  That is the sort of phrase that is well hallowed by human experience in every dictatorship since mankind started; lawful custody, in other words, covers a multitude.</P>
    <P>The phraseology in the amendment put down by Senator Yeats is far more careful and specific.  If there is to be this sort of an exchange of offenders&mdash;with which we totally disagree&mdash;then at least have it on the basis that it is an exchange between police forces.  Whatever criticism we have&mdash;and they are considerable&mdash;in regard to the Northern Ireland police force, they have been dealing with their fellow professional force, the Gárda Síochána, of whom we are proud here and it will be an exchange of an offender from one professional police force to another professional police force.  Surely we can bring into this section, which makes the escape from custody an offence in our law, the provision that the escape should be escape from the custody of the Northern Ireland police force and not escape from some Kitson-inspired security organisation or some of the weird security outfits that the British Government have always been spawning over the centuries and still are spawning in every country with whom they have any association.</P>
    <P>We do not want escape from Kitson-inspired security organisations or from the British military to be equated with escape from lawful custody because we happen to be a civilised State here and this offence that is written here will be an offence under our law.  What we are seeking to do in this amendment is to have human rights guaranteed as they are under our Constitution and law.  What we are seeking to do is to prevent a departure from what is or can be regarded as an acceptable principle of exchanging prisoners between recognised police forces.</P>
    <P>In regard to the whole weird, subterranean, grey-to-black area of British espionage, British security, British MI5 activity, British military activity, the Bill seeks to incorporate all that area of control existing in <Col N="1190" /> Northern Ireland at present as &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo;.  Control within that type of umbrella is regarded under this subsection as lawful custody.  This means, in plain fact, if any person who legitimately goes to Northern Ireland to be present when evidence is heard against him, and by some means or other&mdash;I do not want to inquire into the murky area where this can happen &mdash;finds himself under the control of any of these quasi-military, military, quasi-security, security or quasi-police organisations, which have been brought in through the various machinations and activities of the British Government, and tries to escape from that situation by reason of undue interrogation or torture, and finds himself in the Republic, he is liable to prosecution by reason of an offence in the Republic.  We are now, under this subsection declaring that action to be an offence.  The Republic, which has a reasonably unsullied record in regard to our criminal law legislation will now prosecute that person.</P>
    <P>In this amendment, we seek&mdash;again coming back to section 11&mdash;to adopt the language of the Minister's drafting and insert the phrase &ldquo;in the custody of the police&rdquo;.  It is quite clear that the euphemistic phrase &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo; covers a multitude.  It has been used in every totalitarian state since history began.  We seek to have that phrase deleted and have incorporated instead the practical and specific phrase &ldquo;the custody of the police&rdquo;.  We do not accept the global phrase &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo;. Therefore, it is quite clear that, if an offence is committed under section 3 (2) it is one of escape from a police force, whether it is the Garda Síochána or the Northern Ireland police force.</P>
    <P>There is much merit in this amendment and I ask the Minister to see the logic in our position.  There is no point in slavishly following the British pattern.  If that is the reason why it is being done for drafting or other purposes, it is rather pointless.  The Minister should make it quite clear that, as far as the Republic is concerned, in enforcing such escape offences, we <Col N="1191" /> only regard these as wrong or illegal escape offences when they relate to escape from a police force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I share a good deal of the misgivings expressed by Senator Lenihan with regard to section 3 (2). On the other hand, I must admit that I would draw the opposite conclusions from those drawn by Senator Lenihan. I would be happier with the Minister's formulation of &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo; than with the formulation of &ldquo;the custody of the police&rdquo;.  The Minister could be interpreted as having drawn a very important, substantive distinction.  I do not think &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo; and &ldquo;custody of the police&rdquo;, as the police are constituted in Northern Ireland now, or as they may be constituted in the very changing situation there within the next few months or years, mean the same thing.  I am not too sure that &ldquo;custody of the police&rdquo; could be depended upon to form an adequate equation with &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>One of the most burning issues in the North at present is the issue of policing.  Anybody who listens to radio and television utterances of the SDLP and who has read their newspaper statements has to be aware that one of the issues which divides the communities in the North there at present is the whole question of policing.  The police are profoundly suspect there. They are profoundly suspect of the one party in which the South can repose some trust, that is the SDLP who have devoted themselves strenuously and courageously to the rule of law and to the constitutional solution of the problems in the North. They have more or less consistently tended to regard policing as an extremely dubious affair and with good reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of late, several spokesmen from the Loyalist political area, notably Ernest Baird, have said over and over again that a time may come in the North of Ireland when the UDA may be called upon to defend the province.  They have been asked publicly to repudiate the UDA and they have refused to do so. On at least three occasions, Ernest Baird made it clear that he has no intention of repudiating the UDA.  His <Col N="1192" /> reason for failing to repudiate them is that they may be called upon to defend the province.</P>
    <P>In a circumstance like that, it is extremely likely that, if UDA rule should become the order of the day, the police would slide into the bosom of the UDA and into the bosom of what we are pleased to call over and over again the para-military organisations in Northern Ireland.  The term &ldquo;para-military&rdquo; is used exclusively of Protestant organisations and the word &ldquo;terrorist&rdquo; is used exclusively of Catholic organisations.  As far as I am concerned they are all terrorist organisations. The IRA is a terrorist organisation at present although it may not have been so at the beginning.  The UDA is a terrorist organisation and so too are the Red Hand Commandos and all these para-military organisations.</P>
    <P>The disquieting thing is that an elected representative like Ernest Baird can make a statement of this kind and can make it in a context where the leaders of his faction&mdash; whether those leaders be identified as Ian Paisley, Harry West or William Craig&mdash;have at no stage found it necessary to repudiate what he said. This is my objection to the Bill.  It is being brought forward against a changing situation in the North of Ireland, a situation which is changing in a rather sinister way towards a militant&mdash;call it para-military if you like&mdash;alliance of the right or of the Loyalist interest.</P>
    <P>Against that background I would prefer the Minister's formulation.  If Senator Yeats' substitute clause &ldquo;custody of the police&rdquo; is accepted, the chances are that in six months' time the police may be the agents of those rather sinister alliances of the Loyalists interests.  If the phrase &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo; survives the South will be in a position to decide what is lawful and what is unlawful custody. If the phrase is limited to &ldquo;custody of the police&rdquo;, then it is the custody of the police.  There is the danger that it is any police in the North of Ireland.  I should like to compliment the Minister in drawing this distinction between &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo; and &ldquo;custody of the police.&rdquo;  Even at <Col N="1193" /> present, the two things cannot be equated.  Police custody has, as is evidenced in the whole Strasbourg affair, not been synonymous with lawful custody.  Therefore, in this changing situation in the North, where custody of the police could very quickly come to mean custody of the most draconian forces of the Unionist philosophy, I would much prefer to retain the phrase &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo;, which would leave with us the right of deciding whether the regime in the North of Ireland at a given moment was lawful or not.  If we deemed it to be unlawful we could then repudiate it.  That seems to be far more satisfactory although I am, by and large, in sympathy with what Senator Lenihan and Senator Yeats have said. It seems to leave us with a great deal more room for legitimate and moral maneouvre than the more limiting phrase &ldquo;custody of the police&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I cannot say that I share the subtle difference between the meaning of both phrases because to me it seems to be from the frying pan into the fire.  As far as I am concerned, I cannot see much difference between Sir Francis King and Sir James Flanagan.  Both are Sirs of the British Empire residing and operating in our country.  I have less regard for their ability to mete out justice to us pure natives of the country.  We tried to do something by putting down an amendment, reluctant as we were to put down any amendments.  We feel it is the fundamental right of a prisoner to be present when evidence is being tendered against him, wherever that takes place.  If the Minister says that the prisoner will be allowed to go to the Six Counties, that he will be escorted as far as the Border by the Garda and then will be handed over to what he calls lawful custody, that means that that prisoner from here can be handed over to the FourSquare Laundry unit, to the Green Jackets, to the UDF, to the UDR and to the many other variations of para-military groups.</P>

I was making the point, in regard to the subtle difference between these two phrases, that it might mean that the devil you know is better than the devil you do not know.  I would have pity for the prisoner who would find himself being handed over at the Six-County Border to some of these British outfits, whose sole aim is to maintain British domination and British law in this country.  They are holding on to our Six Counties against the wishes of the majority of the people.  These are the people who have got their British titles handed out in the New Year's honours list because they were traitors to their own country. These are the people this prisoner will be handed over to.  The people taking custody of this prisoner at the Border will be some of these units of the British Army who operated in many countries abroad and left a trail of woe and destruction behind them.  These are the people who will be here taking charge of some prisoner who is handed over and who expects to get justice.  I have no hesitation in saying that I do not believe there will be any justice for him.  He will be taking a grave risk.  He would certainly be a very brave prisoner who would attempt to go to the Six Counties <Col N="1195" /> under conditions such as that. When you have all these various units in the Six Counties prolonging and perpetrating British imperialism in our land, you cannot expect to get justice. How can any prisoner face into the Six Counties and find that he will be handed over at the Border to people who have no connection with any police force?  How is he to know?</P>

      <P>How can he know it? The Garda are not allowed to go with him.  How can one trust Sir James Flanagan or Sir Frank King?  Can one trust these Sirs who mete out justice to people in this country?  I certainly would not trust them.  The prisoner is handed over to somebody.</P>

      <P>As he moves along in the train or wherever he is a hood is put over his head, he is pulled into some corner, put up against a wall and questioned for 24 hours or 48 hours.  They will use him as an ash tray as they did before with prisoners and torture them.  What can we do down here about it?  If the prisoner escapes or tries to escape down here from that custody or from these hooded gentlemen, who are interviewing him, we will be expected to arrest him saying that he escaped from lawful custody.  That is no justice.  We will not do ourselves any good in trying to co-operate with the British in any way.  You cannot make a good Bill out of this.  It is rotten from top to bottom.  What it seeks to do here is just a pure sham, pretending it is protecting the prisoner.  It is doing no such thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been referring to the difficulties a prisoner would encounter were he to submit himself to the ordeal of saying Slán to our Garda at the Border and delivering himself into the custody of the unknown, which will happen when he goes into the Six County territory, because of the multiplicity of the various organisations there that could, so far as I know, take care of him and we <Col N="1196" /> could do nothing about it.  They could take care of him in many different ways.  They could use him as an ashtray.  They could put a hood on him.  They could confine him for 24 hours or 48 hours and deliver him back when they wished.  These are all things he would have to face.  If he tried to escape he could be shot, and if he did not try to escape they could say he made the attempt.  All this is not beyond the possibility of what might happen there.  We have no faith whatever in the regime in charge there.  Indeed, their idea of justice is contrary to all elements of simple justice.  They have maintained that position over the past 50 years.</P>
    <P>No prisoner could have any confidence in British justice, no confidence in an outfit that cannot mete out reasonable justice to the people there. We know they have over 50,000 troops packed in there.  They have various regiments, various breeds, and any one of those units could take custody of a prisoner.  The record of the Green Jackets and the other organisations is well known.  I would certainly have tremendous pity for any poor prisoner, who may not be guilty at all, but who, to clear his good name, would have to enter into these halls of the unknown where the ashtrays and the hoods and the jackboot are waiting for him.  In most cases, if not in all cases, he will prefer to remain where he is rather than take that chance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I upset Senator Dolan in any way.  All I was trying to do was to suggest that it would be worth his while, before making the type of argument he has made, to do one of two things, either to have listened to Senator Yeats speaking on the amendment or to have read section 11, subsection (2) to which indirectly this amendment is directed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The weight of Senator Dolan's complaint and argument in support of the amendment was to suggest, as I understood it, that the prisoner or the accused, would be taken to the Border by the Garda Síochána and handed into the custody of any one of several different organisations.  That specifically is not allowed by section 11 subsection (2).  This was emphasised by Senator <Col N="1197" /> Yeats and again by Senator Lenihan.  It specifically provided that the handing over will be into the custody of the police of Northern Ireland, and to nobody else.  Senator Yeats in this amendment argues on those grounds, that as that is provided in section 11 (2) therefore the provisions of section 3 (2) should similarly be altered so as to provide that the offence of escaping should be the offence of escaping from the custody of the police of Northern Ireland and not escaping from anybody else's custody.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that in order to clear Senator Dolan's mind of any doubts he may have as to the procedure laid down in section 11 (2) of the Bill. The Senator's contribution to the discussion on the amendment has rather confirmed the view I have expressed on a number of occasions that a great deal of the opposition to this Bill has been based on a misunderstanding of what is in the Bill, and I hope that that misunderstanding is now cleared up.</P>
    <P>As regards the case made by Senator Yeats and Senator Lenihan, I think Senator Martin has to a great extent answered that effectively.  We are dealing here, remember, with proceedings brought before our courts where the people who are to adjudicate are judges, and they will be approaching these problems with their own legal traditions and their legal knowledge. I do not want to belittle the amendment. I hope Senator Yeats will not think I am trying to do that.  I can see &mdash;justification is not the word I am looking for&mdash;the reason why an amendment of this sort should be urged, but I think it would in many ways be dangerous to accept it.  It would create the kind of complications which we certainly wish to avoid.  The most substantial complication which might be created is that of which Senator Martin spoke.</P>
    <P>We are talking of a person being accused of this particular offence of escaping and being charged here before our courts.  As the section stands at the moment, it rests entirely with our courts and with our judges to decide whether or not the custody in which the accused person had been held and from which he <Col N="1198" /> escaped was lawful custody.  So long as that position remains, it seems to me that the position is very much safer from the point of view of the accused person than if that wording were altered.  It rests entirely with our courts to decide whether or not the custody was lawful.  I imagine most of us could think of various horrifying examples, the kind of thing Senator Dolan was talking about, any one of a number of organisations grabbing the accused person, putting him up against a wall, hooding him, and so on.  Everyone would feel, as Senator Lenihan felt.  Of course, if he can escape from that, who will blame him?</P>
    <P>It is a matter for our courts to decide whether or not the custody was lawful.  It is only in the event of escape from lawful custody that the question of an offence arises at all. If the courts decide that the custody was unlawful, then no offence is committed, and the accused is entitled to be acquitted and discharged.  Minor complications could arise also from acceptance of Senator Yeats amendment. It is true, and it is clear beyond any doubt, that the handing over of the accused who wants to be present in the North for the purpose of hearing evidence taken on commission, is into the custody of the police of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I can visualise a situation where quite possibly the sitting of the commission in the North of Ireland to take evidence might be a lengthy affair going on from day to day, possibly even from week to week, and it may be preferable from everybody's point of view, including the point of view of the accused, that it should at least be possible under the provisions of the Bill, that he would, for example, be put in custody of the prison authorities, or some of the prison authorities, in the North rather than that the custody whole time should be that of the Northern Ireland police.</P>
    <P>As regards his return here, it is clear that a distinction is made in section 11 between Garda custody and other types of custody.  In section 11 (4) (b) reference is made to the return to the State of the person <Col N="1199" /> being taken into the custody of the Garda Síochána and then if he is required, pursuant to an order of any court, to be kept in custody, to be returned as soon as may be to that custody.  That custody, obviously, could be the custody of the prison service rather than Garda custody as such.  From the point of view of the person charged with this offence, it is in case of him, to my mind, that the Minister should stand firmly in favour of the phrase &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo; rather than that he should accept the more restricted definition of custody of the police of Northern Ireland which Senator Yeats is urging in this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment has taken us over a wide field.  Many points have been discussed in the debate generally.  On Second Stage and Committee Stage we had discussions on the various forces maintaining law and order in Northern Ireland.  We had reference to the RUC, the UDR, the British Army, the various para-militaries and the terrorists.  We had references to Strasbourg and the proceedings being taken by the Government there, proceedings, I think it is correct to say, which were initiated by our predecessors following constant promptings by the then spokesman for the Opposition on Foreign Affairs, now the Minister for Finance.  It is important that it be said for the record that the first promptings for those proceedings came from this party.</P>
      <P>The discussion on this amendment has ranged over the question of unity. Senator Dolan talked in disparaging terms of the head of the RUC and sneered at a recent title he received. He differentiated between himself as a pure native in contra-distinction to the head of the RUC who, incidentally, is an Irishman but whose allegiance lies elsewhere.  Senator Dolan was prepared to sneer at this man because his allegiance lies elsewhere. He used the racist term &ldquo;pure native&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate also raised the question of the unity of the country and <Col N="1200" /> national policy on that.  I understood that it was a common case between all parties in this Oireachtas that what we desire is unity by consent, consent in that context meaning the consent of the majority in Northern Ireland. Senator Dolan raised the old catch-cry of the anti-partition campaign of the 30s, 40s, and 50s of the consent of the majority of the people on this island.  I thought that was something we had put behind us a long time ago and that we had come now to recognise that unity cannot mean anything unless it is voluntarily agreed to by the people with whom we wish to be united, and those people happen to be the majority in Northern Ireland, a minority within the island. The reality of the situation in which we find ourselves is that they are the majority in Northern Ireland and, until they wish to be united with us, unification cannot take place.</P>
    <P>I cannot fathom the obscurantist attitude that still lingers in the benches opposite as expressed by Senator Dolan when he sneers at this majority and sneers at all the things they hold dear, albeit misguidedly.  Nevertheless, they hold them dear and we must recognise that there are differences up there, and accept that these people are entitled to their differences.  We cannot force them.  That is the essential thing.  We can only try and pursuade them by peaceful means and, of course, without violence to have a different constitutional arrangement on this Island.</P>
    <P>It puts back a long way any moves that might be happening in that direction for a Senator who is a member of the largest political party in this State to utter such sentiments without contradiction from his leaders.  It is not the first time they have been uttered in the course of this debate.  They have been said over and over again from those benches, and they have not been repudiated. Can one blame the majority in the North if they look with some scepticism on us down here and our professed desire for unity by consent which will give them a fair and full say in the new community?  Can you <Col N="1201" /> blame them for looking a little askance at the establishment down here when an establishment figure&mdash; and a Member of the Seanad is <i>per se,</i> by definition, an establishment figure &mdash;talks of pure Irish men in contradistinction to the people of Northern Ireland?</P>
    <P>It is regettable that these sentiments should be expressed.  They reveal a certain situation which we must recognise still exists, and we can only continue the process of education and hope that the process which has begun in certain levels of the Opposition party will finally find its way down to all levels and that when we all say here that what we want is unity by consent, and without violence, this is what we all mean and when we talk about having the consent of the majority we do not mean the majority on this island because, of course, that majority is for unity, but we mean the majority of the people with whom we wish to be united.</P>
    <P>We have to show goodwill to these people in our actions and by our words. Sometimes there is an opportunity to act and by our actions to show goodwill and show our desire to meet them, show our desire to have a state of affairs, a regime on this island, which would be conducive to unity and harmony. Sometimes we do not have an opportunity for action and we have to express our desire and our goodwill by words.  This Bill is an opportunity to show by action our desire to be united with the people in the North because it makes a common case with them in fighting a common terrorist enemy, an enemy who has done immense harm in both jurisdictions. We are inclined to overlook the harm that he does in this jurisdiction because we do not have the visible evidence before our eyes of bombed towns.  We do not have the unhappy experience of being personally acquainted with widows and orphans of men who have lost their lives in sectarian murders. We do not read about our neighbours having their knees shot off with bullets, and the hijacking of cars and all the paraphernalia of terrorism are absent by and large from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, indeed.

This Bill is only half of a reciprocal measure.  The terrorist is our enemy and, I was making the point that while there may be an absence of physical evidence of bombings here and while we may not have suffered the murders, the assaults and all the other paraphernalia of terrorism, we have suffered a considerable amount of tragic spill over.  We have had that here.  We are also suffering in our economy, to put this human tragedy on a very material plane.  Our economy has suffered grievously from the activities of terrorists in this island. This Bill is designed to tackle one aspect of terrorism.  It is designed to tackle that aspect where terrorists flee from Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be out of order.  When this amendment was being moved the speeches made in support of it emphasised how much it related to the kernel of the Bill.  It raised all the questions of custody and escape from custody.  That is what I was moving to when I was interrupted.  The primary object of the Bill is to deal with the terrorist who is fleeing from custody.  This ties in with the amendment which deals with what type of custody is involved.</P>
      <P>I wanted to indicate the background to the type of person that the Bill has to deal with, that is the fugitive terrorist.  He may be fleeing after committing a crime in Northern Ireland and taking refuge down here. His very presence is anathema to the people here.  His presence here, as a person wanted for a serious criminal offence, is harmful to our society and to our State.  That is irrespective of whether he is fleeing from facing justice or whether he is fleeing after having escaped from custody.  The point is that his presence here is anathema as far as we are concerned. This goes to the root of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other side have endeavoured to suggest&mdash;and this has been the burden of their case in support of their amendment&mdash;that there are certain parts of the regime of Northern Ireland so obnoxious that a person escaping from them could not be faulted for taking an opportunity to escape.  In describing why these parts of the regime in Northern Ireland are obnoxious we had a wide ranging description by Senator Lenihan.  He said he would not be emotive.  But he gave us, to a lesser degree, some of the blood curdling descriptions of things up there which we have had from Senator McGlinchey, in gory detail, over the past number of months.  We have had <Col N="1204" /> also similar descriptions from Senator Dolan, in describing the regime in Northern Ireland.  Senator Dolan painted the picture of people being handed over for the purposes of section 11 and finding themselves immediately hooded and tortured.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan, in support of the amendment&mdash;in its wish to restrict custody to the custody of the police&mdash; painted similarly horrifying pictures. Of course, both pictures are wrong, inaccurate and completely unreasonable. They are horror stories to try to intimidate people into supporting the amendment.  They do not represent what could take place, or what could be the position, following the passage of the Bill, following the transfer of people into custody in Northern Ireland for the purposes of examination on commission of the witnesses in the cases against them.  That is not what the Bill says at all.  The Bill very specifically sets out to ensure that the like could not happen.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is the section that provides for the taking of evidence on commission.  It is relevant to this amendment because this amendment seeks to amend subsection (2) of section 3.  Section 3 is the section which makes it an offence to escape from custody in Northern Ireland in the case of a person who, in Northern Ireland, is charged with or convicted of an offence under the law of Northern Ireland consisting of acts that also constitute an offence specified in the Schedule or an offence under section 2 or an offence under the law of Northern Ireland corresponding to this section, that is the escape section in the corresponding Northern Ireland Bill.  The last part of subsection (1) (a) of section 3 reads:</P>
    <P>and who escapes from any lawful custody in which he is held in Northern Ireland shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>In the substantive part of that section there is a reference to an escape from lawful custody by a person who has been charged with, but not convicted, of an offence under the law of Northern Ireland that also constitutes <Col N="1205" /> an offence specified in the Schedule. Yet, no objection has been taken to the use of the bare words &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo; in section 3 (1).  If the arguments that are being advanced to build an objection to those bare words in subsection (2) have relevance, they have equal relevance to the use of those bare words in subsection (1). These arguments were, essentially: &ldquo;Who can blame a person from escaping from the bloody hands of the British Army?&rdquo;  Why was an amendment not put down in regard to section 3 (1), and indeed all the other sections where the words &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo; are used?  Subsection (2) of Section 3 says:</P>
    <P>A person who escapes from lawful custody while in Northern Ireland pursuant to an order under section 11 (2) shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Apparently the Opposition draw a distinction between a person who has been arrested in the South, charged with an extra-territorial offence, is going North for the taking of evidence on commission and escapes from lawful custody there, and a terrorist who is arrested even within the North, has been convicted and escapes down South.  I do not see the distinction. However, let us assume there is a distinction.  Senator Yeats says it is a basic distinction.  Possibly he has in mind that because the person is going North from here he is being in custody&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>He is essentially in the custody of an Irish court and it is their responsibility in a way that the other man to whom the Minister referred is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic point is the nature of the custody from which he escapes.  That is the point of the amendment&mdash;to try to alter the custody in which he is being held.  I would respectfully disagree with Senator Yeats when he says that the basic point is the fact that the person is going from the South to the North for the hearing of the evidence, as opposed to the other case where he has been convicted in the North.  The <Col N="1206" /> basic point is the quality of the custody in the North because that is the whole point of the amendment.  The amendment seeks to alter the definition of &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo; and give it a new meaning.  The point I am making, as a deduction from that, is that the amendment should lie for subsection (1) as well as section 3.</P>
      <P>Section 3 (2) relates then to section 11 and, in particular, to subsection (2) of section 11.  Section 11 is the section that provides for the taking of evidence on commission.  Subsection (1) merely sets out the procedure to be followed when the court of trial, unless it is satisfied it is not in the interests of justice to do so, can, by order, provide for the issue of a letter of request to the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, to take, in the presence of the members of the court, which would be in effect the Special Court, evidence in Northern Ireland by a judge of the High Court of Northern Ireland who then would be the commissioner.  That provides for the setting up of the commission.  How it is to be set up is to be the letter of request to the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland.  Then, he appoints one of the judges of the High Court as the commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 11 sets out what happens when the court makes an order.  The court is directed to inform the accused of a number of things.  It informs the accused that he has a right to be present in the custody of the police of Northern Ireland at the taking of the evidence referred to in the order; if he exercises the right he will be delivered in custody into the custody of the police of Northern Ireland.  Paragraph (b) of subsection (2) provides that whether or not he is present at the taking of the evidence, he can be represented by counsel and solicitor, or solicitor only, or by another counsel and solicitor entitled to practise in the State or entitled to practise in Northern Ireland.  That provides for his representation. Paragraph (c) says that if he is not represented by counsel or a solicitor he himself may question any witnesses giving evidence before the commission.  Paragraph (d) is the <Col N="1207" /> fourth matter of which the accused is to be informed.  Senator Lenihan sought to read paragraph (d) with the concluding paragraph of the subsection. Of course, it is clear that paragraph (d) stands by itself.  Paragraph (d) says that the accused is to be informed that while he is in custody in Northern Ireland for the purpose of taking of the evidence...; there is no mention here of the persons in whose custody he is to be in Northern Ireland.  It says merely:</P>
    <P>while he is in custody in Northern Ireland for the purpose of the taking of the evidence, he will be immune from detention, and any kind of suit or legal process, in respect of any cause or matter, civil or criminal, arising before his arrival in Northern Ireland for the purpose aforesaid.</P>
    <P>This is a critical paragraph.  It is critical first of all because it does not specify the nature of the custody in terms of the personnel keeping the custody in Northern Ireland.  It merely says: shall be in custody in Northern Ireland.  It also provides the immunity of that person in Northern Ireland.  Immunity is spelled out.  &ldquo;He will be immune from detention&rdquo;&mdash; that would be detention under the internment powers&mdash;&ldquo;and any kind of suit or legal process.&rdquo;  They are extremely wide words covering the entire ambit of legal proceedings&mdash;&ldquo;In respect of any cause or matter&rdquo;&mdash;again very wide and general words &mdash;&ldquo;civil or criminal, arising before his arrival in Northern Ireland.&rdquo; Therefore, no matter what that man had done in Northern Ireland prior to his arrival there, he is immune from any proceedings in respect of those actions.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan attempted to tell the House there was hardly a scintilla of human rights about this Bill, that this amendment would provide the only scintilla of human rights for a person going North to hear evidence being taken on commission.  That is a complete misreading of the subsection in question.  I have demonstrated by reading it that it could not be couched <Col N="1208" /> in wider terms&mdash;to grant complete and total immunity and protection to the accused person going North.  Those wide terms, granting this complete and total protection from &ldquo;any kind of suit or legal process, in respect of any cause or matter, civil or criminal&rdquo;, I submit is the clearest of directions to any court, to all arms of the Executive, that such a person is inviolate when in the other jurisdiction for the purposes of taking evidence on commission.  That clear and wide direction, that complete and total protection makes nonsense&mdash;and shows them up for the deceitful arguments they are&mdash;that a person going North is liable to suffer indignities, brutalities, illegal questioning, hooding, searching, or all the other horror points that have been adduced by the Opposition in support of their amendment.</P>
    <P>That was a very strong part of the case in support of the amendment, that a person going North could find themselves in the custody of people who have a bad record with regard to the treatment of people in their custody. Senator Lenihan instanced in support of this the fact that this Government is taking action against the Government of the United Kingdom for ill-treatment of people in Northern Ireland.  That is so.  These people have a bad record.  It is precisely because of that dubious record that this total and complete protection is spelt out in the greatest of detail in this statute and is reciprocated in the corresponding British Bill, that there will be that total protection for the person going North.  Once there is this total protection for the person going North, that is where his security and safety emanates, and not from trying to limit or narrow the class of persons who may have custody of his person while in the North.</P>
    <P>This argument of concern for the person as to how he would be treated by the forces in the North was made at considerable length and was one of the major planks on which this amendment was based.  It was maintained that it was necessary in order to protect the unfortunate accused going North from being put into the <Col N="1209" /> ruthless hands of certain forces up there who would illtreat him.  Senator Dolan said he would be no sooner over the Border than there would be a hood put over his head, he would be put up against a wall and questioned for X number of hours.  Of course, that cannot happen because his immunity is spelled out in the clearest of words.  To protect against that happening what is the Opposition's amendment?  It is that when he goes to the North he can only be in the custody of the RUC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, my Bill does not say that.  With respect to the Senator he is becoming confused.  He should read section 11, subsection (2), paragraph (d).  The Opposition say it should be no offence for a person to escape unless he is in the custody of the RUC, on the grounds that if he was in any other custody he would be so brutalised and so treated it would be only right and proper that he should escape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be in violation of what the Special Court has told him&mdash;that he has a right to be present in the custody of the police from Northern Ireland.  That is what the court will tell him.  It is because it is a violation of this we claim that there should be no offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>And the court also tells him that, while he is in the custody of Northern Ireland for the purposes of taking evidence, he will be immune from detention and from all the other things I have described in detail.  The argument for substituting for the words &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo; the words &ldquo;custody of the police&rdquo; was that it would be in ease of the position of the person going North, to ensure that he would not find himself in the clutches of the British Army.  I have already demonstrated that such a person is granted total immunity and that this will have to be preserved and honoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of Senator Dolan's poor <Col N="1210" /> opinion of the Chief Constable of the RUC and the distinction he seems to make, that the Chief Constable is not a pure native whereas we are.  Senator Lenihan advanced the argument that it would be all right, even though this was a bad Bill and all that goes with that, if the person was in the custody of the RUC; then it would be an offence to escape.  That was what he was saying.  Senator Lenihan might not have had the experience I have had of listening to Senator McGlinchey here for many hours&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I listened to Senator McGlinchey for many hours and when he was repeating himself for possibly the umpteenth time and showing no intention of ceasing his repetition I left the House.  In their hearts I think many members of the Opposition would agree I did the correct thing; they envied me my freedom to leave.  Senator McGlinchey for many hours regaled the House with horror stories.  He read from a pamphlet by a Father Faul.  He regaled us for many hours with horror stories, not by the British Army but by the RUC, horror stories of alleged atrocities and illegal acts.  Yet these are the very people whom Senator Lenihan and Senator Yeats would be very happy to see having custody of the accused going North, happy to the extent that if the person escaped from these people, that escape would be an escape from lawful custody so as to constitute an offence under section 3.</P>
      <P>I see a great inconsistency between these arguments, a great inconsistency within the ranks of the Opposition. Senator McGlinchey found the RUC so objectionable he could take up the time of the House for many hours and he was supported by Senator Dolan, who also took great exception to the RUC.  Perhaps other Senators too; I cannot recall.  These case histories related by Senator McGlinchey have not been denied by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying to the amendment.  The point is that one of the justifications for the amendment, argued at some length and quite emotionally by Senator Lenihan&mdash;so far as one can ever be sure when Senator Lenihan is being emotional&mdash; for substituting the words &ldquo;the custody of the police&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo; was that the police would be all right, we might have some reservations but, it would be all right to make it an offence to escape from them but not all right to make it an offence to escape from any other authority up there.</P>
      <P>I was making the point that this was an inconsistent argument, a totally illogical one, when we recall the horror stories&mdash;and they were nothing short of horror stories&mdash;with which Senator McGlinchey regaled the House, for hours on end to the gratification and enjoyment of many Senators on the benches with him at that time.  This force, so fortrightly condemned by Senator McGlinchey in such unequivocal terms, is now suddenly acceptable to Senator Lenihan, the leader of the Opposition, as being composed of people who could have custody of a person going North for the purpose of taking evidence on commission, so that, if a person escaped from those people, he would be committing an offence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no riding instructions to keep it going.  I was so appalled by the variety and inconsistency of the arguments put forward <Col N="1212" /> by the Opposition in supporting this amendment, I feel they deserve, at this stage of the debate, some detailed reply and that is what I am endeavouring to do.  Senator Yeats is a man who makes logical cases in this House, who reads his measures carefully; comes in and, by and large, makes constructive cases in support of his arguments.  I know it grates on him when an argument raised by a colleague contains a serious fallacy or inconsistency when put in counterpart with arguments made earlier by other members of the same party.  It must grate when these inconsistencies and contradictions are pointed out.</P>
      <P>There is a serious difference between the Opposition and myself as to what section 11 means when it talks of &ldquo;custody&rdquo;.  It has been interpreted by the Opposition as meaning that we in this Parliament, in this statute, can say in what sort of custody a person will be kept when he leaves this jurisdiction. Of course, we cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Minister has done in subsection (2) (a).</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>What we can set out and describe is the force or persons to whom an accused will be handed over when he departs from this jurisdiction. I submit that that is the real meaning of section 11, when it speaks of &ldquo;the custody of the police of Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  It can speak of such custody only in the context of the handing over of the accused to go North for the hearing of evidence on commission.  We here cannot say that from that point on the accused is to be kept in such-and-such a custody because our writ does not run there. Likewise, we cannot be directed as to the type of custody we are to maintain here in the reciprocal situation. All we can do is provide for the custody at the point of departure.  The custody we provide at the point of departure is the custody of the police of Northern Ireland.  We have to name somebody.  That is the true meaning of section 11.</P>

      <P>Yes, indeed, including <Col N="1213" /> subsection (2) (a).  Subsection (2) (a) merely informs the accused that he has a right to be present in the custody of the police of Northern Ireland at the taking of the evidence.</P>

Our jurisdiction ends at the Border.  We cannot say thereafter in whose custody the accused is going to be.

      <P>The Minister has said in section 12 that people coming from Northern Ireland to evidence-taking here will be in the custody of the Garda Síochána.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a moment.  I would refer Senator Yeats to section 13 which contains the &ldquo;Provisions relating to custody and immunity of persons in the State for taking of evidence under section 12 and to persons unlawfully at large.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this at some length on Committee Stage.  We cannot legislate here for what the British Bill says.  Our only influence on the position up there is rather sideways influence by virtue of subsection (2) of section 3 dealing with the question of a person who escapes from custody when in the North for the taking of evidence on commission.  It is an offence if he escapes from lawful custody.  The Opposition seek to make that an offence if he escapes from the <Col N="1214" /> custody of the police in Northern Ireland.  In this Bill, when a person from the North is in custody here for the purpose of evidence on commission, that person would be in the custody of the Garda or in prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt at some length with the question of custody in Northern Ireland on Committee Stage at columns 152 and 153 of the Seanad Debates on 9th July.  I said that I thought Senator Yeats was tilting at windmills, and he still is.  He says that because we say in our Bill a person is in the custody of the Garda Síochána or in prison and all that is said in the reciprocating Bill is that he is in custody, that there is some serious difficulty.  I cannot see in essence what the difference is.  If a person is in custody the important thing is that he is protected while he is in custody, that he has absolute immunity, and this is provided in clear and unequivocal language for the person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>From having summonses served on him, that is all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Senator Yeats has read the Bill more carefully than that.  He knows that a person will be immune from detention and any kind of suit or legal process in respect of any cause or matter, civil or criminal, arising before his arrival in Northern Ireland.  Senator Yeats is doing himself considerably less than justice if he interprets those wide words, giving complete and absolute immunity and protection, as meaning just the serving of summonses.  There is total protection for the person.  The important thing is that there be total protection. I made this point before and I asked: does it matter a whit to a person in whose custody he is when he is guaranteed immunity?  This is the critical point.  This is the human rights, the civil rights aspect of the section that Senator Lenihan was so disparaging about.  I do not think it matters a whit who has custody provided the immunity is present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> It was argued that under the Bill, as drafted, a person might go North for a hearing on commission, that he might find himself in the custody of the British Army, having been handed over for administrative reasons or any other reasons&mdash;even mischievous reasons&mdash;and be ill-treated and that if he escaped if the opportunity presented itself to him, it would be intolerable that such a person would then be prosecuted under subsection (2) of section 3 for escaping from lawful custody.  Any custody that abused his statutory immunity could not by definition be lawful custody.  When it could not be lawful custody there could be no offence of escaping.  It was argued here, particularly by Senators Lenihan and Dolan, that such a person might find himself being abused, or interrogated against his will.</P>
    <P>Senator Dolan seems to have the question of hooding on the brain.  He painted the frightening picture of the man being hooded and interrogated non-stop for many hours and asked, who would blame such a person for escaping?  Nobody would.  Senator O'Higgins made the point that nobody would blame that person for escaping and it is unthinkable that he would be prosecuted.  Even if the unthinkable happened and he was prosecuted, I am saying that he would not have been guilty of any offence because the custody from which he escaped would have been unlawful custody by virtue of the clear breach of his statutory immunity.  Any person going North is protected by this immunity.  His custody must respect it.  If it does not respect it, the custody in which he is held is unlawful. It is no offence to escape from unlawful custody.</P>
    <P>The offence provided for in subsection (2) of section 3 is quite clearly the offence of escaping from lawful custody.  Senator Yeats proposes to add the words &ldquo;the custody of the police&rdquo; so that the subsection would read: &ldquo;A person who escapes from the custody of the police while in Northern Ireland pursuant to an order under section 11 (2) shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;  That does not <Col N="1216" /> improve the position of the accused one iota.  I think it possibly disimproves his position.  The reality of the situation is that when a person goes to Northern Ireland to seek to leave him constantly in the custody of the RUC is not to take account of administrative difficulties and realities.</P>
    <P>It may be necessary to lodge that person in prison overnight during an adjournment of the commission proceedings. If he is lodged in a prison overnight that prison may be under the care and control of the prison authorities and would it not be naive in the extreme to say that he would be committing no offence if he escaped from the prison authorities while lodged overnight with them whereas if he was lodged overnight in a RUC station he would be committing an offence?  An amendment which would lead to such a result would make a laughing stock of the legislation in question.  The chances are that a person may have to be lodged in a prison overnight or during an interval in the taking of evidence on commission.  As I pointed out on Committee Stage that prison may be nominally under the prison authority or it may be nominally under the military authority but run in practice by the prison authority.  I do not know how the prisons are organised in Northern Ireland, who controls them or who has legal responsibility for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I should know and I do not want to know.  I have enough to do watching the prisons down here.  I do not know how the prisons are legally organised, as to who has the legal custody of a person imprisoned in them, whether it is the prison authorities, the RUC or the army authorities, in some instances. Indeed, it might be argued that the custody of the person remains in the commissioner on behalf of the trial court.  It is a matter possibly of some argument as to who has custody of a person during a trial in this jurisdiction.  Is it the warders with whom he sits in the dock?  Is it the police who brought him to the court or is it the judge who has <Col N="1217" /> seisin of the trial?  The better opinion is that it is the trial judge who has the custody while a trial is proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a serious matter whether prisons are under the authority of the army?  Surely that is not so trivial for a Minister of Justice here not to be clear on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying it is a trivial matter at all.  What I am saying is that I do not know.  I was coming around to making the point that it can be quite a difficult technical legal point as to who would have seisin or custody of a person in a particular situation.  There could be areas in which the legal authority would be doubtful.  Even for a person on trial in this jurisdiction there would be some doubt as to the person who would have custody of him in the event of his escaping and being prosecuted and would have a right to order his presence or absence as the case may be.  The better authority is that it is the presiding judge, but the person is there possibly with the warders from the prison who brought him down and he has been committed to the care of the governor of the prison.  Again, the governor of the prison might be a military man.  He might be there having, what we might call, practical control of the prison, but legal control could be vested in a civilian who might be elsewhere. Therefore, it is not a simple matter nor could I be easily or readily expected to know, especially in the nuances of the Northern Ireland situation, who exactly would have legal custody at any particular time in a particular institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point is that before an offence under subsection (2) of section 3 can be committed the escape must be from lawful custody.  I submit that that can only be lawful custody within the jurisdiction where the escape takes place.  Assuming that such an offence were being prosecuted here as an extra-territorial offence it would be a matter of proof to satisfy the trial court here that the people who had custody of the person up to the time of his escape were the people <Col N="1218" /> lawfully entitled to have him in custody. This would be a matter for positive proof by a prosecution as part of the evidence they would have to adduce in order to secure a conviction.</P>
    <P>In answer to the particular argument by the Opposition who had some worries about a situation where because of the British Army's record of treating prisoners it might be that a person escaped because of ill-treat-ment, such an escape could not be from lawful custody because the breach of the immunity given to the person would, in my submission, make the custody unlawful.  That might not apply to a person in custody in his home jurisdiction.  His remedies would be other because there is, what I might call, no statutory immunity. There is a common law immunity not to be ill treated.  That common law immunity is present and it gives rise to remedies, civil and criminal, at the suit of the injured party against the authority responsible.  But it does not make the custody in the home jurisdiction <i>per se</i> unlawful.  The unlawfulness, if I might use the word, that would arise in this instance arises by virtue of the breach of a statutory immunity specifically given under this Bill and its corresponding English measure.</P>
    <P>To seek to confine this offence of escaping to escaping from the custody of the RUC is to put ourselves in quite a ridiculous position.  We can imagine a situation where prisoner A is arraigned in the custody of the RUC and is kept overnight in a police station; he escapes and comes down here, and is guilty of an offence if it can be proved against him.  If prisoner B, on the other hand, had been in the custody of the RUC during the taking of evidence and there was an adjournment overnight and he was lodged in a prison&mdash;or he may be a juvenile lodged in a place of detention&mdash;if he escaped and came down here there would be no offence.  That would be a ridiculous result and it would be an inevitable result from the amendment which the Opposition are making.  We should not put ourselves into the position of passing legislation which could <Col N="1219" /> have a ridiculous result.  It would lead to an inconsistency of that nature.  It would be bad law and bad for the standing of Parliament to do such a thing.</P>
    <P>The objectives sought by Senator Yeats in moving this amendment are laudable.  He is anxious to ensure that no injustice will be done to a person who might have to go in custody to Northern Ireland, but the assurance that no injustice will be done is not obtained in trying to define the type of custody into which that person is to be kept.  On the other hand, it is assured, beyond yea or nay, without equivocation, by the section providing for immunity.  As I said before, and it bears repeating, the immunity is from detention and any kind of suit or legal process in respect of any cause or matter, civil or criminal, arising before his arrival in Northern Ireland.  No matter how tempting or how juicy a subject the prisoner might be, his immunity is guaranteed.  This is where the real protection is given to the prisoner going North on commission.</P>
    <P>Again, as I say, a lot of this arises from a misreading of section 11.  Section 11 can only provide for custody at the point of departure.  We cannot say in whose custody a person will be when he leaves the point of departure. He can only be in the custody of the authorities in Northern Ireland.  If a person is in custody, I do not think it matters to him; he has not got his freedom.  This is the whole essence of custody.</P>

      <P>The Senator knows very well what I mean.  By and large, I am satisfied that the arguments which have been advanced in favour of the changing of the words &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo; to &ldquo;the custody of the police&rdquo; in subsection (2) of section 3 are not good arguments.  I have taken some time and gone to some pains to demonstrate why I think that.  I would suggest the Senators opposite who were not here for the whole of my contribution might read the record subsequently and be satisfied and possibly swayed by the arguments.</P>

      <P>When the Opposition are finished with their joke I want to remind them that this amendment is an absolute contradiction of what we have heard from the Opposition benches over a long period for many months.  For three or four hours we listened to Senator McGlinchey <Col N="1222" /> make the very argument that makes nonsense of the sort of amendment that is being put down here.  We have had illustration after illustration, quotations from every book and journal, decrying the actions of the RUC.  The Minister is quite right, because it was not once that any of these allegations were made.  We hear about a filibuster this evening, but Senator McGlinchey at least on a dozen occasions referred to the RUC, the police force in Northern Ireland, as the &ldquo;scum of the earth&rdquo;.  We have here an amendment which suggests that it is quite in order, quite respectable, for the authority in this State now to hand over a prisoner into the custody of that very police force which was referred to as the &ldquo;scum of the earth&rdquo;.  I must say I am proud of the job of convincing that our Minister for Justice has done on the Fianna Fáil Party when he has at last brought them around to saying that they believe it is all right for the authorities here to hand a prisoner over into the custody of the RUC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is quite right in pointing out that, regardless of what laws we pass here, what we say in our Bill, if we are ever to make an arrangement of this sort, at some stage our jurisdiction comes to an end and the jurisdiction of another authority takes over.  Regardless of how watertight we may propose to make it, we cannot go any further than that.  We cannot extend our authority for the moment across the Border whether we hand somebody into the custody of the RUC, the UDR, the army, whoever it may be.  That person is no longer in our custody.  No matter what laws we make, we are not in any position to say precisely how that person will be handled.  What we have done is all that any sovereign State can do.  We have laid down our conditions, which is quite normal practice, between two nations.  We have a sovereign State here.  It speaks for the people of this country with the very same authority as has the British Government, or the authorities in Northern Ireland.  Our State speaks with that authority and gives to the prisoner, who is being <Col N="1223" /> handed over all the protection that a sovereign state can give.  I am completely satisfied in so far as this Bill has sought to protect and give immunity to any prisoner being handed over.  It has done that as far and as well as it could be done.  I think it was a great pity that discussion on this section should have again brought forth the sort of emotional tirade&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to point out to the Senator that we are on an amendment, not on a section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but nevertheless, what we are discussing here is an amendment which must necessarily take us back on a lot of the arguments that have been submitted by the Opposition.  When one discusses what is at the basis of this amendment, the question of into whose authority we ought to give or ought not to give a prisoner, we must necessarily discuss the reasons.  Naturally, the Opposition, I suppose, want to make their case against the particular limb of the authority in the Six Counties and, on the other hand, I feel justified in making a case in reply.  They have gone to great lengths to establish an argument against the various sections of the authority in the Six Counties.  They have discussed and elaborated on the record of the British forces, the part-time UDR, and quoted to a great extent to make strong their argument that prisoners should not be handed into their custody.</P>
      <P>At this stage they recommend that we should give prisoners into the custody of the RUC, although previously they said this was a discredited and disreputable force. Senator McGlinchey went to great pains to point out that these men were the scum of the earth.  Therefore I think I am justified in replying that it was unfortunate that these arguments were used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also unfortunate that people who profess to desire a united Ireland, people who profess to believe <Col N="1224" /> that the people of this State, North and South, are one and the same people and should be reunited should then go to great lengths to elaborate on the foulness of a police force, on their complete untrustworthiness, their cruelty and barbarity.</P>
