      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1 and 2.  In connection with No. 1, an Earlier Signature motion will be circulated, and I propose to move that at the conclusion of No. 1. I cannot be certain about this but there is a possibility, I understand, that the IDA Bill may leave the Dáil.  If it should leave the Dáil today and if there is general agreement among Senators, we might take it tomorrow, but I am not pressing it.  I am merely indicating that so that Senators opposite can consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking this Bill because of the presence of the Minister for Labour at the meeting with the Social Conference. This is the second occasion on which the Minister for Labour has come to the House with a measure to control the salaries of bank officials. The previous occasion was in 1973. That Act expired by Order on 14th December, 1973.</P>
      <P>In June last, the Government, with the twin objectives of combating inflation and maintaining employment, took certain budgetary action.  The measures included the removal of VAT from clothing, footwear, electricity and all fuel (except road fuels), the introduction of subsidies on most CIE rates and fares, bread and flour, butter, liquid milk and town gas.  As a result of those Government initiatives, the cost-of-living was reduced by 0.8 per cent in the period mid-May to mid-August, 1975.  As a Government we sought that, in return for a slowing down of price increases, there should be a corresponding slowing down of income increases. Such voluntary agreement with trade unions was secured in that the third and fourth phases of the 1975 national agreement were revised to link them directly to changes in the consumer price index.  The immediate effect of the revision was to cancel the increases due to workers under the third phase of the 1975 national agreement. The Government's subsidies of June to reduce prices were designed to reduce the cost of living for all&mdash;including bank officials.  That is why the Minister for Labour requested the banks staff relations committee on 30th September, 1975 to advise as to what proposals the banks had for a comparable revision of the terms of their agreement bearing in mind that all other workers had revised their existing agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Labour met with the bank <Col N="315" /> employees on 27th and 31st October, 1975, in the hope of securing from them a revision of the third and fourth phases of their pay agreement, in line with the amendments effected in the national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>In the discussions with the employees' representatives, we did not seek any sacrifices from them or anything beyond what other workers had accepted voluntarily.  The bank employees, however, did not indicate that they would be prepared to amend their agreement in a manner likely to bear comparison to the amendment made by the majority of workers in the national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the banks' joint industrial council on 13th November, a proposal for the modification of their current pay agreement was considered by both sides.  This proposal was subsequently balloted on by the employees but was rejected.</P>
    <P>Last Friday the Minister for Labour met representatives of the Irish Bank Officials' Association in an effort to avert the need for legislation.  He said that if at any time an acceptable voluntary agreement could be reached the legislation would not be activated. He undertook to withdraw the Bill now before the House on the understanding that he would refer the 1974 and 1975 bank pay agreements to the Labour Court to report on whether these agreements conformed with the 1974 and 1975 national agreements as revised; for their part, the Irish Bank Officials' Association would agree to the deferral of payment of the third phase increase of their current pay agreement pending such Labour Court recommendation and that they would agree to accept the recommendation.  Regrettably these proposals were not acceptable to the representatives of the Irish Bank Officials' Association.</P>
    <P>We accept that bank officials are not parties to the national agreement, and in our efforts to achieve voluntary agreement on this matter we respected their wishes that they need not conform with every detail of that agreement, but their settlement must bear some comparison with that of the majority. <Col N="316" /> Other employees in the banks&mdash;apart from the bank officials&mdash;who include porters and cleaners in the banks have, in line with other workers accepted a moderation of their pay agreements on a voluntary basis.  Dáil Members, the judiciary and many others who are not formally bound by the agreement keep in line with it.  This principle appeared to have gained the acceptance of responsible bank employees, but their refusal to accept an amendment to their present agreement as other workers have done compels the Minister for Labour to ask the House to pass this legislation.  If any interest group choose to go their own way they make a mockery of the restraint practised by others, many of whom are suffering much more immediately from the effects of the recession in terms of job insecurity and unemployment.</P>
    <P>We would hope that, on passage of this legislation, if any savings accrue to the banks as a result of the Labour Court adjudication, the benefits will be passed on to members of the general public.  We have already suggested that consideration should be given to the abolition of bank service charges to personal current account holders.</P>
    <P>The present recession is longer and deeper than had generally been forecast. Last June the Economic and Social Research Institute predicted a fall of 1½ per cent in GNP for this year. By October they felt the situation had deteriorated still further than had been expected so their revised forecast was for a drop of 3½ per cent this year.</P>
    <P>The major economies of the world have begun to show signs of improvement, and it is now expected that by early 1977 a general recovery will be under way.  We will be in a weak position to participate in this recovery if we find ourselves with inflation and its counterpart, unemployment, at levels above those of our trading partners.  In 1976 we must devote our resources not to consumption but to investment; we must prepare our physical and human assets for a quick return to high growth rates and full participation in an expanding pattern of world trade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> The Bill is on the same lines as the legislation governing pay and conditions in the banks which was enacted in 1973 and we hope, therefore, that all stages can be taken today.  The present measure will come into operation and expire on days to be appointed by order.  The Bill contains provisions whereby the Minister for Labour could, should he consider it necessary to do so, impose a stay on the salaries and other conditions of employment in the banks.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains provisions which would enable the Minister for Labour by order, to prevent the banks from offering increases in wages or improvements in other conditions of employment in excess of those which the Labour Court would determine as appropriate in the light of the provisions of the national agreements. Contravention or failure by the banks to comply with the terms of such an order would constitute an offence which would render them, on conviction, liable to fines but not imprisonment. There are no penalties of any sort directed against the representatives of bank officials.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The important point that we would like to make on this side of the House is the situation that has given rise to the need for this legislation at this stage.  I quote from page four of the Minister's script:</P>
      <P>The present recession is longer and deeper than had generally been forecast.</P>
      <P>That is basically the trouble with the present Government.  They were advised by us on this side of the Seanad and in the Dáil that this is a serious economic recession which the Government did not appear at an early stage to be tackling, and they now appear, at a very late stage when the horse has gone, to be seeking to bolt the stable door.  The Taoiseach is going on television tonight apparently to explain the real depth and nature of recession to which the Minister has referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was obvious, to us certainly and to any intelligent observer, two <Col N="318" /> years ago.  Yet the ultimate in failure to grapple with the problem arose in relation to the wage agreement to which the Government, as the largest employer in the State, were a party in May of this year.  In April-May of this year the national wage agreement was entered into with the Government as the major interested party both as employer and as guardian of the economic welfare of the community and yet within one month of that wage agreement being entered into, the Government have been seeking in various ways to backtrack&mdash; the Minister for Labour in particular, as the Government agent in this area &mdash;on a situation into which they had blindly entered on the basis that the recession would not be as long and deep as it is turning out to be.</P>
    <P>It is altogether wrong for the Minister to say that the recession is longer and deeper than had been generally forecast.  It was forecast and forecast in very clear terms by us on this side of the House and in the Dáil.  I have articulated on numerous occasions in this respect, that the recession in which we now find ourselves and the inflationary spiral, combined with unemployment, called &ldquo;stagflation&rdquo;, was evident at a very early stage before the oil crisis.  Were it not for the expectations raised by the Government in the first budget introduced by them in 1973, our stagflation would not be anything like it is today.  Let us face it, every other member country of the EEC is more positively successful in getting out of this situation, despite the oil crisis which affects every member country, than we are.  These are basic facts, and it is for this reason, in order to cope in a desperate way with a small area of the problem, that this legislation is now before the House.</P>
    <P>We are not going to oppose the legislation because we recognise that, even though the horse has gone, bolting the stable door in the absence of the galloping horse of inflation does indicate some <i>bona fides</i>, some evidence of reality on the part of the Government that they now, at least, appreciate the situation.  To that extent this Bill is welcome as evidence of the <Col N="319" /> appreciation of a situation that should have been faced up to years ago.  It should certainly not have arisen within a month or two of the national wage agreement when the backtracking started.  This is further evidence of the backtracking at a very late stage.</P>
    <P>The facts are, of course, that bank employees, like everybody else in the community, were conned by the Government's attitude of euphoria towards the whole conduct and management of our affairs.  The bank employees, in good faith, made their own agreement last May, outside the context of the national wage agreement, with their employers.  As in previous years, they were not a party to the national wage agreement and therefore had not the benefit of the cost of living escalation clause.  They made their own agreement with their employers.  In recognition of the fact that the Government are now trying, though at a very late stage, to rectify the situation we are supporting the Government, but certainly as regard the bank employees concerned it is, to put it mildly, very bad handling of the problem.  Their case rests on the fact that they have been outside the wage agreement structure, have benefited less than other sections in the past by reason of not getting the cost of living escalation clause written into the wage agreement. They made their own arrangement with the bank last May and now find themselves under this draconian legislation being frustrated in achieving what they agreed upon with their employers outside the wage agreement structure.</P>
    <P>They are the basic facts prolonging this issue, and, with the greatest reluctance, we are not opposing this Bill because we appreciate the dire situation in which our economy now finds itself; we appreciate that the Government must, even at this late stage, take at least some measures that appear to be tackling the problem&mdash;and that is all this very minor attempt to deal with the economic problem does&mdash;in the sense that it gives evidence of the intentions of the Government to tackle the problem to that extent.  They now seem to be getting down to the business <Col N="320" /> of governing which has been neglected for nearly three years.  That, of course, is of very little assistance to this section of young people, male and female employees at clerical level, who&mdash;and I am told that at the voting these are the people who were predominant in their attitude&mdash;were misled by the Government and who I am reliably informed are people who are standing in this matter on principle, not on a question of getting the particular increases involved.  They feel they were greatly misled in regard to an agreement made by them in May last outside the national wage agreement structure when they now find the Government trying to incorporate them into the overall national wage agreement sector. Basically, their problem is the problem of our community, a community that has been misled and conned by the Government, not just in this area but across the whole area of economic development and progress.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to advert to the apparent contradiction between the provisions of this Bill particularly sections 3 and 4, and the provisions of sections 2 and 3 of the Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Act of 1975 in which the benign light of Women's Year was announced with great public relations éclat by the Minister for Labour.  Section 3 of this Bill deals not only with the amendment or variation of wages in regard to reference to the Labour Court and power to prohibit, temporarily, increases in remuneration paid by banks, but also with power to &ldquo;vary any other terms or conditions of employment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Act is basic legislation dealing with women's rights in regard to conditions and terms of employment.  The question I would like to ask the Minister is, what is the position of the State <i>vis-à-vis</i> the permanent legislation, which is the anti-discrimination legislation. The Minister and the Government hope&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;that this legislation will be of a temporary character.  The side headings to sections 3 and 4 do not give the whole story.  If one did not read sections 3 and 4 fully one would tend to think that the sections deal with remuneration <Col N="321" /><i>per se</i>, because the side heading to section 3 says:</P>
    <P>Reference to Labour Court and power to prohibit temporarily increases of remuneration, etc. paid by banks.</P>
    <P>The side note to section 4 says:</P>
    <P>Power to prohibit increases of remuneration paid by banks.</P>
    <P>The sections themselves refer to the other area I have mentioned, apart from remuneration, and again I refer to subsection (1) of section 3&mdash;</P>
    <P>Where any banks, whether before, on or after the commencement of this Act, pay or agree to pay increases of remuneration to any of their employees or amend or vary or agree to amend or vary any other terms or conditions of employment of any of their employees....</P>
    <P>Again in section 4 the side note would lead one to think that the only provision of section 4 was the power to prohibit increase of remuneration.  Section 4, subsection (1)&mdash;this is the penal section as far as the banks are concerned&mdash;reads:</P>
    <P>Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any banks, whether before, on or after the commencement of this Act, pay or agree to pay increases of remuneration to any of their employees or amend or vary or agree to amend or vary any other terms or conditions of employment of any of their employees so as to provide improved or more favourable terms or conditions of employment for them.</P>
    <P>Therefore, sections 3 and 4 of this Bill are not just dealing with remuneration but also with terms or conditions of employees.  Section 2 of the basic piece of legislation passed by this Oireachtas, the Anti-Discrimination Act of 1975, states:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this Act, discrimination shall be taken to occur in any of the following cases&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  where by reason of his sex a person is treated less favourably than a person of the other sex.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> The terms and conditions of female employees in the banks may be improved in accordance with the legislative directive in section 2, in particular, of the Anti-Discrimination Employment Act, and the other sections which actually prohibit discrimination on the part of employers, for instance under section 3 of the same Act.  It goes on into further detail, but section 2 defines discrimination, where the female sex is treated less favourably than the other sex, in regard to terms or conditions.  Then section 3 prohibits an employer from discriminating in such a manner.  We have a situation where the banks are prohibited, under this legislation, from improving the terms or conditions of their female employees and penalised under section 4 of this Bill if they so attempt to do.  This is ludicrous. Under the legislation before this House the banks, as employers, can be heavily penalised if they observe the directives contained in the Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Act in regard to their female employees.  The Bill before us not alone deals with remuneration but also deals with terms and conditions.</P>
    <P>In dealing with terms and conditions, if the banks decide by way of agreement to deal with their female employees as directed to deal with them in regard to terms and conditions under the Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Act, they are committing an offence under the Bill now before this House.  This is, in my view, a very serious position and one that should be examined in a serious way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have any time apart from the Minister's word in the other House.  We are talking about legislation before this House.  As far as the Bill before the House is concerned there is no question of limitation in regard to time of operation.  We have the Minister's word that this will not be a continuing measure and will be suspended if the matter is settled.  I <Col N="323" /> am talking in terms of legislation that is being rushed through the Houses of the Oireachtas without proper attention. It appears ludicrous in the extreme that we should be penalising employers for observing the directives contained in a Bill, solemnly passed by this Oireachtas with great <i>éclat</i>, with great speech-making to women's organisations all over the country, with mutual congratulatory remarks, various seminars, senaces and sessions.  We have a situation where, in women's year of 1975, the major stroke in this direction of the equal rights for women and men was the Government's Anti-Discrimination Act of 1975, and we have now a legislation which makes it a penalty for employers, i.e. bank employers, to equalise the terms and conditions of female employment in the banks.  These are the basic facts, and I would like to hear in a substantial way from the Minister on this aspect because I think it is a substantial point.  If the Minister is really concerned about passing legislation that is related to the problem at hand, then he could pass the legislation and have in the section, as is set out in the side note, that the basic sections 3 and 4 of the Bill, refer to remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Et cetera</i> in No. 3 and not referred to in No. 4.  To be consistent with the existing legislation of this Oireachtas, the two sections, properly drafted should confine themselves to remuneration and not include terms or conditions.  If terms or conditions are improved by the banks in regard to their female employees they are observing the directives contained in the Anti-Discrimination Act and are being penalised under the legislation we are now proposing to pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are the facts of the situation. I have checked out the matter.  This Bill is urgent and necessary because of the general economic climate, and the importance of having an overall balanced wages and incomes policy. That fact that that is agreed, by all <Col N="324" /> responsible people, to be necessary in the present economic climate does not excuse the Government for bringing in legislation which is at variance with their own previous legislation which was passed solemnly, and was one of the jewels of their legislation in the current year of 1975, Women's Year. That is not the way Government should behave.  We are not here to allow to pass unheeded slovenly and contradictory legislation of this kind, legislation negativing existing legislation.  We are not here to do that in a serious House of Parliament.  We are here as a responsible Opposition to help the Government out of the terrible mess in which they have got themselves.  We are not going to oppose the Bill for that responsible reason.  We would like to point out that that is no excuse for preparing slovenly legislation and enacting it as a solemn Act of this Oireachtas, legislation that is in direct conflict with their own existing legislation passed some months ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe it necessary for a Member of my Party in particular to be lengthy in speaking on this Bill, in support of it.  The principle behind the Bill is one of defence of the national wage agreement. Workers other than bank staffs in the first place voluntarily accepted the overall agreement, and secondly, at the invitation of the Government, accepted the voluntary revision of the terms of the agreement.  It is quite indefensible that some workers should benefit at what quite clearly would be the expense of others, were the bank officials to be permitted to proceed along the lines currently indicated by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other workers in the banking system, as the Minister has stated, are bound by the terms of the agreement, and have voluntarily accepted what is in effect a downward revision of their pay and salary expectations, because of the success of the Government's anti-inflationary packet of June of this year.  It is inequitable that a man who works in a bank, and who happens to be a cleaner, or a porter, should be bound by one set of rules. and another who stands behind a desk with a white collar should be bound <Col N="325" /> by a different set of rules.  It is inequitable that the workers within the banking system should not be bound by the same overall general rules in relation to pay and salaries as others within the industry, when the great majority of workers who service and support their industry are also trade unionists, voluntarily bound by a national set of rules in relation to pay and salaries.</P>
    <P>I believe the reason why this Bill is before the House is that we have here an example of the dangers which are attendant upon worker snobbery.  The bank officials should be part of the overall trade union movement.  There is no justification for the fact that they are outside the movement and that they regard themselves as being, I would not say superior to, but in some way different from the rest of workers within this country.  Had the Bank Officials' Association been a part of the trade union movement this Bill would not have been necessary because, like the great generality of workers they would have accepted the majority decision of Congress and would have been bound by the terms of the revision of the agreement. There are many workers in trade unions and many trade unions who do not accept the principle behind the national wages agreement.  There were others who, while accepting the principle, did not accept the necessity to revise it last June.  Nonetheless as democrats and good trade unions they accepted the majority decision of Congress on both occasions.  If the bank officials had been and were now members of the trade union movement they would have acted in concert with those who support their current position and accepted the overall majority decision of Congress.  I, therefore, repeat that this legislation is an example of the dangers which are attendant upon what is nothing more than worker snobbery.  Those who are organised within associations and trade unions in defence of working class interests have an inescapable obligation to be part of the overall movement and to be loyal to the Trade Union Congress.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that the <Col N="326" /> savings which will arise from this legislation should go towards a decrease in bank service charges.  I would not like it to be thought that this legislation would result simply in the saving of labour costs to the banks and therefore an increase of their profits.  The money which is saved by the passage of this legislation, should be devoted to subsidising the high mortgage interest rates, which the banking industry as a whole is partly responsible for by its raising of the price of money, and the attendant effect of that on building societies.</P>
    <P>The long-term solution to this type of problem is the nationalisation of the banks.  Credit is in itself a social product and it is obnoxious that, at a time of general economic depression, the banking system should be booming to the extent of over £30 million profits.  The whole business of banking should be brought within social control and then perhaps the banks staff association might look quite differently upon their own role within the banking industry and their obligations towards the rest of the working class.</P>
    <P>This Bill is introduced in an economic situation of the utmost gravity. This fact should have forced the bank officials to reconsider their demands, irrespective of the merits which might buttress their case or the principle which they believe themselves to be defending.  There is need for unparalleled co-operation and restraint by all sections if we are to preserve employment and if we are to prevent unemployment from rising to figures of the order of 120,000 or 130,000.  Nobody in the community is exempt from the social obligation of co-operating in measures designed to protect employment. Therefore I support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed and amused to see the Minister having to come into this House with this legislation. If we try to find out why such a thing should happen the answer can be found in the record of this Government. It is amusing to listen to Senator Halligan making distinctions between various types of workers.  He should know that industrial workers are a very important part of the community <Col N="327" /> and that their earnings are higher in many cases than those of some of these people mentioned in this Bill.  This is not the time to draw demarcation lines between white-collar and other types of workers.  At present all of the workers are clothed very well and fellows in all classes of employment can wear collars and ties if they so wish.  The distinction that Senator Halligan makes is not relevant in 1975.</P>
      <P>The Government are in a desperate position and have rushed in here with this legislation.  I am afraid that it will not be too long before the order to abandon ship must be given.  We see a Labour/Fine Gael Coalition Government.  The Labour Party, in particular, are pledged to fight for better conditions and pay for the workers.  Nevertheless, this Government, of which they are a part, are pushing through a Bill which will be a curb on what a worker can earn in whatever profession or salary he is. If they succeed in relation to the bank officials, they will be able to bring in similar legislation regarding the civil service, teachers, farmers, Federation of Rural Workers, or any other type of people who are in employment. It is the thin end of the wedge.  It is an acknowledgment that the great agreement, which we were led to believe was brought to fruition in May of this year, is not working. I pity the Minister for Finance who is trying to deal effectively with the national economy and expecting support from other elements in the Coalition Cabinet, people who were sitting around a table at Liberty Hall and taking quite different decisions on wage agreements from those which they would make when around the Government table.  This has done immense harm.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan made a very interesting point about the employment of women and the expectations that some women had of equal pay and the effect that this legislation may have in this sphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to protecting banks in general, I have always felt that banks <Col N="328" /> down the years have not given the service they should give to the nation and indeed to the individual.  They chose times to open and close and they determined the interest rate to be paid, and it was very difficult in days gone by to get any money from them.</P>
    <P>If we are to progress the banks must be able to lend money and meet the requirements of the nation.  I would not make a case to save money for the banks.  People who worked in banks many years ago found that the remuneration in those days was very meagre.  It was through the union established by the officials themselves that they were able to get from the banks a fairly decent salary.  They have formed their own union or association and it amazes me to find out that it does not seem to be recognised as a union by the Labour element of the Government.</P>
    <P>We, on this side of the House, will not be opposing this Bill.  We cannot do anything about it.  It is the Government's fault to have got themselves into this mess.  They have now found that they have to come in here and try to pilot this legislation through the House.  They know that it is not a very popular piece of legislation.  At the same time they are wise enough to know that there are not that many bankers in Ireland and there is not that great sympathy throughout rural Ireland for bank officials.  In many instances bank officials have put themselves on higher pedestals than most of the community. Perhaps they may pay for it in this respect now.</P>
    <P>We must remember that they are people in employment anyway and perhaps rushing through this type of legislation may eventually lead us on to a situation whereby we may be faced with another bank strike.  That might be something the Government themselves might desire because of the situation in which we find ourselves now with 103,000 or 105,000 people unemployed; it might suit the Government's action and policy if the banks were closed for six months at least.</P>
    <P>We do not want to oppose this piece <Col N="329" /> of legislation because we know the Government find themselves in a mess at present.  We know that there is economic recession.  We know that there are 105,000 people unemployed. We know that the school-leavers have been unable to find jobs.  Prices have escalated beyond all expectations over the last 12 months.  The Minister has admitted here that the country is in a sorry mess at present.</P>
    <P>It has taken a long time to get this admission from Government spokesmen. Now that we have reached the stage where they openly admit that their policies have been a complete failure perhaps they might now pull up their socks.  Perhaps they might say to themselves: &ldquo;At least we have told the people exactly what the position is.&rdquo;  I am a great believer in telling people exactly what the position is. There is no point in trying to draw a smokescreen over their eyes or trying to pretend that the cost of living was reduced by a pound, as was said by Senator Halligan.  That type of nonsense is ridiculous, because it is a well known fact that the cost of living has not been reduced.  Every housewife knows that every week there are increases in prices in almost every commodity bought.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs have just announced another price increase in postal services.  There are other various increases in the pipeline.</P>
    <P>Naturally we expect that when people are ill those who have jobs would stand behind them.  That is a situation that we in Fianna Fáil would freely support. When people are unemployed the rest of the community have to make sacrifices. It is very hard on the rest of the community to have to continue subsidising those who are out of work.  It is not our fault that the situation is like that.</P>
    <P>In 1973, when we handed over to the Coalition Government, there was employment for all, emigration had stopped, the finances of the country were sound.  That was the situation that obtained in 1973 and we can now see the situation in 1975.  That is only two-and-a-half years ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister has admitted that the situation could get even worse.  He <Col N="330" /> more or less says: &ldquo;Mair a chapall agus gheobhair féar&rdquo;&mdash;Live horse and you will get grass.  Perhaps in 1977 there might be an improvement.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is going on the air tonight to issue another warning.  It will be his Christmas message to 105,000 unemployed&mdash;to live in hope because there is something good around the corner.  Oil and gas will be discovered, this country will get rich and there will be employment for all. I do not think that situation is as near as the Government think.  It is a sorry situation they have got themselves into when they have to oppose people seeking an increase in wages and make the excuse for doing that that the cost of living has been reduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the circumstances, I welcome the legislation.  My interpretation of why it is necessary might be very different from the interpretation put forward by people on the other side of the House.  If we had a situation where wage increases were freely negotiated between employers and employees, were based on productivity, based on the profits made in a partticular industry as a result of the efforts of the people employed in that industry, where people worked harder, worked longer hours, made a greater effort to produce more efficiently&mdash;if these were the criteria applied when decisions on wage increases were being sought, then I would definitely oppose this type of legislation.  I would say it was a threat to the rights of workers and of people employed in industry and public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it is we have a situation where the law of the jungle has prevailed.  In the past it was not the people who produced the most, who produced most efficiently, who gave the best return, who got the higher wages, who got the greatest increases or got any increase at all.  Those who got the increases in the past were those who applied the most pressure.  It was the people who could put their finger on the vital nerve at the right time who succeeded in getting wage increases. For this reason I welcome the attitude of the Minister for Labour in saying clearly, and backing it up with legislation, that a small group of people in <Col N="331" /> the right position should not have the right to hold all of us up to ransom and demand what they want for themselves.</P>
    <P>Here we have a comparatively small group of people, people who are in a service which has placed itself in a vital position in Irish life at the present time.  I do not believe they perform a vital role or a vital function. They have maneouvred themselves into a very strategic position in our society, a position of great power beyond the service they perform to society.  As a result of their position they are able to apply the right sort of pressure on the nerve centre at the right time.  In addition, they are in an industry which, regardless of how other sections fare, regardless of how many people are unemployed, regardless of what our balance of payment position is, can ensure and have ensured for themselves higher profits than ever before.  They have a comparatively small number of people employed and can afford to give wages which appear at present to be extraordinary in many respects.</P>
    <P>If this is compared to the situation in industry and agriculture, and especially in agriculture&mdash;it is no harm to reflect that a smaller number of people engaged in that industry export more goods than ever before, produce more than ever before and take a much smaller return for the work done than that to which they are entitled to.  Only 2 per cent of farmers in the west of Ireland can achieve the target of £36 per week of an income after three years' planning and with the most expert advice available. We then begin to realise there is something wrong with the manner in which wage increases have been negotiated over the years.</P>
    <P>I do not accept Senator Halligan's point that it is a matter of snobbery and that this section are out of the mainstream of trade unionism.  I have observed down through the years the people who are in the mainstream of trade unionism, and the bank employees would be included in this.  If they found it necessary to get a better deal than they were getting <Col N="332" /> they would be in the mainstream of trade unionism.  The reason they are not is that they are well able to look after themselves without the assistance of the trade union movement. They know that the law of the jungle prevails.  As long as they are capable of looking after themselves independently of the trade unions they will stay outside of it.  It is only when they find it necessary to further their own objectives that they will join the trade unions.  The idea of snobbery is far wide of the point.  It is a matter of personal gain.</P>
    <P>I have very positive views on how the banks should spend that money. I have observed in the past that, in the fields of agriculture and industry, the banks have a few highly skilled public relations people who flaunt their qualifications and degrees but they are not used to improve the industries in which they invest their money.  I should like to see the banks employing some worth-while people who are qualified in industry and agriculture, who could go out and meet the agricultural community and the industrialists, judge the position, and offer advice.  The banks are in a monopoly position with very little competition and they have failed to provide themselves with the expertise necessary to help agriculture and industry in which they invest money from time to time. They should use this money to train and employ specialists to help Irish industry and, indeed, our whole economy.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the banks, who have so much power over our economy, are in such a poor position to evaluate for themselves the merits of their various investments.  They have reduced their operations almost completely to the criteria of what it is safe for them to do.  They do not try to evaluate the merit of the people to whom they lend money.  They do not try to assess the future of industry, or what benefit it can bring to a particular area by way of employment. Their criteria are security and safety. The money saved could be spent on employing a number of experts, who would be employed as experts, and <Col N="333" /> not as public relations people, to advise them on how best to invest their money for the improvement of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation.  It is necessary.  If people were paid according to their return and if wages increases were paid on grounds of productivity, I would not support this measure.  In the circumstances the Government have no alternative and the Minister for Labour is very wise to introduce this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many features and implications in this Bill and some of them are more serious than others.  To me, as a member of the Labour Party, the fact that a wages standstill Bill or Order is introduced by a trade union official, a fellow member of the Labour Party, the Minister for Labour, is particularly shameful and a particularly difficult thing to sustain.  The fact that a Senator so closely associated with the Labour Party, Senator Halligan, should have made his defence of this Bill by trying to create the impression that there is some utterly bogus class position in this Bill is, again, particularly saddening.</P>
      <P>I fought a number of these types of Bills as far back as the early 1950s when I was a Minister.  An order was being made by the then Leader of the Labour Party in the Cabinet to help the banks to close the banks.  That is the law.  They have to get an order from the Government.  I was the one Minister who declined to sign the order because to me it was effectively a lock-out and I would not be a party to a lock-out of any kind of worker. The order could not be signed.  The then Taoiseach, Mr. Costello, had to go back and negotiate with Mr. Ganly, I think his name was, and they found some kind of a settlement.  It is totally bogus and completely fraudulent of Senator Halligan to try to separate this group of workers simply because they are not members of a trade union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McCartin, a Member of the Fine Gael Party, put it very simply and bluntly.  We operate under the law of the jungle.  Normally I could talk about private enterprise, free enterprise, <Col N="334" /> capitalist systems, monopoly, capitalism. That is what Senator McCartin meant.  That is what I mean&mdash;the law of the jungle.  Over the years these bank officials, in their wisdom, have decided that they will try to get the best deal for themselves through their association and not within the trade union movement.  We cannot have it both ways.  Do we allow them to have the right of free collective bargaining? This is one of the stars in the great democratic crown of the Western democracies. An amendment was put down by the present Tánaiste, Deputy Corish, in 1966, on a similar Bill in which he asked the Dáil to decline to give a Second Reading to the Bill on the ground that it deliberately abolished the fundamental right of trade unionists to free collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now doing this on behalf of the Fine Gael Party of which the Labour Party are now, of course, total prisoners.  I can well understand the position of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Donegan, who introduced the Bill in the Seanad today.  I have no quarrel with him.  This is his policy.  This is what he believes in. This is the way he thinks workers should be treated.  When capitalism is under threat, when capitalism is in crisis, turn on the workers and see that they make the sacrifices.  That is his policy.  I do not agree with it but he has always been very loyal to it, as equally have all the Fine Gael Senators. I have no quarrel with them about this at all.  This is naked, unashamed, monopoly capitalism, conservative social thinking, conservative economic policy.</P>
    <P>I have always taken the position that I do not believe in monopoly capitalism. I do not believe in private enterprise. I do not think it achieves the objective I want.  I know it achieves the objective the Minister for Defence wants, but that is not the same objective I want.  It has achieved its objective here over the past 50 years: approximately 5 per cent own 75 per cent of the wealth of the country.  That is success all right for private enterprise. I do not deny it.  But that is not what I, as a socialist, want.  The 5 per cent have achieved this wealth at <Col N="335" /> the expense of the workers.  Money workers created in their jobs was taken over and used by this small 5 per cent. This is what I object to.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the system can create the wealth.  I do not think we can have a socially just order as a by-product of monopoly capitalism. Does anybody seriously hold that view now?  If so, I will give way and allow somebody to tell me he does.  How can anybody defend monopoly capitalism in the present state of the world? There is a terrible crisis all over the world, in the United States, in Great Britain, in Western Europe and here.</P>
    <P>The dominating economic force is the force of conservative monopoly capitalism.  There is the pathetic picture of the city of New York going bankrupt, one of the most wealthy cities in the world.  The United States are in very severe straits now.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about forecasts. Unfortunately we cannot take his forecasts seriously because he even admitted in his speech that what had been forecast had failed to materialise and that things are going to be worse than they had thought.  It is particularly important that the Government should not be allowed to continue with this kind of terribly dangerous day-dreaming&mdash;which is a substitute for serious political thinking, serious political analysis&mdash;in which they are indulging, in which they have indulged for the past two-and-a-half to three years and which has landed us in this crisis in which we are now turning to workers and saying: &ldquo;In order to support our system, in order to maintain it, in order to keep it in operation, we want you to take a cut in living standards.&rdquo;  Why should workers take a cut in living standards to support a system under which they do so badly?  Why should they do that?  Why should they make any sacrifices at all?</P>
    <P>The Minister said the major economies of the world are beginning to show signs of improvement, and so on, what Senator Dolan called the live horse and you will get grass attitude which they have maintained for a very long time.  I remember at the <Col N="336" /> first conference after the Coalition was formed the present Minister for Industry and Commerce telling us that prices had reached a plateau&mdash; this lovely flowery language he uses. The general idea was that we had reached a plateau.  That is two-and-a-half years ago&mdash;about 40 points on the cost-of-living index I suppose. Things were looking up at that time &mdash;looking up was right&mdash;and everything would be all right.  This kind of fatuous and inane simplistic picture of how things happen or why things happen in a society such as ours is the most frightening thing about this Government.  They are never short of a euphoric kind of bromide to placate the unfortunate public who are genuinely very very frightened now. I personally have never known our society in such a state of total apprehension and foreboding as it is at present.  It is very, very frightening indeed.</P>
    <P>Far from this upturn, the latest word from the United States is that the upturn will be a very transient one.  It will go up and up through next summer, and then next winter, the Dow Jones average, the whole economy, will go right through the floor, down in the 300 mark, and the money poured in through a change in taxation a year or so ago, to cause a reflation of the economy, will cause a very transient upturn.  For the first time I have read the terrifying word in relation to the American economy &ldquo;hyper-inflation&rdquo;.  In recent weeks this has tended to become more frequent in relation to the British economy which is tottering to its demise at a terrifying rate too.  It is the first time I have heard it used in relation to the American economy.</P>
    <P>It is in the context of this kind of thing that we see the hunting of these unfortunate bank officials who are ordinary Irish people, ordinary Irish men and women and this attempt by Senator Halligan to try to create a mini-class war against these unfortunate people who have negotiated these wages and salary increases on a perfectly <i>bona fide</i> basis.  A case was put forward by their officials on their behalf, and then by the banks, and presumably they came to a settlement on <Col N="337" /> foot of a perfectly legitimate case put forward on their behalf.  There is nothing extravagant, nothing wildly out of line with reasonable expectations for people, in what they are getting.</P>
    <P>This wage standstill has to be taken in the context of the other completely shocking attacks and assaults on our living standards which are happening every day.  It is really quite an ordeal now to listen to the morning news and to hear the latest increases in posts and telegraph charges, increase in transport charges, the likelihood that, as Senator Lenihan said, women will not be given equal pay.  There is the drop in the Government investment. All of these things are all in their own way assaults on living standards.  This fits into the total all round assault on living standards by this Government, by this Coalition, the third Coalition, which seems to me to be likely to prove, of all the three disastrous Coalitions, the most disastrous. We are only beginning now.  We have not really reached rock bottom. Everybody knows that.</P>
    <P>I remember when 100,000 unemployed had us all out on O'Connell Bridge.  There were baton charges, protest marches, and an astonishing amount of unrest.  Apparently the figure is to be increased again, taking it up to 130,000 and then 150,000, not to talk about the poor youngsters who worked so hard in order to get their qualifications and now find themselves without jobs.  It is a disastrous record. The general impression they are trying to create is that, in some way or other, it is the fault of the bank officials, that in some way they are to blame, that if these people do not take a cut in their living standards something terrible is going to happen.  Something terrible is going to happen anyway, but it has nothing to do with the bank officials.</P>
    <P>It is the total and complete irresponsibility of the Government who have been there for two-and-a-half to three years.  All Governments take office on the assumption that they have the authority and the power to take certain steps in order to create a just society of one kind or another and to deal with matters like unemployment <Col N="338" /> and inflation and control.  This Government have totally failed to do that. They do not even seem to be agreed on this question.</P>
    <P>The Minister made an extraordinary admission in his opening speech.  He talked about after 1977.  This is 1975 is it not?  1976 is coming up, and then &ldquo;probably in 1977&rdquo;.  This is an astonishing admission surely from the Government.  With unemployment at 108,000, moving to 130,000 to 150,000 and with youngsters who have never registered, and so on, we will be touching a figure of 200,000 unemployed. How can the Government have the nerve to come in here and in any way denigrate any section of the community&mdash;and a person like Senator Halligan support that denigration&mdash;and suggest that if they would only play the game everything would be all right?  Everything will not be all right even if we pass this Bill. All who support this Bill know that well.</P>
    <P>This simplistic approach is the most frightening part, the simplistic assessment, and then the formula is produced. The formula does not work and they do not mind.  They just ride on regardless and produce another formula.  This is what they have been doing since they came into power.</P>
    <P>In the recent by-election in the west of Ireland there was an obvious difference between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce on whether, in fact, the problem was due to the world pressures which the Minister talked about or the specific pressures of excessive wage demands. The Taoiseach, naturally, came down on the conservative, capitalist side of excessive wage demands.  If we could only control those, everything would be all right.  It is much more serious. They will not be all right.  The one factor which has been accepted by most people as a cause of the disastrous situation is the oil crisis.  It is particularly important, not because of the disastrous changes caused in the whole of the western European economies, the response of feeding these increases in prices into the economy and the inflationary changes which took place, but because of the fact that there has been this wonderful&mdash;<Col N="339" /> to me, anyway&mdash;awakening amongst these countries, the primary producing countries.</P>
    <P>They have suddenly realised that they are very powerful people.  The OPEC people were the first to understand that.  They have banded together and they are holding together.  I do not accept that they are holding us to ransom.  They are simply saying that we must pay an economic price for the oil which we have been getting for next to nothing up to now.</P>
    <P>What is even more important than that is the new development that the other primary producing countries know they have the West completely where they want them.  There is little we have now in relation to these countries which they have not got except, perhaps, technological know-how and skills of one kind of another, which they are rapidly learning.  So, we are left in this country, as in most of the western countries, in a position in which the copper producing countries are doing exactly the same thing&mdash; Zambia, Zaire, The Rhodesias, South Africa.  Increases in prices in that regard will be fed into the economy.</P>
    <P>The recent move by Morocco to take over the phosphates&mdash;another terribly important component of any western economy&mdash;represents a new position of monopoly prices which we will not be able to stand up to.  There are other things like bauxite aluminium, mercury and iron ores which are very important to industry in which there is a total monopoly.  This is an utterly new situation.  It is not the usual &ldquo;boom and bust&rdquo; pattern of western capitalism.  It is quite different. This is the terrifying thing about this Government.  They do not see it as that at all.  They just feel that with downturns, or Deputy Keating's U-turns, or Ministers' upturns, everything will be all right.  It will not be all right.  Silly little measures of this kind&mdash;hurting a number of people admittedly&mdash;do nothing at all to deal with the real position of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Probably one of the ugliest features of this whole development by this Coalition Government, and only in <Col N="340" /> respect of the Labour component&mdash;I exclude the Fine Gael Party because it comes naturally to them to do this kind of thing&mdash;is the fact that they are now party to a campaign carried on by the press, the television, the radio, to set workers at one another's throats.  We saw a good example of it a few minutes ago from Senator Halligan when he tried to make one worker angry at another worker because he is a snob; there is class quality in his demand and not in yours.  That is not true.  He is a worker.  He is earning his living by skill of hand, or mind, or whatever it is.</P>
    <P>No worker has a right to turn on another worker under any circumstances. There are too many on the other side for workers to fight amongst themselves.  These people are fighting for higher living standards for their families.  What would this money go on, if they get it?&mdash;and they have every right to get it if they negotiate it by free collective bargaining.  It would not go on trips to the Bahamas or Florida, or a bigger or better yacht, a new &ldquo;Jag&rdquo; or a Rolls Royce. It would go on food, milk, meat, vegetables, clothes, education, books, essentials for the ordinary, average Irish family.  That is what it would go on.</P>
    <P>If one set of workers within the banking industry are not as well cared for as another, whose fault is it?  Why should the porter not get as good a deal as any other kind of worker within the banking system?  Whose fault is it if the porter or the cleaner does not get as good a deal as the bank officials' association gets for its workers?  Is it the banks?  Is it the bank officials?  Could it be the unions by any chance?  This is a particularly pernicious development&mdash;the setting of workers against one another.  It can be seen running through this speech and through all the speeches of all the Ministers of the Coalition Cabinet.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is that those who are in work must make sacrifices for those who have not got jobs.  Does not everybody see this trend developing now? &ldquo;You are very lucky.  The unemployed need your help.  Take a cut in your <Col N="341" /> standard of living for their sakes.&rdquo; Appealing to the average worker is an unanswerable appeal because of their classical, historic, never-ending generosity to one another.  They will make sacrifices.  Why cannot the other group make sacrifices?  Why cannot the 5 per cent be asked to make sacrifices? What is wrong with sacrifices from the wealthy class in our society?  Why should it always be the workers who are asked to make these sacrifices?</P>
    <P>Make no mistake, the principle underlying this Bill&mdash;it can be seen in all propaganda being put out, in all the speeches&mdash;is the principle which will underline the approach to the trade union negotiations in the national wage agreement.  There was the attack on the indexing system which was a fair system.  The trade union leadership will be faced with an Act which has already been established and to which they have subscribed.  Those who vote for this Bill will have subscribed to this pattern of wage freeze, wage control, a drop in living standards. Make no mistake, if these people do not get this increase&mdash;they looked for it simply to keep their standard of living at a reasonable level&mdash;they must suffer.  Who must suffer?  The men, of course, the women and the children will suffer.  There is no doubt about that.  Their families are the people who must suffer.  Everybody knows that the average Irish men are concerned practically exclusively for their families. The majority of them are&mdash;how they are dressed, the kind of education they get, how long they go to school, the food they eat.  These are the simple things bought by workers with the wages and salaries they get.</P>
    <P>This is an attack on the living standards of these innocent people.  The principle here is an attempt to introduce a very simplistic assessment of the causes of our present terribly dangerous economic situation.  One part in the conflict between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce is that the sources of our present disastrous economic situation are exclusively or predominantly exterior to the country and the other is that it is endemic to society or it is domestic pressures which are causing this present situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="342" /> The latter part of it, of course, is true.  Oil, as I conceded earlier, has obviously been a very important component in damaging the economies of all the western European democracies. But this other thesis which is now being put forward by the Coalition, that is, the control of wages&mdash;and this is supported by CII and all the other vested interests&mdash;is not correct.  It is not as simple as that.  I am always faced with this difficulty when talking on measures of this kind that with the facts as they are&mdash;the demand to damage in some way the interests of workers and at the same time the demand that we should defend the system which is responsible for damaging the interests of the workers&mdash;my case always is: if you believe you can make this capitalist system operate then do so.  You had 50 years to do it here.  What has happened to it?  What has gone wrong with it?  Why can you not make it work? Why can you not see that people get a good health service, good education, good care in old age, good housing? You failed on every one of these counts in the last 50 years, those of you who believe in monopoly capitalism.  This is a scandalous society in regard to the cultural, social and educational content of the lives of the people and any other way you like to look at it.  You have failed on every single count and now you turn to the simplistic analysis of it: if we could only deal with wages everything would be all right.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Industrial Organisation sent us this report by survey teams on 22 industries.  Most of you probably remember it.  It was a most interesting inquiry initiated by the late Seán Lemass in the early sixties.  It was interesting because the findings were particularly depressing.  It showed that protection had provided us with an extraordinary incompetent level of industry.  A few people made a lot of money.  But, as far as society is concerned, were it not for the appalling level at which emigration continued for so long&mdash;one in three having to emigrate&mdash;we would have had a revolutionary situation here 20 or 25 years ago.  However, let us not give up hope.  We are, I suspect, rapidly approaching that happy situation.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from this <Col N="343" /> report just to offset the emphasis on the question of the importance of wages in the establishment of a sound economy.  In relation to management it says:</P>
    <P>To some extent, all the shortcomings of the surveyed industries discussed in other sections of this report are also shortcomings of management.  Without intelligent analysis of all industrial problems by management and initiative in the solution of these problems, no firm or industry can be efficient.</P>
    <P>At page 19 the report says:</P>
    <P>The present lack of well-trained management is reflected in the relatively low use of modern management techniques reported by the survey teams.</P>
    <P>A summary on page 26, says:</P>
    <P>Labour relations were in most cases good and there have been few strikes.  Some recruitment difficulties arose in most of the industries.  Chief problems have been with female labour mainly in the Dublin area....  But there was also difficulty in management, technician and skilled grades.  The generally lower level of wages and salaries in Ireland compared with Britain appears to result in emigration which exacerbated recruitment problems.  Training could generally be much improved and this would lead to an increase in productivity.  There was considerable room for improvement in the use of modern managerial techniques in the industries surveyed.</P>
    <P>Buildings and equipment were, in a number of cases, somewhat old and unsuitable.  The type of machinery in use was generally not suited to modern mass-production techniques&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and production runs were in most cases short.  Production was usually highly diversified and as a result of these factors costs of production were usually relatively high.</P>
      <P>I simply referred to those few points &mdash;and there are many more of that kind in that very interesting report&mdash; to show that it is much more complicated than simply turning to the worker and saying: &ldquo;You are getting paid too much.&rdquo;  The same kind of thing appears in a recent CII report, which made much the same case in defence of the Coalition Government's policy&mdash;they are worried that the safety valve of emigration is gone and that now they have to try to provide enough jobs.  Thirty-seven thousand new jobs are needed and they are providing jobs at the rate of 2,000 a year and&mdash;this is an astonishing statement&mdash;there has been a drop in the number of people who work in the economy over the 17-year period since 1958.  This is an incredible admission of failure, when we think of the millions of pounds given by the IDA and Fóir Teo.  I am trying to make the point about this business of saying that if we cut somebody's wages everything will be all right, ignoring the fact of the failure over the years by private enterprise to put money back into industry, to keep up with technical development, new skills, management techniques, export drive, to rationalise their production and so on.  Probably the least factor of all was wage rates.  Any kind of modicum of success in Irish industry depended on becoming a kind of competitor to South Korea, or Hong Kong or Japan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The point which was raised by Senator Lenihan is a particularly important one&mdash;the reference in sections 3 and 4 to the conditions of employment&mdash;in the light of the fact that we are now coming to a point at which the anti-discrimination laws should begin to bite and we would get a legitimate demand by female workers for equality of pay. I hope the Minister deals with that point because there is a general feeling that, as part of the catastrophic collapse of the economic situation during the two-and-a-half years&mdash;the lifetime&mdash;of this Government, one of <Col N="346" /> the proposals will be the setting aside of equal pay proposals which, as Senator Lenihan said, the Minister introduced with so much <i>éclat</i>.  This, then, brings one to another group of workers, in the civil service and in private industry, because private industry is now complaining that it has not enough money to pay this equal pay.  The women must carry on.  They are continuing to be discriminated against both in private and public service employment.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the profits likely to be made by the banks:</P>
      <P>I would hope that, on passage of this legislation, if any savings accrue to the banks as a result of the Labour Court adjudication the benefits will be passed on to the members of the general public.</P>
      <P>The Minister is taking very wide and sweeping powers in this Bill in relation to telling the banks what they must do about the workers and about the conditions of employment of the workers, about the right of access to the books, accounts, information, records, documents and so on.  Why is it that he simply issues a pious hope about this very important question of the amount of money that may be saved by the banks in this situation, should this legislation be passed?  Is it not possible for the Minister to enforce his will in a much more practical way than the way suggested here, that is, the abolition of bank service charges to current account holders? An extraordinary proposal this, that you should exercise this kind of generosity at somebody else's expense, because of course, it is the bank officials' money you are handing over to abolish bank service charges.  Is there no way in which this money could be kept in trust for bank officials?  Is there no way in which the banks should not be permitted as they have in the past to make money out of this kind of situation, if it is allowed to develop again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talks about devoting our resources not to consumption but to investment.  Of course this probably is the most important failure on the part of the Government&mdash;this <Col N="347" /> failure to devote our resources to investment. The extraordinary change which has taken place in our society in the last five years&mdash;as short as that &mdash;is remarkable.  We have become a very wealthy country, probably for its size and population the wealthiest country in the world, certainly one of the four or five wealthiest, because of the zinc, lead, gas, oil resources.  Zinc and lead we know certainly about, and we have reason to believe that there is enormous wealth in gas or oil around our shores.  This is probably the most inequitable part of the Coalition's record in the last two-and-a-half years, this perpetuation of the piseog about Ireland which has turned out not to be a piseog.  For many years we all believed we were a very poor country, a very poverty stricken country.  In the last five or ten years, at most, this idea has been completely exploded.  There is enormous wealth.  We are a very wealthy country.  If this wealth had been exploited in the interests of the people to whom it belongs instead of being handed over for a pittance to a handful of foreign oil moguls banded together with a few of our own mining and oil moguls, we would not be in this position of going to the workers and asking them to make sacrifices. There is no need for our people to have to make sacrifices of this kind, of which this, I am quite certain, is the forerunner of many other similar sacrifices to be asked of the workers. This is the most inequitable part of the Coalition's policy: that we, a very wealthy country, should be asking our people to suffer in this way, completely gratuitously suffer in this way, when we have become, as I said earlier on, a primary producing country&mdash;an extraordinary development.</P>
    <P>While the moguls are now banding together to protect their interests and to see that the West pays the right price for whatever they can produce in the line of copper, bauxite or iron ore, mercury, phosphates, and all these things, we are handing this over to other people who will sell it and take the greater part of the profit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> There was a time when this call to the nation to tighten its belt and keep its back to the wall, and all that kind of stuff, the kind of rubbish we will hear from the Taoiseach tonight&mdash; a place could have been made for it in a time of war or something like that. This Bill is no longer justified.  It is completely sinful that it should be produced here by a Labour Minister. Fine Gael are acting true to type, but it is completely shameful that a Bill of this kind should be produced in the real circumstances of the country. Not only that, but that we are going to get not just this Bill but many other proposals of this kind.</P>
    <P>This is an unnecessary Bill.  It will inflict considerable hardship on utterly innocent people.  It seems to me that it will be used as a precedent.  Those trade union officials who support this particular principle in respect of this group of workers are taking a very dangerous step, because it can be used against them.  No attempt has been made by the Minister to say what has happened in relation to profits over the years, bank profits and all the other kinds of profits that have been made over the years.  There has been no rational defence whatever of the monopoly capitalist system which has now pushed this Government into bringing in this very unfair piece of legislation. I wish to say that I oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by saying that I agree with Dr. Browne when he says that everything will not be all right if this Bill is passed. Equally I disagree with him in saying that it is a wage standstill.  If it were a wage standstill we would be talking about the nation as a whole and not a particular minority group within the nation.  Thirdly, it gives no great pleasure to any trade union official to support any measure that is suggestive, even though it is affecting a minority, in some way of a wages standstill, even on a temporary basis.  This is what this is.  It is a temporary provisions Bill.  It is not a very palatable experience for a trade union official to stand up and face this.  Of course the difference between Dr. Browne and me and other people is that I have been representing trade union people on the ground floor <Col N="349" /> and house associations for over 31 years.  I was not in disneyland or away above them, but on the floor with them on a day-to-day basis.  Consequently I have had to come to terms with them on many occasions.  I have had to take my own members on, and I have only done that in the belief that I was doing the right thing.  I believe it to be on the basis of enlightened self-interest on behalf of the people I represented.</P>
      <P>Had I not been involved in an exercise of that nature some years ago, I can say now that some of the people I represented, while we lost about 1,000 jobs, we were very close to losing about 4,000 jobs if we had not come to a realisation of the facts at that particular time.  I am pleased to say that not only I came to realise the facts but the people that I fought and argued with and finally talked to came to that realisation.  Of their own free will and vote they accepted that situation.</P>
      <P>It is not a question of it being easy for a trade union official to stand up and talk about something.  It is very easy to use the safety of generality, but when you get down to the specifics it is a much more difficult problem.  In taking the trade union line, for example, I should like to quote here from a discussion document that was put to the Trade Union Congress in 1972.  While I am not going to refer to everything that was in that discussion document, I think it is very right that I should, in fact, state what the thinking was in that particular document, even if it was not eventually agreed.  There was a great measure of the thinking of the leadership of the trade union movement contained in that document and I quote:</P>
      <P>In whatever policies it decides to pursue on wage and salary claims the trade union movement must have regard to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  The potentially inflationary dangers of claims of a certain magnitude.</P>
      <P>(b)  The need for a solidarity policy that ensures preferential treatment for wage earners in the lower income groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  The need for policy and the harmonisation of non-wage <Col N="350" /> fringe benefits and conditions of employment, such as pension schemes, sick payments, annual leave, hours of work for all workers, and the improvement of these benefits and conditions having regard to the increased labour costs involved, and</P>
    <P>(d)  The implementation of equal pay for work of equal value for men and women.</P>
    <P>Whilst the trade unions cannot escape their responsibility to pursue those particular policies, and certainly did not in the national wage agreement&mdash;they went into them and they did, in fact, carry this kind of thinking in with them&mdash;they did not conceal the fact that they expected the Government and the employers to pursue policies that would minimise any adverse effects of increasing prices on the conditions of the national wage agreement. That is a common thing.  It is not make-believe.</P>
    <P>In the case of the bank officials, who are working in a high profit area, their adoption of the attitude &ldquo;Let's get as much out of them as we can&rdquo;, is understandable.  Unfortunately, I could not weave a cocoon around myself and believe that the rest of the world owed me a living, or owed the men I represent a living.  Therefore, I have to come to terms with the national situation.  The people I represented could have got more money. There is no question on that.  That would stand up to any test of argument.</P>
    <P>The bank officials, even though they are not in the trade union movement, should first of all defend their right of freedom of association.  I do not think they should be coerced into becoming members of the Trade Union Congress or anything else.  Equally, I would say that, having regard to the trade union attitude, the number of people they represent and the policies they introduced in the national wage agreement, it is quite right that the Minister should take a close look at these situations and take whatever measures are necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan was conscious of the fact that there was no other way <Col N="351" /> to deal with the problem, despite the <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i> situations.  Therefore I must thank Senator Lenihan for his realistic approach to this problem. The measures embarked on are necessary in view of the circumstances we find ourselves in.</P>
    <P>I find I have to take issue with the bank officials&mdash;and not just on the issue of the porter or cleaner as mentioned by Senator Halligan&mdash;on the fact that every working class person in the country has to expose himself to the instrument set up by Government, the Labour Court, to win the right to get certain increases.  The bulk of the work carried on in the Labour Court at the moment is to try to get increases for people who have not even succeeded in getting the last phase of two or three wage agreements ago.  This temporary provision requires that the bank officials submit their case to the Labour Court, and having regard to the terms of the national wage agreement, that they and their employers would adhere to the settlements made by the Labour Court.  That is not a lot to ask when one considers that we are asking that the community should play its role, that the farmers should be taxed, that there should be a wealth tax, an acquisition tax and so on, when we are all working towards a community accountability to one another. It is not a lot to ask people who are in secure employment.</P>
    <P>Bank employees&mdash;though they may object to interference with their negotiations&mdash;should take consolation from the fact that they are not on a day-to-day basis subjected to work study or to wage incentive systems.  They are secure enough to know that they will not be faced with redundancies. The employee who is faced with redundancy or rationalisation finds himself in a position where he cannot get even the second or third phase of a couple of national wage agreements ago.  It is not a big demand on them if they look at it in that way.  I would be quite willing to talk to the officials in my local bank on those lines.</P>
    <P>There is nothing extraordinary in saying to them: &ldquo;Do the best you <Col N="352" /> can.  We do not want to coerce you into a situation of having to deny your rights of freedom of association, but when circumstances do not permit otherwise, we expect you to come into line with general thinking.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The question of rationalisation has been dealt with already by Senator Noel Browne.  I do not know how feasible or practical that argument is. In principle I would not be opposed to the idea, but I do not think it will solve the problem.  It is something that needs a great deal of examination and not irresponsible, broad statements, &ldquo;Let us take over this and take over that&rdquo;.  What is the point in taking over banks if the policies do not change?</P>
    <P>The Bill asks for nothing that is not expected of other workers.  If other sections of the community are not playing their role and if the bank officials have criticisms about that, we shall be glad to hear about them.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances the Minister has no alternative but to do his best to see that all sections of the community do their utmost to get us back on the rails.  That does not mean that everything will be all right.  It does not even mean I would favour further legislation for general restrictions.</P>
    <P>In the present circumstances there is not much hope of a redundant worker finding a job, particularly those in the older category.  A person who has worked for his living all his life does not like living on the dole or receiving redundancy payments.  He wants the dignity of work.  In this sense the bank officials have an advantage there.  Their jobs are not in jeopardy. They will probably receive a temporary setback in their aspirations, and for the moment I think they should accept that.  I have never had to take a temporary setback without finding a way ultimately, in good circumstances, of recovering the ground lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say is entirely devoid of political content. I wish to speak objectively and without prejudice to any Government policies.  I cannot support the Government <Col N="353" /> on this legislation or any other Government that might be in power introducing this legislation. I cannot support it on three grounds; first as a matter of principle; secondly, because it is selective; and, thirdly, because I do not believe it is the right action to take.</P>
      <P>I cannot support it as a matter of principle because it does violence to the liberty of any group of people to enter into a free bargaining situation. As a trade union official I would have to object to it because, with the passage of time, I might find myself in the position where such legislation would be used against the people I represent and against myself personally.  I cannot allow myself to be placed in that situation now or in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Bank Officials' Association were not present at or associated with the negotiations which went on, at which I was present and to which I gave my vote.  Therefore, I cannot see that they are morally or legally bound to the decisions.  If they had attended the negotiations and subsequently tried to breach the decisions that would be a different situation.  The bank officials freely entered into negotiations with their employers and did a good job of work.  Most fair-minded trade unionists would say: &ldquo;Good luck to them if they got that little bit extra.  We do not resent this.&rdquo;  But putting the principle of free negotiation as against the differential between what was got under the national wage agreement and what the bank officials got, I would say that the majority of trade unionists would say that the principle of free bargaining is far more important than the difference between the amount awarded under the national wage agreement and that awarded to the bank officials. The right to bargain freely is fundamental. It transcends any other situation. That is the situation in which I find myself as a representative of people for whom I negotiate week after week, month after month and year after year. I would put myself in the position of restricting my freedom of movement, my liberty to act on behalf of people. I say this objectively and without prejudice towards any policies the Government <Col N="354" /> may have.  That is the reality so far as I am concerned and I cannot run away from it.</P>
    <P>I maintain that this legislation is selective in so far as it is picking on one small group of people whereas there is a free bargaining situation for people in industry, people who are trading, in increases in fees, in increases in prices and so on.  It is a supply and demand situation in which people make tremendous profits and there is no restriction on them.  This Bill is selective in so far as it picks on one individual group.</P>
    <P>I cannot support it for another reason, because it is the wrong action to take.  I speak now from wide experience. I refer to the deplorable history of negotiations involving the IBOA.  At the end of their second last strike I was asked by them to represent them on a tribunal to clear up the mess &mdash;a mess which should never have taken place.  The mess took place because everybody was trying to grind this group of people into the ground, but they did not succeed.  On another occasion I acted for them at a pensions tribunal.  The result was reasonably successful.  On a third occasion a tribunal was set up to interpret about five words in an agreement into which they had entered.  The words were &ldquo;extraordinary circumstances in the economy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A chairman was appointed; a representative of the banks was appointed, and I represented the IBOA.  The tribunal met the bankers and the bank officials at a joint meeting.  The tribunal then withdrew and the deliberations began.  The two other people on the tribunal said: &ldquo;We cannot hold that there are extraordinary circumstances in the economy&rdquo;.  I maintained that there were extraordinary circumstances in the economy which would warrant the bank officials lodging a claim.  I should like to emphasise the words I used&mdash;&ldquo;which would warrant the bank officials lodging a claim&rdquo;.  We were not in a claim situation; we were asked to interpret about five words.  The argument went on.  Two people on the tribunal maintained that there were no extraordinary circumstances in the economy.  I maintained there were <Col N="355" /> because I had already lodged a claim for an increase in the salaries of the officials I represented.  Dozens of other associations had lodged claims because there were extraordinary factors in the economy.  I was asked to sign a statement to the effect that there were no extraordinary circumstances in the economy&mdash;having lodged a claim because there were.  I refused to sign and the chairman produced his report.  This led to the last disastrous strike.  I told them before we left the meeting that they were like King Canute telling the waves to go back.  They were trying to push aside obvious economic problems and extraordinary circumstances in the economy.  I told them they were walking the bank staffs into a major strike which would affect everybody, both rich and poor, and that they had a grave responsibility.</P>
    <P>My advice was not taken and look what happened.  There was a strike. Bank officials went to London and elsewhere to get work.  They had to work overtime when they came back and they earned far more money&mdash;including relief from income tax while they were working in Britain.  The moral of that situation is that by introducing this sort of legislation they are putting the bank officials in a corner from which they will have to fight again.  It may be said that we cannot have a bank strike because people cannot get work in London any more.  But the same situation as that which followed their previous return must exist if there is industrial action by the bank officials. Again they will have to work to clear up the backlog and they can earn large sums on overtime plus an increase in their wages to offset loss of earnings during the strike.</P>
    <P>It is with that experience I speak. I know these people.  I have worked for them on a voluntary basis.  They asked me to sit in on meetings and to help them in their deliberations, and I have done so.  I have seen the hamfisted way in which they have been treated.  I forecast that this legislation is going to write another disastrous chapter in negotiations with the IBOA. I know them and I know their determination and they know well the tremendous weapon they have.  I am not <Col N="356" /> making a case for or against them. I am pointing out the reality of the situation, and as far as I am concerned I must object to this legislation as a matter of principle.  I must object to it because it is selective and I must object to it because I know from my experience that it is not the right thing to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan) Patrick S. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially, I should like to thank Senators for their reception of this Bill and in so far as I have been able to study it today&mdash;I am standing in for the Minister for Labour&mdash;I shall endeavour to answer their questions and reply to points they have made.  I would refer first to the contribution of Senator Lenihan, my political opponent. I notice he is very fond of language. Many times he referred to the situation that is developing in the economy.  I propose now to use language to tell him that, in my opinion, I will be able to prove him slightly wet behind the ears.  He said of course that he knew everything about the recession that was coming, how long it was going to last, that Fianna Fáil had warned and warned.  I know it is a fairly good gambit for an Opposition to keep saying things are bad.  We never descended to that while in Opposition. We were always very constructive. It does not help the economy when you have an Opposition that keeps saying that.  The only way that Senator Lenihan and his fellow Senators could possibly have known what he suggested he did know was to have been in the conclaves of Sheik Yamani and other gentlemen out in Egypt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I would first like to deal with his statement that there was legitimate case for argument.  Yes, I agree that, between the bank officials and the Government in their approach to this particular position, there is a legitimate case for argument.  However, I will be dealing later with the proposal by the Minister for Labour to send the 1974 and 1975 agreements between the Irish Bank Officials' Association and the Irish banks to the Labour Court.  Many Senators raised that and there is no point in my repeating myself or perhaps replying to one Senator on a point he made and having to talk about <Col N="357" /> it again because the point made by another was perhaps slightly different.</P>
    <P>Let us face the fact that this has had to happen three times.  A certain Minister for Labour introduced a similar Bill in 1973.  Fianna Fáil drafted a Bill but had not brought it in previous to the change in Government. The only difference between that Bill and the present Bill and the one that was introduced in 1973 was that there were penalties in the Fianna Fáil Bill for the workers and for the trade unions.  I leave that to the House. That is just a fact of life.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan also made the point that bank officials were outside the national agreement and therefore they should be allowed to negotiate their own pay agreements.  The economic situation at present is such that no group of workers totalling 10,000 in number can decide to break a line which is, we hope, going to be accepted by the great number of workers in the country.  A unit of 10,000 workers could upset what may be necessary to bring our country through a most difficult period.  From that point of view it would be quite improper of the Government to allow this to happen.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan also raised the matter of the Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Bill as it applies to women bank officials.  The position is that this Bill does not affect the Anti-Discrimination Bill and that the last payment that will bring these ladies to equal pay has yet to be made, and it is to be made at the end of this month.  This Bill legally does not affect that, so that all they have to wait for is not a Christmas present but a New Year's box and they will be &ldquo;even Stephen.&rdquo; That is why I think the ex-Minister and Leader of the Opposition here in the Seanad was slightly wet behind the ears.  Any order made by the Minister under the Bill will relate only to the payment of certain stages of the bank pay agreement.  This agreement contains no provision relating to equal pay.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan seems to be obsessed by equal pay, but I can tell him that the legal position is that equal pay is not caught up with this Bill. Whatever happens equal pay under the Anti-Discrimination Act it is a separate <Col N="358" /> matter.  The Bill before the House was framed by Fianna Fáil, introduced by the Minister for Labour in 1973, by order withdrawn and is now being introduced again.  I put on the record of the House the Government's assurance that it does not affect equal pay, and the ladies concerned can take that as an absolute statement of fact.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan then made the point that terms and conditions could be excluded from&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I was talking about, terms and conditions.  I was not talking about equal pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator was talking about it up to then, but in relation to terms and conditions he said they could be excluded.  It is not possible to exclude terms and conditions because if the bank reduced working hours, paid additional gratuities, did all these different things, there would be opportunities for extra earnings and bank officials would have a far more favourable situation than other workers.  That fact was accepted by the Senator's party when they drew up their Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Halligan mentioned various matters.  I do not want to enter into that sphere very much except to say that, as I understand the position in banking here, the Central Bank hold control, and banking profits are subject to tax.  But one of the things one needs here is profit in banking for the simple reason that the pool of money to keep our economy sound and healthy must move with inflation and must be greater each time there is any inflation.  For that reason, banking profits which will have been maintained and retained within the banking system are good as long as they are used for productive purposes.  The direction of the Central Bank is accepted by the ordinary banks in this regard.  From that point of view the only complaint one might have is that there might not be enough productive purposes to apply the money to or not enough money to apply to productive purposes.  That is a chicken and egg situation.  It has nothing to do with this Bill but which is a fact of financial life that is with us and must be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> The other matter in relation to the banks in this regard referred to by Senator Halligan could be referred to in this way.  I made a note as I was listening to him.  Money is one of those fluid things that you cannot keep within the bounds of a nation.  You can make an order that says that nobody can export a donkey from Ireland or that nobody can export cement from Ireland.  So you can contain all the donkeys and all the cement you like in Ireland, but one of the things you cannot do with money is retain it within a community. If money wishes to flow, it is entirely liquid and flow it will.  The basis of a sound economy which can get the maximum employment for people is one whereby more money is available for more productive purposes creating more employment.</P>
    <P>The point was raised several times during the debate as to whether or not the Irish Bank Officials' Association were entitled to stay out.  I say, yes, of course, they were entitled to stay out. They lost, I understand, by staying out in 1974, 1975 is not finally decided yet.  In my general approach I will deal with that matter also.</P>
    <P>Senator Dolan blamed the Government for bringing in legislation against the workers.  It is his legislation just as much as ours.  However, apart from that matter I want to be quite clear on this: it is not legislation against any band of workers.  Senator Brosnahan took that line, too, in the course of his contribution.  This is legislation to equalise matters.  This is legislation to set things at right, but again the wise thing is to wait until I am dealing at the end, with the action proposed to be taken by the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>Senator Dolan then said that this was a case of the Government openly admitting that their policies and their Ministers were a failure.  No such thing.  Again Senator Dolan would want to have been either the fairy godmother with a magic wand or in the conclaves of Sheik Yamani with access to his purse to have done anything different.  The estimate of the depth of this recession and the length <Col N="360" /> of this recession certainly could be no more at various stages than a &ldquo;guesstimate&rdquo;.  The cost of the first increase in oil&mdash;and I do not refer to the cost to Senator Lenihan or Senator Russell or anybody else when they put petrol in their cars or fuel oil in their heating system, but the cost to the Government&mdash;was £100 million extra.  There are three slices and I was trying to estimate the other day the total of the three slices.  I do not profess to be an economist. I do not profess to be anything but a pragmatist.  I have no ideology at all, but I can tell you that the best &ldquo;guesstimate&rdquo; that I could make of it was that this is going to cost the Government in the order of £250 million. That is what we have to face up to.  Senator Dolan who knows more Irish than I do, translated an old Irish proverb and said: &ldquo;Mair, a chapall, agus gheobhair féar.&rdquo; I have thought of another one: &ldquo;Ní hé lá na gaoithe lá na scolb&rdquo;: the day of the wind is not the day for thatching.  This happens to be the day of the wind. This is the day when you are gathering your store together.  This is the day when you are getting ready to see to it that this economy when this recession lifts will be &ldquo;even Stephen and off with the starting gun&rdquo; with every other economy in Europe.  That is the job that this Government is going to do, and part of that work will be done in the passing of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Let me quote a politician from the other party&mdash;now departed, Lord rest his soul&mdash;for whom I had considerable regard.  He said that we must not eat the seed potatoes.  Senator Browne referred to the &ldquo;ideology&rdquo; which he thinks I serve.  I serve no ideology of any kind.  I am proud of the fact that I served for 20 years on a joint labour committee of the Labour Court as an employers' member of the provender milling industry, and during that time there never was a strike.  On that committee at various times on the opposite side were the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Labour.  The Minister for Labour, the Minister for Local Government and myself still serve on it.  Ideology was never of my back garden.  I am <Col N="361" /> a complete pragmatist, and all I want to do is to get the job done.</P>
    <P>I now refer to what Senator Browne said about the paragraph on page 4 of the speech.  He talked about forecasts. He said:</P>
    <P>The present recession is longer and deeper than has generally been forecast.</P>
    <P>Last June the Economic and Social Research Institute predicted a fall of 1½ per cent in GNP for this year.  By October, they felt the situation had deteriorated still further than had been expected, and their revised forecast was for a drop of 3½ per cent. We had had increases small and large and this Government were setting their sights at larger increases in the GNP so that there would be larger slices of the cake for everybody.  However, because of the oil situation and the downturn in world economy, this recession occurred.  Senator Browne was referring to forecasts by the Government.  The forecast referred to by the Minister for Labour was the forecast of the Economic and Social Research Institute, and Senators know exactly how that is composed. The studied opinion of the Economic and Social Research Institute was 1½ per cent, that is, they were 2 per cent wrong.</P>
    <P>I am standing in for the Minister today because his work necessitates meeting the social partners.  The major economies of the world, as Senator Browne quoted, have begun to show signs of improvement, and it is now expected that by early 1977 a general recovery will be under way. We will be in a weak position to participate in this recovery if we find ourselves with inflation and its counterpart, unemployment, at levels above those of our trading partners. No group of 10,000 people can be allowed to militate against the work that is being done by the Minister for Labour and his colleague, the Taoiseach, in negotiating with the social partners to ensure that the minimum interference and the minimal setback in their hopes and aspirations is suffered by all the people, from the bank directors right down to the lowest paid worker.</P>

      <P>However, he found out that there were.  Senator Noel Browne repeatedly referred to a &ldquo;wage standstill Bill&rdquo;.  The purpose of this Bill is not to stop the bank <Col N="363" /> officials from getting any pay increase. It merely seeks to provide that they will take their place with every other worker in the country.  Senator Harte adverted to this and said that what he wanted to see was every worker getting a fair crack of the whip and the maximum opportunity.  If that opportunity is not today, what we would wish it to be, that is a fact of life.</P>
      <P>However, this is not repressive legislation and it is not a question of trying to impose upon these workers a wage standstill.  I will be dealing with the gravamen on this later. Senator Browne has said that we are saying to the worker: &ldquo;You are being paid far too much.&rdquo;  Nobody ever said that to a worker as long as this Government has been here. We are the Government who set up the national wage agreement and carried it through.  We are the Government who have negotiated with people and made fair play bargains with them.  In fact, I would wish that workers were being paid more, but paid in real money, and I wish to see inflation halted.  Towards that effect these decisions must be taken.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne referred to the fact that the Minister spoke of bank charges in the Bill.  The Minister for Labour made a suggestion himself that money saved, if any, might be devoted towards bank charges mentioned in the Bill. Following the enactment of this legislation, the question of the 1974 and 1975 agreements of the IBOA going to the Labour Court, he and the Minister for Finance will confer with the banks in this regard.  There is nothing terribly sinister about that.  It is just the normal thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Harte mentioned two things which I like.  One was the safety of generality.  There was too much in this debate today&mdash;if I may mention it; it is only my fourth or fifth time in the Seanad and perhaps I am a little impertinent in mentioning it&mdash;of the safety of generality and not enough, as Senator Harte said, realisation of the facts.  He said it is great to be able to go into a bank, and I should like to give him some advice on talking to <Col N="364" /> a bank manager.  You throw your hat into the office and if he throws it out you do not go in, if it stays inside you go in.</P>
    <P>Senator Brosnahan prefaced his remarks by saying that there was no iota of politics in the thing at all and that he was entirely, shall we say, ethereal and away from the matter, but then talks about principle and the right action and so on.  Senator Brosnahan told us that on three different occasions he has acted voluntarily for the bank officials.  I shall leave that matter as it stands.  He disagrees with the principle in the Bill in as much as it interferes with free collective bargaining. This does not do so.  This is a purely temporary measure which the Minister for Labour was forced to introduce after voluntary response was not forthcoming from the bank officials. The Minister for Labour saw the bank officials last week and offered to be bound by the ruling of the Labour Court and to send their 1974 and 1975 agreements to the Labour Court and admitted that they lost in the 1974 agreement.  They would not at that point of time go to the Labour Court for him and that is the reason for this measure.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal briefly with the matter in general.  The gravamen of this is that the Labour Court adjudicated on the 1974 bank pay agreement. It found that that agreement was not in breach of the 1974 national pay agreement.  The banks, however, lost out under the fixed escalation clause of the 1974 pay agreement.  In negotiating the 1975 pay agreement bank officials sought to recoup the loss under their 1974 agreement.  Thus, it would be fair to bank employees that both their 1974 and 1975 agreements be sent, and when this legislation has been passed, the Minister for Labour will send 1974 and 1975 Irish Bank Officials' Association agreements to the Labour Court for adjudication.  He will be bound by the results of that Labour Court adjudication.</P>
    <P>People suggested that this Government were doing nothing, but last June this Government were faced with a choice of repressive action or trying to get the economy on its feet.  We <Col N="365" /> chose the latter.  I said that with the twin objectives of combatting inflation and maintaining employment we took certain budgetary action.  These measures included&mdash;and one forgets, eaten bread is soon forgotten&mdash;the removal of VAT from clothing, footwear, electricity and all fuel (except road fuels), subsidies on CIE rates and fares, subsidies on bread and flour, subsidies on butter, liquid milk and town gas.  That meant that in that quarter there was an increase of only 0.8 per cent in the consumer price index.  Without further increasing costs and so further reducing our competitiveness for exports, it was possible for workers to forego part of the end of the national wage agreement and be in the &ldquo;even-Stephen&rdquo; situation. That was done to avoid repressive legislation.  Now there should be a further adjustment.  This legislation is not repressive legislation against the Irish Bank Officials' Association.  It is right and proper that everyone must adjust and contribute a little for a relatively short space of time, for one purpose only, to see that the soundness of our economy, and therefore our jobs and our children's future, are preserved.</P>

      <P>The reason for this motion before the House for earlier signature by the President of the Regulation of Banks (Remuneration and Conditions of Employment) (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1975, is that the Minister for Labour was notified this week by the banks that, unless this legislation was enacted and the necessary orders made by the Minister under this measure before the 17th December, 1975, they would have no alternative but to pay on that day the third phase of their 1975 pay agreement to their employees.</P>
      <P>It is the Minister for Labour's intention immediately this Bill becomes law, to refer this bank's pay agreement and their 1974 pay agreement to the Labour Court for a recommendation as to their conformity with the National Pay Agreements 1974 and 1975, as reviewed.  It is essential, in the circumstances, that the Bill should become law and the necessary orders made before 17th December, 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel sure that all Senators will welcome this Bill which provides for the introduction of a new scheme of supplementary welfare allowances to replace the existing outmoded and generally unsatisfactory home assistance scheme.  The new scheme will be administered by the regional health boards under the general direction of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>Senators will have received with the Bill an explanatory memorandum which has, I hope, assisted them in their consideration of these quite complex proposals.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for the removal from our Social Welfare legislation of the last vestiges of the harsh and unfeeling Poor Law, contained in the Public Assistance Act of 1939 which for all practical purposes is being repealed. This is a very important step forward in the development of the social services in this country and it is a step that is long overdue.</P>
      <P>The attitude towards those unfortunate enough to be deprived or poor which was embodied in the Poor Law was both censorious and patronising. In the debate in this House on the Second Stage of the Public Assistance Bill, 1939, one Senator referred to that piece of legislation as being &ldquo;full of delicate charity&rdquo; and as showing respect for the poor in Irish society.  No one today, looking at the practical results of that Bill over the years, could regard that view with anything but amazement.  Attitudes have changed, for which we must be thankful, and legislation must also be changed to ensure that the rights and dignity of citizens are positively protected and promoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing this measure I am very conscious of the lessons of history which indicate, in the words of one recent commentator, that &ldquo;since other attempts to bury the Poor Law, in Ireland and in Britain, have shown the truly remarkable ability of the Poor Law to survive death sentences, a really radical reform will be necessary&rdquo; I believe that the measure <Col N="368" /> provided for in this Bill is indeed a radical and workable reform of the home assistance scheme and that it will bring much aid and support to many people who are deprived economically and socially.</P>
    <P>While saying this I recognise fully that the long-term solution to the problems which give rise to the need for a home assistance or supplementary welfare allowances scheme lie in very basic structural changes which will require significant advances across a broad front.  Provision in the field of social welfare is of importance in so far as it can alleviate the effects of poverty and inequality but the ultimate elimination of poverty will demand concerted efforts in all areas of economic, social and political policy.  Equally, I accept the need for careful review and assessment of the progress of the new scheme which will be introduced under the terms of the Bill.  Every effort must be made to ensure that it will contribute in a positive manner to the strengthening of our social welfare services.</P>
    <P>It is essential within any social security system to have such a relatively flexible support service which will enable assistance to be given, quickly and as of right, to those in urgent need or who cannot be helped under other income maintenance services. Such a service should be also available to help those whose needs cannot be fully met under other State schemes or who find themselves confronted with an emergency situation.</P>
    <P>The new supplementary welfare allowances scheme will provide this support service within the national system of income maintenance services. It will become an effective and integral part of the overall national social welfare services and, unlike the present home assistance scheme, will not be seen as an unconnected poor relation of that service.</P>
    <P>The new scheme will, however, retain and develop the local, community-based element of home assistance, which is its most important potential strength.  The problems of those seeking assistance under the new scheme will, in most cases, call for more than a mere cash response. <Col N="369" /> Social services, social work support and a genuine community care are also needed to help recipients to cope with the situations in which they find themselves and where necessary to reintegrate themselves with dignity in our society.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a further step in the direction of the Government's declared goal of establishing a comprehensive system of social security catering for the needs of all citizens. Its effect will be to provide assistance, as of right, to a further substantial number of persons and families and to bring us nearer to the desired end of providing adequate maintenance coverage for all.</P>
    <P>Home assistance had its origins in the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, 1847, and was the only statutory form of assistance, other than institutional assistance, provided for persons in need until the beginning of this century. Since then the establishment and development down the years of various State-sponsored social insurance and assistance services has greatly decreased the need for the present home assistance service, as established under the Public Assistance Act, 1939.  This fact is reflected in the steady fall in the numbers of recipients, including dependants. From a weekly average of some 75,000 30 years ago the numbers have dropped to less than 30,000 at present.</P>
    <P>The nature of the service has also changed radically in that the majority of recipients nowadays are persons who receive assistance to supplement a payment under some other social welfare service or while awaiting payments under such schemes.  As a result of this trend home assistance in terms of expenditure is now a relatively small service, the cost in the last full year, 1973-74, being approximately £2 million as against expenditure on the State social insurance and assistance schemes in 1975 of the order of £370 million.</P>
    <P>The home assistance service, which is financed from the rates, is administered by 31 public assistance authorities, or by health boards acting on their behalf, subject to the general <Col N="370" /> direction and control of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, under the existing scheme a person is eligible for home assistance if he is unable by his own industry or other lawful means to provide the necessaries of life for himself or his dependants.  All applications are dealt with by the local assistance authority which may decide, at its absolute discretion and without right of appeal, whether a person is eligible and what assistance should be given.</P>
    <P>Criticism of the home assistance service has been a feature of social and political comment for many years. Surveys of the service have shown that because of major defects in its structure it operates in an arbitrary and far from satisfactory manner. There are major inequalities in regard to standards of eligibility and in regard to the amount of assistance given as between one authority and another.  In some cases these inequalities exist even within the same authority in regard to the treatment of basic needs.  Again, in the matter of supplementation there are wide differences in the treatment of similar cases.</P>
    <P>These inequalities and the scope for local variation and even for arbitrary exclusion stem from the wide differences in the financial circumstances of the various local authorities involved, as well as from the fact that the existing law does not define with any precision the circumstances in which assistance may be paid or the amount of assistance to be provided. It can scarcely be denied that the resultant discretionary allowances granted in such an arbitrary way, without any right of appeal or review, have all the unpleasant flavour of the Poor Law.</P>
    <P>Indeed one recent social survey among poor people showed quite clearly that more than a quarter of the persons who were actually receiving home assistance at the time of interview did not admit this fact to the interviewers and the author of the survey was forced to the conclusion that this was due to a basic feeling of shame associated with the receipt of assistance under the service. <Col N="371" /> If it can be said of any social service that it is compromising of the self-esteem of citizens of our country, then surely the time for reform is more than ripe.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be the technical or theoretical criticisms of the existing home assistance service, I am satisfied that by far the most important reason for reform is the stigma which is associated with home assistance.  Improvements such as those proposed in this Bill cannot change attitudes, but they can help to remove the most obvious causes of those attitudes and to bring to an end the social cleavage between home assistance recipients and the rest of the community which appears to be an inevitable result of the present system.</P>
    <P>The Public Assistance Act, 1939, the present law in the matter, includes provisions deriving from the Poor Law which are unacceptable in a modern welfare system.  I refer to provisions such as that which makes it an offence, punishable by imprisonment, for a person in receipt of assistance to refuse or neglect to perform a task of work which he is required by the Act to perform.  Such provisions have not been operative for many years but their very existence in current legislation in this day and age highlight the need for radical reform.</P>
    <P>The inherent defects of the home assistance scheme in its present form have inevitably led at times to criticism of the officers who had the task of implementing it over the years.  I do not accept that such criticism is valid and I wish to place on record my appreciation of the work which home assistance officers are doing and have done throughout the country in seeking to operate an outdated and thoroughly defective scheme with humanity and with concern.  I trust that the proposals contained in this Bill will provide a more suitable framework for the efforts of these officers in the future.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the detailed provisions of the Bill.  In general the aim of this Bill is to provide for the foundation of a social assistance service which will enable pressing need to be met <Col N="372" /> in a flexible and speedy manner while at the same time guaranteeing to all persons who have to resort to the service a standard basic income as of right in place of the arbitrary and variable payments they may receive at present.  These basic payments will, of course, be subject to a standard means test.</P>
    <P>While uniform basic rates must be a fundamental feature of the new service, the diversity of recipients and the wide variety of the circumstances which cause them to seek assistance require that there must also be a considerable element of flexibility in the service to enable the wide variety of personnel problems and needs to be adequately catered for.  This means that provision must be included to permit the basic rates of allowance, or indeed the payments under the various State income maintenance services, to be supplemented so that particular, special or urgent needs of individual claimants may be met.</P>
    <P>Another necessary feature of the new service is that it must be capable of being co-ordinated on a family oriented basis with a comprehensive range of non-monetary social work services, the overall objective of which will be to break the cycle of poverty in which some families find themselves trapped.</P>
    <P>A most important feature of the new supplementary welfare allowances scheme is that its administration through the health boards, which will apply national standards and national guidelines, will eliminate the territorial inequalities of the existing system in relation to the standards of eligibility and payment and will enable the new scheme to be operated within the framework of the community care services of these boards.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his needs and those of his dependants will be entitled to supplementary welfare allowance.  This allowance will be provided as of right instead of on a purely discretionary basis under the present Poor Law based scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="373" /> As I have already said, the demand on the home assistance service has declined over the years because of the introduction of social insurance and assistance schemes which gave statutory rights to benefit to specified categories of persons.  The provision of assistance as of right for persons in need who happen to be excluded from such other income maintenance schemes is a feature of corresponding residual benefit services in other countries with highly developed systems and is long overdue in this country.</P>
    <P>Since the new scheme will provide that an allowance will be payable as of right instead of at discretion, it is only reasonable to ensure that none but cases of genuine need are covered.  Accordingly, students receiving full-time education, who as individuals could be regarded as having no means but who are in fact normally maintained by their parents, will be excluded from eligibility. Persons in full-time work and persons directly involved in trade disputes will also be excluded.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear, however, that these exclusions are not absolute.  In the first place a person in any of the excluded categories may receive an allowance in case of urgent need.  Again, even where urgent need does not exist, a person receiving full-time education could in exceptional circumstances be paid an allowance, an example being a student who is head of a household.  Similarly a person who has been receiving an allowance while out of work may, under regulations to be made by the Minister, have his allowance continued for a short period after he starts work to help him in the transitional period.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of persons directly involved in trade disputes is on the same basis as that applying in relation to the unemployment benefit and assistance schemes, except that under the new supplementary welfare allowances scheme it will be possible to allow payments in respect of dependants to be made during a trade dispute.</P>
    <P>While under the relevant legislation the administration of the home assistance <Col N="374" /> scheme is a function of the public assistance authorities, that is, the corporations of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford and 27 County Councils including North and South Tipperary, these authorities have, with the exception of ten county councils, transferred their functions in that respect to the health boards under powers given by the Health Act, 1970.</P>
    <P>Subject to the general direction and control of the Minister for Social Welfare the supplementary welfare allowances scheme will be administered by the health boards, and claims for the new allowance will be determined by the chief executive officer or other officers of each board acting on his behalf.</P>
    <P>Under regulations to be made by the Minister for Social Welfare a health board may determine that a person shall not be entitled to the new allowance unless he is registered for employment.  However, there will be a general exemption from this rule in respect of persons incapable of work, persons over pensionable age, women with dependent children and other classes of persons in whose circumstances the imposition of the condition of seeking employment would be inappropriate.</P>
    <P>Persons who make application for supplementary welfare allowance may also be required to make application for any statutory or other benefits or assistance to which they may be entitled.</P>
    <P>Apart from the grant of home assistance being at the discretion of the public assistance authority, an objectionable feature of the scheme, which is linked closely to the antiquated tradition of poor relief, the fact that there is no provision for appeals against decisions of the authorities in relation to applications for assistance is another notably repugnant feature of the present system.  I have already pointed out that under the provisions of the Bill persons in need will be entitled as of right to allowances under the new scheme.  There will also be provision for appeals and the person who is dissatisfied with the determination by an officer of the health board <Col N="375" /> of his claim for supplementary welfare allowance will be able to appeal against such determination to a person appointed by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The basic supplementary welfare allowance payable to a person without means will be the same as the maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable in rural areas.  Thus a person without means and without dependants will receive £7.75 a week while a person with an adult dependant will receive £13.50 a week.  Increases for dependent children will be payable at the same rates as those which are paid to recipients of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>A family consisting of a man, his wife and two children will, therefore, receive £18.50 a week.  If there are four children the total weekly payment will be £22.30.  A single person with four dependent children could receive £16.70 a week.  In the case of persons who have some means those basic rates will be reduced by the amount of such weekly means.</P>
    <P>These proposed rates compare very favourably with the present national average of payments made by way of home assistance.  In a survey made last year it was ascertained that the average payment to a person receiving home assistance, otherwise than as an addition to other statutory benefit or assistance, was £4.91 to a person without dependants, or £9.11 in the case of a recipient with dependants.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides also for supplementation where the basic weekly rates of the new allowance or the weekly rates of other statutory social insurance and assistance payments are insufficient to meet individual special needs.  Such special needs could, for example, arise in relation to rent payments, to heating or diet requirements, or in the case of persons living alone or having no income other than an allowance over a prolonged period.</P>
    <P>Although the amount of the supplements will have to be determined by the health boards by reference to the particular circumstances of individual claimants it is desirable that where practicable the provision of supplements <Col N="376" /> should be standarised for all health board areas.  The Bill therefore includes a provision which will enable the Minister, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, to specify by regulations the circumstances which will give rise to supplements and the amount to be paid in the case of particular classes of claimants.  These regulations may also provide for the granting of supplements in the form of assistance in kind.</P>
    <P>Standard uniform rules for the assessment of means will be introduced under the new supplementary welfare allowances scheme, representing a further big improvement on the present position.  In general, these rules will be on the same lines as those used in the assessment of the means of an applicant for unemployment assistance. It may, however, become necessary in the light of experience of the new scheme to vary these rules if they are not sufficiently flexible or are otherwise inadequate to meet all the particular circumstances which may arise.  Provision is accordingly included in the Bill to enable the means rules to be varied by regulations made by the Minister for Social Welfare with the sanction of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>So far I have been speaking about supplementary welfare allowances in the form of normal weekly payments, and I would like now to mention briefly the provisions made in the Bill for other forms of allowance.  In the first case, where a health board considers that the needs of a person can best be met in such a way, an allowance in kind may be granted instead of the whole or part of a cash payment.</P>
    <P>Again, where a health board deems fit, a single payment may be made to meet an exceptional need arising on a single occasion as opposed to continuing special expenses which would be met by an increase in the weekly payment.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that each spouse will be required to support the other and either will be liable to maintain his or her children under the age of 16, without prejudice to other obligations imposed by law or otherwise. <Col N="377" /> These provisions are broadly similar to those of the Public Assistance Act, 1939, but the further provisions of that Act, which stipulate that every legitimate person is liable to maintain his father and mother and every illegitimate person his mother, are being repealed.  The proposals in this Bill limit the liability to maintain to the immediate family unit, which is a considerable liberalisation of the wider and outmoded concept of liability under the Public Assistance Act, 1939.</P>
    <P>It follows from the maintenance provision that I have just mentioned that where a person receives a supplementary welfare allowance, every person who is liable to maintain that person should be liable to contribute according to his means and ability to do so to the allowance granted.  The Bill, accordingly, empowers the health board to apply, where necessary, to a District Court for recovery of sums paid by way of allowances from the persons liable to maintain who are in a position to pay, or make some contribution towards, the cost of the allowances paid.  The Court will fix the amount of the contribution to be made in such cases by the relative who is liable.</P>
    <P>At present public assistance authorities are responsible for the burial of persons who die leaving insufficient resources to provide for their burial, or whose relatives, if any, are unable to meet the cost.  There is provision in the Bill to enable health boards to make arrangements for burials in such circumstances and to empower them to obtain repayment of expenses incurred, where appropriate, from the estate of the deceased person or from any person who is liable to maintain the deceased person.</P>
    <P>I come now to the financing of the new scheme.</P>
    <P>At present, public assistance authorities are required to meet the full cost of home assistance expenditure from the rates.  I have already pointed out that one of the reasons for the absence of uniformity in the treatment of recipients of home assistance throughout the country is the fact that poor counties just cannot <Col N="378" /> afford the same level of assistance as is provided in some of the wealthier counties.  If each local authority had to bear the full costs of the new service in its area, with its higher and standardised rates of payment, there would be a very substantial increase in the local rates in the poor counties where home assistance standards of payments are generally lowest.</P>
    <P>Having given the matter very careful consideration, the Government came to the conclusion that it would not be unreasonable to require local authorities to bear the cost which they are now required to meet for home assistance, together with a share of the additional cost of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, under the proposals of this Bill each local authority's contribution to the total amount to be paid by all authorities will be determined by reference to what it is now spending on home assistance, so that the poor areas will not have to contribute a higher proportion of the total cost than they are doing at present.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the new financing arrangements are that expenditure under the new scheme will be met partly by payments to the health boards from the local authorities, which are at present public assistance authorities, and partly by grants from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Each local authority, which is at present a public assistance authority, will pay to the health board in whose area it is situated a sum equivalent to its expenditure on home assistance in the year 1975 in respect of each full year of the operation of the new scheme.  In addition, 40 per cent of the amount by which the total expenditure of all health boards on the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in the year in question exceeds the total expenditure by all public assistance authorities on home assistance in 1975 will be borne by the local authorities concerned, and each individual authority will pay to the appropriate health board a share of that 40 per cent.  The allocation between the authorities of the 40 per cent of the excess cost will be determined by the proportions in which total expenditure by all public assistance authorities or health boards <Col N="379" /> on home assistance in 1975 was shared between them.</P>
    <P>For example, if expenditure by a public assistance authority on home assistance in 1975 is one-twentieth of the total expenditure by all public assistance authorities in that year, then that particular public assistance authority will be required to pay one-twentieth of 40 per cent, which is equivalent to 2 per cent of the excess cost in question.  Expenditure by health boards on supplementary welfare allowances over and above that covered by receipts from the local authorities, i.e. 60 per cent of the excess cost will be met by grants from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>If the new scheme comes into operation other than at the beginning of a year, the arrangements I have outlined will apply on a <i>pro-rata</i> basis in respect of whatever part of the year is involved.</P>
    <P>Local authorities which are at present public assistance authorities will have also to pay the administration costs of the new scheme.  The local authority in each health board area will share the administration costs in similar manner to that in which local authorities share their contributions to the health boards under the Health Act, 1970.</P>
    <P>The cost of the home assistance scheme in 1973-74, the last complete financial year for which figures are available, was, as I said earlier, about £2 million.  However, adequate statistical and other information necessary for an accurate estimate of the cost of the radically different scheme with which it is proposed to replace it is not available.  It is difficult to guage with any degree of accuracy the effects of the replacement of a purely discretionary service at local level, by a service providing standard payments as of right to be applied uniformly on a nationwide basis.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the available information, however, it is estimated that the overall yearly cost of the proposals in this Bill, excluding the costs of administration, will be of the order of £4.5 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="380" /> Taking the cost of home assistance in 1975 to be £2 million, the additional cost of the new scheme would therefore be about £2.5 million.  On the cost sharing basis which I have described, the local authorities would be required to bear 40 per cent of the excess cost, that is, 40 per cent of about £2.5 million which is £1 million, leaving about £1.5 million to be met by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned earlier that a number of public assistance authorities had already transferred their functions in regard to the home assistance scheme to health boards under powers contained in the Health Act, 1970.  In doing so they also transferred the staffs concerned with the administration of the scheme.  When the supplementary welfare allowances scheme comes into operation, the respective staffs of the remaining authorities will likewise be transferred.  I wish to make it quite clear that the employment and superannuation rights of such staff will be safeguarded under the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Likewise, all property of public assistance authorities used solely or mainly in connection with the discharge of their functions under the Public Assistance Act, 1939, will become the property of health boards.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of this Bill, the Public Assistance Act, 1939 will be repealed, with the exception of two sections which are still required in connection with the administration of the health services.</P>
    <P>Transitional provisions in the Bill will enable references in existing statutes, orders, or regulations to matters affected by its proposals to be adapted or modified as may be necessary consequent on the replacement of the home assistance scheme by the new supplementary welfare allowances scheme.</P>
    <P>There are also transitional provisions to protect the interests of persons claiming or receiving home assistance at the transition stage.  Moreover, in line with similar provisions in social welfare legislation in the past, the Bill also includes a provision enabing the Minister for Social Welfare to take appropriate action by <Col N="381" /> order, within a period of one year from the date of commencement of the new scheme, to remove any unforeseen and otherwise insuperable difficulty which may be encountered when bringing the scheme into operation. Any such order must, of course, be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution of either House within 21 sitting days.</P>
    <P>The remaining proposals in the Bill provide for the making of regulations for the purposes of the supplementary welfare allowances scheme and for the bringing of the Act into operation by order.</P>
    <P>I believe that the new supplementary welfare allowances scheme, which is provided for under the terms of this Bill, can become an effective and necessary part of the overall social welfare service and that it can remove from that service some, at least, of the stigma attaching to schemes of the Poor Law type.  I am sure that all those who will have the task of implementing the new scheme are determined to make it effective and fully sensitive to the needs and dignity of every claimant and recipient.</P>
    <P>Yet, in the long run, the success or failure of social welfare provisions in terms of human dignity and of the full integration of all citizens into the community will depend on our attitudes as individuals and members of society.  Recent research into the attitudes of the general public to social assistance services and their clients has indicated the continued existence of prejudices which can only hinder the evolution of adequate services and, more important still, of policies leading to long-term solutions.  I refer to such attitudes as the making of distinctions between the &ldquo;deserving&rdquo; and the &ldquo;undeserving&rdquo; and the determination to exercise social control over assistance recipients in what is seen to be their own best interests.</P>
    <P>There are still many in our society who see poverty as the result of personal failure rather than as the outcome of deep faults in our social and economic structure.  The existence of scientific evidence of the continuance <Col N="382" /> of such attitudes points to the urgency of work designed to bring home to all the real facts about deprivation, its causes and its answer.</P>
    <P>I believe that such concepts as the distinction between the &ldquo;deserving and the undeserving&rdquo; will cease to be meaningful once the elimination of poverty itself can be accepted as a goal of national policy.  Allowing for all the harsh facts of economics in these days such a goal is not alone desirable, it is realisable if we truly wish it.  It is not realisable if we continue to believe that some people should be poor and that some should not.  Or to put it another way, we must be able to face up to the fact that, if the poor are poor because of the way in which the system works and not because they have faults as people then the non-poor are comfortable for the same reasons and not because of their special personal merits.  It is an uncomfortable but necessary thought.</P>
    <P>I hope that the reform initiated by this Bill will have a positive effect upon the attitudes of the public at large and that it will assist the overall thrust of policy in the fight against poverty.  All effective policy change in the social area is dependent upon widespread public awareness and understanding. These are the only real bases for acceptance of the costs of good social services and for sustained community involvement in them.</P>
    <P>Without support and involvement on a very considerable scale even the most radical policies and programmes cannot get to grips with the deep problems experienced by very many individuals and families throughout the country.  This is especially the case in respect of the proposed new scheme of supplementary welfare allowances which are designed specifically to deal with the problems of perhaps the most deprived groups in our national community.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the measures proposed in this Bill can achieve two aims.  They aim to do away with what has been aptly described <Col N="383" /> as the pauperisation, the indignity and the inadequacy of the Poor Law. They aim also to introduce a new service upon which we can build a programme capable of bringing effective help to many in real need. These are aims which are totally consistent with the progressive development of our social services.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to Seanad Éireann for its speedy and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom, sa chéad dul síos, a rá go bhfuilfimid sásta ar an dtaobh seo den Teach go bhfuil Bille mar seo ós ár gcomhair ag an Rúnaí Pharlaiminte.  Aontaimid leis an dearcadh atá aige agus leis an obair atá á dhéanamh againn i dtaobh leasa sóisialaigh ins gach áit.  Cuirimid fáilte roimh an chuid is mó de na tairiscintí atá san Bhille seo.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House are in favour of this Bill.  This party have always been in favour of any type of social legislation that would help those in need.  We would be particularly concerned about those people who are in receipt of home assistance.  It may be a blot on our society that such a scheme has had to exist down through the years and that it is still needed.  No matter how we legislate there will always be people who will be ill, who will not able to work and who will not have an opportunity of working, and who, for one reason or another, will not be able to sustain themselves or their families.  There are many families at present who are working hard but no matter how hard they work they still find they are not able to sustain themselves and their families in reasonable comfort.  It should be our aim to try to do everything possible to assist these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the stigma of home assistance. It is a stigma that has attached for too long to this type of benefits.  As a member of a county council, I realise that there are people in every county who are in need of assistance. Perhaps the hardest thing of all for these people is to admit that they need such assistance.  In many cases they <Col N="384" /> have to bury their pride and seek some help from the county council.  It is fair to say that in may own county and in other northern counties, the home assistance officers who have been charged with administering this scheme have, down the years, within the financial restrictions imposed upon them, been very sympathetic.  It is only right that officers who go out to investigate claims would bear in mind that they are dealing with human beings and that they are decent people who were probably evicted out of their homesteads in the past, people who were firmly rooted in the national tradition and who were sent to the poorer parts of the country to eke out an existence there.  These people had their pride, and we must admire them for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are doing the right thing in removing this stigma and looking upon benefits as a right.  These people are our own citizens and we have a duty towards them.  It is up to us as legislators and as a Government to see to it that there will not be anybody within our society who will not have the ordinary means of living a decent life and giving their families a reasonable chance of success.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the duties of parents and the duties of children towards their parents. He said some effort was being made to ensure that people who could afford it and had property should be more or less responsible for their parents, as is laid down in the Fourth Commandment.  Such an attitude has been a feature of all our legislation down through the years; I think it was even one of the reasons why there was a means test for the old age pension, recognising the fact that children have a duty to their parents, especially in their old age.  It is an admirable feature of our society and one that should be sustained.  It would be sad if younger people, who are able to avail of the many services and advantages that have been made available in our time&mdash;the good roads, schools and so on&mdash;were to back-track on their duty to their parents and hand them over to the State and say it is <Col N="385" /> the duty of the State to take care of these people, or worse still, to put them into an institution or geriatric homes, which are really prisons so far as the old people are concerned.</P>
    <P>The thinking behind this Bill is very good.  It is no shame to be poor. Many people are poor not because they are unable to work but because of circumstances.  Some people are born into wealth while others are born of poorer parents.  It is often very hard to rise above that.  Legislation should be designed to try to ensure that these people who had not a fair start in life would be given some kind of equality without cutting out competition. They should be given basic necessities to which any man and woman rearing a family should be entitled.  The family is the base of our society and we must not lose sight of this.  If it is brought to our notice that people are in need, it is the duty of the local authority and of the Government to ensure that they are assisted.</P>
    <P>Many people are critical of what they call &ldquo;hand-outs&rdquo; to undeserving people.  If that happens in any case it is not the fault of the Government or of a local authority: It may be the fault of the people themselves who have not got a conscience and who try to get something they are not entitled to. Naturally none of us would condone that.  At the same time, people in the upper strata in society get plenty of hand-outs that there is no word about, in particular, people who avail of secondary and university education. Many a time the small farmer was subsidising the students through university. Very often those people, when they came to the university, looked down their noses at the poor farmer. When you examine our whole social structure you will concede that there is hardly anybody in this country who is not getting some type of assistance, dole or subvention in one way or another from the taxpayer.  We should bear that in mind.  These people who have to seek social welfare assistance should not have to come hat in hand.</P>
    <P>In the past our officers, our county managers and county councillors were very lenient in this respect.  It is only right that they should investigate the <Col N="386" /> claims, but, as often happened in the past in investigating old age pensions and so on it is not necessary for them to go around counting every hen&mdash;there are none of them now anyhow.  These rules and regulations were administered too strictly.  I am glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say this is the death knell of the poor law system. It has existed for far too long in this country.  It was introduced by an alien Government that came in and walked upon the natives.  They then shoved the natives into the mountains and into small farms, classified them as congested or undeveloped districts, and handed out doles or some other sort of pittance.  The Irish people are above that, and have nothing to be ashamed of, if, because in rearing their families and unavailability of work or inability to work they have to ask for assistance. As the Minister said, there will be structural changes in the whole system as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important to have these benefits. It is people's right.  We know that some of this legislation goes back to the famine in 1846-47, when poor houses were built and soup pots and so on were handed out.  We are now able to stand on our own feet and cater for those who are unable to cater for themselves.  There are still in our community itinerants who have to travel the country, who find it very difficult to get accommodation.  This is sometimes understandable because not very many people like to have them on their doorstep.  They are, nevertheless, human beings.  While some of them are wealthy, the vast majority of them are very poor.  While we may talk about the third world and undeveloped areas, we should think of our own people and remember that charity begins at home.  You may often find people who are generous in contributing to other schemes but who give meagre support to those who are in need.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that about 30,000 people come under this legislation.  That is an enormous number out of a small population. Around £2 million has already been spent.  We have a Christian duty, <Col N="387" /> apart from our duty as legislators, to see that these people do not die from want.  It happened once.  We must ensure it will not happen again.  We should follow the philosophy used when helping third world countries. We must do our best to educate these people, to ensure that they will try to rise above the status in which they find themselves and cultivate the desire to help themselves.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to bring up families on the idea that they need do nothing, that there will be a hand-out for them while they are alive.  We should try and get away from that attitude. We should, through our legislation or other means, encourage these people, not write them off as inferior citizens but try to educate them and create opportunities for them.  At present many of them cannot avail of national education.  Every citizen should be able to avail of post-primary and third-level education.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made some reference in the Bill to students.  I am not sure whether they are catered for or not.  There are other county council scholarship schemes, but if the child of a very poor family, on home assistance, had ability and was able to get into a secondary school, he should be helped right along the way.  We should lift people out of the rut in which they find themselves, and that is what we on this side of the House would like to do for citizens who are not in as favourable a position as others in our community.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to people's self-esteem and to the unpleasant flavour of home assistance.  It was a very unpleasant word.  It is no wonder that many families tried to keep it a secret from their neighbours.  There was certainly a stigma attached to it. Many of us here have experience of other bodies apart from local authorities who helped in various ways, particularly the St. Vincent de Paul Society, in a secret way.  They deserve recognition and thanks for their excellent work.</P>
    <P>The amount it is proposed to pay is £7.75, and if there were four in the family it would bring it up to £23. <Col N="388" /> It is important for the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister to keep in mind so far as these amounts are concerned that we are living in an inflationary situation.  Last year there was a 26 per cent increase in inflation and no matter how generous £7.75 might look, if you go into any shop at present to cater for a family, even of four, with a £10 note, you will have very little change coming out.  You cannot hand out everything, but at the same time it is necessary for us to keep rates in line with inflation. There are many people who live in homes by themselves who are catered for by the health boards through home help and so on and for whom heating is a great problem, with the price of coal escalating.</P>
    <P>I am not one who would advocate gathering people into institutions, but only last week a man living alone was burned in his home.  Our officers should try to keep a keen eye out for such situations, so as to ensure that, if at all possible, old people who are living alone will have all the necessities of life, that, if they have nobody at all related to them, at least the county council, the health boards and the State will take full responsibility for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned burials, and this is a very big problem in many areas where some poor old man has lived by himself and has nothing. It is only right that the county council, as they do of course, should step in in these cases and see that he gets a proper Christian burial.  While he may not have succeeded financially he deserves respect as a human being.</P>
    <P>I notice that the staff, too, are being transferred.  I would pay great tribute to them for their dedication; their efforts to help the underprivileged in our community.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister is doing nothing that has not already been done by the county councils throughout the country.  The only effect of this legislation is to transfer from the county council the finances that the county council used for this operation in the past.  The county council will now have to pay over that money to the health board, and the health board <Col N="389" /> then will pay it back to the recipients in the various county council areas. That is not good enough.  If this is to cost another £2 million, the Minister and the Government should have been big enough to go the whole hog and say they would pay for home assistance and not be handing this back to the ratepayers who, in all county council and urban areas, are saddled with intolerable burdens, burdens that are weighing very heavily on them. Many of them have families and, as you know, there is no allowance made for a ratepayer who has a family. That is totally unjust.  It would be much fairer if the Minister had said that they would carry this through taxation.  One would think from listening to all this that the Government were doing something wonderful on behalf of home assistance recipients, when, in fact, there seems to be nothing taking place except a chain of operations whereby instead of their receiving home assistance directly from the county council, the council will pay it to the health board; then another official will have a look at it there and it will be paid back from the health board to the same people in the county council.  That will increase the cost instead of saving money on the operation.</P>
    <P>There are many other points I am not going to refer to now, but I welcome the Bill and wish the Parliamentary Secretary every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, which is long overdue.  Social Welfare covers a very wide field and it is not possible to bring about improvements overnight.  I will say, in fairness, that all governments from time to time have made their contribution to improve the position of the underprivileged.  This Bill is more flexible.  In the past while the home assistance officers were doing a very fine job, they were very restricted and had very little to give.  They had no guidelines or training, which made the matter very difficult when a home assistance officer was called in to investigate a claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, he had to investigate whether or not the person qualified. <Col N="390" /> Then he had to try and assess what he had to give him.  Because of the small amount received, the claimant became frustrated and was inclined to think of the home assistance officer as everything but a gentleman.  At that time, if people were turned down by a home assistance officer there was no redress.  Irrespective of how difficult people were, if they could have a second opinion it meant a lot.  That second opinion might still turn them down, but then they would be satisfied with the decision.</P>
    <P>In my opinion this appeal is the best part of this Bill because it makes a person feel his case will be fully investigated. In the section that refers to that appeal, there is reference to another health board officer plus somebody appointed by the Minister. I would not be happy about the reference to the second health board officer.  If another officer of the same board came in it would not be fair to the officer because he might be called upon to reverse the decision of his colleague.  That would not be that easy.  On the other hand, the applicant might feel that he was not getting a fair deal by virtue of the fact that the two people concerned were working for the same board.  However, I am quite sure that the Parliamentary Secretary will look into that.</P>
    <P>I am worried about training.  Anybody who is called upon to deal with the public needs training, particularly with people who are in need.  When people are in need they are frustrated, annoyed and upset, and therefore it is much more difficult to deal with such people.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this Bill.  I would like to know how long it will take to assess a claim. The health board will assess the applicant.  From my experience of health board officers there can be delay.  Even with an ordinary application for a medical card the delay can run into six weeks.  Six weeks' delay in the issuing of a medical card would not be that bad because somebody would not die of hunger, but somebody waiting on this allowance for six weeks could be in a very bad financial position.  For that reason I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="391" /> to introduce some condition whereby the matter would be speeded up.</P>
    <P>There is another condition which I really favour, that is, in regard to employment.  From day to day, whether they are justified or not, we hear people speak about the abuses of the social welfare code. For that reason it is much better that all other channels of employments should have failed before home assistance is considered.</P>
    <P>There is another part of the Bill that I think is very important, that is, that the health board can pay a welfare allowance in an urgent case. In the event of somebody being in dire distress it is well to know that the discretion is there for somebody to come out and pay it immediately if the applicant is in trouble.  Waiting is not going to improve the position, and very often people become annoyed and upset if there is pressure on them for something they cannot meet.</P>
    <P>Another thing is this substitute of goods and services instead of portion or all of the allowance.  That is a good idea.  I wonder if we could go a step further, but I am not too sure what the legal aspect would be. Very often with parents one of the two can be described as a spendthrift and, irrespective of the amount of money which will go into that house, poverty can exist.  Poverty, through bad management, can exist in houses with an income of £60 or £80 a week.  It would be desirable if the health board inspector could decide which of the two parents should receive the money, or it might be advisable to supply goods and services instead of money.</P>
    <P>Section 5, subsection (1), refers to a trade union dispute.  Does this refer to an official or an unofficial strike? Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would tell me how the person will qualify.  Under section 5 a person will not qualify, but his dependants and family will.  Is the qualified person one who is locked out or who refuses to pass a picket?  This section should not act as an incentive to people to remain on strike.  I am sure it would be the wish of every Member of the Oireachtas <Col N="392" /> to keep the wheels of industry moving.  I may be interpreting this wrongly and I should like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackGarrett" hpid="Mr. Garrett Mr. Garrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to alleviate and get rid of poverty.  It is my belief that it will never get rid of poverty.  My way of getting rid of poverty would be to give a poor man an existence allowance, not a bonanza, make him rely on his own resources and make him independent of this allowance.</P>
      <P>A couple of years ago in my part of the county we received a direction to bring our public assistance payments up to the same level as Roscommon and Galway.  This we did. It cost us about £114,000 a year.  Last year we paid out £207,000 cash in public assistance. Our 1975 estimate will be over £280,000.  This is an increase in one year of £91,000, and that does not include administration costs.  Such bills may be all right in a county where only 40 or 50 people are on public assistance. In counties such as Mayo, where there is an average of 1,600 or 1,700 people on public assistance, rates will be increased by 15.5p: Our rate must be one of the highest, if not the highest, in Ireland.  No county can afford that rate for public assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £4½ million being paid in public assistance will not raise the dignity of anybody.  All that is involved is a change of name.  Social welfare supplementary allowance is the same as public assistance.  I can tell my neighbour to buy a cow for some poor man, but have I any authority to tell a man what to do with his own money?  The Government are not justified in telling us in County Mayo to put a rate of 75.5p in the £ on the people of Mayo. Then they will go on the platforms at the next election and say: &ldquo;We raised your public assistance.  We raised your dignity by changing the name to social welfare supplementary allowance.&rdquo;  In a couple of days we will have before us in the county council the legislation requiring every county council have proper pounds and maintain them.  It was the same with the legislation concerning the waiver of rates. We have had too many of these Bills <Col N="393" /> telling us what to do without money and to raise that money on the rates. We were faced this year with a county manager's estimate requiring a rate of £12.47p in the £.  We spent five nights trying to reduce it and eventually struck a rate of £11.17p.  This Bill will put a tremendous burden on the ratepayers in county Mayo.  All the Government have done is change the name of the Bill from public assistance to social welfare supplementary grant.  They are making the county councils collect the money and hand it over to the health boards.</P>
    <P>The Government have not given us any money last year or this year.  Why can the Government not give us an opportunity of living within our means?  Why can they not take 1972 or 1973 as the base year?  They are taking 1975, which is a year in which it is costing us £280,000 to meet our public assistance on payments to poor people.  This idea of the county councils carrying £1.5 million for the poor people of Ireland is diabolical, particularly in view of all the preaching the Government make about looking after the poor and the unemployed. There will be more people on this public assistance and social welfare in another few weeks when this unemployment money runs out.  Then the county councils will be paying them and the Government will not.  They are making the county councils collect the money from the overburdened taxpayers and the overburdened ratepayers to pay these people the money.</P>
    <P>We have no say in the matter.  We must pay what the health board demands from us.  The health charges were not brought down very much this year in Mayo.  Our health board has a budget of £31½ million to cater for the demands of three counties.  In previous times, when we were directly under the county council, our budget ran at about £3½ million.  But if a demand is made on us we have to meet it.  It is unjust and unfair to us. Eventually the day will come, not alone in Mayo but in many other places, when there will be a rebellion against the payment of rates.  We have been told that there has been a reduction over the last 30 years from <Col N="394" /> 75,000 to 30,000 in the number of people on public assistance.  During the last few weeks various Ministers have told us that Fianna Fáil during their 30 years in office did nothing at all to help the poor.  But this reduction is a good example of what Fianna Fáil did during their years in office. That was a considerable achievement.</P>
    <P>I am not happy about the position in regard to students.  They get nothing from this social welfare supplementary grant.  Take a man in any part of the country who is receiving this social welfare supplementary grant who has a boy or girl who is clever enough to obtain a scholarship to a secondary school or a university. There is not the faintest hope that that father will be able to provide money for that student's upkeep.  Such situations should be catered for. Students who have the ability to obtain these scholarships should not be hindered by lack of money.  Perhaps we may have a better type of politician here in the future if some of these young people decide to make politics their career.</P>
    <P>Even with a demand for £280,000 there were people in Mayo receiving public assistance as low as £1.75 to supplement their income.  About three weeks ago a poor unfortunate person told me that she was getting £1 assistance. I knew what bills she had to meet and I asked an official if anything could be done to assist her.  I was told that nothing could be done to help her.  She will now be getting a little more under the provisions of this Bill.  However, this will not come from Government funds; it will come from the ratepayers of Mayo.  We cannot afford to increase this public assistance allowance next year no matter what demand is made on us. We will not qualify for the 60 per cent grant next year because we will not be able to give this increase.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister for Finance, as the Bill states, have to sanction the actions of the Minister for Social Welfare when it is the county councils who will collect the money?  The county councils will pay the money collected over to the health boards and the health boards will then pay <Col N="395" /> it out to the recipients.  Why bring in the Minister for Finance to sanction this?  He is not giving us any money?  He has given us no money since public assistance came into operation.  Why has the Minister for Finance to sanction the regulation of circumstances which would give rise to supplements and the amount to be paid or assistance in kind in the case of particular classes of payments?</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Brien when he says that in the case of persons receiving supplementary social welfare benefits the investigating officer should have the right to determine whether it be the father or the mother who would receive payment.  We are all aware of the abuses attached to unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance and how in many cases none of this money is used for the upkeep of homes.  Most of the recipients spend their money on a day out in the pub.  But when people are entitled to these supplementary grants, at the discretion of the investigating officer the payments should be made either to the father or the mother.  If the husband insists he is entitled to a certain amount of the money, the investigating officer should ensure that the wife gets the food vouchers to enable her to care for herself and her family.</P>
    <P>I know a man who has 17 children and that man gets about £47 or £48 a week public assistance.  Would anybody blame that man for not going out to seek work?  He can grow potatoes and other vegetables.  He can have some chickens and will not have to buy eggs.  He may have a cow.  He may have 20 or 30 acres of mountainy land where he raises sheep.  He can kill a lamb to provide his family with meat.  That man will never seek work when he can get £48 per week in public assistance.  He can make £20 a week on extra jobs, on &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; helping out his neighbours.</P>

      <P>Senator Garrett, on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackGarrett" hpid="Mr. Garrett Mr. Garrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
      <P>If each local authority had to bear the full costs of the new service in its area with its higher and standarised rates of payment, there would be a very substantial increase in the local rate in the poor counties where home assistance standards of payments are generally lowest.</P>
      <P>That is true in Mayo, at any rate.  The people there cannot afford the increase in the rates which this will involve.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also said:</P>
      <P>Accordingly, under the proposals of this Bill, each local authority's contribution to the total amount to be paid by all authorities will be determined by reference to what it is now spending on home assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a poor area a man will have to contribute a higher proportion to the total cost than at present.  The council provides money for assistance to the Western Health Board, but has no say in how that money is spent.  The poor counties cannot bear that cost.  That cost should be borne by the Central Government and made a charge on the whole county.  The rich and the middle <Col N="397" /> classes as a whole should look after the poor of the country.</P>
    <P>As well as paying the increases the council must also pay the administration costs.  In addition the Western Health Board have estimated £18,000 as the cost of a free fuel scheme.  The council could not object to it; we have to pay out.  The council's total net expenditure on public assistance services for 1975-76, even without these increases at all, will be £340,350.  A county such as Mayo cannot afford that.</P>
    <P>I will not oppose the Bill, but there are few things in it I can support.  It is not going to alleviate or abolish poverty.  A man who is given £45, £46 or £47 a week in assistance will not work as a labourer for the county council for £33 a week.  That is the standard rate in Mayo.  Is there any sense in that situation?  The families of such men are going to grow up and say &ldquo;Well, my father had a hell of a fine time on £47 a week, sitting down watching us playing and gallivanting around the garden&rdquo; and they are going to try to do the same thing.  They will not be inclined to go to work.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an answer to the Family Planning Bill, because the more children a man has the more money he will get and the less work he will do. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to try to alter the base year and give us some chance of existence in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the principle of the Bill because it is a different kind of Bill from any of the social welfare legislation we have had in this House for a long time.  It is a Bill which is not based on the concept of handouts but on the concept of entitlement.  It will be a long time before we can give the poor in this country what they are entitled to.  But this Bill, in so far as it declares an entitlement, puts a moral obligation on us all to meet it in some way.  The way in which we meet it is of course inadequate, but now we are saying, unambiguously, without any possibility of being misunderstood, that persons who are not wealthy enough to meet their basic needs are entitled to all the help they need in order to bring them above <Col N="398" /> the poverty threshold.  The actual words are in section 2 of the Bill:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this Act, every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his needs and the needs of any adult or child dependant of his shall be entitled to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>That is the core of the Bill.  Without that, any amount of discretionary power granted to any authority, local authority, health board and so on, would be meaningless.  There must be this fundamental provision in the Bill if the whole concept is to work.</P>
      <P>It is a concept which is based on justice, not just on social justice but on the economic justice without which we will never have any type of social justice.  We are a long way from social justice and we are a longer way again from economic justice.  But this Bill is putting some of the priorities right. There may not be the money there to create the conditions which the Parliamentary Secretary would like to create but the legislation is now there and when the money is there the spirit of justice will become more and more of a reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with Senator Garrett when he said that all we had here was a change of words and that the words did not make any difference.  If Senator Garrett believed that, he would not have spent so long on his feet abusing the Parliamentary Secretary for what he thought was in the Bill. Of course, words mean things.  The fundamental change in this Bill is the change from the word &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;allowance&rdquo;.  This is a good change.  It is an important change.  &ldquo;Assistance&rdquo; is one of these words that have value-laden connotations attached to it.  It is something that might be given, something that might be withheld.  Whether it is given or not depends on the goodwill of the donor, not on the rights of the recipient. &ldquo;Allowance&rdquo; is a much more neutral, a much more valid word, one which indicates that if a person is entitled to something there should be no doubt whatsoever but that he gets what he is entitled to.  I might even <Col N="399" /> prefer the word &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo;.  A supplementary welfare entitlement might even have been stronger.  But, granted that the word in the Bill is &ldquo;allowance&rdquo; it is at least a change from the word &ldquo;assistance&rdquo;, a change not just of terminology but a change that exemplifies the thinking behind this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another reason why I am very much in favour of this Bill is that it is hugely discretionary.  It gives to the chief officer of health boards, and the officers appointed by him for the purposes of the scheme, considerable latitude in all sorts of ways, for example, in terms of deciding whether social needs and the needs of individual people and their families should be met in terms of cash or in terms of kind.  It gives them discretion to say when an award should be made.  One thing I am more glad to see in this Bill than anything else is the statutory recognition of the concept of urgency. We are all familiar with the fact that the workings of a social welfare system, although substantial improvements have taken place in recent years, often are not rapid enough to meet the real needs of the recipients.</P>
    <P>I came across a case the other day where a man was sacked by a firm, without notice, without redundancy, and immediately after that the firm went into voluntary liquidation to escape its obligations to its creditors, including the people who had worked for it.  He was left high and dry.  It took him eight weeks to get public assistance, and that was no more than ten miles from where I am standing today.  If it took a well-educated working man eight weeks to get his entitlement, eight weeks of not knowing how much money he was entitled to, when he was going to get it, whether he would ever get it, the provision in this Bill for statutory recognition of the concept of urgency is long overdue. Again, we will never meet needs as quickly as they need to be met. Now we have a statutory responsibility being placed on the health boards to meet urgent needs in an urgent fashion.  I have come across several cases like these and I am sure all public representatives in this House <Col N="400" /> have.  I am sure all public representatives share with me the annoyance and frustration that come from having to deal with a bureaucracy, even a wellintentioned hard-working bureaucracy such as frequently is found in our society.</P>
    <P>I hope the provisions of this Bill will be taken to heart by the public service generally and, in particular, this provision for urgency.  For public servants the important thing is precedent, the important thing is priority. Very often through no fault of their own they may lack this sense of urgency. This sense of urgency is now being enjoined on them.  They have to pay attention to it.  They have to meet, as I said, urgent needs in an urgent way.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested from the other side of the House and, indeed, may be suggested on this side, that this Bill can be abused.  Of course, this Bill can be abused.  Of course the Bill will be abused.  It is one of the surest things in life that this Bill will be abused.  I would argue very strongly that the amount of abuse which may or may not creep into the workings of this Bill, monitored or not monitored by Senator Garrett and his friends, will be absolutely tiny compared to the huge volume of institutional, financial, economic and social abuse we have hurled at the poor throughout the generations of the working of the Poor Law Act.</P>
    <P>Senator Garrett seemed to think this Bill was a retort to the Family Planning Bill, which I know the Parliamentary Secretary supports, because it implied that the more children you had the more money you got.  I ask Senator Garrett would he have it the other way around?  At the same time, there are some points which should be made on the question of financing.  Certainly the rating system needs to be changed.  I do not propose to go into it here.  I do not think I am competent to do so.  To argue against this Bill and the financing of it solely on the grounds that it will impose an additional charge on the rates in certain cases is cynical in the extreme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="401" /> Senator Garrett even went to the extent of threatening that, if this Bill became law, the county council of which he is a public representative would not be able or willing&mdash;the difference is really immaterial&mdash;to find the money which would release the extra State grants to help pay the improved benefits in this scheme. This is an extraordinary demonstration of priorities.  I hope that if that happens Mayo will be the only county in which it happens.  I hope that if it does happen in Mayo, Senator Garrett will get the answer he deserves, because he will then find out that, although you may take away everything from the poor, you cannot take away their votes.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of small points of detail in the Bill which I should like to take up here.  The first is the reference in section 3 to persons who are receiving full-time instruction at universities, colleges, schools, or other educational establishments. I agree, of course, that it is sound administrative practice, that these people by and large should be excluded from the working of the Bill.  I am very glad to see in subsection (3) of this section there is a discretionary element introduced. It was referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary in his speech when he instanced the sort of situation that might arise in which somebody who was in full-time education would be entitled to a supplementary welfare allowance.  In this he has put his finger on one of the greatest weaknesses in our social system, and one of the greatest opportunities that was missed when the free education scheme was introduced so many years ago.</P>
    <P>Everybody agrees&mdash;and certainly it was&mdash;that the free education scheme was a good thing.  It has taken people a long time to realise&mdash;and many people still have not realised&mdash;that the cost of education is far more than the cost of the school fees.  It is far more than the cost of the school buses. It is far more than the cost of the schoolbooks.  For many families in Ireland, far more than many people suspect, it is also the cost of not being able to go out to work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="402" /> Senator Brosnahan knows, I am sure, better than most of us of the many families in this city and in this country whose children are not able to complete primary education, let alone post-primary education, because of the urgent financial needs of their families which forced them out to work.  This is a sad fact.  It is a fact of life.  It is a fact which was not recognised, unfortunately, in the O'Malley scheme.  An opportunity was lost at that time, I believe, to introduce some form of income supplement for certain families to enable their children to continue in education.  This Bill, in a very small way, goes a bit of the way towards plugging that gap which was left unplugged in our education system.</P>
    <P>It is often said that this is not important, that the reason people do not participate to any great extent in education beyond a certain age is that they are not interested in it.  The answer to that argument is, and always has been, that people should put their money where their mouths are.  Let them offer people grants, real grants, to enable them to keep their children at school and they will find out how quickly these social attitudes change, these alleged social attitudes.</P>
    <P>As things stand at the moment, the educational system is the greatest single offset to progressive taxation we have.  It redistributes large portions of tax back to the people who paid it in the first place not, indeed, to the people for whose benefit it was designed, and very often gives them a surplus as well.  I would refer the House to the recent report of the National Economic and Social Council on inequality of income distribution which points out that for a certain hypothetical family, very much in the upper income bracket, the education grants and subsidies are so large that such a person, earning over £6,000 a year, can actually be getting more from the State in benefits than he is paying to it in tax.  I will not labour the point except to say that it should be made.</P>
    <P>What is of even more fundamental importance in this Bill is that it tackles <Col N="403" /> an even more basic problem than the educational one I have been speaking about, the distribution of resources in the educational system.  It tackles the problems of family health and welfare and nutrition which are fundamental to the well being of society.  However much educationalists may think and act as if the educational system can remedy all the ills of society, it is very true to say that without basic housing standards, nutritional standards, income standards in the lower socio-economic groups, all any educational system would be doing would be trying to patch up something that is as full of holes as a fishing net.  This is the fundamental thrust of this Bill.  It is something I am very pleased to welcome.</P>
    <P>The second point of detail is the flexibility of the Bill with regard to distribution of benefits or allowances in cash or in kind.  This echoes something in the policy document on social welfare adopted by the Labour Party Conference and which insisted that many people's problems are not ones that can be solved just by cash.  Anybody can hand out cash, although we have seen, even in this Government, that not everybody can get the cash to give out.  Everybody's problems are not always solved by this miraculous commodity. Very often people need services.  Very often they need human relationships that can only be provided by sensitive people.  In its discretionary aspects, this Bill lays substantial emphasis on these things.  I am glad of that.</P>
    <P>I have one minor quibble with the terminology in section 10 where we talk about the definition of an adult dependant in a way which, possibly, makes sense to a parliamentary draftsman but not to me.  It refers to an adult dependant either as a married man or as a married woman.  In the case of a married woman her husband is only regarded as an adult dependant if he is incapable of self-support by reason of some physical or mental infirmity.  It seems to me, particularly since section 16 (1) (d) refers to the mutual responsibility of husbands and wives to maintain each other, that this kind of section could be telescoped quite comfortably <Col N="404" /> into some sort of phrase like &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo; means in the case of a married person, his or her spouse if he or she is living with him or her or is wholly or mainly maintained by him or her.  I fail to see the need to drag in a man's physical incapacity to qualify him for the status of being maintained by his wife.  There may be some men who would be quite happy to assume the role of a dependant in the household.  I do not know if this Bill really takes them into account.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to make a few brief remarks on the question of administration. This was referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary in his opening address when he expressed the hope that people who would be administering this scheme would do so sensitively and with every courtesy to the people concerned.  I should like to stress that.  I should like to add to what Senator O'Brien said about the importance of training.  Whatever training procedures are adopted for the people who will administer this piece of legislation, they should be warned against treating the clients of the social welfare system as problems and encouraged to treat them as opportunities, basically, of course, as human beings, as people who have rights, and treat themselves as people whose job it is to make sure they get their rights.  It is a splendid idea to do as has been done here, to build an appeal system into the administration of the Act.</P>
    <P>With all the best will in the world, there is still too much mal-administration in our country, too much petty tyranny by people who are accountable to nobody.  We must have administrative practices which allow people to appeal against decisions which they genuinely feel are bad.  We must have administrative mechanisms which will allow people to break out of what can be a vicious circle of tyranny at the local and perhaps even at the village level.  There must be an avenue of escape from such claustrophobic and humanly degrading situations.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Parliamentary Secretary that the greatest single reform that could be made in the public service in the administration of this or of any other social welfare legislation <Col N="405" /> is to ensure that the positions dealing with the public are promotional posts, and not junior posts.  There has been too much of a tendency in the past to regard the junior ranks of the civil service as the people best fitted to deal with the public.  Accordingly, as you go up the grades in the civil service, you get further and further away from the problems with which you are supposed to be dealing.  The actual responsibility of dealing directly with the public, on a face-to-face basis, should be the responsibility of a civil servant or public servant whose seniority is only just below that of the policymaking level.  People who went from the position of dealing directly with the public directly into the policy-making level, would help our Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries to produce legislation much more attuned to the real needs of people than to the presumed needs of administrative systems.</P>
    <P>In broad terms, I am delighted to see this Bill, not so much for the money it will hand out, although that is not by any means ungenerous, as for the fundamental principles it enunciates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is on the record of the House that in January or February of 1970 I suggested that a Bill of this type should be introduced, although not really of this type because this Bill has not gone as far as it should go.  It deals with people who are in the non-contributory section of the social welfare code. To date, very little has been done for them by the State.  Everything has been done at local level.  In his leftish jargon Senator Horgan said people should put their money where their mouths are.  He even went on to say that they were not accountable to anybody for what they did.  That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Galway, our county council spend practically £1 million every four years on people in need of social welfare who, for one reason or another, are not in the contributory section.  No legislation worth talking about was ever brought into any House by any Government to try to help them.  It was left to the county <Col N="406" /> councils and to the local bodies to assist these people to the best of their ability.  It was the local councils who came to the rescue of such people. They were accountable to the ratepayers who paid the money.  Senator Horgan is not quite fair when he says they were not accountable.  They were accountable to the ratepayers of the county.  They did a job that was very hard to do, and tried to do it to the best of their ability.  It is quite fair and true to say that.  A long time before I was on it, our council played their part, and continue to do so.  It is no mean feat for the people of County Galway to subscribe such an amount of money to a section of the community the State have, in fact, not recognised since its foundation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome for what it is worth.  As I said previously, it has not gone as far as I would like it to go. The disabled persons' maintenance allowance scheme operates in every county.  If a person tries to abuse this Bill he will probably drop the DPMA scheme and get into this one.  That is not the proper way to do those things. A disabled person, whether he is a contributory subscriber to the social welfare code or a non-contributory subscriber, should have equal entitlement. That is a basic principle with which I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree.</P>
    <P>For example, a man is working on a small farm of land of 20 or 25 acres, and his eldest son has to stay at home and rear his brothers and sisters and work hard to do it.  Then he gets married himself.  His wife's sister marries a neighbour down the road.  She continues to work and so does her husband. The two couples are the same types of families.  One couple is working and one couple is at home.  The girl who has employment goes into hospital to give birth to her baby.  She gets three months off with pay.  Her sister who is married up the road goes into a crowded hospital and gives birth to her baby.  She stays three days in the hospital and is then sent home.  I do not think any government&mdash;and particularly this Government who claim to be social welfare heroes&mdash; can say that they have done everything <Col N="407" /> for this class of people.  I do not see anything in this Bill to help them.</P>
    <P>We talk about second-class citizens but there are people who are now classed as third-class citizens who do not benefit under this Bill.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary understands exactly what I am trying to say. The DPMA is a payment made by the county council to the best of their ability.  They are responsible to the ratepayers.  In our county a person who was ill, disabled, or unable to work got a payment of approximately £9.  We could not take into account whether he had one child, two, three or ten children, or no children.  It was a flat payment of £9.  We could give no more.  What does this Bill do for that type of person?  That payment is now taken into account in the assessment of a person making an application under Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowances) Bill.  This is what I particularly dislike about this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 12 (2) (a) (i) provides that any sums received by way of allowance under the Social Welfare (Children's Allowances) Scheme shall not be taken into account.  Section 12 (2) (a) (ii) provides that any sums received by way of allowance for domiciliary care of handicapped children shall not be taken into account.  Any sums arising from the profitable use of property are not taken into account.  Why is not any person receiving disabled person's maintenance allowance excluded?  When it is not stated in the Bill, that will be used. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary understands what I mean when I say that.  When it is not included here, it will be taken for granted in the criteria set out for the means test.</P>
    <P>I still think that, in the assessment of the means test, the Government have taken into account something which is very unreal.  Section 12 (2) (c) provides that the value of any advantage accruing to such person from the use or enjoyment of property, other than furniture and personal effects, which is personally used or enjoyed by the person will be taken into account in assessing the means of an individual for payment under <Col N="408" /> this Bill.  If a misfortunate man is living in a house with his wife and four or five children, if he does not qualify under any other part of the social welfare code, and applies for payment under this Bill, the house will be assessed on its cash value.  We will have a new set of people assessing the value of the house.  We will have all those misfortunate civil servants working for the health boards going around valuing houses.  I am sure some of them will not do it correctly, not deliberately.  It is ludicrous that, in the assessment, the slates, the timber and the bedroom will be taken into account.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government to delete forthwith section 12 (2) (c).</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter in the Seanad and to afford the Minister an opportunity of justifying his decision on the record of this House.  I have also had a request from two of my colleagues, Senator Alexis FitzGerald and Senator Eoin Ryan, to contribute briefly, so I shall be confining my remarks to well within the allotted time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision of the Minister last March to overrule the refusal by Dublin Corporation to allow demolition of the Georgian former headquarters of Bord na Móna at 28-32 Pembroke Street was one of the worst planning decisions ever made in relation to the city of Dublin.  I say this for three basic reasons.  Firstly, this is the first legally authorised demolition of a List B building, the list of buildings identified for preservation in the <Col N="409" /> Dublin development plan of 1971. Secondly, the Minister refused a request by one of the objectors for an oral hearing, so that there was no public inquiry prior to his reversal of the refusal by Dublin Corporation to grant permission for the demolition. Thirdly, the decision totally contravenes the city plan in allowing a massive office development on such an unsuitable site.  What is the wisdom of permitting an office development of such density, comprising six storeys in front and seven storeys behind, opening on to the smallest square in the city centre, with very poor approaches to it?</P>
    <P>I propose to develop these three points briefly.  Taking the first point, that this decision relates to a List B building, it is necessary to go briefly into the relevant chronological background. In 1971 the Dublin development plan was published in which there was a List A of buildings to be safeguarded if possible, and a List B, of buildings to be fully protected, to be the hard core of the centre of the city of Dublin which would be protected at all costs.  This list refers to specific buildings like Marsh's Library, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Tailor's Hall, and it also refers on page 32 of the report to houses in particular streets. In Upper Pembroke Street the particular houses listed are Nos. 28 to 32, which are the subject of this planning decision.</P>
    <P>On 26th July, 1972, Bord na Móna applied to the planning department of Dublin Corporation for planning permission for the erection of a three-storey office extension and sanitary block at the rere of Nos. 28 to 32 Upper Pembroke Street.  The corporation in an order dated 22nd September, 1972, decided to refuse permission for this development.  One of the reasons given was that the proposed development contravened the plot ratio provisions of the Dublin development plan.  An appeal was made against this decision to the Minister for Local Government, and the Minister by order dated 14th March, 1973, granted the permission.  That was the first occasion on which the Minister overruled the decision of the planning <Col N="410" /> authority.  However, Bord na Móna did not proceed with this particular plan.  Instead, they made a further application for planning permission on 31st May, 1974, this time for the erection of new Bord na Móna headquarters with six storeys at the front and seven at the rere, and a facade identical with the existing facade at Nos. 28 to 32 Upper Pembroke Street.  The corporation again, by order dated 26th July, 1974, decided to refuse permission.  I should like to quote from the reasons given by the corporation for refusing permission:</P>
    <P>(1)  The buildings concerned in this proposal are listed in List B of buildings, the preservation of which is an objective of the Dublin Development Plan, 1971.  These buildings are understood to be in good condition and well-maintained. Accordingly, it is considered contrary to the proper planning and development of the area and to the stated preservation policy of the Dublin Development Plan, 1971, to demolish and rebuild these buildings even if partly in facsimile; the integrity and originality of the buildings would be destroyed with consequent injury to the value and amenity of the Georgian streetscape in this location; the rear elevational treatment would, likewise, be out of character and scale.</P>
    <P>(2)  The proposal is at variance with the permission granted on appeal by the Minister for Local Government, which allows an equivalent office provision to be made while at the same time not involving the demolition of buildings scheduled for preservation in the interests of the proper planning and development of the area.</P>
    <P>This decision was appealed by Bord na Móna to the Minister for Local Government and the Minister, by order dated 19th March, 1975, granted the permission.  So for the second time&mdash; and it is this second decision which is the subject of the motion today&mdash; the Minister overruled the decision of Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>That is the first point&mdash;the historical background relating to the first <Col N="411" /> legal authorisation of the demolition of List B houses.</P>
    <P>The second point relates to the method of decision, and I think that this is a further aggravating factor. When an appeal was lodged in 1974 by Bord na Móna against the refusal of the planning department of Dublin Corporation a formal request for an oral hearing was made by the Dublin Civic Group to the Minister.  I should like to quote briefly from the letter dated 25th September, 1974, written to the Minister for Local Government, stating that the Dublin Civic Group wished to have an oral hearing and that their objections were as follows:</P>
    <P>This proposal would involve the demolition of those houses and their replacement by a facsimile facade. We view with concern the growing tendency of seeking planning permission for facades as one of the gravest challenges to the integrity and character of the remaining 18th century streets and squares of the city.</P>
    <P>This formal request was acknowledged in a letter from the Department dated 8th October, 1974.  It is a standard form letter, which says that &ldquo;the matter is receiving attention&rdquo;.  In fact, no public inquiry was held; no further communication was received, and the Minister announced his decision last March reversing the refusal of Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>Given the extreme importance from the planning point of view of this decision, it is extraordinary that the rules of natural justice were not complied with, and that a formal objector was not given an opportunity of stating the objections; that there was not a public inquiry to allow public airing of views.  Indeed, I would go so far as to say that in my view there may be certain legal implications in this. This is not the place to state whether this decision would be open to challenge on the grounds that it contravenes the rules of natural justice.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to understand the reasons which the Minister gives in support of his decision&mdash;that the houses were in such bad repair and <Col N="412" /> that there would be too high a cost in maintaining them.  How do we know this?  In 1974 the Dublin Corporation said that the houses were well-maintained and well preserved. In 1972, when the original application was made, Bord na Móna made no reference to the houses being in bad repair and they applied for planning permission to build an extension. There was no evidence, no inquiry, and therefore no proof that the houses were in such bad repair that exception would have to be made to their status as List B buildings and that they could be demolished.  I think the Minister has a very real burden to justify himself.</P>
    <P>The third major objection to the decision is less concerned with aesthetic qualities and conservation issues than it is with land use planning.  Permission to erect such a large office block on that very constricted site goes quite against the site plot ratio provisions of the city plan.  This was clear from the first refusal by Dublin Corporation in 1972.  It is contrary to the character of the area and it will create severe traffic and congestion problems.  It is sad that this sort of activity is to be carried on under the aegis of a State-sponsored body, and this is a very relevant factor in criticising the circumstances and implications of this decision.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the Minister has come in for a storm of criticism in relation to this decision. His action has been condemned by a special meeting of the Dublin City Council held on 22nd September, 1975.  I should like to quote from the motion carried in the Dublin City Council.  It says:</P>
    <P>This council deplores the decision of the Minister for Local Government in overruling the Corporation and allowing Bord na Móna to demolish 28 to 32 Upper Pembroke Street.</P>
    <P>It has been condemned by the whole body of conservation opinion, by An Taisce, the Dublin Civic Group, the Living City Group and the <Col N="413" /> Architectural Association of Ireland; by the Planning Committee and Cultural Committee of Dublin Council and by the European Architectural Heritage Committee of the Council. I should like to quote briefly from the press release of the conservation bodies where they point out:</P>
    <P>The attitude of the corporation to this application has been quite clear.  It was refused.  The refusal was supported not just by the Planning Department but by the Planning Committee, by the Council and by the Corporation's EAHY Advisory Committee.  This is a major issue.  The combined weight of all the city's institutions is found to be inadequate to save the 1 per cent of the city's buildings identified by An Taisce in 1967 and adopted by the corporation as its preservation objective.</P>
    <P>Most significantly of all, the official body of the architects of Ireland, the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland, have come out publicly against this decision.  The Minister himself will acknowledge that this is a rare occurrence. In a press statement dated 3rd December, 1975, the institute stated as follows:</P>
    <P>The council considers the corporation's decision to have been a logical and proper implementation of the intentions of the development plan in respect of conservation and would wish to see a solution which would ensure that the buildings and the streetscape be retained as a matter of civic, national and European importance.  The Declaration of Amsterdam, to which the Minister for Local Government subscribed, places the Government in the capacity of guardian of our architectural heritage for the whole of Europe and not just Ireland.</P>
    <P>It may be said that this decision exposes the hypocrisy of all the glowing statements which have emanated from the European Architectural Heritage Committee and from the Minister as our representative in Amsterdam when signing the public declaration of conservation values in Amsterdam. Therefore it is incumbent <Col N="414" /> on the Minister to put on the record of this House whatever reasons he may have had for this decision which has evoked such public criticism.</P>
    <P>I now make way for my colleagues who wish to contribute to the debate and I await with interest the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the position that the Minister's function is spent in regard to this particular property.  I appeal in the strongest possible way to the directors of Bord na Móna to refrain from exercising the liberty they have been given before they make a thorough examination of the economics of their own decision and before they have a thorough examination again of the possibility of the preservation of this property.  I do this because what has been the source of unconscious, sometimes joy to generations of people, what is the work of Irish skill much more than of the patrons who employ them, can be so easily, so irrevocably destroyed.</P>
      <P>We are not talking here about the preservation of something alien.  This is less alien than the religion professed by most of the people of this country which is semitic, what Disraeli called Christendom, the intellectual colony of Arabia.  We are that.  It is less alien than the common law which is applied in our courts daily which we are so glad to have and which was discovered in the journeys of the Norman judges around the parts of England where they wanted to find the customs.  This is the work of Irish craftsmen which is in accordance with the European urban architecture of the 18th century.  If Pembroke Street, as a result of Bord na Móna's decision, goes today, does Fitzwilliam Square follow tomorrow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know nothing about these houses. I know nothing about the ability to preserve them.  I recognise that there are cases where this ability is gone because of past user and where we may have to be satisfied with the poor substitute of a facade which is serving merely as a link to preserve a vista. But in this case it is open to this public body to recognise the great public feeling there is about it and <Col N="415" /> of the irrevocable damage they may do if they proceed with the decision which is open to them to take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this motion and to ask the Minister or the directors of Bord na Móna to have second thoughts about this decision. There have been many conflicting views in recent years about planning, about preservation of the city, but there has been almost universal agreement that certain areas, certain buildings, should be preserved. It has been generally agreed that if any of these buildings goes, if any of these areas is interfered with, or if any excuse or reason is accepted for beginning to interfere with these buildings or these areas, then there is no hope for the preservation of the essential atmosphere and attractions of the city.</P>
      <P>Five or six years ago there was not a great deal of public opinion in support of the kind of preservation we are talking about, but gradually public opinion has supported preservation and this kind of planning.  In these circumstances, it is extraordinary that at this stage the Government and the State bodies should be involved in this kind of situation.  One would have expected that the Minister and the State body concerned would have been giving the lead in the preservation of these essential areas.  It is extraordinary, as I say, that Bord na Móna should be flouting public opinion, and I would appeal to them and to the Minister to reconsider this decision, which in itself is a very serious one, but which, more important, may be a precedent for many more similar decisions for reasons that, on the face of them, may appear to be good ones but certainly in the long run will do immense damage to the city of Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty in dealing with conservation issues is that their complexity is often misunderstood and legal and financial aspects are ignored.  I am not saving that that is necessarily Senator Robinson's approach, but I am simply pointing out that there is a tendency when controversy arises to seize on an emotional aspect and forget <Col N="416" /> other practical and important factors. Senator Alexis FitzGerald was honest enough to say that he did not know anything about the buildings concerned, the structural condition of them, or anything else.  It is a pity that others who make comments about them do not also make the same confession. I am perfectly satisfied that most of the people who talk so loudly about conservation simply read something in the evening papers and, as there is a band wagon to be climbed on, they then climb on the bandwagon.  Despite what Senator Robinson has said, she does not appear to have researched this too well because she does not appear to be aware that there were two Ministers involved, and that my predecessor on a very important day, the 13th March, 1973, signed the permission for office block development for Bord na Móna which, if put into operation, would cover a larger ratio of the site than the combination of the existing building and the extension granted.  Nobody at that time objected to this decision, not Dublin Corporation, not the Dublin Civic Group, not Senator Robinson, not anybody.  It was done by another Minister so it must have been all right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt Senator Robinson.  I would be grateful if she did not interrupt me.  I suppose one can regard this as welcome evidence of genuine public interest in the preservation of our architectural heritage which I hope has been developed as a result of our activities during European Architectural Heritage Year.  The rather cheap sneer which Senator Robinson directed towards me in regard to my function during Architectural Heritage Year because I did not do very much during European Architectural Heritage Year was not warranted.  I did what I could. I was chairman of the national committee. I had excellent people working with me on the national committee. I assisted in every way I could.  It appears that the people who have been talking now about preserving the architecture never did a damn thing in their lives, if Senator Robinson would excuse <Col N="417" /> me, to preserve anything like this.  But it is nice to be on the side of the angels. It is nice to be able to condemn when everybody else or a certain group of people are condemning, when the newspapers are full of letters usually written by the same people.  I do not know why the newspapers publish them but they do.  This seems to be the perfect answer to everything; do not do anything yourself but tell others how to do it and then you are a great conservationist.</P>
      <P>It is not possible for me in the time available to go into these issues as fully as I would like to but perhaps it is pertinent to ask what degree of conservation do we want for Georgian Dublin.  Do those who talk about the integrity and character of 18th century streets and squares ever feel that it is a bit inconsistent not to recognise the inevitability of change?  The horse and carriage have disappeared from those streets, so too have the social conditions which produced such a house for occupancy by a single wealthy family in a state made possible by the efforts of hosts of lowly-paid workers and servants.  I take it that nobody wants to return to that kind of conditions.  I certainly do not.  Some people have even suggested that it might be possible for somebody, not themselves, but somebody, some unnamed person, to buy those buildings and restore them as dwellings.  This would be lovely.  We go back 200 years and get servants for £1 a year who will do the usual work which they had to do, and this will be grand.  But I am afraid that when we ask that somebody should pay some of the money which they themselves have to do this type of work, conserving these things, then it is just not &ldquo;on&rdquo;.  They do not want to be involved in that kind of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It follows that if the function of the buildings has changed, they must be adopted to new uses unless we want to preserve them as museum pieces. Dublin Corporation have power under the 1963 Planning Act to acquire a building in order to preserve it as such a museum piece, but they have shown little desire to do that.  I think it only fair to point out that there are many other demands on their resources, and I doubt if there would <Col N="418" /> be general public support for any large-scale diversion of funds for such purposes when there is such pressing need to rehouse as many people as possible and to provide the services and facilities which are essential for a growing population.  Other uses for those buildings are possible but they all involve change of some kind.  This, I think, is very important: if we examine the Dublin development plan we find that while it is an objective to secure the preservation of buildings listed on List B paragraph 3 (11), accepts that:</P>
    <P>The extent of conservation which is likely to be practicable must be limited by the degree of public and private support for such a programme and must not absorb such a proportion of the resources of the planning authority as would be likely to prejudice other essential objectives.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3 (13) recognises:</P>
    <P>Works which affect the interior of the building or which do not materially affect its external appearance so as to render such appearance inconsistent with the character-of the structure or of neighbouring structures may be undertaken with planning permission.</P>
    <P>Obviously those who have spoken, many people indeed who have taken up radio time and newspaper space, are not aware of this.  They read the pieces they want to out of the Dublin report, but they do not want to read or they do not want to repeat those which do not appear to side with what they want to do.  Again it is relevant that, while certain changes are envisaged in the Planning Bill, as the law stands at present permission is not required for internal alterations within an existing building.  It is impossible therefore under existing law to require the preservation of &ldquo;the integrity of buildings&rdquo;, as some groups understand it.</P>
    <P>The Bord na Móna premises are used as offices and have for 30 years been occupied for that purpose.  On what basis can it be suggested with any realism that they should now revert to the original residential use?  As they are, they are not really suitable <Col N="419" /> to meet modern requirements for either use and have now reached the stage where structural and other defects necessitate costly and extensive repairs.  May I say that the Bord na Móna offices were examined by competent structural experts and were found to be entirely unsuitable for repair of any kind.  Indeed, I would like here&mdash;because it is the only opportunity I shall get&mdash;to refute a statement made on the radio that the facade of the building is being demolished completely.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  In addition to the planning conditions Bord na Móna have undertaken to retain the facade up to first-floor level.  In addition to that, the arrangements being made, which I will repeat in a minute, with your permission, Sir, show that an effort will be made to try to have the remainder of the facade restored as far as possible to what it looked like originally.</P>
    <P>Some credit must be given to Bord na Móna for the fact that they were anxious to preserve the existing buildings and that their original proposal was for an extension at the rear.  This would not have eliminated defects in the existing building and when further investigations disclosed the seriousness of their present condition, the board decided to apply for permission to construct a new building with a facade identical to that existing and reusing the present doors, fanlights, balconies, stone cornices, steps and so on.</P>
    <P>In refusing permission, the planning authority did so primarily because the buildings were on List B and were &ldquo;understood to be in good condition&rdquo;.  I am sure that if the planning authority had investigated this matter as fully as their development plan envisaged they would have had to modify their understanding.  The plan stated the intention of the planning authority to provide guidance for reconstruction, restoration and preservation on the basis of detailed studies. In particular these studies were to include (a) consideration of the quality and state of repair of buildings <Col N="420" /> and (b) estimates of the cost of repair and alteration likely to give a reasonably economic return.  So far as I know the planning authority have not carried out such studies, either generally or in relation to this particular case.  They have problems of pressure of work, but it meant that it was left to me on appeal to have this fully investigated, and this was done.</P>

      <P>The question of a public inquiry has been raised by Senator Robinson.  Indeed, it is rather peculiar that the inquiry was asked for by one of the bodies, the only body that objected.  A number of others have become very vocal since and, in fact, have written to me condemning my decision, but they did not think it worth their while to give any evidence or write in any evidence and, as a matter of fact, they could not care less until they found the bandwagon outside their door and then they climbed on to it.</P>
      <P>The other main reason for refusal cited by the corporation was that the integrity and originality of the buildings would be destroyed.  I think I have dealt with this point sufficiently to indicate the inconsistency of the corporation's stated reason with the legal position and the development plan.  Indeed, the corporation could have reversed my decision if they so wished, but they did not do so.</P>
      <P>Of the many bodies and individuals who are now raising criticism of my decision only one group made representations during the appeal, and I considered their views very carefully and in particular the claim that permission in this case will establish a precedent.  I appreciate that other developments may claim that a precedent has been created for demolition of houses on List B, but this is a misunderstanding of the position.  Each case must continue to be dealt with on its own merits.  This is entirely consistent with the terms of the development plan.</P>

      <Col N="421" /> When Bord na Móna made their appeal they expressed their concern to maintain the integrity of the streetscape and to minimise the new elements in the facade.  Much of the existing brickwork had already deteriorated and been refaced.  They were prepared to use the type of brick best suited for replacement of the existing brickwork and to erect sample test panels before reconstruction commenced.  They were even prepared to reproduce as far as possible the method of mortar jointing employed by 18th century bricklayers. Subsequently they undertook to retain the existing facade up to first floor level.  Accordingly, I consider that the board have demonstrated real concern to find the best solution possible.</P>
    <P>In my statement of the 18th November, I gave additional information regarding the reasons for my detion regarding the reasons for my decision. I do not propose to go into the matter further at this stage.  I freely admit that there can be a genuine difference of opinion as to how reconstruction with a replica of the existing facade may turn out, but I believe that the Bord na Móna proposal is likely to give the best result in the long run. To refuse permission might have created a change for a few years but could only result in further deterioration, especially if the buildings became vacant for any length of time.  Minor repairs would only put off the decision and the final result might be a much less acceptable solution.  If we want to see what happens with buildings that are left unoccupied, we have only got to go to Mountjoy Square which I pass <Col N="422" /> every day and which is a disgrace to any capital city and indeed no noise or no protest of any kind appears to have been made by the people who are shouting so much about this one.</P>
    <P>One of the dangers in speaking on a particular case, and in a necessarily limited way, is that one can be quoted out of context.  I want to make it clear that my decision in this particular case, taken on the facts of that case, is in no way inconsistent with my policy &mdash;and in respect of which I have given practical indication of my intent in favour of revitalising the central urban area.  I am shocked at the fact that the only Minister for Local Government in many, many years who had made any effort to make the centre of Dublin a living city again is the one that received the attack from people who as far as I can see do not appear to be prepared to do very much themselves or do anything about it.  Rundown areas in our cities must be improved, housing improvements being accompanied as far as possible by environmental improvements. But the solution in any particular case depends on the circumstances of that case.  Therefore I think that, having fully considered and having got expert advice on this particular case, the decision which I gave was the only reasonable decision which any reasonable man or woman could give and I am surprised that so much is being made of it by people who I thought would have a better understanding of a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday 11th December, 1975.</P>
