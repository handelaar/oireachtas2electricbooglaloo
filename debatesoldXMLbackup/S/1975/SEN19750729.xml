      <P>It is proposed to take No. 1 today.  I should mention at this stage that the Minister has an engagement in the evening.  I suggest that we break from 5.30 p.m. to 7 p.m. instead of from 5.30 p.m. to 6.45 p.m., in order to enable him to fulfil that engagement.  I suggest also that we might consider extending the Order of Business after the tea break. There are some other Bills that may come to us in the course of the day and it may be convenient to order them later.  I suggest we should look at it after the tea break if Senators are agreeable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable effect to be given to some of the Government proposals in the budget regarding the stimulation of employment. It is our aim by means of this legislation to provide for the creation of 10,000 jobs in the period to June, 1976, for workers who have lost their employment as a result of the current recession.  This is the basic objective of this premium employment programme.  In our past efforts to create employment Ireland has relied exclusively on grants for capital expenditure, and though this has worked by and large reasonably there has been the recent report of the OECD on Manpower Policy in Ireland to suggest that perhaps other methods might be more appropriate for our present situation.  That report of the OECD questioned the appropriateness of this policy, that is of a policy that had relied on support for capital expenditure and argued that a:</P>
      <P>...scheme of employment premiums might, for a given injection of funds, lead to a greater incentive to increase employment.</P>
      <P>Therefore, this premium employment programme receives support from that quarter and, of course, has been attempted by other countries facing the effects of the recession such as we are having at present.  This therefore is the first active intervention, through wage subsidisation, in the area of direct job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Bill was in the Dáil the Government have given further consideration to the employment areas at which the Bill was directed.  We have decided to include agriculture, including horticulture, within its scope.  I am submitting appropriate amendments to the Bill to achieve this.  Agriculture is a major industry and if its inclusion in the Bill can lead to the creation of employment in that area over this period of increased unemployment, then the benefits to our economy should assist other sectors in the recovery process.  We are, of course, in relatively uncharted territory in terms of what may be possible under such a programme.  I propose to monitor <Col N="981" /> very closely the progress made in this area and make use of this review on how it progresses.</P>
    <P>As regards manufacturing industry, it is proposed under the programme that (i) Premiums will be payable in respect of full-time employment of persons who (a) were in receipt of unemployment benefit at any time after 20th June, 1974; and were (b) continuously on the live register for not less than the four weeks immediately preceding their first employment under this programme; or (c) were attending a training course under the National Training Authority full-time immediately preceding their first employment under this programme or (d) were employed by the same employer on a short-time arrangement in the PAYE week beginning on 15th June, 1975.  (ii) Additional employees recruited on a part-time or short-time basis will not be regarded as eligible for the purpose of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of agriculture in the Bill will, of course, entail some administrative differences between the industrial and agricultural sectors. Nevertheless, broadly similar conditions as to qualification for payment of the premium will apply.  However, in the case of agriculture, I have to ensure that a minimum period of employment in agriculture will ensue. The minimum period proposed is nine months from the commencement of the additional employment.  The purpose of this period is to overcome the seasonality element normally present in agricultural and horticultural employment.</P>
    <P>The programme will be administered through the National Manpower Service of my Department and the staff of that service, which has a national network reaching into every county throughout the State, are in contact with employers on the operation of the programme.  Preliminary information has been made available to interested employers.  Over 400 inquiries have been received at departmental level though this does not include contacts made at local level. As might be expected, the largest volume of inquiries so far received <Col N="982" /> came from the textile sector.  We feel that, in this industry in particular, the scheme can be a significant factor in stimulating the re-employment of workers who have been laid off during the present recession.  Inquiries have also been received from employers in such sectors as plastics, footwear and engineering.</P>
    <P>The amounts of the premiums will be those announced in the budget statement of the 26th June, 1975, that is, £12 per week per eligible employee from 29th June, 1975, until 27th March, 1976, and thereafter £6 per week per eligible employee until the termination of the scheme on 26th June, 1976.  There will be no ceiling on the funds available for the employment programme.  The target I am working towards is the return of 10,000 people to full-time employment.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the section 3 of the Bill, insofar as manufacturing industry is concerned, is to enable a decision to be made on the industries and persons to whom the programme will apply.  Section 4 which is the heart of the Bill, gives me power to pay premiums to eligible employers. Section 5 would give power to require an employer applying for payment under the scheme to provide information both as regards the industry carried on by him and an employee or class of employee in order to enable me to determine whether the scheme applies or not.  It would also enable me to provide forms for the purpose and generally to provide for the effective administration of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Under Section 6 I have power to appoint inspectors who would generally have similar powers to those appointed under the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973.  Section 7 contains the usual provisions relating to prosecutions.  Section 8 is a standard provision covering expenses.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that the Bill and its provisions are aimed at getting people back to work, now out of work, who but for the occurrence and provisions of this Bill would remain unemployed longer.  It is not designed to subsidise the employment of those who would be employed anyway.  It is <Col N="983" /> designed to help that part of employment which has been most hit during the current recession, that is, manufacturing industry, in the main, and because of the importance of the agricultural industry and the possibility that useful, productive work might be obtained for people in that industry over the coming months I have decided, with my colleagues in Government, to extend the benefits of the scheme to agriculture, given the provisions that those who would qualify must work for the nine-month period.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Bill emanating from the Government that makes any attempt to deal with the massive unemployment problem at present must be given a chance.  That is a <i>sine qua non</i>.  We agree with the principle of the Bill.  Any of my criticisms directed towards it will be directed firstly at its inadequacies; secondly, the fact that it has taken such a length of time to make some move in this direction, when we have been living for six months with an unemployment rate in the region of 100,000 people. So far as we have some action being taken now towards dealing with this problem the Bill is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I do not think this Bill will stimulate the creation of 10,000 new jobs in the period of the next 12 months.  The Bill is too inadequate to do so.  I would like to point out a number of ways in which this type of inadequacy is reflected in the Bill itself and, in my view, will inhibit and restrict the Minister in achieving the objective he has set himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all&mdash;and we will be putting down an amendment on this&mdash;the Bill does not deal with employment in the service industries.  Straight away there is a major omission because it is in the service industries such as transportation or the hotel industry, to mention but two big employers, where I feel immediate stimulation could be given and immediate employment provided, particularly at this time of the year. The starting date is June.  In the interests of stimulating immediate <Col N="984" /> employment during the summer and autumn months, from the 29th June onwards, the service industry would appear to be an obvious target for this type of premium grant help.  I should like to hear from the Minister on that point.  Indeed my view is reinforced by the fact that the Minister, rightly so, is introducing an amendment to include the agricultural sector.  If the agricultural sector is being included along with manufacturing industries, surely it highlights the omission of the service industries.  There is no mention of why this obvious omission occurred. It would appear to my mind, unless there is some better answer, that the whole range of service industries would offer, in the summer and autumn months, an obvious area for stimulating further employment.</P>
    <P>We propose to put down an amendment so that the enabling part of the Bill will allow employment premium grants or payments to be made, not alone in respect of manufacturing industries, but other economic activities as well.</P>
    <P>The second restriction in the Bill which will prevent the stimulation of 10,000 jobs is an old one with which we and indeed anybody in any parliament is familiar; that is, the Minister has tied himself, under section 3, to determine industries or activities which would qualify for premium payment with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  If ever there was a way to spoil a scheme of this kind, that has the seeds of some imagination in it, to frustrate its development and spoil it <i>ab initio</i>, there is provision here in section 3, by tying the Minister's hands behind his back, in regard to determining the industries or activities in specified industries to which the scheme applies, and the persons or classes of persons to whom it applies.</P>
    <P>With all respect that makes nonsense of what the Minister says in page four of his speech, as handed to us, and I quote:</P>
    <P>There will be no ceiling on the funds available for PEP.  The target I am working towards is the return of 10,000 people to full-time employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> There is a very real ceiling written in here, by providing for the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister and this House is very well aware that if one wants to get an imaginative scheme going quickly&mdash;it has to be got going quickly as it is for a year's duration only; with the high unemployment rate there is the need for speed to get it off the ground quickly; applications are already in, as the Minister has said himself&mdash;there is no need to elaborate on the need and the one way to inhibit, or corral the development of proper ways and means of dealing with that need is to provide that the Minister cannot move in any direction in the way of a flexible determination on his part of the industries, activities in specified industries or the persons or class of person to whom the payments are to be made if he can do so only with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  That is a built-in ceiling already written in to section 3.  In my view, it will be far more effective in restricting the scheme and rendering it inadequate than any ceiling that might be written into the scheme itself. Ceilings can always be removed.</P>
    <P>I am glad that no ceiling has been written in but I believe that a far more effective ceiling has been introduced, as it were, by the back door, in providing for the consent of the Minister for Finance in the administration of the scheme under section 3.  It is the same sort of restrictive thinking that is involved in not including the service side of industry in the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <P>Similarly&mdash;and again it is symptomatic of the inadequate approach to what could be an imaginative way of dealing with a very serious problem&mdash; there is restriction in section 4.  Section 4 deals with the payment to employers of employment premiums. The Minister has stated that he proposes that these premiums should be at the rate of £12 per week until the 27th March and, thereafter, at £6 per week per eligible employee.  That may be attractive up to a certain level of employee.  A far more flexible scheme could be introduced under section 4, subsection (1), by providing that the payments should be regarded as a percentage of the wage rate current <Col N="986" /> in the particular industry to which the scheme relates.  This would appear to be the logical and more flexible way of approaching it, rather than have a hard and fast grant payment that may be adequate in the case of badly or lower paid employees but is certainly not relevant in the case of wage rates which run, as they do now, at a level far ahead of £12 per week. I am thinking in terms of basic wage rates around £50 per week.  In that sort of situation, say £40 per week, surely the more flexible approach would have been that the Minister should determine what payment should apply as a percentage of the wage rate related to the industry and the employment to which the Minister is giving help.  It is part of the lack of flexibility which I see in the scheme, combined with the necessity to obtain the consent of the Minister for Finance, that will lead to this being a restrictive, inadequate scheme rather than an imaginative, immediate and urgent scheme which we want it to be.</P>
    <P>Similarly, with regard to fixing the date, here there is an inbuilt restriction. Under section 2, subsection (3), the scheme shall be deemed to come into operation on the 29th June, 1975. There is no flexibility there to enable the Minister to deal with serious unemployment situations that have arisen since the 29th June and which will arise undoubtedly in the coming months of autumn and winter.</P>
    <P>The Minister is immobilised within the straitjacket of what the unemployment position was on the 29th June.  Should the Minister immobilise himself in this manner? Would it not be a far more sensible approach to ensure that if a later date would appear to the Minister to be the date which should be specified in respect of a particular industry, surely the Minister should have that power in the Bill without inhibiting himself by relating the unemployment to the level that obtained on the 29th June this year.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go through the numerous cases where this is unjust. There is the case of the employer who tries to ensure employment right <Col N="987" /> through to 29th June and who, coming into autumn, may face problems. What is his position?  He did have a substantial labour force, probably due to his own efforts, enterprise and resolution in keeping going despite losses and troubles.  He is finally forced to the wall now or sometime later in autumn or winter. What will be his position?  There is the other extreme of the man who took the easy way out at an earlier stage. He did not fight with any resolution against the difficulties and trials of time.  Instead he packed it up and closed his factory.  That man is in a position, when he was so closed on the 29th June, to reap some benefit, benefit which, under this scheme as it stands now, deprives the hard-working <i>entrepreneur</i> who kept going through the trials and tribulations and was functioning on the 29th June, if with difficulty.  He may find that he must close now, or some time later, and is omitted from the scheme.</P>
    <P>In all seriousness the Minister could, if he got the consent of the Minister for Finance, have written in there a provision for a later date as may be determined by the Minister in respect of certain industries.  We propose to put down an amendment of that kind.  No Department is better fitted to deal with that problem than the Department of Labour, by reason of the expertise available to them, both in the Department, in AnCO and in the various machinery that has been developed by the Department in recent years.  I would have the utmost confidence in giving that Department and the Minister for Labour the widest possible flexibility to deal with what is an emergency.</P>
    <P>The Minister's optimistic target&mdash; the stimulation of 10,000 jobs over the next 12 months&mdash;which I would like to see achieved, is being severely inhibited and restricted <i>ab initio</i> by reason of the matters I have mentioned: restricting the Minister for Labour to a certain date, 29th June; restricting him to manufacturing industries, although this has now been extended to include agricultural industries but not including the major <Col N="988" /> area of service industries; confining the Minister to the £12 a week ceiling for nine months and thereafter to £6 per week, and the provision requiring the Minister for Finance to consent to his determination in regard to the details of the scheme.  That sort of narrow, straitjacket thinking will be the death-knell of this potentially good scheme.  I would suggest to the Minister&mdash;we will put down amendments to help him&mdash;that he stand up and fight this matter because this is the most crucial social and economic problem, practically at catastrophe stage now, that has ever faced our economy.  It cannot be approached in a niggling manner.  Rather, it must be approached in an imaginative manner.</P>
    <P>My main criticism of this Bill is firstly it is unimaginative, inadequate and unduly restrictive and secondly, &mdash;which has been illustrated today in the attitude of the Employer-Labour Conference&mdash;is too late.  The Minister seemingly was in a position to do something in April, but allowed negotiations to proceed on the whole pay settlement area without any comment.  The horse of inflation is galloping.  The stable door is now being sought to be closed.  My real criticism is that, along with this measure being too late, it is not even attempting to deal with the enormity of the problem facing us.  I would have preferred far more dramatic legislation giving the Minister sweeping powers.  And sweeping powers are needed in this day and age to deal with this problem in our society.  The Minister should not be circumscribed in this matter by the heavy hand of the Minister and the Department of Finance.  I am saying this to help the Minister.  I hope that the Minister, even if he is circumscribed in the Bill, will for the sake of unemployed people and our economy stand up to the Minister for Finance and insist that the appropriate finances are made available to achieve the target he seeks of 10,000 more people being encouraged into employment.</P>
    <P>The Bill as it stands shows very little evidence of that.  Rather it shows every evidence of being too little, too <Col N="989" /> niggardly, too inadequate and bears the heavy hand of the Department of Finance throughout.  We will look at the Bill on that basis and seek to improve it by way of amendment.  I can assure the House and the Minister that the amendments we will put down will be amendments to give the Minister more power and greater authority to deal with this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this provision by the Minister for Labour to improve the unemployment situation. I do not agree that this measure is too late.  It is difficult now to see what will be its effect eventually.  It is the sort of measure one would not have expected a responsible Minister to introduce until he felt the gravity of the situation warranted new thinking and a new approach.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister's approach is very commendable and imaginative. As I say it is very hard to say what the eventual result of the scheme will be.  It is hard to judge the mood of the people involved in industry, to know in how many instances just £12 a week will mean the difference between retaining a job and losing it.  I would suspect in manufacturing industry probably not all that many.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the Bill for the industries where the measure can give effective relief, I would nevertheless say to employers and to industry to beware of the danger of employing more people than are required to do the particular job that is to be done. If you put 11 men on the shop floor where ten men should do the job, you are putting the job of the other ten at risk by employing the eleventh man.  Not only do you create a situation for the time being where there is less work per man to be done but you create a precedent where people learn to move at a slower rate and in the long run when things take the other turn, as they will, we shall end up being less competitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I know there are a number of industries in the country, perhaps more than might appear obvious where even £12 a week comes to a sizeable figure and an industry could fall short by £50 a week to make ends <Col N="990" /> meet; that £50 could be the last straw and it could mean the breaking point. In addition, it will give encouragement to the smaller industries where the weekly wage is a big percentage of the turnover.  They will come to realise that the Government are concerned about their position and have taken steps to help not only the employment situation but the manufacturer and the employer.  I feel sure that in many instances the scheme will be welcomed by employers, will save jobs and help to get many industries over the present recession.</P>
    <P>At the present time the Department of Labour are doing a good job.  In the past couple of years I have been very impressed by the sort of organisation that has developed, the sort of aids to employers, particularly in the West of Ireland, where we have to many new people in industry, where we lack the tradition and skills that are so important and where we have the Manpower Service and the facilities that AnCO provide.  It is entirely new, and some people have the experience of starting up industries and working in manufacturing industries for five years.  There is a tremendous improvement in the services that are available through the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>It is very heartening to know the Manpower Service is there at the end of the line and can be contacted. They are developing very fast the expertise required to help industrialists in difficulties.  They provide the right people for the right jobs and the contacts and also show concern, for instance, when individuals in the staff they ring up, industrialists, say &ldquo;We have two or three men qualified. They are very good and we would like to know could you fit them in?&rdquo;  They have the knowledge of where jobs might be available, the knowledge that good men are available, and concern for the men they have trained.  Other measures the Department of Labour could very well take are to intensify the efforts of AnCO.  There is nothing as bad at a time like this as to sit back and say: &ldquo;We cannot sell what we have already produced; what is the point in <Col N="991" /> training people?&rdquo;  If we will just sit tight and wait until this blows over, when times improve we may find that we have not sufficient trained staff. This has happened before and I feel sure it will happen again.</P>
    <P>This employment premium is very good, but it is much more important to take a man into training now and have him in a position to take up the job when the time comes.  I have seen fellows going off for courses out of factories and workshops when the industry could not afford to let them go, when in fact more work needed to be done than there were semiskilled people to do it.  I would say now is the time to avail of the lull to prepare ourselves for the new situation which we feel certain will come in two or three years' time.  If there is a recession in industry, there must be men who can train, and certainly there are young people in industries who can take training.  Finances may be tight and scarce, but I would ask the Minister for Labour to make every effort, if it goes to the setting up of emergency training centres, temporary places where men could be trained now.  This is very relevant to what is under discussion, and I am sure the Minister has this in mind as well.</P>
    <P>I am very glad the Minister decided to extend this to the agricultural industry, because I feel, from my own experience, that agriculture could avail of this more quickly than some of the manufacturing industries.  I expect to see a good result from this. In the past we had a remission of rates to the extent of £17 where a farmer had an employee.  In the most recent past this became very small as time went on.  Representatives of farmers were never slow to point out that some years ago even the £17, small and all as it might appear to be, was a contributing factor in the employment of many people.  This new premium will encourage farmers.  This is an industry where we need not be afraid to have work done to have goods produced.</P>
    <P>There is so much to be done in the reclamation of land, the provision of <Col N="992" /> better farmyard facilities, that I am absolutely confident that many farmers who just could not see their way to pay the full amount of a man's weekly wages will avail of this premium to take men into employment.  They will improve land and buildings.  They will turn out more produce and, as a result, there will be more jobs in industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been very wise to extend this to the agricultural industry, which I believe will above all industries respond to this as they have always responded in the past to any programme of economic expansion. One always found that the agricultural industry could measure up to whatever targets of expansion were set for it.  I am glad that the Minister has seen fit to add this incentive.  No more than in industry, things have not been good in agriculture for the past couple of years, but in any industry when things are at their worst, we should turn the recession to whatever advantage we can and prepare for the day when things will be better.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's Bill as an effort to get us out of the present recession, to improve the position of industry and agriculture, and I hope it gets from industry the response it deserves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Lenihan has already said, we on this side of the House welcome this Bill.  We are particularly glad that the Minister has decided to change it slightly from its somewhat unsatisfactory form, so that now it is to include agriculture.  In doing this, he has reacted to the urging of the Fianna Fáil Party in the other House.  The fact that he now comes in at the last minute in order to amend the Bill&mdash;we have not yet seen the amendments&mdash;shows how outrageous was the procedure in which the Government forced this Bill through the other House.  To have allowed a Bill of this importance and complexity two hours for all stages was a scandalous performance.  It is impossible to discuss this Bill without&mdash;I do not intend to speak at length on the subject&mdash;a passing reference to the manner in which it has reached the House.</P>

      <P>Senator Yeats is well aware that it is not in <Col N="993" /> order to refer to the procedures of the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, I think it is in order to refer to the Government's handling of legislation. I do not intend to go into any great detail, but only two hours were allowed for discussion.  I am aware that extra time was allowed but the offer was not acceptable because it was at the expense of other Bills which, in turn, had two hours. However, I am pleased the Minister listened to the urgings of the Opposition in the other House and has decided that this time their pleadings should be acceded to.</P>
      <P>We welcome the Bill, although it is somewhat doubtful how effective it will be.  The Minister is excessively optimistic when he suggests in his opening speech that his aim is to stimulate the creation of 10,000 jobs in the period up to June, 1976, for workers who have lost their employment as a result of the current recession.  It is unlikely that the Bill will be that successful.  It will have beneficial effects and it is welcome from that point of view.  But the success of schemes such as this in Germany and other countries has not been such as to suggest that this type of legislation on the whole is very effective.  It is well worth while trying and one commends the Minister and the Government for their endeavour, but one must not be over-optimistic about its effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One is particularly glad, due to the introduction of this legislation, that the Government at last realise the seriousness of the unemployment situation.  While there are over 100,000 unemployed, this has been the case every week since last January. There is nothing new about the situation.  Six months have elapsed with the unemployment figure at this level.  It was obvious for a considerable time prior to January that this would be the unemployment figure, with the way things were going.  The Government had plenty of time to introduce this kind of legislation.  It is only now, at this very late stage, <Col N="994" /> that they have done something about it.  Although it is a late recognition of the facts of the economy, we are glad they have seen the light.</P>
    <P>The difficulty has been that, while accepting, as they had to, that unemployment was running very high, they have at the same time tried to salvage their position somewhat by suggesting that, while it might be high here, it was not that bad; that other countries in the EEC were in an even worse position.  The fact is, as the Government are well aware, we have by far the highest rate of unemployment of any EEC country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister doubts this.  I will put it this way: it does not cover the situation to take the Irish live register and say it has gone up by 46 per cent. as it has in round figures, since last year.  Unlike the live register in any other country, we have a considerable number of people who are on unemployment assistance, among them large numbers of small farmers who are not unemployed in the normal sense of the word.  Since this time last year, the real figure for unemployment is up by almost 90 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the position of our colleagues in the EEC, we find that this compares with a figure of 80 per cent for Belgium; 61 per cent for Great Britain; 41 per cent for Northern Ireland; 89 per cent for France&mdash; about the same as us although the actual number unemployed is far lower in relation to the population&mdash; 60 per cent for Italy; and 60 per cent for Holland.  In the case of West Germany and Denmark, the percentage increase since last year is considerably greater than ours, although the actual numbers are much lower. Not only have we the highest number <Col N="995" /> unemployed in relation to our population&mdash;the Minister is correct in saying that unfortunately it is a normal situation in this country&mdash;but we also have very nearly the highest percentage increase since this time last year.</P>

The state of affairs in Britain is such that we would not match them in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from a newspaper of two days ago and I cannot be much more up-to-date than that.  It would appear, in the light of the figure which Senator Halligan mentions, that probably the British percentage increase is 80 per cent, whereas with us it is nearer 90 per cent.  I shall refer to the British figure later because it bodes ill for what is likely to happen in our case in the coming months.  This is an important factor in relation to certain sections in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some ways this Bill is unsatisfactory. It is extraordinarily vague. There is nothing in it to suggest who will receive these premiums, how much they will be, or what industries will benefit.  It gives the Minister power, at his complete discretion, to fix the rates of premium.  The House has been told in the recent budget statement, and again by the Minister today, that initially the figure will be £12 and during the last three months <Col N="996" /> it will be reduced to £6, but this is not contained in the Bill.  The Minister can decide what workers will or will not qualify.  That information is not contained in the Bill, except that the Minister has the complete power to decide these matters; not even by order or regulation but by an administrative decision which need not be referred back to the Oireachtas.  He can decide what employers will qualify.  Up to now he has limited himself to manufacturing industry. He has now said he is going to extend this, but nonetheless within the limitations that, in manufacturing industry, on the one hand, and agriculture, on the other, he can pick out individual employers anyway he likes and say they qualify or they do not qualify.  Even where he has picked out groups of workers, groups of employers, industries and so on, he can vary his decisions on these heads in individual cases.  In effect, the Minister can spend public money as he pleases without any element of legislative control.</P>
    <P>As Senator Lenihan has already said, we would be very glad to give the Minister greater powers if he had taken greater powers than these to deal to a greater extent with the massive unemployment with which we are faced than is proposed in this relatively limited field.  However, any such powers ought to be set out in the Bill and therefore be subject to legislative control.</P>
    <P>We have heard today from the Minister some very brief details of how these proposals will work.  Until today we had to rely on a handout from the Government Information Services. One wonders why this handout was not circulated to Members of the Oireachtas.  Apparently anybody else in the country can get it but not the people who are supposed to be enacting this legislation.  This handout, issued on 26th June, by the Government Information Services begins rather curiously by saying &ldquo;Subject to Dáil approval the following provisions will apply&rdquo;.  Whatever about the Seanad, the Dáil have never been asked to approve any of this because it is not in the Bill.  Neither the <Col N="997" /> Seanad nor the Dáil have any power of approval of the details of a scheme which are sent around the country in this form by the Government Information Services.</P>
    <P>The only information we have about these measures is when they will start and when they will end but we have no information about the intervening 12 months.  Therefore we have to assume the statement from the GIS is correct, together with what the Minister has told us today.  It is on this basis that we have to consider the Bill and on that basis one must accept that the scheme is disappointing. There are varied respects in which the proposed scheme is entirely unsatisfactory.  Because of these deficiencies it will not achieve anywhere near the effect in relieving unemployment that it should.</P>
    <P>First of all&mdash;and this has been referred to by Senator Lenihan&mdash;the date fixed in the scheme relating to the level of the work force is June 29th, 1975.  This is almost making a lottery out of this whole affair.  A factory employing, say, 200 people on June 29th, will be paid premiums only in respect of workers taken on beyond the figure of 200.  A factory that closes down in July, September or November of 1975 or anytime next winter cannot qualify for the premiums unless at some stage it passes the level of its work force on June 29th.  This deals, in other words, with past history only, not with the future. It does not deal with the true life situation of increasing redundancies, increasing unemployment which, for various reasons, is almost certain to hit us during the coming winter.</P>
    <P>Even if it is the past history, it is very much a case of hit or miss.  Take the case of a factory that closed in May and happens to re-open briefly towards the end of June; if it was employing its normal complement on June 29th and then after a month or so closes down again, perhaps in July, it does not qualify.  It gets no benefit in the Bill.  What is more important, its workers get no benefit from the Bill.  The assumption all through the scheme is that June 29th, not merely <Col N="998" /> in the country as a whole but in relation to each individual industry, is the bottom of the trough, that there will be no cuts in the work force after that date.  There is no evidence that this is the position.  Unfortunately, there is a great deal of evidence to the contrary.</P>
    <P>Last month the Confederation of Irish Industry&mdash;the people who are very much affected by the operation of this scheme&mdash;issued a bulletin called <i>Economic Trends</i> in which they suggested that the prospects for the rest of this year are that production and employment will continue to decline. They said that demand is not expected to pick up and home sales will decline still further; that there is some hope that exports will show some slight increase but that even this measured optimism must be tempered by the deflationary effect of the proposed British counter-inflation measures which were announced recently.  In the centre pages of this document, the CII produced four extremely gloomy graphs.  The first is of production trends, and in each case these graphs are the result of the expectations expressed by the various industries taking part in the survey. Where the figures are available they show the actual result as opposed to the results of the surveys, and in each case the actual results were shown over past months to have matched very closely the survey expectations of the industries concerned.  Production trends are expected to continue to decline, a straight graph down the page.  It is the same with employment trends and export trends.  This survey, of course, was made before the announcement of heavy deflation by our neighbour, Great Britain, so that the actual figure there will probably be even worse than it is expected to be. We know that manufacturing exports so far this year have been well below last year in volume.  The expected trend for home sales is down, and they point out that here there are particular problems because the final 4 per cent average tariff against British imports was removed on July 1st, and then next winter the import prices of the old EEC and other non-British <Col N="999" /> products will fall by 10 per cent on January 1st next.</P>
    <P>The indications are that things will not get better in the employment field but in autumn and winter they are likely to get worse.  Indeed, the CIF Newsletter of 15th July said:</P>
    <P>It is evident that Irish industry is facing exceptionally difficult trading conditions.  These are likely to get worse at the end of 1975.</P>
    <P>Under these conditions it is very difficult to understand why the base stage, if one can use the term, of June 20th has been fixed in this Bill. It simply means that any deterioration&mdash;and a deterioration is almost certain to take place&mdash;this autumn and winter means that the industries concerned would not qualify for these premiums, except in the restricted cases where they can show an actual increase of employment over June 20th last.</P>
    <P>At this stage I might mention, as Senator Lenihan already has, that apart altogether from manufacturing industries and agriculture, which are not being brought in by the Minister, there is very serious unemployment also in service industries, particularly of course those related to tourism. There is also very severe unemployment&mdash;perhaps more severe than in any other single sector&mdash;in the building industry.  One can see obviously that there are practical difficulties in covering these, but now that the Minister has decided to cover agriculture the practical difficulties of covering these other sectors would appear to be no greater than those for agriculture.</P>
    <P>In the present emergency the Minister should face the risk that possibly some public money might go astray.  If it is not possible to frame a cast-iron scheme which would cover every possible eventuality, he should certainly leave himself at least scope for covering any aspect of the economy.  I have not seen his amendments so I do not know what form they will take.  I hope they will take the form not merely of adding agriculture to the existing provisions of <Col N="1000" /> the Bill relating to manufacturing industry but that he will leave himself in a position whereby he can extend this scheme to any section of the economy.  It does not commit him to doing so, but he should give himself the power.  He would be very unwise to limit himself in any way in this respect.  We will certainly try to draft amendments for the Committee Stage which will secure this result.</P>
    <P>I doubt if the cost will be very great, particularly in the light of the obvious saving of those who come off the register.  Every man and woman off the unemployment register saves the State money.  The actual total cost of this to the State will probably be small.  The basic point is that this is intended to deal with the very serious evil of massive unemployment.  The Minister should if necessary even take risks in order to ensure that no section of the economy that might otherwise be covered fails to be covered.</P>
    <P>Another point in this Bill which is difficult to understand is the provision that no worker should be entitled to be covered by a premium unless he has been four weeks on the register as a general rule.  This is not in the Bill but it has been stated in the various announcements made about the form this scheme will take.  This is difficult to understand.  Take the position, for example, of a man perhaps in some provincial town who loses his job on a Friday in one local industry and another industry, perhaps the only other one there may be, offers him a job starting the following Monday. Normally he would be delighted to take it, but under present circumstances with the £12 premium payable the other industry could not afford to take him.  That industry would, if necessary, go 20 miles away to take on a man who had been four weeks on the register.  It is difficult to understand what the purpose of this is, particularly in view of the fact that the first few days, the first week or so, of unemployment is always the most traumatic. One would have thought that there would be a very good case to be made on that ground alone for allowing a man to be taken off the register at once rather than make him wait four weeks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> As I have already said, it is difficult to understand why the actual figures of £12 and £6 are not mentioned in the Bill.  One wonders if the Minister intends perhaps to vary the figures? Does he intend to give himself that power?  If he does, then perhaps he can put up a case for that.  But if he intends to stick rigidly to the £12 and £6 which have already been announced&mdash; £12 up to March 31st next and £6 thereafter&mdash;it is very difficult to understand why he cannot put these in the Bill.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, one wonders why it is intended to have fixed figures of this kind at all.  The problem with the fixed £12 and £6 is that in the case of low-paid workers particularly &mdash;in the case of women working in textile industries for example&mdash;the £12 is obviously a very considerable incentive for an industry to take in workers.  On the other hand, in the case of skilled workers, who might be earning £45, £50 or more a week, the £12 is of relatively minor importance and would only have a marginal effect in encouraging an industry to take in a worker.  Here again one feels that the Minister should allow himself more flexibility.  We propose to put down an amendment to try to devise some system whereby the Minister would have the power to fix a percentage of the wage rather than an outright figure of £12 or £6.  As things stand it seems that certain industries may well benefit considerably from this, but others could benefit very little.</P>
    <P>There is also the point that from the point of view of the workers, those who are on the unemployment register, who when at work earn a low wage&mdash;perhaps in a textile industry or something of that kind&mdash;under the pay-related scheme would come out relatively well and in some cases not far off 100 per cent of their former wage, whereas skilled workers on a much higher wage get a smaller proportion of their wage.  To this extent skilled workers suffer still more when unemployed.</P>
    <P>There is a strange provision in section 4 that I find difficult to understand. <Col N="1002" /> It is subsection (3) of section 4 which states that:</P>
    <P>... the Scheme may provide for the reduction or non-payment of an employment premium in a case where the Minister is satisfied that the employer concerned is in receipt of, or has received, moneys by way of a grant or loan from any body established by statute for the purpose of promoting, encouraging or assisting employment or industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, has discretion here but nonetheless he is given the power, in effect, to withhold premiums from industries which have benefited either from the IDA or even, which is still more extraordinary, from Fóir Teoranta.  I am not saying that he proposes to do this but he is giving himself the power and one wonders what the purpose of it is. I can hardly believe that he proposes to eliminate industries benefiting from Fóir Teoranta because obviously one might forget about the Bill in that case.  It appears from some remarks he has made in the course of the passage of this Bill through the other House that he proposes to eliminate in some cases the payment of premiums where money is still being paid by the IDA.  I find it difficult to understand the purpose of this.  After all, we are interested in this scheme in providing employment.  I cannot see that the niceties of the Department of Finance relating to public money being spent in industry should affect this in any way.  I would be glad to have some kind of an explanation of the meaning of this part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>However, in relation to the points of the Bill which, as I suggested, are less than satisfactory, if the Minister is prepared to make changes in these, the scheme could well have a real chance of cutting, to some extent at least, the number of jobless in the country.  As it stands, with the Minister's new amendment, we can certainly support it as a relatively small step forward, but one must accept that it is no substitute for the really radical and energetic steps that the Government ought to be taking.</P>

      <P>Paradoxically, this might be one of the few Government measures that will actually not cost the Exchequer any money at all in its implementation.  In fact, the more successful it becomes, the less costly it will become.  It seems to me that a proper cost-benefit analysis of this scheme would indicate a great number of hidden savings to the Exchequer when the people are given the benefit of the employment premium, taken off the unemployment register and put back into productive employment. This is one of the reasons why the measure has obvious attractions for the man in the street, who sees it as a very commonsense way of employing State funds.  Apart from the immediate and obvious savings in the State's share of social welfare payments, there is of course, the recoupment of some part of the premium through VAT and also in some instances, there will be recoupment through PAYE.</P>
      <P>If one were to approach this Bill in a truly global fashion, from the point of view of looking at both the income and the expenditure side of the Exchequer, I do not think that the strictures of Senator Lenihan should be taken too seriously into account.  I must say, in passing, that the Senator in constantly inveighing against Ministers for Finance, tempts me to encourage him to do a Crossman act and to publish what will obviously be very intriguing diaries indeed.  He is constantly complaining about Ministers for Finance and their heavy hand.  As Minister he worked with three very intriguing Ministers for Finance, to wit, Deputies Lynch, Haughey and Colley.  His diaries would make a pretty marvellous <i>exposé</i> indeed.  Perhaps he might offer them by way of an academic, as well as a political contribution, to the history of our time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much welcome the shift in emphasis evident in this Bill, away from the subsidisation of capital and towards the subsidisation of labour.  I am glad the Minister has quoted from the special OECD Report which argued that a scheme of employment premiums might, if given an injection <Col N="1004" /> of funds, lead to a greater incentive to increase employment than the subsidisation of capital.</P>
    <P>It may be that as one of the beneficial side effects of the current crisis we will, increasingly in the future, question the subsidisation of capital when examined against the loss in the labour force.  For example, in a society in which there is an excess labour supply relative to capital, is it economic sense to employ labour saving devices, generally imported capital expenditure, while men are on the unemployment queue?  What really is the economic sense of having JCB's cavorting around, engaged in local employment work, when men who could be employed on direct employment schemes are probably holding up the walls of villages and town squares and the gable ends of walls in our cities.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of this factor practically daily when driving here because I pass a local authority scheme which appears like something almost out of an American war movie, given the amount of plant and equipment in use.  The amount of men employed on this project must be no more than ten or 20.  But one could visualise that same type of scheme actually giving employment to 100 to 150 men using the more traditional means.  Clearly the present method of doing the job is criminally wasteful of the labour force and this situation is repeated all over the country today. In the midst of apparent efficiency we have waste of humans.</P>
    <P>It is true that during the 1950's and the 1960's there was a great vogue in terms of efficiency in the form of cutting back on the labour force and of employing more labour-efficient means of production.  But, we are now beginning to pay the penalty for some of these short-sighted and in some cases ill thought out investment plans.  There was a great vogue towards bigness, towards cutting down in terms of the employment content prevalent in management philosophy. One measured the efficiency of management practically by the number of men and women that it could make redundant and that it could shed.  If <Col N="1005" /> a company could produce the same output with 1,500 rather than 5,000 men, it was held to be efficient and effective and its management were lauded to the sky.  We are now paying some of the penalties for this.  There is no less spectacular example than the Jumbo jets, in which the entire aircraft industry invested so heavily throughout the world.  This is now a very questionable investment project indeed and can be seen as part of the malaise of bigness and labour eliminating devices that has affected managerial science and attitudes throughout the last two decades.  The emphasis of managerial thinking was on capital at the expense of labour. For that reason, I strongly underline and endorse the emphasis given to the OECD comment on manpower policy in Ireland by the Minister in that it helps partially to redress the balance.</P>
    <P>It seems that a lesson for the third world and for developing nations has been that they should invest primarily in their labour force rather than try and imitate the capital intensive economies of the western world.  To a certain extent we, too, are analogous to the Third World countries and the path which was followed in other countries with labour shortages was not the path we should have followed in developing our economy.  We are now paying the penalty for imitating economies with problems of labour scarcity in having plant and equipment lying idle at considerable expense, both to public and private enterprises.  For that reason, I very much welcome the decision which lay behind the introduction of this Bill.  I know that, as the Minister has said, it was a leap in the dark and I am aware of the administrative apathy which must have existed in opposition to such proposals, particularly when they run counter to what has been the prevailing and conventional wisdom for the last quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>I find myself, unexpectedly, in some sympathy with, and to a certain extent I support some of the criticisms of the Bill which have been offered by Senator Yeats.  I said, in a small contribution last week on the Finance Bill, that it seemed to me that the <Col N="1006" /> Employment Premium Bill should also have given consideration to firms which were about to suffer redundancies. I mentioned that the anti-inflation and anti-unemployment package put together by the United Kingdom Government had contained such provisions.  In their case, of course, they are dealing with industry on a much larger scale than us, and I believe that in their case a firm will get special assistance of this sort when the number of redundancies involved is 100 or more.  It seems to me to go somewhat against the commonsense element in this Bill that one should permit men to become unemployed because a failure to sustain an industry through a particularly bad period and then subsidise them for being employed, perhaps next door or down the road, in some other industry.  I trust that this Bill can be seen as a first tentative step in the general direction of the subsidisation of labour rather than a once and for all and final shot in that direction. For this reason, I regard the Bill as an experimental investigation of the possibilities which underlie the subsidisation of labour rather than capital.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the experience to be derived over the next six to nine months the Minister will, I trust, return and give more consideration to the possibility of assisting firms which are threatened with redundancies, particularly those firms which are labour intensive and which have suffered grievously from the recent inflation and drop in demand.  In addition consideration should be given to the granting of these premia to local authorities for works of community development and also for public works programmes.  In the current OECD <i>Observer</i> there is an inventory of what is being done in the various states in terms of stimulating employment.  I was struck by one scheme in Canada where local authorities are given assistance along the lines of the employment premium scheme in respect of work programmes of a community improvement nature, with particular reference to those with a large youth content.</P>
    <P>It seems to me. given the very low <Col N="1007" /> level of civic responsibility which characterises Irish social life, that one might turn the present crisis to benefit by tapping the idealism which normally resides in the young by getting them to tackle many of the local and communal problems which exist throughout the country.  For example, one can think of the enormous urban jungles of this city with their paucity of community amenities and of the many schemes which might be embarked upon by employing young people and by using the skills, and social commitment in community associations and by putting all their resources to work in conjunction with the local authorities and the system of financial assistance available in this scheme.</P>
    <P>My view on the Bill as I have stated previously is that it should be regarded as experimental and not simply as a once and for all and final response to a very serious crisis.  I agree with Senator Yeats, and I am sure so do other Members of this House that the current unemployment situation is not one which will disappear very quickly.  The unemployment figure in the United Kingdom, as we have been reminded, is now one million.  The forecast, as I said last week, for the middle of this winter is one and a half million and it is anticipated that unemployment in the United Kingdom will continue to grow to two million over the next 12 months. In these circumstances it is virtually inconceivable that unemployment in this country will drop in the next 12 months.  At the moment, unemployment, as I understand it, in the eight other EEC countries is increasing substantially. Ironically, we are the one economy in which, temporarily at any rate, unemployment has been stabilised. Given the fact that there is now general recognition of the seriousness of the world depression, I think it is optimistic beyond the point of minimal reasonableness that we should anticipate a decrease in the rate of unemployment in the domestic economy over the next 12 months.  We heard today a trade figure which was profoundly depressing from the point of view of a political upturn in the world economy. The trade figures for the United States are now showing a surplus in balance <Col N="1008" /> of payments when in fact they should be, if the rest of the world economy was to become in any way healthy, showing a fairly hefty and massive balance of payments deficit.  The difficulty is that, at a time when all economies are looking for export led growth, each economy is resorting to measures restricting imports.  In this way we are all going to plunge ourselves into collective and self-perpetuating unemployment. It seems that the United States is, as it has been over the last decade, serving the world very ill through the policies pursued by its respective Presidents.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, a great necessity for the Minister and for the Government to look upon this Bill as a venture in a new area of economic policy and not to reject what has been done in the past through the IDA and through other State agencies, such as Gaeltarra, in the subsidisation of capital, but to regard this measure as the development of a totally new development which would supplement, complement and add to the more traditional means of stimulating economic growth.  I ask the Government in tackling unemployment in manufacturing industry and agriculture by looking for increases in employment over the base date to approach this Bill from the point of view of engaging in an experiment upon which they will draw, say, in six months time, for experience in framing a mere permanent policy of labour subsidisation.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that in the near future the one thing which will become evident is that this measure, far from being temporary, will become a permanent feature of our economic apparatus and weaponry in fighting unemployment.  There is not going to be any significant improvement in the world economy for two years so, therefore, there is not going to be any dramatic upturn in our trading performance and, for that reason, there is not going to be any significant improvement in our employment situation. Consequently there cannot be a situation in which we turn on a tap of aid and assistance and then in six months begin to slow it down to half <Col N="1009" /> and then 12 months later cut it off altogether.  I think we have to regard this employment premium scheme as a new method of social experimentation and encouragement of employment. I do not believe that we should be deterred by the possible unscrupulous exploitation of the money potential in this Bill.  As Senator Yeats said, we have to be prepared for a certain amount of that.  I would agree with him it would be far better if we permitted a certain amount of this to go on rather than have the dole queues lengthen even further.</P>
    <P>As I said in the beginning, I do not really see that in the terms of cost benefit analysis the Exchequer can prove there will be a cost in implementing this Bill.  In fact I suspect quite the contrary.  I welcome the statement by the Minister that there is going to be no financial ceiling on the employment premium programme. I say also that, in so far as he and his Department are concerned, they should regard the scheme as an experimental measure.  I hope that Senator Lenihan is not more accurate in looking into the future than I am.  I hope that the heavy hand of the Department of Finance, as he described it, will rest very lightly indeed on the Department of Labour over the coming months because it is upon the success of this measure, the vision of the Minister, the energy and imagination of his officials that the happiness and livelihood of so many countless thousands of people are going to depend.  We can only wish them well in their endeavours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure too.  As Senator Halligan has pointed out it is a reflection of new thinking in an attempt to stimulate employment. It is new thinking as far as this country is concerned.  It has been going on in other countries for some time now, I regret that we have not introduced a measure of this type previously.  Senator Halligan is right in his assessment that this will not be a temporary measure.  I believe it will be permanent and that it will be more widespread.  It is worth trying because the attempts in other countries have <Col N="1010" /> shown a very worthwhile result in job creation.</P>
      <P>One country in which this has been tried with considerable success is Canada, where the scheme is administered from Ottawa by a distinguished Irishman&mdash;in fact a fellow county man of mine and the Minister &mdash;Dr. R.H. Johnston.  The scheme there has exceeded the expectations of the Canadian civil servants.  It is a more wide ranging scheme.  One of the main differences in the Canadian scheme and the scheme put forward here is there is a good deal of regional flexibility.  It is operated on a regional basis and the needs of the respective regions, which vary greatly in Canada, are taken into account.  The money, which of course comes from central funds, is administered on a regional basis when the projects have been checked out by Ottawa.</P>
      <P>Could we look at things on a regional basis in this Bill and in many other areas of administration, because there are great differences in our regions?  For example, the needs of the west and south-west of Ireland are greatly different from those of the Dublin region.  Sooner or later we will have to start taking these things into account in all our legislation.  This is a worthwhile attempt at stimulating employment.  I know it will be necessary to make amendments to a scheme like this after it has operated for a period of a year.  If as Senator Halligan predicts&mdash;I believe he is right&mdash;the scheme shall cease to have effect on 26th June, 1976, then this time next year we will have to have another piece of legislation which, I hope, will make the necessary amendments to the scheme as it is set out here.  I am certain it is a good way to stimulate employment.  One of the things which will have to be looked at again&mdash;perhaps the Minister will look at it now&mdash;is the class of industry included in the Bill and also the class of employee who will receive a grant or a premium under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to join with Senator McCartin in welcoming the fact that the agricultural industry is to be included. Here we have an area which <Col N="1011" /> could benefit greatly from an employment premium.  As Senator McCartin said, it is the sort of industry which creates other employment.  If we improve our agricultural position, then we automatically create jobs in manufacturing industries, food processing industries, and in the service industries. This is a very welcome measure and I am sure the agricultural industry will respond to these premiums.</P>
    <P>There are a few other small points I should like to make.  The Minister mentioned that AnCO trainees who are full-time workers at AnCO training centres will be eligible for the premium. Perhaps the Bill could be extended to those other trainees who are in community workshops, for example.  These are mainly run by voluntary organisations such as the Rehabilitation Institute. They are financed partly through State funds from the Departments of Health, Social Welfare and Labour, and financed to a considerable extent by funds raised by the organisations themselves. These are organisations which take people who have a minor handicap, a mental handicap or physical handicap.  They train them in a community workshop or a training centre for full employment in normal industry. They manage to do a terrific job by taking people who are receiving benefits from the Department of Health if they stay at home, by bringing them out and taking them off the unemployment and the socially handicapped registers and putting them back into full productive employment. There again the State is not losing anything.  If they are off social welfare and back in employment, or if they come into employment for the first time, then this is a positive and creative thing for the community as a whole.  I hope the Minister will consider extending section (c) on page 2 to include trainees who have been full-time trainees at community workshops for a sufficient period before receiving their first employment.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Senator Lenihan when he talks about a percentage of the wage rate instead of a fixed premium.  I think it is better to work on a flat rate.  There are too many <Col N="1012" /> percentage tied attempts to balance things out.  We have seen an interesting piece of legislation in the U.K. with a flat rate increase on wages. That is the way to really deal with a problem such as the wage control problem.  It is better to have a flat rate and, in this way, the people with lower wages and salaries do not feel aggrieved by seeing people higher up the scale getting huge increases in kind, even though they are only the same percentage of their salary as the person lower down the scale has got. The flat rate is the way to deal with this situation.  It certainly makes it easier to administer.</P>
    <P>We will know in a year's time how this has worked and whether the flat rate is the best rate.  We can only work by hindsight and by examining how programmes in other countries of a similar nature have succeeded and where they have failed and where they have been exploited.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to see referred to in 1976, when I am sure we will have continuing legislation of this type, is how the target which the Minister has set himself has been measured up to.  We had an example last week where the IDA put out the targets for job creation.  I complained &mdash;I think it was a fair complaint&mdash; that these targets are always being thrown around as if they were balloons bouncing around in hot air. We very rarely see in a year or so whether there has been a shortfall, whether the target has been met, or whether the scheme has done better than the target figure.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister when he is dealing with this problem in a year's time to let us know how close to the target he has got, exactly how many jobs have been created, and what the breakdown has been in the various range of industries.  There is no point in putting out airy-fairy targets at this stage and never referring to them again.  It is a trick we tend to use.  When the Minister comes back in a year's time, it is important that he should give actual figures for jobs created.</P>
    <P>I have some further points which might be better discussed on Committee <Col N="1013" /> Stage.  I welcome this measure. It is a step in the right direction even though part of it is a step in the dark.  We do not know how it will work.  I hope it will succeed in relieving this great problem which the economy faces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamWhyte" hpid="Mr. Whyte Mr. Whyte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Whyte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is encouraging to know that the Opposition welcome it also.  It is new thinking on employment in industry and other areas.  I particularly welcome the fact that the Government, due to a certain amount of agitation behind the scenes on the Government side of the House, have agreed to include agriculture in this measure.  I believe there is scope for much more employment in agriculture.  Very many people employed in agriculture have been putting off work that badly needed to be done because of a shortage of finance in the industry.  In the past couple of years things have been difficult in the agricultural industry.  I hope people will take this opportunity to do very necessary work on farms and on land in general. There is a considerable amount of unemployment in the country areas. Unfortunately a considerable amount of unemployment always existed there.</P>
      <P>It is depressing to see the areas of the country&mdash;in the West and, indeed, the Midlands&mdash;where people have been unemployed or under-employed for a long number of years.  These are the parts of the country where a lot of extra work needs to be done.  The roads are not as good as we would like to see them.  Hedges need to be cut.  It is a pity there was so much unemployment and that so much necessary work was never properly tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased to see that AnCO trainees will be eligible under this scheme.  As Senator McCartin already pointed out, this is a particularly good opportunity to ensure that as many people as possible get training with AnCO.  Very many of the old trades and skills which were useful are no longer available.  Many people will have to adapt themselves to other ways of work, so they will need extra training.  This is a particularly good <Col N="1014" /> opportunity to avail of that and I should like to see the training facilities in AnCO expanded if that can be done.</P>
    <P>As Senator McCartin also pointed out it has happened in the past, and it had to happen, that people who were productively employed in industry had to be taken away from the job for further training.  Now that they can be retrained without taking them out of productive work the most use possible should be made of this.  I do not think the Minister's target of 10,000 cannot be attained.  I am hopeful that it can be attained.  I welcome the fact that this is open-ended as far as finance is concerned because, as has been pointed out already, it need not cost the country money at all.  The more people re-employed under this scheme, the bigger the saving in finance.  Putting people into productive employment is the really important part of this scheme.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan said this scheme ought not to be restricted, as it is, and that the date of 29th June should not be the final date for accepting people. I agree with some of his sentiments. The scheme will have to be amended over the months and maybe, in fact, over the years.  If all the people who were let off can be taken on again under this scheme, it will be open-ended. There are people who might try to cash in on this type of aid.  Not everybody would do it, but some would.  Human nature being what it is, it would be very easy for industrialists and people engaged in agriculture to give themselves the benefit of the doubt and say: &ldquo;I just cannot carry on without aid and I will avail of the £12 the Minister is putting up.&rdquo;  I am afraid the Government would find themselves subsidising all work after a very short time and, because of that, the Government could not accept an open-ended date on which this scheme would start.</P>
    <P>Of necessity this has got to be a short-term scheme.  It is, in fact, £12 for the first six months and £6 after that.  The principle is good in general &mdash;and this has been referred to by many Senators already&mdash;and it is something which will be used to a greater extent in the future.  We have a lot of unemployment at the <Col N="1015" /> moment.  We have over 100,000 people unemployed.  This is a very big figure.  It is big because of the fact that we always had far too many people unemployed.  We were prepared to go along over the past 30 or 40 years with 50,000, 60,000 or 70,000 unemployed.  Those figures were far too high.  They were accepted as the normal up to the past couple of years.  They should never have been accepted as being normal.  The type of assistance we gave to people who were unemployed or under-employed was actually a hand-out.  They were encouraged to do nothing further only sit on their fanny and draw the money: a subsistence rather than an existence.  That type of approach to unemployment was wrong.  If this new approach encourages people to work or encourages industry to employ more people, it will have a very good effect.  I would like to see it used in the future to a far greater extent than it has been in the past.</P>
    <P>It was deplorable to see parts of the country where a great deal of work needed to be done and, at the same time, a great many people were unemployed or under-employed.  Governments never have money just to hand out.  The Government have what they collect from the people in the way of taxes.  People who are unemployed have an absolute right to the necessities of life and to a reasonable standard of living, but they can only get them at the expense of people who are working.  No matter whether it is pay-related benefit, dole or what have you, it comes from the section of the community who are working as of now and from people who put by a certain amount when they were fortunate enough to be employed.  Able-bodied people who are unemployed are not acting in their own best interests, through no fault of their own in very many cases. This type of scheme which encourages extra employment, at a smaller price than unemployment has been costing, is a good scheme and is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I have to disagree with my friend who said we have too much machinery, <Col N="1016" /> too many modern ways of doing things, thereby knocking people out of employment.  Modern machinery is doing a job it took many people to do.  I do not think that is what is wrong.  If a machine can do the work of six people, there is nothing wrong in that.  First of all, it takes a number of people to manufacture that machine.  Secondly, it probably does work that is difficult, tedious and troublesome, at which six men might be employed.  It is not wrong that that machine is doing that work.  What is wrong is that the benefits which accrue to humanity because of that machine have not been properly distributed and, on occasions, this has resulted in a loss of employment.  If any job that is being done now by six people can be done by a machine in a shorter time, the result is that those six people have that much more leisure, and a happier life, and continue in employment if we work out our calculations property.  We have not done that on a national scale nor, indeed, on an international scale in the past.</P>
    <P>I hope we will reach the Minister's target of 10,000.  While our figure of 100,000 unemployed is far too big, it has been enlarged by the fact that we already had too many people under-employed or unemployed.  I welcome the Bill and I hope it achieves the aims it sets out to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as we can understand what the Minister proposes to do, we can welcome the Bill in a general way, but it is an extremely vague Bill.  We are told that the Minister is going to introduce a scheme and that is really the beginning and end of it.  Even before we are told what the Bill proposes to do, or what the terms of the Bill are, we are told that it is to be amended.  The Bill which, to start with, is very uncertain and vague is already in the course of amendment before we get a grasp of what is proposed to be done. Nevertheless, it appears to be a Bill which will do some good, which will make some contribution to a very serious problem and, to that extent, we must welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;We are, of course, in uncharted territory and I <Col N="1017" /> propose to monitor very closely the progress made in this area and to make use of the results of this.&rdquo;  It is quite clear, if he is in uncharted territory, we are even more so.  I hope that, as time goes on and he monitors the situation, he will be able to make a real contribution to this problem.  It is somewhat surprising that we only have this Bill at this stage because we have had 100,000 unemployed since the beginning of the year.  We have not significantly any more now than we had many many months ago, but it is only now that we have this small contribution to the problem.  I think the reason must be&mdash;apart from the fact that the Government are very slow to take any action in problems of this kind&mdash;that the Government really believed the economic situation would improve towards the end of this year.  A number of economists said it would probably improve towards the end of the year and the Government were hoping against hope that the position would improve and that they would not have to do anything about the problem.  They have probably come to the conclusion now that things will not improve very much before the end of the year, whatever may happen next year or the year after.  Consequently this may be the reason for the Bill's introduction.</P>
    <P>The real position is that the high level of unemployment, the continuing level of unemployment and the fact that we will probably have a higher level of unemployment, are due to inflation and to the failure and inability of the Government to do anything about inflation.  Inflation is the most serious factor in contributing to unemployment and in making it difficult to deal with unemployment. Inflation means there is no confidence in business circles, no confidence among employers in expanding industry or continuing at past levels.</P>
    <P>There is no confidence because the employer cannot plan for the future. With every effort he makes to expand or continue his business he immediately finds himself up against the problems created by inflation.  He is no longer sure of what the effect will <Col N="1018" /> be if he embarks on certain courses, or expands or even continues at the present rate.  Every estimate he makes is vitally affected by inflation.  Consequently, he has no confidence and he is unable to plan for the future. This immediately affects the level of employment in his business.  For that reason also he is reluctant to invest any money in expanding his business and this again affects employment. He finds it impossible to make any costings either for a new product or for the export of some product. Therefore he is reluctant to go ahead.</P>
    <P>Senator Halligan talked about equipment and the advantage or disadvantage of having elaborate intensive equipment as opposed to employment. One of the effects of inflation is that an employer is inclined to invest in a machine because he knows exactly what that machine will cost and he has some idea of what the costing of that machine will be in the future, whereas in the present situation, with inflation at its present rate, he has no idea what it will cost him to employ the equivalent number of employees to do the same job.  If inflation was not running at its present rate, the employer could employ men to do the job rather than buying a JCB or whatever machine Senator Halligan mentioned.  To that extent also, inflation affects the employer in the way he tackles a job and in deciding on the number of employees he will have to do a particular job.</P>
    <P>When the employer is thinking in terms of exporting goods, of competing in the international market, he realises that, with the high level of inflation here and the fact that it is getting worse rather than better, he will probably be unable to compete satisfactorily with any product he exports. Consequently he is reluctant to decide to embark on any export programme to produce goods for which he feels he will not be able to find a market.  Without going into all the ramifications of inflation, and they are immense, it is the most serious factor affecting employment and employment levels in the future and is extremely difficult to deal with.</P>
    <P>In saying that, I am not saying that <Col N="1019" /> that is merely a fact of life and that nobody can do anything about it.  The Government should be doing something about it.  Of course, they fall back on the current international situation and say that this inflation is due to the international situation and, consequently, they can do little or nothing about it.  It is true that we have inflation internationally at present throughout Europe.  It is true also that inflation is being dealt with in most of the countries of Europe.  It is true that a very considerable improvement in the position has taken place in most European countries and that ours is still the worst in Europe and shows little sign of any improvement.  To that extent the Government must accept responsibility for the current rate of inflation here and for the effect that is having on unemployment.  Unemployment is very largely the result of inflation and the level of inflation here is largely due to the failure and apparent inability of the Government to take measures to deal with it.</P>
    <P>There is a distinct lack of confidence in the Government among the business community and among the employers.  There is a distinct lack of confidence in the ability of the Government to take measures to bring down inflation, in their ability to give the necessary lead so that business can expand and prosper and that unemployment can be dealt with.  Mr. Donal Carroll, the chairman of P.J. Carroll &amp; Co. Ltd., one of our biggest employers, said at a conference last week:</P>
    <P>Enterprise in these islands is being constrained, inhibited and stifled by the short-sightedness and ineptitude by Governments which are failing either to recognise the essential needs of the economy or to supply an environment in which it can flourish.</P>
    <P>He referred to the British Government and said:</P>
    <P>But the Irish Government, he argued, was an equal failure in its inability to solve economic problems and create an environment which encouraged growth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> That quotation is from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 24th July, 1975.  Admittedly, inflation is a phenomenon which is widespread.  But it is something which is being dealt with in most European countries.  It is something which the Government in these countries have been able to control and improve.  Unfortunately, our Government have not shown any signs of being able to deal with it, to face up to it, or to take the measures that are necessary.  Because of this we have the present unemployment situation.  Because of this we have over 100,000 people unemployed.  Because of this it looks as though we are not only going to continue to have that number unemployed but, if anything, the figure will go higher.  Therefore, the situation cannot be blamed on international factors.  The Government cannot say this is something about which we can do nothing.  They must do something about it.  It needs every possible effort to deal with the situation. If the Government are going to say, and continue to say, that they can do nothing about unemployment, that they can do nothing about the inflation that is causing unemployment, then they should get out and allow some other Government to deal with it.</P>
    <P>In regard to this Bill, the underlying factors, the underlying causes of unemployment are very serious and need to be tackled quickly. This Bill is not getting to the root of the problem, rather it is only tinkering with the problem.  In its own way it is making a small contribution. The idea of paying a premium to a firm to bring back somebody, to give them employment again is a good idea, and deserves to be tried.  The experiment is a good one and will probably pay some dividends.  To the extent that it will effect some small improvement in the situation, to the extent that it will ensure that some few hundreds, or few thousands&mdash;I think the Minister is somewhat optimistic when he said 10,000&mdash;to the extent that it provides employment for any number of men, it is to be welcomed.  Certainly we wish the experiment success.  The Government cannot merely shrug off the problem by saying that they have now introduced this Bill which will do something <Col N="1021" /> to deal with the very serious problem of 100,000 unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that this imaginative Bill was received with acclaim by all sides, workers and employers, in the country, on the day it was announced in June.  It is to be hoped that this programme will have the desired effect of taking off the live register some 10,000 unemployed workers and put them into productive employment, which of course will be of tremendous benefit to our economy and the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the Government have decided, after consideration, to extend this Bill to include those engaged in agriculture and horticulture. I had hoped&mdash;and still hope&mdash;that processing industries, particularly agricultural processing industries, firms like co-operative movements who are involved in the processing of agricultural produce, milk, cheese and by-products of these, possibly would also be included as agriculture.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister when replying would clarify whether that section of the agricultural industry would benefit under the scheme.  &ldquo;Benefit&rdquo; is the operative word in a Bill such as this.  Only good can come from something which helps to stem the tide of unemployment which economic forces from without and within our country have brought upon us at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a long meeting with one of our important farming organisations last night.  They mentioned the importance of this Bill to the agricultural community.  The expressed the hope that it would and could be extended to the agricultural sector. Therefore, it is with great pleasure I welcome that additional extension to cover the agricultural community. On farms there is a lot of very important work to be done irrespective of the changes that have taken place in agricultural production, particularly in the dairving industry.  Because of the rationalisation and improvement in production in the agricultural sector with particular reference to dairying these changes have brought about less need for agricultural workers. In turn, because of that, the <Col N="1022" /> numbers engaged in agriculture have been dropping for a considerable number of years and are continuing to drop.  Apart from this drop there is much important work of another type to be done on farms, that is, the increasing production in crop and animal husbandry.  There will be improvements to buildings, lands; cutting of hedges, cleaning of ditches&mdash; all these are important matters which have been left in abeyance for some years because of the cost factor involved in employing labour.  I sincerely hope that this Bill will bring about an improvement in that situation. It will give a very welcome upsurge to work on farms and will be a stimulant to employers in that sector to bring in people to do this important work.  That kind of important work on our farms would benefit our entire economy.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the improvements I have outlined that will accrue to the agricultural sector, any help that any industrialist can get to re-employ people can only be a very welcome measure and should be treated as such by all sides of the House.  Credit must be given to the Government for having initiated the scheme.  It takes a good Cabinet and team work to devise machinery to stimulate employment. The improvement affected by the announcement of the Bill is illustrated by the Minister's remarks concerning the number of people who have already shown an interest in this scheme.  I would also expect that by the end of the special period to which the Bill relates the world economic situation would have improved to such an extent that the need for this scheme would no longer be evident and that a situation of full employment here would ensue.</P>
    <P>Of course, we are not all suffering from a loss of memory.  It must be admitted that even in the boom years of other administrations, Ireland always had a very high unemployment rate reaching almost the current peak, which is occurring in a world economic crisis situation.  The Opposition in merely castigating the present administration for the total number unemployed is not being impartial.  There were boom years in which everything <Col N="1023" /> in the garden was reputed to be lovely, but many a worker was unable to get a job and even when he did had very poor recompense for his labours.  At that time also workers were forced to turn to the emigrant ship.  Many of our boys and girls, the lifeblood of our country, emigrated to England, America and elsewhere to earn their living.  Nowadays this exodus does not take place.  They expect, quite rightly, that their own country and Government will provide a means of livelihood for them from the time they leave school until they die.  This is as it should be in any country.</P>
    <P>We should not have to depend on the economy of any other nation to ensure that our boys and girls will enjoy always a certain standard of living and the opportunity to get employment in their native land.  That is why the Industrial Development Authority which I complimented last week, because of their development of industries, particularly the pharmaceutical industry, which can compete on the European market, can predict a net gain in new jobs over the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>Therefore in the interim this Bill will help industries which are in difficulties, industries such as the textile industry and others referred to by the Minister as being in need of help at present.  This Bill is particularly welcome in that it can assist such industrialists. In addition to the advantages of increased production and its resultant benefits for our economy, having men at work is good for the men themselves, good for them physically and mentally.  I know of no man who, having lost his job through no fault of his own, would not prefer to be gainfully employed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the tea break I was speaking about the importance of employment not only to the economy but also to the people.  We hear now quite often that there is a general air among working people that they do not want to work or that they would prefer to be on the dole.  I had mentioned that I had never been personally aware of any man who had lost his job through his own fault and would not prefer to be gainfully employed.  This in fact has been found to be true.  There are exceptional cases, of course, to all rules, but for any person who is unfortunate enough to lose his employment through no fault of his own, after giving a lifetime of service in a job, whether it be in a factory, on a farm or otherwise it is a traumatic experience, and the vast majority of people employed there would prefer if that situation had not arisen.  Indeed, they would be much happier to go on to retirement age.  We have often found, particularly in agriculture, that people are even slow to retire at the optimum age of 65 years, and I have known men to go on in insurable employment to the 70's and to continue even over the 70's in agriculture with nothing only the stamp which covered them for injuries at work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The experience in the country is that people prefer to work, but it is only right that we should have in the social welfare code assistance for those who unfortunately lose their <Col N="1025" /> employment in order to cushion them against the shock and ensure they get the maximum we can give them, to which they have contributed, for all the service they have given while they were in employment.  I would like to see more effort, through the National Manpower Service, put into getting alternative employment for these people.  Indeed this Bill will assist the manpower service, and I would like the Minister to confirm that employers whether industrial employers or agricultural, should apply direct to the manpower service to avail of this scheme and not just apply to the local unemployment exchange.</P>
    <P>I would like if the manpower service would extend their efforts further and be active in every way to ensure that unemployed people get preference over those, for instance, who usually try to better themselves in employment.  The manpower service offer facilities to people to change their employment if they so wish, but while this is a very desirable thing in normal circumstances, the manpower service should give preference to people who are unemployed at present.  This Bill will make the job of the manpower service that much easier, and I hope that when they start to operate the Bill they can honour commitments that have been entered into by the Minister and ensure that the figures that he hoped would be taken off the live register will, in fact, be removed.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill and wish it all the success it deserves.  I have no doubt, as I said initially, that it will be received with acclaim, and I expect the result will prove that this was a very worth-while measure and that it will have the desired effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I welcome this Bill.  Its main purpose is the stimulation of employment and if it succeeds in doing anything in that direction it will be worth while so far as we are concerned.  The Minister says here in paragraph 2 that in our efforts to create employment Ireland has relied almost exclusively on grants for capital expenditure.  Will these <Col N="1026" /> grants be trimmed down now because of the introduction of this measure, and will it mean, in effect, that employers in future, or people initiating new industries, will find themselves not able to get the maximum grants because of this?  If that is the case, and if it in any way would effect the establishment of an industry in an area, that would certainly not be welcome.</P>
      <P>What the Government are aiming at is to try and reduce this 103,000 or whatever the number is of people who find themselves unemployed.  Admittedly there has been a fair number of people unemployed in this country for many years and there are some people on that register who would not be in a position to take up employment the next day if it was offered to them because of its location, because of family commitments and so on.  But it is no exaggeration to say that in the past two-and-a-half years these numbers have escalated out of all proportion. Such a situation has not obtained previously in the seventies or, indeed, in the sixties.  The last time this ill wind blew across the face of this country was in 1957 when the last Coalition Government was in office and on the previous occasion, 1949 to 1951. It is rather strange.  Maybe the fairies are responsible for it.  Every time a Coalition Government takes office in this country this blight seems to hit the whole nation.  Thousands and thousands of people who were in gainful employment before that always find themselves in the dole queues.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons this is happening is that there is no confidence.  I do not want to injure in any way the efforts the Government are trying to make but as an Opposition it is our duty to criticise them as a Government.  I have no hesitation in placing the sole responsibility for the catastrophe that has hit this country at the feet of the Government.  There is no confidence in their ability to remedy this situation. This measure in front of us is a stop-gap effort in which I have not got much faith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first essential for recovery is that the manufacturer, the investor and the would-be industrialist should <Col N="1027" /> have confidence in the ability of the Government to lead this country. When they enter into commitments or dealings with the Government those dealings and commitments should be honoured.  We have not got such a Government in office at present.  They are welching and back-peddling on agreements already made with workers and industrialists.  You cannot expect any confidence in that type of outfit.</P>
    <P>There are people from abroad who would like, because of their initiative and desire, to gain more wealth by coming here.  But they will not come when a situation such as this exists. If my information is correct, there are thousands of pounds leaving this country.  People are taking money out and investing it in the Six Counties or in England.  In a situation like that, it is difficult for any Government to get money.  It is difficult to get an industrialist to come in here and establish a worthwhile industry in which he can expect to make some money for himself and his shareholders, in which the worker can have confidence and which will produce articles that will sell on the world market in competition with other countries.  These stop-gap measures will be useless in creating such a situation.</P>
    <P>If this Bill could reduce the 103,000 that are unemployed we would welcome it.  It is a dangerous situation that exists in many areas where people are getting almost as much money when idle as when they are working.  Eventually people will not have the incentive to work and will lose their own self-respect and dignity. Most people in this country would like to have a job and a fair amount of security.  There are plenty of unions and federations which they can join to ensure continuity of employment.</P>
    <P>If the climate is a climate of no confidence whatever, such as is in this country at present, it is very hard to make progress.  The Government make lame excuses when their honeymoon of two-and-a-half years is nearly over and we are faced in the middle <Col N="1028" /> of July, 1975, with the reality of a vast number of people unemployed.  It is no great pleasure to us to churn out the figures again and again.  These figures are annoying to everybody irrespective of their political persuasion.  They are annoying to the workers and the industrialist and they are costing this country money.  The Government are now trying to lock the door when the horse is gone.  They are introducing this as a stop-gap measure to tide them over the summer period.  They want to pretend that all is well.  They are whistling past the graveyard.</P>
    <P>There are many questions one could ask on this measure.  If the Government could put 10,000 people into employment it would mean they would not have to give them pay-related benefits and they would be getting 10,000 stamps in over the weekend.  Instead of £12, it might cost the Government £8, allowing for stamps and so on. Therefore, instead of giving a universal grant of £12, it would have been fairer to make it a percentage of the amount of money the person was receiving through unemployment assistance.  It is very difficult to say whether the £12 will have the desired effect.  I hope it has for the sake of the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris said it was a very imaginative Bill.  I do not want to cast any reflection on Senator Ferris because he has made a good contribution, but we could apply many corrosive adjectives to it.  It will not be of any benefit to the workers or those who are unemployed, but as an attempt to do something, I suppose we should welcome it.</P>
    <P>It must have been an afterthought, in so far as the Dublin-based Government is concerned, that they eventually decided, through pressure from the farmers' organisations, to apply this to the agricultural community. How it will apply to them is a mystery to me, and I have some knowledge of agriculture and life in rural Ireland. Will it apply to people working in milk powder factories or creameries. Will it apply to people who are working with Bord na Móna? You could consider turf-cutting an agricultural occupation.  If a person decided that he would go into turf production on his own rather <Col N="1029" /> than be attached to Bord na Móna, would he be entitled to avail of the £12 grant?  What would happen if a county council applied for the grant? There are hundreds of county council workers unemployed at present because of the shortfall in grants consequent on the serious inflation, 26 per cent, that has taken place over the last few years.  How will the local authorities who have to lay off their workers be affected in this respect? What will happen, for instance in the coal mining area of Arigna?  Will this measure affect people in inland fisheries? There are many questions on which the Minister will have to enlighten us on Committee Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The building industry, which is suffering very much at present, is not mentioned.  This industry has a very good employment content if it can be got going again.  It is important to know if this grant will apply to people working in hotels and connected with tourism.</P>
    <P>These people have been taking a tremendous hammering over the last few years.  They very often have been asked 12 months and two years ahead to publish their brochures and prices. When the time comes they find that inflation has pushed it up 26 per cent or even double that, 52 per cent.  Such people will be very interested to know how this will work.  Will people working in meat processing, who have been taking millions from the farmers, qualify for this grant?  I will be looking forward to the Minister's answers to these questions either on this or on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>We are faced in this country at present with the spectacle of this Government of all the talents now trying to cling like leeches to power, when there are 103,000 unemployed with no great confidence in the future; with the spectacle of the five Government Ministers attached to the Labour Party not sitting down with their colleagues at a party conference but going along to their respective trade unions and saying a very different thing to that which they are agreeing to at Government level.  No Government could stand up to that type of double dealing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> The Government are stumbling and fumbling from one month to another hoping that oil will ooze up around Bantry, that gas will be discovered off the coast of Waterford, and that some supernatural method will be found to solve our problems.  They should have formulated their proposals long ago in the Cabinet, put them before the people, and stood by their decisions, thus instilling confidence into industrialists and those engaged in various types of industry.  The Government should not have allowed prices to escalate and then blamed the Korean war, the Suez crisis or the little Arabs or somebody else and never at any time placed the blame where it rightly belongs, at their own doorstep.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dolan has a vivid imagination.  He believes we are living in isolation here in this country and what affects the rest of the world does not affect us here.  A man who says that investment in industry here is now being transferred to industry in Britain and the North of Ireland must have that type of imagination because we all know that over 1,000,000 people are unemployed in England and they are doing very little about it.  The future for England is very poor and very bad because it is estimated that within the next few months there will be 1,500,000 unemployed and in the next two years there will be 2,000,000 unemployed in England.  I cannot understand Senator Dolan even imagining that people here in Ireland will transfer their monetary allegiance to a country such as England.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because it gives an opportunity to industry to increase their employment.  It subsidies them to the extent of £12 a head on taking on extra men or extra women, as the case may be, and this should be praised by all concerned.  I understand it has been accepted by the Front Bench of the Fianna Fáil Party here in the Seanad.  Even though some of the Members of the Fianna Fáil Party here in the Seanad believe the Bill could be improved, they have accepted the Bill as a good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand Senator <Col N="1031" /> Dolan's contribution here this evening. I would hope that certain areas would take a deep interest in this Bill and the subsidies that will be paid to increase employment.  I would like the Shannon region to take due notice because it is one region where, looking at the reports of the exports of products there, I see the value of the total decreased in 1974 over 1973. Now there is an opportunity of taking on more people and the subsidy will be paid so that those people would be employed and we would have more to export.</P>
    <P>I am also glad that agriculture is included.  It is an opportunity for people in the agricultural industry also to look at the situation because, especially in the dairy industry we are at a peak, and from now on we will be on the decline, the milk will not be available, and as long as the people who are employed are kept on and other people are employed, they can build up that industry and be ready for the 1976 season.  We all know the value of the dairy industry in this country.  We all realise it will be of greater value in the future and if we can work up the kind of enthusiasm in that industry that should be worked up with the management of that industry and the farmers, then we will be doing a good thing.  This is what is required now.</P>
    <P>We should point out to the people involved in that industry that there is this great future and that the country will be depending on this industry as well as on the beef industry.  We hear a lot of condemnation from the other side about the beef industry.  Unless we encourage people to get more involved in those two industries and the total agricultural industry, then we will be in a bad position.  I think we will be able to do this here.  The Government are keenly interested in agriculture, as can be seen from a section of the Bill here, and I know that we here on this side of the House will do our utmost to recommend this section to the agricultural industry and I am sure that they will not be found wanting.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see forestry included <Col N="1032" /> in the Bill.  I believe it is not included.  Here is an industry that can definitely take on more people, that is waiting for improvement, and waiting for more investment and it would be helped by its inclusion in the Bill. There is much land that can be put into forestry that is good for very little else.</P>
    <P>I would hope this Bill will help to reduce the unemployment position from 100,000 down to 90,000 people. I do not honestly believe this will happen, but it will help to keep down the number of unemployed.</P>
    <P>As there will be a check kept of the number availing of the £12 premium we will know what benefit this Bill will be in the future.  The Opposition will probably say that the Bill has had no effect because the number of unemployed may still be 100,000 or it may even increase, because we are facing the winter when there has always been a slackening off in employment. It is only natural that more people are unemployed in the winter than in the summer.</P>
    <P>This Bill should give encouragement to all concerned.  It will show that the Government are interested in the people and are anxious to have people employed.  Almost everyone&mdash; there are those unfortunate people who cannot work&mdash;likes to do an honest week's work.  We should help people to get work, if at all possible. This Bill helps people, in some small way, to get work.  We are in a period of high inflation, not just in Ireland. We are part of the world and of Europe.  The same economic situation exists throughout the world.  That situation is one of high inflation and widespread unemployment.  The great countries such as Germany, France and even America are also experiencing unemployment at a level never remembered in the history of those countries.  If they cannot do anything about the situation our chances of doing something are very limited. However limited they may be we must try to do something.  This Bill will help remedy the situation.  I hope the Bill gets a Second Reading today and passes through all Stages as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill because it is indicative of the Government's determination to resolve the unemployment problem facing the country at present.  Listening to Opposition speakers one would imagine that we never had unemployment in what is referred to as &ldquo;the good old days&rdquo;.  In the so-called &ldquo;good old days&rdquo; there was upwards of 70,000 unemployed.  The worst aspect of that situation was that we were conditioned to accept it as being inevitable. When one combines that with emigration, which existed at that time, one is speaking in the region of 100,000, if the people who emigrated had stayed at home.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a genuine effort by the Government to stimulate employment and to give an incentive to employers to take on extra employees.  This must surely be the proper treatment to give, at a time when those employers must face very stiff competition in international markets with rising inflation, for a disease which has now been diagnosed.  One can only give a warm céad míle fáilte to such treatment and diagnosis.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out to Senator Dolan that much of the depression about which he spoke is also present throughout the world.  One would get the impression from listening to Senator Dolan that it stopped at Dún Laoghaire harbour.  I should like to refer him to the Central Bank <i>Bulletin,</i> Summer 1975.  I should like to ask Senator Dolan if he regards the Central Bank as a National Coalition agency, propagating propaganda.  I should be very surprised if his answer was in the affirmative.  On page 10 of the <i>Bulletin</i> they refer to the economic depression, and give four reasons for these developments.  They are as follows:</P>
      <P>(i)  the very steep rise in import prices which due to low price elasticity for imports increased the value of foreign purchases considerably by diverting demand from home produced goods and services.</P>
      <P>This is something over which no national Government have any control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> (ii)  the fall in export, and consequently domestic, prices for cattle in 1974 which was largely responsible for the decline of 8 per cent in the value of agricultural incomes&mdash;further depressing demand on the home market.</P>
    <P>Again, I would point out we are now members of the EEC and as such are not complete masters of our own destiny.  If it were not for the efforts of our Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the situation would have been much worse during the depressed period of cattle prices in 1974.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did he not allow the cattle from the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the cattle from the EEC I would point out that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was one of the few Ministers who fought against that.  It took him six months to get the EEC Ministers to change their minds.  It was not his fault.  The document continues:</P>
      <P>(iii)  a fall in the volume of industrial exports since late 1974 due to the declining volume of world trade consequent on the sharp increase in oil prices and to relatively high cost trends in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Again, the Government could not be held responsible for much of this.</P>
      <P>(iv)  a cyclical decline in spending on consumer durables from the high levels that had been reached between 1972 and mid-1973.</P>
      <P>These are the reasons given in the Central Bank <i>Bulletin,</i> a document which is respected for its depth of research and authenticity throughout the country and abroad also.  On page 64, &ldquo;Conclusion of the Forty-Fifth Annual Report of the Bank for International Settlements, the first sentence is:</P>
      <P>At the present time the industrial countries are undergoing the sharpest and most widespread of postwar recessions.</P>
      <P>This is something which shows that this is a widespread phenomenon and over which we have no control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill as introduced, which has now been amended by the introduction <Col N="1035" /> of the agricultural sector into the scheme, is heartily welcomed.  The scheme was assessed at a rate of £12 per person employed.  This is a reasonable figure.  In the short term it will have the desired results in that it should, without great effort&mdash;and inquiries both at Department headquarters and at the local level Department offices would seem to corraborate this&mdash;mean increased employment in many industrial sectors and now in the agricultural sphere before very long.</P>
    <P>Much of the qualified welcome that has been forthcoming from the Opposition is due possibly to jealousy in that down the years they in their time failed to reach this level of imaginative legislation.  I should like to point out that despite the prophesies of gloom which seem to emanate from different sources, this country is not at the bottom of the list in so far as economic depression is concerned. For example, at this moment the Netherlands have a rate of unemployment running at 12.2 per cent as against ours of 8.5 per cent.  We must compare like with like.  There is no point in comparing our economy with that of West Germany.  There is no comparison at any level.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of the Bill which should be mentioned, that is, the wisdom of introducing this category whereby additional employees recruited on a part-time or short-time basis will not be eligible for this scheme.  It is very wise to include this because you could have great abuse if you allowed people to employ on a short-time basis and avail of the very substantial benefits of the scheme.  At a time like this, this is a very welcome and worthwhile Bill.  I hope that the House will pass it with the greatest majority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lenihan was worried about &ldquo;the dead hand&rdquo;.  He did not use that phrase but it was in my mind as it was used by a Member of the other House when his party were in power. He was worried about the presence of Finance.  This is a usual provision in paying Bills of this kind.  There is no <Col N="1036" /> ceiling on expenditure in pursuit of the objectives of this legislation.  Our target is 10,000 jobs.  If we can, we will exceed that target.  I hope to come back in the early autumn for more money for this fund.  We, on our side, made the point repeatedly that this legislation is simply a means of inducing industry at this time to take on fresh workers.  No more is claimed for it than that.</P>
      <P>We do not see the Bill as a substitute for general recovery.  It is only when demand picks up in this economy and in other economies to which we export that we will see a recovery in employment figures. Throughout the year this recovery has been expected.  If one looks at the report of the ESRI in March, they expected certain growth which never took place.  That was a report in March by a very reputable research agency in this State.  Elsewhere, we see the same confusion among those who have been observing the economies of our main competitors.  The sought for recovery has been slow in taking off.  It has commenced in the largest area, the area which in Helmut Schmidt's words is &ldquo;the psychological capital of world economic confidence&rdquo;.  In New York and the United States the economy is already on the way to recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will take some time before the recovery in these major economies and before the benefits of that recovery come back to Europe.  Only last week we saw agreement reached between the French President, the German Chancellor and the Benelux countries on means for co-ordinating recovery in Europe.  As the House will know, we have sought in social affairs in Europe for this conjunction of economic and social policy.  All these recovery signs must become much stronger before we can see employment here coming back to the figures it was at.  Let us remember that our unemployment rate has always been the scandal of Europe. It has always been at over 7 per cent. In our best days it was over 7 per cent.  I do not say that the present situation is anything to be happy about.  When we hear Members of <Col N="1037" /> the Opposition worrying about unemployment, we should know that during most of their reign they lived with an unemployment rate with which no other democratic regime in Europe could live.</P>
    <P>Specific points were raised.  Senator Dolan wants the hotel industry and the building industry included.  We excluded those industries that had a high seasonal content for the obvious reason that we did not wish to subsidise employment that would take place anyway.  We wished to direct our funds to those employments which might wait a little longer before taking on extra workers.  That is why we excluded industries that had this seasonal content.  The county council work he mentioned does not qualify. It is not a manufacturing industry. There is a great deal of mobility in labour in the building industry.  We tried to confine it to those areas where we felt it was needed most.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris mentioned that more effort would be needed by the NMS to place unemployed persons.  Although our record of placement at this time is down on what it was in better periods of employment, it is still very high.  It is still at around 60 per cent. At all times the record of our placement service will bear favourable contrast with the sister service in the North of Ireland.  Naturally the record of placement at this stage is not as good as it was a year ago.  I confirm &mdash;it is made clear in the Bill&mdash;that employers should contact the NMS and they will in turn be active agents throughout the country to get employers interested in the provisions of this legislation.  It will not be the employment exchange who will be the agents for the propagation of the benefits of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have explained why we excluded agricultural-based processing industries because of their seasonal nature and because we felt that the increase in employment would have occurred in these sectors anyway.  That was the basic reason for their exclusion.  It would be particularly difficult for the same reason to include service industries, because again they have a very high seasonal content.  Administratively, <Col N="1038" /> it would be very difficult to decide on the nett additions at any time to the work force.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan mentioned the unfairness of selecting an arbitrary date.  Of course there is always something arbitrary and possibly unfair in selecting any date for the start of a scheme such as this.  He mentioned the question of flexibility, yet one must start a scheme of temporary duration.  This is a scheme of temporary duration designed to induce industry to take on workers, especially in areas where they might let workers go, to ensure that a pool of labour is kept in certain areas which without the benefits of this Bill might be allowed to go.  We would have a situation developing in late spring of next year or early summer where employers around the country beginning to expand once more with the retreat of the recession, would find themselves short of workers.</P>
    <P>It is, then, a scheme of temporary duration designed to bring us into the conditions of full recovery, a weapon in the manpower recovery programme of the Government.  We permit ourselves some flexibility.  I have discretion in legislation to fix on a notional base figure for a particular job on the date of commencement of the scheme. We had the case mentioned in the other House of a particular firm in receipt of Fóir Teoranta aid, and which organisation were represented on the board.  This firm conformed with the dictates of Fóir Teoranta, but they were running down the work force.  Such a firm in a particular county were caught by this date.  In fact, by agreement they had run down their work force for the specific reason of rationalising it, making it more efficient and therefore making the jobs of the remaining workers more secure.  They had done that and found themselves with this low work force when this date was announced by me, arbitrarily.  In that specific instance I can, knowing the full background and with full discretion to examine the background with Fóir Teoranta, fix a figure higher than the actual figure on that date.  I have that discretion, even though it would not be helpful to me to have a movable <Col N="1039" /> figure and date for the commencement of the scheme, because all manner of abuses could creep in in that situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats mentioned the elimination of payments in certain cases. This exemption is in section 3 (3) of the Bill.  Again this is concerned with the exclusion of certain seasonal industries.</P>
    <P>Senator Halligan said that it would be less costly because it took workers off the exchange.  I hope it succeeds in that way.  We have had the complaint that the State gave insufficient attention to the matter of financially aiding people.  We gave unemployment benefit but we did not give a choice to the individual to return to gainful employment.  That criticism has been made but this legislation is an attempt to right that balance.</P>
    <P>The question was raised by the same Senator whether we should give consideration to firms about to have a redundancy problem.  The State agency responsible for this is Fóir Teoranta.  I have always believed that between Fóir Teoranta and the Industrial Credit Company we need a middle agency to rescue firms in economic difficulties.  I know such a proposal is having the active consideration of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Senator West referred to the fact that similar measures were relatively successful on a regional basis in other countries.  He seemed to be a bit sceptical of the figure of 10,000.  As I remarked in my opening statement, we are in uncharted territory in that we have not had legislation of this type here before.  The full dedication of the staff of the National Manpower Service will be available to achieve this figure of 10,000 and higher, if that is possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats complained that the Bill was too vague.  It is true that it has that disadvantage of enabling legislation that it gives me rather wide powers, within the ordinary definition of the industry covered, of selection and discretion.  That is an inescapable element in a Bill of this nature.  He made the point that there was no mention of the amount of the premiums. <Col N="1040" /> These were, of course, already mentioned in the budget statement. He made the criticism that I had too much power to exclude certain types of workers.  Again, that is a necessary authority that comes to me in terms of the selection of the industry to be covered by the scheme.</P>
    <P>Four weeks unemployment before workers can qualify is a necessary qualification to ensure that it is the genuine applicant who will qualify in this area.  In the other House, the Opposition spokesman made the point that this was discrimination against one section of the unemployed.  There is no discrimination here because one may qualify by graduating to the point of being four weeks unemployed.  That regrettable privilege is there for any one of the unemployed at present.  I think Senators will agree that we need a certain qualifying period.  Senator Yeats asked what the position is regarding factories who close beforehand. I have that flexibility in terms of the notional base figure on the date of the coming into operation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The question was asked about employers who are in receipt of moneys from State agencies whether they would be totally excluded.  We have some power under the enabling legislation to have some discretion in the evaluation of particular cases.  Applications from employers who, for example, are currently in receipt of or have received grants or loans from the IDA. Fóir Teoranta, State agencies for promoting, encouraging and assisting employment, will be subject to special examination.  An IDA grant may relate to the provision of employment for, say, 40 workers on 1st October, 1975.  Under the scheme it is not proposed to give premiums to that employer in respect of those workers.  But if the employer should, as a consequence of the scheme, show that on 1st October, 1975, he employed 50 workers, he will then be entitled to receive premiums in respect of the ten additional employees.  I have already explained the case of employers receiving aid from Fóir Teoranta.  The intention is that the scheme should not in general offer conflict with any of Fóir Teoranta's rescue operations <Col N="1041" /> which might involve actual staff reductions for the greater security of the remaining staff.</P>
    <P>Senator West referred to the desirability of the scheme being extended to community workshops.  Perhaps in the autumn we can look at this suggestion It is not provided for at present, but when I am reviewing the operation of the scheme I will bear that very good suggestion of the Senator's in mind.</P>
    <P>Senator Halligan hopes the Bill will not cease in June, 1976.  I hope the need for the Bill will have disappeared in June, 1976.</P>

      <P>There is a great deal more that the State should be doing in the area of active involvement in the creation of employment by such means.  Perhaps, even in a period of full recovery the State should at all times have legislation that would provide it with a means to intervene decisively in particular sectors of our industry to ensure that employers in those industries can get the workers they need.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris referred to the need for expansion in reviewing the whole area of manpower.  He referred to the need for keeping our national training system in top gear even in times of recession.  This could not be more in accord with my own thinking on the subject.  We are this year in the process of spending almost £9 million. The greatest expansion even in our training programme has taken place this year for precisely that reason. We have this big unemployment problem.  This is the time for preparation. This is the time when our work force should be given the skills which will be required when recovery takes place. This is the most profitable thing we could be doing in this period of lull in economic activity.</P>
      <P>I have tried to cover as far as I could the points Senators raised.  I am sorry for being absent for some part of the debate, but I had to meet the ESB Officers' Association on another matter.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Title>Air Navigation and Transport (No. 2) Bill, 1975: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to close a loophole in the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1965, which has been brought to light by a recent case.  The Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1965, stipulates that an authorisation is required from the Minister for Transport and Power to operate an air service.  Air service is defined in the Act as a &ldquo;flight carrying passengers, cargo or mail for reward.&rdquo;  In 1966 the then Minister made an order under the Act which grants a general authorisation mainly for flights which are the subject of international agreements such as scheduled flights governed by bilateral agreements.  Other air services including most charter or non-scheduled flights require my specific authorisation.  In considering applications for authorisations from foreign carriers for charter flights, whether passenger or cargo, my Department has regard, <i>inter alia</i>, to Aer Lingus and Aer Turas, a cargo carrier.</P>
      <P>Recently a US owned and registered aircraft carried cattle from Shannon to the Continent on behalf of a farmer without an authorisation.  It was claimed that the aircraft was leased to the owner of the cattle and that consequently the flights, not being carriage for reward, did not fall within the definition of air service under the Act.  The lease in question, the validity of which has been challenged by me, provided for the hire of the aircraft for one month at a cost of $10 plus other unspecified valuable considerations. The matter is the subject of High Court proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case however reveals a loophole in the provisions of the 1965 Act relating to the operation of air services.  Anyone who has goods or people to transport on own account by air could do so without an authorisation <Col N="1043" /> by entering into on arrangement to lease an aircraft for a very short period or even for one flight.  A group of persons or firms could combine to lease an aircraft between them and use it freely for the carriage of goods owned by each of them individually. Such an arrangement could apply to incoming as well as outgoing flights. There are many foreign non-scheduled air carriers and leasing companies who would be only too anxious to enter into such arrangements and by price cutting to undermine the services provided by the Irish carriers and by reliable and reputable foreign carriers. Senators will appreciate that such devices, if extensively used, would frustrate the objectives of the relevant provisions of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1965.  Apart from the protection of the Irish carriers, the application and administration of the provisions of the Act make for orderly development of civil aviation, an objective enshrined in the Chicago Convention of 1944 subscribed to by most countries of the world engaged in civil aviation.</P>
    <P>The effect of the proposed amendment would be to bring all flights where passengers, cargo or mail are carried within the scope of the authorisation provisions of the Act.  This is necessary in order not only to cater for the case of leasing but also the possible cases of temporary and doubtful &ldquo;sales&rdquo; of aircraft effected for the purpose of circumventing the provisions of the Act.  The proposed new control encompasses certain classes of flights hitherto not subject to authorisation and which are freely allowed. These include emergency flights, pleasure flights, flights by small aircraft. I propose to authorise such classes of flights by way of including them under the general authorisation effected by the Air Services Authorisation Order, 1966, and so removing from them the requirement of obtaining individual authorisations.</P>
    <P>In recommending this Bill to the House, I should like to emphasise that it is not to be taken as an attempt by the Legislature to overrule the Judiciary. The Bill is merely for the purpose of plugging a loophole in the <Col N="1044" /> statutory controls which the case in question has revealed.</P>

      <P>Very briefly this is a very proper Bill.  I understand it came to notice during a debate in the Dáil when the Minister assured Deputy Barrett that he would bring in a Bill to plug this loophole, and he has promptly done so.  The dangers are obvious, enabling all sorts of doubtful carriers to engage in doubtful leasing arrangements.  Indeed, these types of doubtful arrangements were largely spawned here under the road transport legislation over the years when all sorts of doubtful leases and renting operations were entered into between carriers and, in particular, farmers, prior to the introduction of road haulage legislation to exclude agricultural products, in particular, cattle, sheep and pigs.  There was a whole corps of decisions of the courts in this respect which provided many loopholes which were operated from 1933 onwards.  There are, in my view, no cleverer people than some of our own people in matters of this kind.  There is a bit of a lawyer in most Irishmen.  I would be interested to know for the record, whether the idea of this leasing operation in regard to the aircraft from Shannon to the Continent was thought up by a Clare man or by the American carrier.  I know the case is <i>sub judice.</i></P>

      <P>The loophole has come to light, as I said in my opening speech, because of a leasing arrangement engaged in by a resident of Clare and a foreign operator of an aircraft. This is because of a new type of traffic, the carriage of calves from Ireland to Europe, that has developed only in the past 12 months.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to empower Bord na Móna to borrow the amount necessary to finance their third development programme. Bord na Móna, following the 1973 fuel crisis, carried out a review of bog areas which had previously been considered incapable of economic development.  As a result the board formulated their third major bog development programme.</P>
      <P>The board's initial development programme adopted in 1946 had as its main features the production of one million tons of sod peat annually, improvements in the Lullymore briquetting plant and the establishment of the first generation of turf fired power stations.  The second development programme launched in 1950 concentrated chiefly on milled peat production and since that date the annual milled peat output has been built up to around three million tons.  The success of that programme led to the erection of four additional peat fired power stations and two new major briquette factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third programme is being introduced at a time when the high cost of imported energy is inflating both domestic prices and the external deficit <Col N="1046" /> on the balance of payments.  In a White Paper entitled <i>A National Partnership</i> laid by the Government before both Houses of the Oireachtas last November, the need to accelerate the development of domestic sources of energy was emphasised.  Among the proposals listed in that White Paper towards that end was the board's third development programme.</P>
    <P>Under the third programme, in addition to the 130,000 acres of bog already in production, it is proposed to develop a further 40,000 acres from which annual production will be available as follows:&mdash; milled peat, 1.7 million tons; sod peat, 44,000 tons; moss peat, 600,000 bales; briquettes, 80,000 tons.  The additional milled peat supplies will be capable of sustaining 160 megawatts of electricity generating plant with the capacity to produce 700 million units of electricity annually. A new 80 megawatt unit will be erected at a site yet to be selected, additional units will be added to the milled peat stations at Lanesboro and Shannon-bridge and the lives of the stations at Ferbane and Rhode will be extended.</P>
    <P>Because of the increase in oil prices the cost of production of electricity from milled peat is comparable with that of production from oil.  Provided the present trend of world oil prices is maintained, it is expected that electricity generated from milled peat produced under the third programme will continue to be competitive with that produced from oil.</P>
    <P>The production of briquettes from milled peat ranks next in importance to the production of electricity from milled peat.  Since the rise in oil prices, briquettes have become more popular and production is now scarcely adequate to cope with the demand.  To meet the increased demand the board propose to erect a fourth briquette factory at a cost of £3.5 million and an annual output of 80,000 tons.</P>
    <P>Bogs at Coolnagun, Garrymore and Ballydermot will be developed at an estimated cost of £700,000 to produce 44,000 tons of sod peat annually.  This will be absorbed by the domestic, industrial and institutional demand for sod peat.</P>
    <P>As regards moss peat, four bogs at <Col N="1047" /> Gilltown, and Prosperous, County Kildare, Kinnegad, County Westmeath, and Ballivor, County Meath, are to be developed to yield a total annual production of 600,000 cubic metres of peat for processing at the moss peat factories at Kilberry and Coolnamona.  This production will be used partly to meet increasing factory demands and partly to replace reductions in bog outputs where some production areas are being cut away.</P>
    <P>The development involved in this programme will extend over Counties Tipperary, Laois, Offaly, Kildare, Kilkenny, Meath, Westmeath, Galway, Roscommon and Longford and will take about five years to complete.  It should provide continuous all-year-round employment for an additional 1,500 men rising to about 1,800 men during the peak production season. The board at present employ 4,500 men on a regular basis, a figure which rises to 5,500 during the peak production period.  The total cost of the programme, including the estimated cost of preparing the bogs by draining them, providing the necessary rail haulage services, production machinery, workshops and ancillary buildings, will be £28.5 million.</P>
    <P>The necessity for this Bill arises because the board have almost exhausted their existing statutory borrowing powers.  Under the Turf Development Acts the board may not borrow more than £28 million.  Their borrowings to date in respect of previous programmes total £27.7 million.  The Bill proposes to raise the borrowing limit to £60 million to cover the £28.5 million needed for the third programme and contingencies.  The Bill provides that the additional borrowings may be made in any currency and that repayment may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance in foreign currencies should the need to do so arise.  The Minister is already empowered to guarantee borrowings by the board in the currency of the State.</P>
    <P>In the case of the first and second programmes the necessary capital was advanced by the Exchequer but pressing demands on the Exchequer for other services could limit its capacity <Col N="1048" /> to meet the board's requirements in respect of the third programme.  The board have, therefore, been having discussions with their bankers about the possibility of raising finance from banking institutions.  No decision has yet been taken on how the programme will eventually be financed.</P>
    <P>A major difficulty which the board must face is how to remunerate their capital investment during the initial five years while the bogs are being got ready.  During this period there would be no production and hence no return to the board on the investment.  In the case of the first and second programmes this difficulty was overcome by allowing the board a waiver of interest in respect of Exchequer advances for the initial five-year period and a deferment of repayment of capital until after the expiry of that period.  The board have proposed that a similar waiver and deferment be granted in respect of Exchequer advances for the new programme.  I am at present in consultation with the Minister for Finance about the whole question of the financing of the programme. Meanwhile section 3 of the Bill would enable a waiver of interest on similar lines to the earlier programmes to be granted to the board should it be found necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>The adoption of this third programme of Bord na Móna represents an important step in our developing energy policy.  The events of 1973 and 1974 brought home to us the vulnerability of our energy supply position. The availability of cheap and abundant supplies of oil from the Middle East led us in this country, as it did in many other western countries, into a position of overdependence on a single energy source.  Moreover, it tended to stifle the incentive for the development of costlier alternative sources.</P>
    <P>The curtailment of oil supplies in late 1973 demonstrated the great insecurity of undue dependence on Middle East oil.  Moreover, the huge increases in oil prices added tremendously to the cost of energy, with repercussions on domestic consumers, industrial enterprises and almost all services.  These increased costs added to the difficulties already being experienced <Col N="1049" /> by business firms and thus aggravated the recession affecting the economy.  They also caused a sharp deterioration in the balance of payments position.</P>
    <P>In the light of these developments there is a clear need for a diversification of our energy sources so as to ensure improved security and stability. In the pursuit of this objective, priority must naturally be given to our native resources, because of security considerations, because of the balance of payments advantages and because the development of our own resources confers additional social and economic benefits.  An intensification of the turf development programme is fully compatible with these criteria.  It has, of course, been a basic aim of national policy to encourage the development of our bogs.  While the aim has been to pursue maximum economic development, the low price of oil which prevailed up to 1973 affected the scale and extent of previous bog development programmes.  In this respect, we should perhaps recognise that one effect of the energy crisis has been to lift the economic constraints which previously prevented the development of certain bog areas.  These previously uneconomic bogs will now be developed under the third programme.</P>
    <P>The opportunity presented by this Bill is being availed of to provide in section 5 two small but desirable improvements in the terms of the board's general employees' superannuation scheme.  That scheme was established under section 6 of the Turf Development Act, 1953.  Under its terms pensionable service dates only from the date on which an employee enters the board's employment.  Some members recruited at an age which precludes them from achieving the qualifying period for full pension are anxious to be permitted to purchase the additional years needed for such qualification by making additional contributions to the scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the same scheme, pensions of members who die in service are payable for five years and pensions of members who die within five years of retirement are payable until the fifth anniversary of retirement.  However, <Col N="1050" /> when the board introduced their widows' and orphans' pension scheme on 1st September, 1972, this facility lapsed for new entrants to the board's service as from that date.  Employees already on the board's staff who had been contributing towards this benefit were given the option of opting out of payment or retaining the benefit if they were prepared to pay the board's share of the contribution as well as their own.  If they decided to retain the benefit they would be required to pay an additional ½ per cent of their salary to the superannuation fund.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend this Bill to the House.  It will make an important contribution to our energy objectives, as I have explained earlier.  It will provide a social and economic boost to the midland counties whose prosperity is closely linked with the scale of activity of Bord na Móna.  It will be a vote of confidence in the board which have always enjoyed the strong support of the whole community for the progress they have made down through the years.  The board have earned a high reputation for technical innovation and development and they hold an important place in the fabric of rural life.  I am confident that the House will join with me in commending the board for their initiative in coming forward with this programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>We certainly welcome this Bill on this side of the House.  I am glad to be afforded the opportunity of saying a few words in praise of the excellent work performed down the years by Bord na Móna.  I want to pay a special tribute to the pioneers in that respect, notably Tod Andrews, Chief Engineer Maguire, Donegan, McGovern and all the people who were connected with the board from the very beginning.  They were a very dedicated staff.  Bord na Móna accomplished great things for this country. Irish people are not fully aware of many of the things which they have done.  They have been pioneers in the field of inventing special types of machinery for processing peat, and machines which were able to travel on soft peat and bog land.  People from countries as far away as Russia were very glad to come here and consult <Col N="1051" /> with our engineers and experts in Bord na Móna who, at that very early age in the history of our State, were fit to instil confidence not alone into their own employees but into the Irish people in general.</P>
      <P>They started at a difficult time in our history.  By their painstaking efforts since they have built up tremendous confidence in their ability. They captured a great percentage of the home market for the sale of their well known briquettes and moss peat. In every way they have established themselves and their products have sold in competition with imported fuels.  They were always keen to ensure that the less fortunate members of our community were able to buy a few bundles of briquettes.  They brought comfort into many homes where the dearer materials would not find their way.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that the Government recognise the need for this expansion. We depend far too much on imported energy-creating material from abroad, in particular oil and coal.  It was only natural in those years that the Government should look around and see what were the possibilities of providing some of that energy from the natural resources. Bord na Móna were set up as a result.</P>
      <P>One thing that has been puzzling me is why Bord na Móna are being asked to go abroad to borrow this money.  The Government are far too inclined to trot off to some foreign country to borrow money.  Other State-sponsored bodies got very substantial grants from the Exchequer in the past to keep them in existence. I cannot see why Bord na Móna have now been asked to go with their hat in their hand to some foreign country to seek finances part of which should be readily forthcoming from the Exchequer. They are as much entitled to grants as any other State-sponsored body.  However, the Bill empowers them to borrow abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad this Bill has come before the House because last April in my own home county of Cavan I was trying to induce many Fine Gael members on our county council to put forward a resolution to the Minister <Col N="1052" /> for Local Government and the Minister for Finance to provide us in that area with special grants for making roads into private bogs.  They were not of a nature which would attract in Bord na Móna.  I think Bord na Móna will eventually become interested in them because they have a smaller type of machine that could operate in those areas.  The Fine Gael members at that council meeting were dead against anything to do with turf. They were 100 per cent against the very provisions now in this Bill.  I hope they will get a copy of <i>The Anglo Celt</i> and read what the Minister has to say about the capabilities of turf to provide us with extra energy.</P>
    <P>There is another area&mdash;I am not sure whether it comes directly under Bord na Móna&mdash;in north-west Donegal where home produced turf is used to generate electricity.  Is the turf exhausted in that area?  It may be hand-won turf but at least there is an employment content in it, and it is used for creating energy.</P>
    <P>A request was made long ago that the Government and the Minister for Transport and Power should investigate the possibility of establishing a second coal-briquette burning station at Arigna.  Perhaps that does not come within the ambit of this Bill.  It is something that people will be asking questions about and rightly so, because these are areas where this energy is known to exist underneath the surface.  It is not miles out from Bantry Bay or the Waterford coast. It is in the country.  The Government should be using part of their expertise and resources in trying to locate, pinpoint and use an energy material they already know is there in abundance. With modern methods of excavating open-cast mining, and so on, it should not be beyond the competency of modern experts to deliver coal to that briquette factory at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>The production of briquettes from milled peat ranks next in importance to the production of electricity from milled peat.  These briquettes are very popular.  I am afraid that with the way inflation has hit this country and, in particular, by virtue of the fact that Bord na Mnóa are being asked to <Col N="1053" /> borrow abroad, the interest rate eventually will become top heavy for the board.  The board will not be able to repay the capital and interest and they will be forced to increase the price of these briquettes.  That would be a disaster because we are depending a lot on the consumption on the home market.  These briquettes are clean, well packed and very popular.  I would not like to see Bord na Móna being put in the unenviable position that they would have to price out of the market a very popular product which has made many a drawingroom fire and many a kitchen fire very pleasant places to sit around on winter nights.</P>
    <P>Anyone who travels through the midlands cannot but observe the tremendous change that has taken place since Bord na Móna were founded. It is very pleasant to recall names like Coolnagun, Garrymore and Ballydermot. All these names are fairly common and find a place in our school geographies.  It is a great tribute to Bord na Móna that this has taken place.  They have catered all down the line for the nation, but they have also seen to the workers.  They have provided living accommodation for them. They have built up little towns and created various social amenities and made it very pleasant for the workers and their families who have to live in what some people might call backward places.  They are ordinary accessible places in the very centre of our country.  They were very right to do that and they set the headline for many other industries in that respect too.  Anything that we can do in the diversification of energy sources here should be welcomed.  What the Minister proposes in this Bill is to expand as far as possible what he calls the third programme so far as bogs are concerned, to provide extra energy.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word regarding pensions mentioned here in the Minister's statement.  It refers to widows, orphans and so on.  It is only right that an institution such as Bord na Móna would have a scheme to cater for their dedicated workers who worked with them in the past.  They must take tremendous pride in the fact that they have produced this product. Whether we be at home or <Col N="1054" /> abroad we must see peat moss and briquettes being exported from this country, a product produced here, neatly packed, well advertised and now being sold in many European countries. Since our entry into the EEC these packets of peat moss have become familiar sights abroad, which is a great achievement.  Instead of feeling abashed at the old insulting remarks that we were bogmen, we can be proud now of that fact; that we are able to turn our bogs into something of great benefit to the nation and which will help also to reduce this terrible unemployment mountain which has come upon us in 1975.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I would be thankful if the Minister would refer to some of the points I have raised, not by way of criticism but by way of welcoming the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Dolan I would like to give the Bill a warm welcome and to join with the Minister in praising the initiative of the board in bringing forth this third programme.  At first sight it might seem a tremendous jump from a £28 million borrowing limit to £60 million.  The Minister has made a very sound case, as presented to him by the board, for raising the limit to this very substantial figure.  As everybody knows we are probably the most vulnerable country in the world as regards energy.  The fact that at present something like 70 per cent of our energy requirements are generated by imported oil gives some indication of the situation in which we found ourselves two years ago when the Middle East oil crisis struck us, as it did the rest of the world.  It is vitally important that the Government should press forward with every possible effort to find substitutions for imported energy sources and our natural resource, turf, is an obvious one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to developing a basic natural resource, turf development gives employment in areas where it is most badly needed.  The Minister said in his speech that the midlands and other areas always have been areas of high unemployment.  Anything that can help to increase the <Col N="1055" /> employment content in these areas is to be heartily welcomed even if the question of supplying more of our energy requirements from natural resources never arose.</P>
    <P>I notice that in the list of counties listed for development under this third programme no mention is made of Clare, Kerry or west Limerick.  I wonder if the reason is that the turf resources in these areas are now coming to an end.  I hope not.  Indeed if there are viable commercial deposits of turf still in these areas I would urge the Minister to include them in his development programmes or, through him, to urge the board so to do.  They are also areas of very high unemployment.  Any development, based particularly on native resources, would be very welcome in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not say in his speech what are our resources of turf <i>in toto</i>.  Probably it would be very difficult to give even a reasonably accurate figure.  But I do remember reading some years ago that our resources of turf were limited.  The fact that the whole price structure has changed with the enormous increase in the price of oil and, consequently, the value increase in the price of turf, coal and other energy-producing materials may make it possible to extend our resources of turf.  This is quite a normal situation not only in turf but in other natural resources all over the world where the rise in prices brings into the list of reserves or resources materials formerly regarded as uneconomic.  I would like to think that the same situation has happened in this country. It would be nice to think that there was an increase in the value of turf <i>vis-à-vis</i> the price of imported oil and other energy materials and that the price of turf will result now in a substantial increase in our native resources.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister, when replying, would indicate whether the price adjustment and the price value of turf means a more economic future for some of the small turf-burning stations in places like west Clare and elsewhere which, if they are not actually closed down, were certainly in danger of so doing.  In addition to opening up new turf-burning stations <Col N="1056" /> and new briquetting factories, an investigation should be carried out of the smaller turf-burning stations which were gradually&mdash;I think I am being correct in saying&mdash;being phased out under the board's programme but which now, due to the changed circumstances, may have become viable once again.</P>
    <P>It is a sensible step, although one I would not normally commend as good commercial practice, to waive the interest on the loans over the initial developing period of up to five years.  The substitution of native sources for imported sources is so important to this country that we should not hesitate to give every possible financial help by waiving or deferring of interest during the years of development.  In a case like this where it is a question of developing our own resources, I would not hesitate to borrow abroad.  It is good, sound economy. If our own financial resources do not run to financing a development of this kind, we should not hesitate to borrow abroad.  We are borrowing to develop our basic, natural resources.  I cannot think of a better investment.</P>
    <P>I wonder if any consideration has been given to borrowing from some of the EEC sources of funds, from the World Bank or from the European Investment Bank.  I understand that these financial institutions are concerned primarily with the development of natural resources and have given massive help to the Third World countries.  We could make a very good case for getting hold of some of these funds to further develop our turf resources.  I think this is a Bill that will be unanimously welcomed in this House.  The Minister and the board are to be congratulated on their initiative in pushing ahead with this third development programme.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to go into details.  I was not here when the Minister made his introductory remarks.  Coming from an area which has a considerable amount of bog, and having been born in a large bog area, I welcome this Bill which is to provide extra funds for Bord na Móna or indeed for any institution interested in the development of our bogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" /> I agree with Senator Russell.  I am very sorry that north and south Kerry, especially Lyracrompane, and indeed the other small bog areas, and the west Limerick bogs have not been mentioned.  In this critical time of the oil crisis we should be interested in small as well as large-scale ventures. To many thousands of families this will mean the difference between life and death, especially for the older people during the coming winter.</P>
    <P>As Senator Dolan said, there are several county councils which submitted schemes to the Minister before this Bill was mooted asking that some portion of the local improvement scheme money would be spent on bog roads and drains.  When oil was cheap many people stopped using turf and neglected bog roads and drainage. Many bog roads are now impassable and there is no way of getting the turf cut until the bogs are drained and the roads improved.  We should concentrate more on schemes for the smaller bogs, not the grandiose ones planned for the Bog of Allen where briquettes are made.  I would ask the Minister to devise some plan under which money would be channelled into these backward places where there are thousands of acres of bogland which could be opened now, as was done during the last war.  I would appeal to the Minister to give that plan serious consideration. We have been told that the local improvement scheme money cannot be used because the standard required is very high.  We are not asking that grandiose schemes be carried out on those bog roads; we are not even asking that they be surface dressed.  We are asking that some fund be set up and given to county councils for the improvement and drainage of those bog roads.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, this Bill has come too late for anything to be done this year but even if something could be done next year, I would regard it as better late than never.  There are no commercial bog areas in north Kerry and west Limerick.  I appeal to the Minister to give our cause some consideration.</P>

      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome this financial expansion for the Turf Board.  They are worthy of <Col N="1058" /> the highest commendations for their work in peat and bogland areas since their foundation.  Anyone going through the midlands today would be proud to notice the change in the economic and social life of people living there brought about through the board's developments.</P>
      <P>While we all abhor the situation brought about by the oil crisis in 1973 and 1974 with its balance of payments problems and so on, one lesson we must have learned was that, until that time, we had all forgotten that we had within our own territory large energy resources.  We had completely accepted the fact that oil was to be the whole basis of our future energy production.  That situation led the Turf Board into serious problems.  Fortunately, for the country's sake, the board continued their work and are now on the fringe of expansion, so urgently required for the country's energy situation and its balance of payments problem.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Uí Eachthéirn and Senator Russell, I regret that the boglands of the western counties are not mentioned.  In Kerry there are very large areas of bogland still capable of development.  The Turf Board have had a tradition in Kerry, in so far as they have been involved in two areas, Lyracrompane and Barna, the latter still a central point of development.  I would ask the Minister to urge the board, now that opportunities exist for sales of peat and peat products, to expand into those areas of the west where there are still adequate boglands for development.  This will result not only in extra native fuel but will give a fillip to employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also the smaller ESB turf-burning stations.  One of the original ones was established in Caher-civeen. This station is supplied mainly through private turf production.  I would ask the Minister to urge on the board that it is vital to areas with an increasing demand for electricity that they, with private producers, step in and ensure that not only are the present requirements of these small stations met but, if at all possible, that they be expanded.  This would have a beneficial effect on the balance of payments, <Col N="1059" /> on employment and on the general level of economic and social life of the community.</P>
    <P>There is the other aspect also, the resumption of a substantial volume of private turf production following the substantial increase in the price of oil and other fuels.  This is something which the Department of Finance and the Department of Local Government must consider in the same light as the turf board are doing, that is, with a view to expansion.  This can be done only if additional financial facilities are afforded to local authorities for road and drainage development in bog areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome and support the Bill. I would urge the Minister to ensure that in its implementation, the board will expand their operations to all those bogs capable of development with a view to increasing their productivity, making more native fuel available and increasing employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the introduction of the Bill and Bord na Móna on the work they have done since their establishment.  I come from an area in which the name Bord na Móna is synonymous with employment and a sense of well-being.  Much of North Mayo, until recently, was dependent totally on bog development for employment.</P>
      <P>Like Senators from Kerry, I am disappointed that Mayo has not been mentioned in the Bill.  We have had in Mayo major development of turf by Bord na Móna in supplying milled peat to the power station at Bellacorick. Naturally, we should like to see further development because we understand that there is room for expansion in that area.  One has only to look at present development and see bog stretching to the horizon on all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention one rather ludicrous point which shows that Bord na Móna have progressed a long way since their early days.  I remember some relations of mine being brought to the midlands to work for Bord na Móna on bog development.  <i>En route</i> they passed through 30 miles of solid, <Col N="1060" /> blanket bog.  After some short years Bord na Móna saw fit to commence development in the Bellacorick area of north Mayo.  It goes without saying that the days of having bogland referred to as wasteland are gone.  Bogland, as such, here could become a veritable goldmine in so far as resources for energy are concerned.  We all know the consequences of the 1973 oil crisis.  It did one good thing, as the Minister mentioned in his statement: it brought to mind how important was bog development; indeed it may have been an incentive to us. The Minister said that the 1973 crisis was an incentive to the formation of the third programme of expansion by Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of bog development I should like to mention.  It concerns the cut-away bogs.  I know that An Foras Talúntais have undertaken an in-depth survey.  In fact they have established a research station to ascertain how feasible it is to develop bog along agricultural lines, what crops and so on might be suitably planted in bogland.  This is an area where Bord na Móna are not involved in bog development.  As time goes on, Bord na Móna will be left with a vast acreage of cut-away bog on their lands. I wonder if the Minister has any policy in mind with regard to the further development of cut-away bog. In some instances, it is being used for sheep grazing, a very worthwhile project. I wonder could cut-away bog be used by local people?  Could it be divided among local farmers, or would the extent to which it would have to be fertilised be prohibitive for local farmers to ensure that the fertility rate of the land would be maintained? These are matters about which I know little.  They are questions with which Bord na Móna, or some other agency connected with them, should be concerned.</P>
    <P>There are vast areas of bog here which could produce energy at a price competitive with that produced by oil. If we are to believe economists and accept their prognostications, we must assume that the cost of imported fuel will increase and continue to increase. We have proved, through Bord na Móna, that we have manpower and <Col N="1061" /> the technical &ldquo;know-how&rdquo;.  Senator Dolan mentioned that the technical &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; of the employees of Bord na Móna is second to none.  As far as I know they have proved their capacity for inventiveness, both at home and abroad, in producing new machinery and new innovations for the development of bogs, which have been acclaimed by people in places as far away as Russia.  The production of turf as a source of energy, be it in milled sod or briquette form, is to be commended.  I often wonder if we have been doing enough in the past to expand this native source of energy, which is traditional and about which we all know so much.  There are very few of our people who have not at one time or another during their lives used turf.</P>
    <P>The increase from £28 million to £60 million is to be welcomed.  I hope that in this expenditure the Minister might see his way to including a further expansion of the work at Bellacorick producing milled peat for the power station.  With the proposed local industrial expansion my logic tells me&mdash;my knowledge of electricity is negligible&mdash;that if a source of energy is produced at local level it will cost less.  Any further expansion of native resources is to be welcomed, in that it will provide employment, will show that our boglands are not wastelands but a very definite national asset there to be used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has given all sides of this House an opportunity to pay tribute to Bord na Móna, a fitting tribute to a body that, down through the years, particularly in periods of economic depression in rural employment and so on, has always had the respect of the community, particularly the rural community, so dependent on them to provide employment in areas which would not benefit from industrial employment, as such.  This wealth of energy is God-given.  They are the producers of this energy.  They produce fertilisers which are used extensively in the horticultural world, and the valuable by-product of peat moss is used extensively in rural areas as bedding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under all headings, the board have <Col N="1062" /> produced an excellent product which has always found a ready market, even in times of very cheap alternative fuel.</P>
    <P>We talked about the possibility of borrowing in the Bill.  Senator Russell quite rightly said there was nothing wrong with borrowing, especially borrowing from abroad, to develop our natural resources.</P>
    <P>Senator Dolan was incorrect in stating that the Minister was insisting, asking or ensuring that the board would borrow abroad.  My interpretation of the Minister's opening remarks was that it was optional for the board to borrow in any currency of their choosing, foreign or otherwise, if the need arises, and nothing could be clearer than that.  If anybody in this country wishes to invest in Bord na Móna, the board will welcome that investment.  An investment in the board would give an extra impetus to them to develop our natural resources.  This is a much sought-after resource, especially if we consider the situation in regard to oil.  If we are not prepared to develop our own natural resources, not alone of oil but of turf and so on, it would be a very bad fiscal policy of any Government if they did not allow such borrowing to take place.  To borrow to develop the natural resources is certainly a much better financial policy than to allow payments and a draining of our reserves on the importation of oil to be used in this country.</P>
    <P>The third programme, as it is referred to, is most desirable and it will be possible, with this additional capital which is in this enabling Bill, to raise the borrowing limit to £60 million.  I am pleased that my own county of Tipperary is included in this development programme.  The location as has been mentioned previously in other announcements, is considered to be the Littleton-Ballingarry area of County Tipperary. This is very significant, of course, in view of the fact that that is adjacent to the Ballingarry mining area which is another producer of home energy but, unfortunately, has closed, and closed before it was realised how <Col N="1063" /> important it would have been to have Ballingarry mines in operation just now with our fuel crisis.  An extension by Bord na Móna into this area will certainly give a tremendous boost to employment which has been depressed in the area and the area has been specified by the IDA as a designated area for employment purposes.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made by the Minister to the relevant comparable price <i>vis-à-vis</i> oil and the home-produced products like turf.  In view of the continuing unsettled Middle East situation, we should join with the Minister in commending the board on such confidence in their product as to carry out such a massive programme of expansion as outlined.</P>
    <P>Many of our institutions, county council offices, health board offices, hospitals and so on, have changed over to oil for heating and cooking in the last decade.  They did that at that stage for economical reasons and convenience.  It is now rather embarrassing for us members of such institutions and those of us responsible for their economic running to realise that most of these conversions have now taken place and we will not be able to benefit as fully as we should have done from this increase in production of our native turf.</P>
    <P>However, we must consider ourselves fortunate that our other home producer of energy, the Electricity Supply Board, are geared in such a way that they can avail fully of the increase in home-produced energy.  We also welcome the fact that the Minister for Local Government made recent stipulations that in future all council houses will have chimneys. The home consumers of turf can look forward to an adequate supply of the commodity which it is accepted will bring life to any room in a house.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the improvements the Minister has outlined in the pensions scheme.  There are, I understand, some further anomalies remaining, and I would look forward to some legislation in the near future which would enable such anomalies to be cleared.  I welcome this step forward towards that clearance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be described as ironical that the Government may in the near future borrow £30 million from the oil sheiks to invest in turf production in this country. While I may feel that it is ironical, nevertheless like other Members of this House, I would welcome investment in turf production from borrowings at home or abroad.  Investments of this kind and borrowing for investment of this kind are much more useful than borrowing abroad to pay the day-to-day expenses the Government incur.</P>
      <P>I do not intend saying very much on this subject except to express my disappointment that there appears to be no mention whatsoever in the Minister's speech of any of the £30 million the Government propose to invest in the time to come being spent in my own native county of Donegal, a county that has as much bogland as any county in this country.  We hear the lip service being paid to the west and north-west of Ireland, but the Government could divert some of this money there.  In other branches of the industry good reasons may be put forward why it would be an uneconomic proposition to invest too much money in certain parts of the western seaboard, but surely as far as turf production is concerned, this cannot be said.  It would appear the most of the money is being spent or will be spent in Kildare, Westmeath and Meath.  I would urge the Minister this evening to pay particular attention to my own county of Donegal where, even yet, thousands of acres of bogland are untapped and unused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years there has been a tendency on the part of the Forestry Division to buy up good parts of bogland, land or bogs, that would be much more useful if developed for peat.  The forestry have other fields to explore.  There is plenty of land in Ireland unsuitable for any purpose other than forestry.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should have consultations with the Forestry Division and discourage them, if possible, from buying land that is suitable for turf production.  While I recognise the importance of the plantation of trees, this could be done in the areas that <Col N="1065" /> would not interfere with turf production.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Senator Ferris in his reference to the use of oils in hospitals, county council offices and State institutions.  The time has come, with the price of oil being so expensive, when Government Departments must urge the various bodies, both State and semi-State, if possible, to change to the use of turf.  It would not alone help to give employment at home but would have a very important effect on our balance of payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I expected&mdash;and I am very pleased about it&mdash;this Bill has been welcomed by the Seanad.  A number of speakers have referred to the fact that our appreciation of the value of the turf we were walking on came very late.  It took an Arab oil embargo and a quadrupling of the price of oil in the last 18 months to bring us to our senses in this regard. As I said in my opening speech, and as Senator Ferris and Senator O'Toole said, there is the effect of this on our balance of payments in that we have to find £150 million extra every year to pay for this oil.  £150 million is approximately £50 per head per annum of the population.  I myself have six children which means I have to find £8 per week to pay for that oil.  What we should have been doing is working harder to earn that £8 per week, but we have been paying £8 per week, without producing anything to compensate for that.  That is one of the problems of the inflation we have at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This law applies not just to an individual or to a household or to a business, but to the country as well, that if we are going to pay £150 million a year extra for the increased amount of oil we are importing here, we have got to produce £150 million worth of goods extra to export to pay for that. We can ask ourselves whether we have been doing that or not.  Certainly this third development programme of Bord na Móna goes some of the way towards reducing the £150 million by bringing into production another 40,000 acres of boglands in the country on top of the 130,000 <Col N="1066" /> already in existence.  Senator O'Toole asked me what we were going to do with these cut-away bogs when they are finished, and somebody said we may overcut them and overproduce from them, with the result that what is left of the bogs is not of much use.</P>
    <P>I again found in the Dáil, when we were putting this Bill through, that there was a little bit of confusion here where people are inclined to think that this third development programme is to cut the bogs further down.  In fact, it is not; it is to cut them further out&mdash;in other words, bring into production increased boglands.</P>
    <P>This is being made possible by the increase in the price of oil.  Senator Aherne used the phrase which I still hear used fairly frequently, that is, &ldquo;while the oil crisis lasts&rdquo;.  This crisis may last forever.  This is not something we can wish away.  We have to wake up to the fact that we are going to have to pay increased prices for the oil and energy we import for as long as we can see.  It will not even suit us to have that increased price dropped too dramatically.  We must remember that the generation of electricity from oil up to October, 1973, was very much cheaper than the generation of electricity from turf at that stage.  Figures in this connection may be of interest to the Deputies.  At the moment we generate about 63 per cent to 65 per cent of our electricity from oil, about another 24 per cent from peat or turf, and only 10 per cent from hydro, the baby from which the whole electricity network in the country grew, and the balance of 1 per cent or 2 per cent is from imported coal or coal from the Arigna mine.</P>
    <P>This has been reversed in the last 18 months.  The price of electricity generated from turf is now cheaper than from oil at the inflated price we are now enjoying.  This of course, carries another bonus, in as much that oil available at under one dollar a barrel in the Middle East did not make people form queues outside the door of the Department of Industry and Commerce looking for exploitation licences for our Continental Shelf for oil and gas.  I saw, in fact, a figure recently indicating that probably the <Col N="1067" /> cheapest oil that will be produced in the North Sea&mdash;we have no figures yet or indeed oil; we have gas off the south coast&mdash;runs between three dollars and four dollars a barrel to produce. That is four times the cost of the Middle East production.  If the price of Middle East oil goes back to two dollars a barrel those licences are only to paper the walls with, because nobody is going to invest their money to put rigs and platforms on our Continental Shelf to bring oil ashore at a price that is four times the price at which it can be got in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>Even though we complain about the disruption of our lives because of the quadrupling of oil prices, it has its bonuses for us, the development of our Continental Shelf and the third development programme of Bord na Móna.  When we get the natural gas ashore in 1978 or 1979 what we are allocating to the ESB should provide about 30 per cent of our then needs of electricity, that on top of the existing 24 per cent.  As the demand grows that 24 per cent will not alter in ratio until the total demand gives us over 50 per cent to 55 per cent generated within our control and reduces this hopeless dependence we still have on imported oil.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of me and of the Government&mdash;and I would like to answer those criticisms as I have done on a number of occasions here and in the other House and outside it &mdash;because of our decision to allocate portion of the find off the south coast for the generation of electricity.  The expert opinion available to the critics in the press, and elsewhere of the semi-wastage of using natural gas to generate electricity is just as much available to the Government.  The Government knew this criticism would be levelled at them, but they took the decision on the basis that security of supplies for the generation of electricity as an energy source was a number one priority and that we should fight our way to a 100 per cent self-sufficiency in energy.  We must never again allow ourselves to be in the position where decisions taken thousands of miles away by people over whom we have <Col N="1068" /> neither influence nor control could totally disrupt our economy, not just in the short time or, as Senator Aherne says, &ldquo;while the emergency lasted&rdquo; but for our lives and our children's lives and our children's children's lives. These are the considerations that motivated the Government.  Even though you can get efficiency of over 90 per cent by using natural gas for the manufacture of fertiliser or for direct use through pipelines into kitchens for cooking and home heating, while the use of natural gas for the generation of electricity will be somewhere over 40 per cent, we made our decision because we decided the first priority was self-sufficiency in electricity generation. It is for this reason of self-sufficiency that I welcomed and brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas, and that the Dáil and the Seanad have welcomed, the third development programme of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>As Senator Dolan said, Bord na Móna have been for nearly 40 years innovators, experimenters, huge employers in areas where there was not much other employment and where it was difficult to entice other industry to go.  Bord na Móna pioneered in that field.  As Senator O'Toole said, they invented and put together machines that people have come from all over the world to see and purchase, even from Russia.  However, the objectives and ambitions of Bord na Móna are wider and greater than their desire merely to have plaudits thrown at them here by me.  They want to increase their employment; they want to extend bog development and they want to devise a policy for 30 or 40 years' time.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell wanted to know how far we had to go in regard to bog production.  It is little better than an educated guess as to what will happen to those cut-away bogs afterwards. They are now thinking in those terms and they have at the moment cultivated cut-away bogs for sheep-grazing, cattle grazing, growing shrubs and a number of things, on about 700 acres, which may be small when you take into account that their total acreage is 160,000.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the philosophy behind the introduction of this Bill.  I <Col N="1069" /> am very pleased with the welcome it has been given by both sides of the House and also the welcome it was given in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Senator Dolan asked why we should borrow money abroad.  Senator Russell took the opposite point of view and said that all sources of borrowing should be open to Bord na Móna.  That is correct.  Up to now Bord na Móna were not allowed to borrow except from the Exchequer. To broaden that field they were allowed to borrow money from other sources.  They are in consultation at the moment with the European Investment Bank and with a number of banks in the United Kingdom and in Europe about the availability of funds. They would not get grants anyhow. They would have to repay and pay the interest on the money they borrowed from the Exchequer.  A waiver of interest and repayment was given for the first five years while the bogs were got into production.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell, Senator McGlinchey and a number of other Senators referred to the fact that some of the bogs were not being developed.  Bord na Móna will not rest on the third development plan.  They will move on and are very much alive to the bog areas which they have not yet covered.  Hopefully, there will be a fourth, fifth and sixth development plan by Bord na Móna.  Economics play a part in this.  There are bogs which at present prices can now be economically developed.  There are other small bogs which it would not be economic at the moment to develop. Circumstances change and, hopefully, the other bogs will become economic in the future.</P>
    <P>As regards the bogs in Kerry and Clare they are considered too shallow and are not suitable for development by the board's present methods.  In Kerry the gradings are too steep. There are outcrops of rock which make it very difficult for the machinery to be used on these bogs.</P>
    <P>As regards the local authority grant for bog roads, the only grant for bog roads that comes within my Department is for the development of roads for the delivery of turf to the existing bogs or to existing stations at Gweedore, <Col N="1070" /> County Donegal, Screeb, County Galway, Miltown Malbay, County Clare and Cahirciveen, County Kerry.  I understand the position in Local Government is that they give local amenity grants to the various county councils.  It is up to a county council to allocate those grants.</P>

      <P>The only other point I should like to make is in regard to the use of cut-away bogs.  There are 700 acres of them at the moment.  The selling of shrubs from these bogs alone has proved quite a profitable business for Bord na Móna in the last number of years.  A decision as to what will be done with the bogs at the end of their life need not be made by Bord na Móna.  The debate, the argumentation and claims of different sections of the community for the use of these bogs can be put forward.  Bord na Móna's claim is that they have an existing work force there when the bogs are finished and that it is desirable to get employment for them.  As against that an argument could be put forward by agricultural interests that these bogs should be taken over by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries <Col N="1071" /> or the Department of Lands and that they should be divided among farmers or farmed collectively.  This debate could go on without any commitment on anybody's side for the next five or seven years before a firm decision has to be taken as to what can be done with them.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Seanad for the very warm and very informed welcome it has given to this Bill.  I agree with all the speakers regarding the marvellous work that has been done by Bord na Móna.  They have a very bright future.  There is such a high level of intelligence and ingenuity in the board that even without the oil crisis, which allowed this third development programme to come into operation, they would have devised other means.  It would not have been beyond their capabilities to devise other means of utilising their labour force, their engineering capabilities and the natural resources under their command.</P>

      <P>Now that we propose giving extra money to Bord na Móna I feel that the board, with this money, should expand their activities in a certain direction.  I certainly agree with everything that has been said about Bord na Móna in the tremendous work they have done.  The work has been so good that the time has come when the Minister should give them responsibility for all bog development, irrespective of whether it is for their own operations or not. Not alone should they be looking at the turf production they require but they should encourage bog development in the private sector as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lead is required because of the international situation and the oil crisis, for the production of turf from <Col N="1072" /> private bogs.  People should be given encouragement to cut their own turf. A system of grants could be operated by Bord na Móna.  They are the most qualified body to do this.  This is something that I would like the Minister to give particular attention to.  Apart from Bord na Móna's own operations, there is no lead as far as turf production is concerned.  Possibly, in the past this was not necessary.  It was very annoying that the Minister should tell us in his closing speech about the cost of oil production in the future.  It will be very necessary in future that a body such as Bord na Móna should not alone expand their own operations but encourage as many people in the private sector as possible to engage in this activity.</P>
    <P>I accept what the Minister has just said that with the extra money given to Bord na Móna they must first consider economic bogs.  This is a realistic approach.  However I think the Minister will accept there are many bogs in this country and, in particular, in my own county that may not be considered economical in so far as Bord na Móna's operations are concerned. They, nevertheless, have a very important role to play in turf production. The people who own these bogs and use them should be given some financial encouragement by way of grant to buy small machinery to develop the bogs not for commercial use but to sell turf in their own neighbourhoods.  Great use could be made of these bogs without having to get involved in a major scheme.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to intervene but the Senator is speaking at some length on this topic which is essentially a question concerning the functions of Bord na Móna and certainly it would have been, shall we say, perhaps closer to the Bill on Second Stage.  On Committee Stage on section 2 I would be glad if the Senator did not speak at length.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This allows Bord na Móna to increase their borrowing from the existing limits of £28 million up to £60 million.  In fact, this difference <Col N="1073" /> is already being allocated to the third development programme and some other small contingencies.  I know that private developers of bogs can hire machinery, co-operatively or individually, from the sugar company to do this but I will discuss what the Senator has said with Bord na Móna, in the context of not wishing to have their attention diverted from the third development programme.  They have set themselves a very tight deadline for this and I do not want them in any way to dilute their energies when achieving that deadline.</P>

      <P>Have the Government any plans to inject money into Bord na Móna in case they are not able to do what is expected here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <P>I also want to mention &mdash;I think the Minister also mentioned the point&mdash;the need for public buildings, schools, hospitals and so on to get back to using native fuel and, in particular, Bord na Móna fuel and encouraging the development of the smaller bogs, as Senator McGlinchey said.  That is tremendously important and it will make the people of this country oil conscious.  It will be far better propaganda than all the Minister can say regarding the oil crisis and the price of oil if it is seen that the Government are in earnest, that they are going around seeking out every little piece of worthwhile bog in the country and that they are preventing the foresters from planting it over.  That is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true. I should like to see as much turf as possible used in public institutions.  As regards the point made by Senator Dolan of giving extra money to Bord na Móna to allow them to engage in other activities, I know that there is a school of thought that asks why do the Government come back frequently to the House of the Oireachtas looking for an increase in the borrowing limits of various State companies.  In this case we are increasing it from £28 million to £60 million.  It is right that State companies should put specific proposals to the Government and that the Government should come <Col N="1074" /> into both Houses of the Oireachtas frequently to have the affairs of the particular State companies debated. If, say, we decided to increase from £28 million to £90 million Bord na Móna's limits for borrowing, it might be another five years before Bord na Móna would be discussed here and in the meantime they could spend this money just on my say so and the Minister for Finance's say so as to how they should do it.  It is far better that we should come in here frequently and allow the Deputies elected by the people and the Senators to have their say on what should be the correct attitude of Bord na Móna on this.  It is much more desirable than giving them large sums of money infrequently and allowing them do as they like with them.</P>

      <P>I fully agree with what the Minister has just said.  Earlier he stated that all the money sought under section 2 has been earmarked for the board's third programme.  I certainly accept that this money should be devoted to this purpose. If the Minister found a volume of support for the suggestion I made a few minutes ago that the board's activities should be expanded to accept responsibility for all turf production in this country, I take it that he would come back again to the Oireachtas seeking extra moneys for this purpose?</P>
