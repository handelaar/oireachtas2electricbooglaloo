    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan) Patrick S. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Retirement benefits for former members of the Permanent Defence Force, including the Army Nursing Service, and the Chaplaincy Service are provided for in Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes made by the Minister for Defence, with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act, 1932, as amended and adapted.  Section 4 of the 1932 Act prescribes that no pension scheme shall come into force unless and until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and has been confirmed by resolution of each House.  Section 2 of the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Act, 1968 exempts from this statutory requirement of confirmation pension schemes which provide for increases in retirement benefits arising out of increases in Army pay or increases in public service pensions generally.  Other schemes must come before each House for confirmation. This procedure takes up the time of <Col N="1046" /> the Houses discussing the detailed schemes, many of which though, perhaps, complex in form are of no great significance.  It may also entail lengthy delays for people who are waiting to be paid the benefits.  In practice, the whole trend of the schemes has been towards improvements.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to dispense entirely with the requirement of confirmation by resolution and will thus facilitate both the Legislature and the beneficiaries of schemes.  The Seanad will still be able to keep a watch on matters because of the provision requiring schemes to be laid before each House, with power to annul them.</P>
      <P>I may mention also that Senators have on occasions expressed the view that they could well be spared the necessity for confirming these pension schemes.</P>
      <P>I should like to add that this Bill has nothing to do with special allowances, and nothing to do with a means test.  It is merely a cleaning up of the legislation and putting things in order so that it is possible to pay pensions to people quicker.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>This is a welcome improvement on procedures that have heretofore been in operation in regard to payment of Defence Forces pensions.  There is no opposition to the Bill from this side of the House. We welcome the Bill and regard it as a desirable and sensible improvement in relation to procedure and the expedition of payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesSanfey" hpid="Mr. Sanfey Mr. Sanfey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sanfey</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill, on behalf of our party.  As the Minister explained, its purpose is to streamline procedure for promulgating pension schemes in the Defence Forces.  Although it entails only procedural changes it will, nevertheless, have the effect of speeding up the granting of pensions and anything that can be done in this line is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister spoke here previously I availed of the opportunity of asking him to endeavour to consolidate the mass of legislation relating to Army pensions into a simple <Col N="1047" /> and readable form.  In this connection I was pleased to note that when replying to the debate on this Bill in the Dáil last week the Minister adverted to this problem and said he hoped to get down to the task soon.</P>
    <P>I wish to bring to the Minister's notice an injustice that exists in regard to Army pensions, more so than to pensioners in other branches of the State service, and it is the question of abatement of some pensions. Members of the Defence Forces in receipt of service pensions and disability pensions do not enjoy both pensions.  It is the practice that they get only the whole of the greater pension and half the lesser one.  This is an injustice and, as a public representative, I have received representations from people who feel that this is unfair discrimination against members of the Defence Forces.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on the substantial improvements he has brought about in conditions in the Defence Forces, generally, since he came to office two years ago.  I wish him success in his future efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Mr. West Mr. West">
      <NameTxt>Mr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  On numerous occasions when speaking about pensions in the Defence Forces I suggested that legislation of this nature should be introduced.  I am glad the Minister got round to doing it.  It will save time when dealing with every small change in the emoluments paid as pensions to our Defence Forces.  I support Senator Sanfey in his plea to the Minister, and his Department, to consolidate the mass of legislation involving Army pensions.  I am interested in problems dealing with Army pensions and I believe everybody agrees that our Defence Forces must be adequately remunerated and when they retire they must receive adequate pensions. We must keep our Army strength up and to do this we have to pay our personnel.  We have to ensure that when they retire they are in the same category as people who retire from the civil service.  They have pensions which adequately keep pace with the cost of living and the price index and with inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" /> Up to now every small change has had to be dealt with by a separate piece of legislation in the House.  It shocked me when I traced back through the legislation to find out exactly how much legislation there had been over the years.  I presume the reason for this initially was that Army pensions were a contentious issue in the 1920s when there was a dispute as to who would get the money, when the issue was a political one.  When one party was in power one group of people got pensioned off and when another party was in power another group of people got pensioned off.  We might reflect that, after a period of civil strife such as the 1920s, one of the best ways of getting people to give up the gun and to take up a peaceful way of life was to pay them off.  Our Army pensions legislation and some of our old IRA pensions legislation was directed towards this end.  If it achieved its end, then it certainly was worthwhile.</P>
    <P>We may indeed again be faced with a situation, in another part of the country, in which similar measures are necessary.  However, this period is over in the Republic and, therefore, it is time for a measure of this nature, which allows the Minister to lay an order before both Houses of the Oireachtas, to be brought in instead of continuing to introduce a new Bill every time a small change needs to be made.  Inflation is increasing at such a rate nowadays that such Bills have been very frequent.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, as I have asked him before, about an anomaly concerning the position of single men in the Forces.  It concerns the non-payment of gratuities.  Up to recently when a married officer retired he would get his pension which was a certain proportion of his salary, and then he would get a gratuity to allow him to settle into civilian life.  Perhaps he had to buy a house because he had been living in barracks and this gratuity was to help him and his family move into civilian life.  These gratuities were not paid to single men. Of course the position for single men was particularly difficult in that they <Col N="1049" /> were compulsorily in barracks.  Often the married personnel had moved out of barracks in their later years of service.  Single men remained in barracks and, therefore, they had to make the bigger adjustment when they moved to civilian life and settled down.  No gratuity was paid to single men.  On other occasions I have gone through the details and given the Minister figures concerning the number of people involved.  The total expenditure would be minimal and the number of people involved relatively small because of course gratuities apply only to people who have done a long term of service&mdash;15 or 20 years.  I should like to ask the Minister if he has made any provision for the payment of gratuities to single men.  We have spent much time in our legislation ensuring that married people and women are not discriminated against.  Why should we persist in discriminating against single men? As a bachelor I feel this particularly myself and I hope that the Minister will look into the problem of the payment of resettlement gratuities to single men.</P>
    <P>Along with Senator Lenihan and Senator Sanfey, I welcome the Bill.  It is necessary and will save time and trouble.  I hope, as Senator Sanfey has said, that the Minister and his Department will get round to the rather big task of consolidating all our Defence Forces pensions legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation, which is aimed at making more expeditious the adjustment of retirement pensions for Army personnel including the Army nursing service and the chaplain service. The existing legislation to some extent created delays in the adjustment of the pensions of retired personnel.  In view of the rapid rate of inflation it is absolutely essential that the pensions and retirement allowances of former members should be kept in line with current rates of salaries and wages.  The Bill will do a good job and I hope it will end any frustration that existed heretofore because of the late adjustment of pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support two points made, first of all, the plea made by Senator Sanfey and Senator West for the consolidation of legislation concerning the payment of retired military personnel.  Senator Sanfey's point about abatement and the fact that the two pensions cannot be granted simultaneously is one well taken, and also Senator West's point about the situation of the unmarried soldier who is retiring and is not granted a gratuity.  Senator West has frequently spoken of this subject.  We should give him total support in this matter.  Bringing piecemeal measures again and again before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the case of the Army, when we do not do it in the case of the civil service, is an anomaly in the first place.  In the second place, it is important to note that soldiers are called upon to place themselves uniquely in hazardous circumstances. The unmarried soldier in particular has a problem in settling back into civilian life.  Every possible effort should be made to help him in that regard because there are problems of loneliness and readjustment. Those problems should not be increased by difficulties, particularly the difficulty in regard to gratuities which seems to be one of discrimination.  At the end of a long career of service which involves danger, hazards, sacrifices and very often unusual social deprivation such as loneliness and separation from family, the question of double pension should not be questioned.  Both pensions should be granted.</P>
      <P>I should again like to support Senator West's suggestion that there should be a consolidation of all laws and regulations relating to emoluments, pensions and retirement gratuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that the Minister had the foresight to see that it was necessary to have a proper procedural arrangement in this respect. At the present rate of inflation the Minister might have had to come back on about four occasions between now and the end of the year.  Secondly, I should like to support Senator Sanfey's point regarding the question of abatement. <Col N="1051" /> People who work for the State leave themselves open to certain risks and are absent from their homes at certain times.  They are also forced to pay social welfare contributions and yet have no rights in that respect.</P>
      <P>The State seems to have the lien on the benefit by deciding that she can take the greater of the two.  In that respect, this is an anomalous situation. The situation may not be exactly as I have stated, but if I got Senator Sanfey's message right, most people will agree that this anomalous situation should be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Miss Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill.  The security ensured in it to Army personnel will no doubt have a great effect on future recruitment.  In these times recruitment is not easy.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the section in which the Minister has seen fit to give recognition to members of the Defence Forces who have acted in a nursing capacity.  This is long overdue. They are the cinderellas of the Defence Forces, who are very often forgotten and who carry out a very worthwhile service.  The widows of Old IRA pensioners should also be amply looked after.  In general, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan) Patrick S. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Members for their acceptance of this Bill.  Senator Sanfey mentioned the question of consolidation of legislation.  In this regard, there is nothing stopping us except that it is an enormous job.  We have a huge volume of different Acts of Parliament.  While consolidating all these Acts would simplify things and make it easier for Senators and Deputies to examine them, it would not improve things.  While we are very anxious to do this the position is that since 1969 the senior staff capable of doing this work have not been available in the Department of Defence.  As soon as they are available, the work will be done.  While it is a great irritation that one must look up five or six Acts of Parliament to get what one wants, consolidation of itself would not change existing benefits. Changes in benefits occur only as a result of a decision by the Government, <Col N="1052" /> with the sanction of the Department of Finance, and a proposal by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Senator Sanfey referred to the actual money received by a person entitled to a disablement pension and an Army pension.  He does not get the total amount of the two pensions; he gets the greater pension plus one-half of the lesser.  The whole of the disablement pension is free from tax.</P>
      <P>The pension code is very involved. One could look at things and say they should be different.  A civil servant may find himself in the same position. When his two pensions come to five-sixths of his salary, he gets no more. The Army man is in the position that he gets the greater pension plus one-half of the lesser.  This normally works out at around the same figure. We cannot have one group of pensioners receiving more than another. I am not putting this subject aside.  I will certainly examine it.  My point is that they are different.</P>
      <P>Army pensions must be different from civil service pensions because Army personnel are serving under different conditions and retiring ages differ from those in the civil service. An Army officer may retire at 56, 58, 60 years; if he is an engineer or a doctor, he may stay until he reaches 65, but a civil servant may serve on to 65.  So whether you want pensions to be exactly equal, whether you want them to be better or worse, of necessity <i>ipso facto</i> they are basically different.  If there is an injustice on the abatement matter I will certainly look at it.</P>
      <P>Senator West made the point about the single soldier&mdash;and he made the point that he was single himself.  I am sure we all wish him not too long in that position and hope he will take unto himself a lovely lady.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all love to see the Senator happier.  In relation to gratuities for single Army personnel the present position is as follows. Gratuities for single personnel in addition to pensions are being introduced on a phased basis to correspond <Col N="1053" /> with the various stages in the equalisation of pay between single and married personnel.  All single persons leaving the Army after 1st June, 1973, will receive an additional 17½ per cent of the difference between the single and married rates of pension and a gratuity equal to 17½ per cent of the gratuity payable to their married counterparts.  All single soldiers leaving the Army after the 1st January, 1974, will receive the same pensions and gratuities as their married counterparts, and all single officers leaving the Army after 1st December, 1974, will receive an additional 50 per cent of the difference between the pensions and gratuities payable to them and to their married counterparts.  We are working towards equal pay for all single and married personnel.  The Department of the Public Service has worked out the scheme with my Department.  While there is an anomaly at the moment, I am happy that we are moving towards wiping out that anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say that the gratuity for the single man would be only 17½ per cent of the gratuity for the married man?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said we are moving in slices.  All single persons leaving the Army after 1st June, 1973, will receive an additional 17½ per cent of the difference between the single and married rates of pension and a gratuity equal to 17½ per cent of the gratuity payable to their married counterparts.  As time goes on, that will be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a small slice to start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but there is a movement towards making the single person equal to the married person as far as that gratuity is concerned. It is a question of time.  We have our timetable.  We have agreed it with the Department of the Public Service and in time all will come right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Moynihan welcomed the Bill and I thank him for his kind words.  Senator Martin also made the point, which I have answered, about the single soldiers.  Senator Harte <Col N="1054" /> made the point about Army pensions and their difference.</P>
    <P>It is my desire to provide everything for the Army and the personnel under my charge in the very best way and to get the very best for them.  I am sure everyone will agree that the various retirement dates of serving personnel create a problem.  If civil servants retire at different dates and at different ages from the service, of necessity their pensions must be different.  As Minister for Defence my personal desire would be to have Army pensions better.  You can compare like with like; you cannot compare like with unlike.  Therefore, the situation is that they will be different.  Any soldier or officer, whoever he might be, can ignore that part of the pensions code he feels is not fair to him and only mention what he knows is in his favour.  That is only human nature. When we examine this as a whole we must look at both sides of the coin and my desire is to do so.  I hope to take the matter up with the Government and see to it that our serving soldiers&mdash;who are doing a marvellous job&mdash;will get the very best.</P>

      <P>I bow to the Minister's judgment but it exemplifies what Senator Sanfey and I have been complaining about, that is, the incredible complexity of these Acts which go back over many years.  When I look at these Acts I try to see how an alteration in one could be brought into effect.  Unless one goes right back to 1932 you do not know what other amendments must be made.  This is a good argument for the consolidation of legislation as a whole.  It is very complex for the layman to sort out what is going on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that that is <Col N="1056" /> so and I hope we will get round to consolidating legislation in the future. The only reason we have not done this already is that the senior staff are just not available.  From the time the duties of the Department of Defence became more onerous, about six years ago, the senior staff were not available.  I would hope that we will do it.  There are other matters which could be more serious.  After all, this is only an irritation.  Even though one is confronted with a maze of legislation if one has to go through it, it does not help the individual pensioner to consolidate it.  We will do our best to do what the Senator wishes but at the moment we are tied up with work.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 3, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) every member of the union shall be entitled to vote by post where his circumstances so warrant.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an amendment that was discussed in the Dáil.  It is one which I believe has a lot of merit having regard to the dispersed nature of employment and employees in trade unions.  Trade union branches have members in every part of the country ranging from Cork to Donegal and Galway to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear reasonable in a voting situation such as is envisaged in section 3, which lays down the conditions for amalgamation or transfers&mdash; the principle of which we are in total agreement with &mdash; and the various safeguards which the Minister envisages in regard to ensuring that such amalgamations <Col N="1057" /> or transfers should take place in the proper manner, by way of secret ballot and without any interference or constraint in regard to the marking of the voting paper, in regard to the union taking the proper steps to ensure that the voting takes place not less than seven days before the resolution begins, that every member of the union has received a notice in writing complying with subsection (3) (e):</P>
    <P>not less than seven days before voting on the resolution begins, the union shall cause to be published in at least one daily newspaper published in the State notice (in such form as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce under section 12) of the holding of the vote.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) ensure that democratic procedures are observed in the voting procedures adopted where amalgamation or transfer is envisaged in regard to trade unions.  Further safeguards in regard to trade unions satisfying the registrar in subsection (2) meets with our approval.</P>
    <P>What we are seeking to do in amendment No. 1 and amendment No. 2 when we come to discuss it, is to strengthen the hand of the Minister through this legislation in the obvious direction for which it is designed. Obviously, the whole tenor of the section is designed to ensure that there is a full, fair and democratic vote.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that the realities of the situation as far as trade union members are concerned is that they are dispersed in many employments throughout many areas of the country. As the Minister said in the Dáil, there is nothing in the legislation to preclude a trade union adopting the postal system of voting.  In regard to a vote under this section for an amalgamation or a transfer a union can decide to do that if it so wishes.</P>
    <P>It is a vital protection to ensure a real majority vote of the trade unions concerned should there be postal voting.  What I would like to avoid in any situation of this kind is any minority pushing through a decision that may not be truly representative <Col N="1058" /> of the majority of the amalgamating unions.  If there is to be an amalgamation or a transfer, that should be seen to be fully democratic in every sense of the word.  It is a different matter in an ordinary election.  For instance, there are polling stations in every area.  People know where their polling stations are.  They go to the polling stations and they vote.  That is the democratic procedure of voting.  Here you are going to ask members of a trade union dispersed over the whole country in various employments to make a very important decision in regard to their future, in regard to amalgamation or transfer which, in most cases, would be a desirable matter.  But, from the democratic aspect, I feel it should be written in here, as we suggest, in subsection (1), between lines 21 and 22, paragraph (b) that every member of the union shall be entitled to vote by post where his circumstances so warrant. In other words, if he is in a situation where it is difficult for him to vote, where the union may not be able to make the facility available to him by reason of where he works, he should have the entitlement to vote by post. The union then, in devising its election procedures, will have this as an alternative method whereby members can vote either by way of direct ballot or postal vote as they wish.  It is a reasonable precaution in the interest of ensuring firstly that as large a number of people as possible vote and, secondly, that, by having such a strong majority behind whatever decision is made, there would be a real moral authority, apart from a legal authority, behind any amalgamation that takes place.  In any such situation the largest number of people voting in a positive way is obviously the most desirable way to start a new amalgamated trade union.  It is in that manner that such a trade union will get its full moral as well as legitimate authority.  I think you are going to get the widest spread of the people voting by giving the entitlement to vote by post which may not be just practicable from the point of view of the trade union or the trade unionists, in many cases, unless this right is allowed.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the point that has been made, particularly dealing with this type of legislation and the gravity of the situation at the time of a postal vote.  But there might be some confusion.  First of all one cannot allow a postal vote to someone who is not an in-benefit member because, under the rules, he is debarred. Secondly, there is a postal vote situation.  I have members in six different counties.  Every one of them is allowed a vote in every ballot.  I may have as many as ten ballots in a year even on small issues such as election to a branch committee.  I have no doubt that the bulk of the unions provide, in their rules, that people are catered for by the postal vote.  There are obvious difficulties.  If one argues that someone must get a postal vote into his hand, each individual, then a person who is lying in hospital is entitled to be asked if he wishes to vote or is able to do so, or a person who is holidaying in Majorca is entitled to be asked if he wishes to vote.  Generally speaking, the option of a postal vote obtains.  The emphasis on in-benefit membership has got to be kept in mind constantly.  For example, there can ge a lot of people in Dublin, living next door to the union or within easy reach of the ballot box, who are denied votes because they are not in-benefit members. But once a person is in full benefit, he is entitled to a vote.  As I understand it, in my union and in most of the other unions, there is provision for that, and it does happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to Senators that as between the Bill, as originally drafted, and what we have here now, I have accepted an amendment at the suggestion of the Opposition in the other House that we should have (e) added to section 3 (1).  This is the part of the section which allows of publication in the public press &ldquo;not less than seven days before voting on the resolution begins, the union shall cause to be published in at least one daily newspaper...&rdquo;.  This was to ensure that no voting could, in fact, take place without the knowledge of the prospective voter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1060" /> It must be pointed out that there is the option available to the voter who has not been given reasonable opportunity of voting to bring his complaint before the registrar who, if such a case were proved, would be able to declare the entire process invalid.  Therefore, the position in the Bill, as drafted, is that we are satisfied that there is full notification to the prospective voter about the date, the rules and what is at issue.  All of these things are looked after in the legislation.  Also we are satisfied that postal voting is allowable under the section as set down here.</P>
    <P>I find myself in complete agreement with the general line of Senator Lenihan and other Senators that all prospective voters would understand what is at issue.  I am satisfied that that is covered in the legislation, as drafted.  I am satisfied also that it would be superfluous and unnecessary to add any postal clause specifically. It is covered here.  Therefore, there is no need to accept the amendment as I do not believe the case arises.</P>

I do not see the Minister's point that it is actually written into the section as it stands before us.  I would like to see where in the section it can be done, or a trade union may do it.  I am trying to be helpful here because I think we are all agreed that it is desirable to have as large a majority of trade unions voting on such an important matter in order to give moral legal authority to the new amalgamated unions.  While I appreciate that in 90 per cent of the cases trade unions will adopt the postal vote procedure, I would like to see it written into the section.  I should like to know from the Minister where it is in the section because I do not see it.</P>

      <P>I want to make a point on the wording of the amendment.  I agree with Senator Lenihan to this extent: I think everyone wants to do the best he can to make sure that everyone has a vote.  I was very impressed by Senator Harte's contribution.  It was a practical contribution <Col N="1061" /> from a person who has practical experience and who knows what is done in trade unions.  I do not say this disparagingly but it seems to me that the amendment, as suggested, is much more theoretical than practical.  For example, it would raise all sorts of questions as to who decides when a person's circumstances warrant a postal vote; there could be all sorts of complications arising.  As I understand the position, as indicated by the Minister and by Senator Harte's contribution, there is nothing here to prevent the postal vote if the union, as a matter of practice, with its own experience in handling these matters, decides in particular circumstances that a postal vote is desirable.  There does not seem to be anything to cut that out.  I understand that, in fact, is the situation and it seems all points of view are reasonably catered for having regard to that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 26 and 27, to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) voting shall be supervised by an officer from the Office of the Registrar, nominated for that purpose by the Registrar.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is designed to ensure what is generally envisaged by the Minister and the trade union movement in section 3, that in regard to amalgamations and transfers the matter be dealt with as democratically as possible and that all proper safeguards be taken.  In parliamentary elections one has an independent returning officer, an official independent of the particular movements or political parties concerned in the election, and moving on that principle and on that analogy I suggest the insertion of a new paragraph as set out in amendment No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This does not carry in it any reflection whatever on the trade unions or their capacity to carry out an election, or the fairness or unfairness involved &mdash;it simply is the old principle of justice being seen to be done as well as being done.  That is the reason we have arbitrators and returning officers in regard to parliamentary elections. Similarly the registrar in this case is being made the overlord of the whole system of amalgamations and transfers. Without any reflection whatever on the manner of the voting that takes place between the amalgamating trade unions and their members, at the same time there should be an independent officer.  This officer should be from the office of the Registrar and nominated for that purpose by the Registrar who is the person nominated in the Bill to be the supervising officer of the administration of the Bill in all its aspects.  We are seeking to add this <Col N="1063" /> further task to his overlordship, a very practicable task, that the voting should be supervised by an officer from his office and nominated by him so that justice should be seen to be done.  This is in the interests of the amalgamating trade unions and their members because there are always people who raise narks and rows after voting takes place.</P>
    <P>I think it valuable that everybody concerned in the amalgamation or the transfer process can say that the voting has taken place under an independent arbitrator&mdash;in this case the Registrar or his nominee&mdash;so that the members of one union who may have objected to the amalgamation or the transfer will not have a grouse or complaint against how the voting was done and cannot make any allegation of pressure against the majority decision, which I am certain will in all cases be legitimately and properly taken.  This removes an area of ground away from a complaint of that nature.</P>
    <P>We all know that there are plenty of people of that kind in society and if it is seen that the whole election process is supervised by someone who is not associated with the trade union movement as such but is an official of the Registrar who is charged with the overall administration of the Bill when it is law, that will carry more effective weight with the public and with the trade union members.  It will carry more weight with members who will have complaints or chips on their shoulder if they are in the minority position after the amalgamation or transfer of votes has taken place.  This will mean that justice will be seen to be done, as well as being done.</P>

      <P>Here again I think this amendment is quite unnecessary. Trade unions have demonstrated quite clearly that they are capable of conducting their business in a democratic and fair manner without legal supervision, just as boards of directors of companies seem to be quite capable of effecting massive mergers and all kinds of arrangements to suit themselves without any kind of legal intervention.  I would seriously suggest <Col N="1064" /> that if anybody is to supervise the holding of ballots by trade unions, certainly the effecting of mergers and other matters by company directors should be supervised also.</P>

      <P>Again each union has union trustees and branch trustees. If you allow people to sit down and hammer out grounds on which to come together you cannot lay down the law too rigidly to them.  If in free negotiation they have accepted each other's rules, even in regard to absorbing enough staff and other administrative difficulties, I do not think it would be right to bring somebody in from outside to supervise when they have elected trustees in each union.</P>
      <P>No doubt the unions will ensure that the ballot is supervised by both parties, and this is the whole idea behind it.  The fact that somebody from outside comes in and counts the votes does not give any protection. The protection lies in the fact that each union, after they have negotiated their way into a position where they can put it to a ballot, have people conducting and supervising the ballot who are representative of both parties negotiating the claims.</P>

      <P>Since we have provided for the fairness of the voting procedure, the kind of notice that must be available to the prospective voter, the conditions that must be carried through in voting, the authority conferred on the voter himself, the penalties involved in the action he may take if his case of dissatisfaction is proved when he goes back to the registrar's office, for all of these reasons I would not see the point in accepting this amendment.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 3.</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 9, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>9.  Where, in the case of a body of persons which is a trade union under the law of another country and has its headquarters control situated in that country, a majority of the members of that body who are resident in the area comprising the State and Northern Ireland so decide, the members of that body who are so resident may, in accordance with this Act, amalgamate with or transfer their engagements to another trade union and shall, from the making of such a decision, be a trade union for the purpose of section 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Bill as originally drafted, we were anxious to bring about a situation where there would be more rationalisation of trade union structure within Ireland, and that led on to the point where we sought to bring into being an executive authority for the union members in Ireland, north and south.  But it did occur to us that the effect of the kind of legislation we had in the Bill as drafted would be not be to create more Irish unions but perhaps absorb Irish unions in the larger unions in Britain.  Therefore, this amendment would permit the 32-County membership of a British-based union, if they so wish, to amalgamate or transfer their engagements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> The Bill as it stands facilitates the amalgamation of two Irish unions or the amalgamation of an Irish union into a British-based union.  As it stands, the Bill makes it next to impossible for the Irish branches of British-based unions to amalgamate with another Irish union or with the Irish branch of another British-based union, because the majority in most cases would belong to the rest of the union's membership in Britain.  For example, if an Irish branch of a British-based union wished to amalgamate with another trade union whether Irish-based or British-based, a majority of the vote of all members of that union resident in the State, Northern Ireland and in Britain, possibly millions of members, would be necessary to enable the amalgamation to take place.  This would be impossible to achieve.  The amendment seeks to overcome this by providing that the 32-County membership of a British-based union may, if they so wish, amalgamate or transfer their engagements.  That is the purpose of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke along these lines on Second Stage urging the Minister to move further in the direction of allowing Irish-based members north and south to take decisions such as envisaged in his amendment, and, indeed, Senator Kennedy spoke specifically on these lines and mentioned that this was one of the points of view put by congress to the Minister which had not been included in the Bill originally.</P>
      <P>I take it that the amendment largely meets the point Senator Kennedy and I were making.  The Minister has referred just now to the danger under the original Bill of a British-based union eating up a smaller Irish-based union, the very danger which still exists without this amendment.  This amendment means that if the Irish members of a British-based union&mdash;and by Irish I mean 32-County Irish members of that union&mdash;decide by a majority to transfer to another trade union, such a decision will, in effect, amount to an amalgamation as envisaged by this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1067" /> If Senator Kennedy is happy with it I am happy with it as well.  There is one point that occurs to me.  It may be a drafting point or be a weakness in it, but, while I am totally in agreement with the principles in the suggested amendment, I would refer to the last three lines of the proposed amended section 9:</P>
    <P>...amalgamate with or transfer their engagements to another trade union and shall, from the making of such a decision, be a trade union for the purpose of section 2.</P>
    <P>Does that not leave it open that they may amalgamate with or transfer engagements to another British-based trade union?  From the drafting point of view, in order to ensure what the the Minister envisages in the new section, should it not be stated there &ldquo;transfer their engagements to another trade union based in the State or Northern Ireland?&rdquo; I put a hypothetical situation where a majority of Irish-based trade unions north and south decide to leave a British-based trade union.  Under this new section as phrased, they can proceed to join another British-based union.  I would ask the Minister to clarify that point because it would certainly take the ground from under what was intended by the new section if the majority of British-based union A could, by a majority decision, transfer to British-based union B.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be possible to draft legislation that would limit the right of association to a particular union.  We can go as far as we have gone here and give the Irish membership of any larger union with UK head office the right of deciding themselves and constituting themselves a trade union for the purpose of amalgamation or transfer under this Bill.  That is what we have brought about in this section, but we could not designate or limit with whom they could amalgamate. That would not be possible under our Constitution.  Certainly, it would abridge their right of association very seriously and I would remind Senators that while one might argue the benefits <Col N="1068" /> of such an objective in legislation of this kind, the real direction of this legislation is towards rationalisation of union structure.  It does not enter a valid judgment of whether it is better with a British or an Irish union.  The effect of the section here is to give the possibility to the Irish membership of amalgamating with Irish unions in Ireland.  The amendment, as drafted, is to redress the balance in favour of Irish membership if it desires to amalgamate with a union with head offices in Ireland.  I think that is as far as we may go.</P>

      <P>It is a constitutional difficulty but I would make a very strong judgment in favour of Irish-based unions and the more strongly we move in favour of pushing legal and Constitutional provisions to the limit the better.  I should like to pay a tribute here particularly to large Irish-based trade unions.  They have always acted in a very responsible manner in regard to our national economy and its development.  Any difficulties here have been caused in many cases by British-based trade unions making decisions for Irish members based on conditions and criteria perhaps not even relevant to British situations but even less relevant to our situations.  They have tended to induce into the whole labour-management climate here a wrong approach.  The Irish-based trade unions have almost always adopted a constructive national approach over the years.  Subject, of course, to the limitations of the Constitution, I would go so far as possible to discriminate against British-based trade unions.  I know this was attempted previously and we got into constitutional hot water.  It is a wider issue than the issue in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment as a step in the right direction even if he is not making a value judgment. The power he is giving in this section means that Irish members of British-based trade unions have new power under this section to form a union of their own, and amalgamate, if they wish, with another Irish trade union. As Minister for Labour, the Minister cannot give his value judgment.  But I <Col N="1069" /> hold a very strong view about the deleterious effect that British-based trade unions have had on the whole development of the trade union movement here and our whole national and economic development over the years. Anything that can be done to remedy this is welcome and I sincerely welcome this amendment for that reason.  I should like to see it go further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment serves at least two purposes: first, it enables unions operating here to amalgamate or to transfer without the intervention of the massive British trade union forces which decide issues in Britain.  In my opinion the second purpose is the more important, because it enables this to be done without creating any division inside the trade union movement.  The unity of the trade union movement, North and South, has been one of the most encouraging signs despite the troubles in the North over the past few years. This amendment conserves that situation and will help to continue that very desirable state of affairs.  I should like to thank the Minister on behalf of the trade union movement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>Before section 18 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The members of an amalgamating trade union, which has not got a political fund, shall, upon becoming members of an amalgamated union with such a fund, be deemed to have opted out of such fund".</P>
      <P>We have had a very easy discussion heretofore on matters designed to improve the Bill.  We now come to the section in which the Fianna Fáil Party, being representative of most trade unions in the country, feel very strongly.  We wish to incorporate, before section 18, a new section which will provide that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of an amalgamating trade union, which has not got a <Col N="1070" /> political fund, shall, upon becoming members of an amalgamated union with such a fund, be deemed to have opted out of such fund.</P>
    <P>In regard to the iniquity of the whole political fund system, I know this can be answered by saying that technically a member may opt out if he so wishes but everyone knows the reality and that people just do not opt out of things; they take the easy way out. When a political levy is collected automatically it takes a very courageous person to say to his shop steward or his branch secretary: &ldquo;I do not want to pay a political levy and I refuse to pay it.  I do not want it deducted.&rdquo; That sort of man or woman would be very exceptional.  Technically, that is the stock answer to this situation.  This levy is automatically collected and even though people say: &ldquo;We do not like this; we do not agree with it; we never vote Labour, we vote Fianna Fáil, we vote Fine Gael, we vote Sinn Féin, but however let them have it.</P>
    <P>There is no point in people telling me that the fund is available to trade union members who fight elections on their own as independents, or something like that because 90 per cent of this levy collected practically by coercion from workers who do not vote for the political party concerned, goes to finance a party which they do not support.  That is the reality of the situation.  I will not go into the rights or wrongs of it because it is quite evident where the right lies and it is equally evident where the wrong lies.  It is wrong.  It is right that people should opt to contribute for a particular political party or a particular purpose.  It is right that, if trade unionsts opt to pay the political levy and contribute to the political fund, that they should so opt.  It is not right, it is quite clearly wrong that they should be asked to opt out of a situation which has been created and set up for them.</P>
    <P>Here we have not alone a totally wrong situation which already exists and is being allowed to continue but we have it compounded to a greater degree by actually prejudicing people who have never paid a political levy, people who are members of a trade <Col N="1071" /> union and who have not heretofore got a political fund.  There are sensible trade unions who do not have a political fund and whose members do not pay a political levy.  Along with this iniquitous system, to which we are totally opposed as a party and as a group and, indeed, as liberal citizens in a free community should be opposed, we have here now a situation where, if the minority amalgamating union has not got a political fund, has members who have never paid a political levy, the members of that minority union will be compelled by virtue of amalgamation to pay into the political fund of the majority trade union.  I do not think the Minister can deny that that is precisely the situation.</P>
    <P>I have spelled out in legal terms what the effect of this Bill will be if it becomes law in its present form and what we are seeking to do is to incorporate before section 18 a new section which will give to people who have heretofore not been obliged to pay this levy the elementary civic right to continue in that position after amalgamation takes place and not have imposed on them by reason of the amalgamation, which may be legitimate for trade union reasons, for economic reasons, or for reasons of rationalisation, a levy which they have never hitherto paid to a fund to which they have never hitherto subscribed on the basis of an amalgamation that may be eminently desirable on other grounds.  I am sure in 99 per cent of such a minority union the reasons for the amalgamation will be reasons totally unrelated to the political fund and the political levy. They will be good trade union reasons, economic reasons and many other excellent reasons.  Despite voting for amalgamation for these excellent reasons they will be walked into a position where, for the first time, they will be forced to pay a levy and forced to contribute to a fund which largely goes to fighting the election expenses of the Labour Party.  The whole thing is wrong in principle.  To have this in addition to a wrong principle is, in my view adding insult to injury in a situation which has been demonstrated <Col N="1072" /> quite clearly in the past to be wrong. There is apparently nothing we can do about it.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend to be living in a land of angels.  I am quite certain that trade unions that have a political fund and a political levy are not going to drop it.  But why add this insult to people who were members of a union that never had such a fund and levy but who will now be forced to pay a levy by reason of an amalgamation to which they have agreed for reasons completely divorced from the whole question of politics.  As a party representing the majority of trade unionists I cannot over-emphasise the importance of this amendment.  It is quite clear that the vote the Fianna Fáil Party get at an election is obtained on the basis of the bulk of the votes of trade unionists. We get the majority of the votes of trade unions that are strongly represented here in Seanad Éireann and the Senators concerned are well aware of that.  We have a strong moral duty to all trade union members and political supporters to ensure they are not further victimised by imposing this compulsion on them, a compulsion totally unrelated to the main purposes of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am totally opposed to the inclusion of this amendment. I am opposed to it because the rights of a trade union to establish a political fund and to use that fund in certain political ways, including the election of members of that union, were won at great cost over decades by British and Irish workers.  I will not vote for anything that would change that situation. Apart from any other consideration, the political funds of the unions are not used exclusively as Senator Lenihan said.  Many non-Labour candidates in every election are supported out of trade union political funds.  Perhaps things have changed to some extent but, at any rate, we can say that the use of political funds by trade unions is governed by law while the use of political funds by some political parties and the making of political grants by industry and certain other sections of the community are not governed by any law.</P>

      <P>One would think, listening to Senator Lenihan, that trade unions have only one fund, a political fund.  There are many funds in most trade unions&mdash;strike funds, provident funds, sickness funds, mortality funds&mdash;so why discriminate against the political fund? Is it intended, for instance, that if an amalgamating union have not a strike fund, on amalgamation the workers are automatically excluded from the strike fund or from any other fund? Why refer in this section only to the political funds and not to other funds? I am opposed to this proposed new section and I suggest to Senator Lenihan that he withdraw it.  It is not in the interests either of the workers or of political parties that the rights of trade unions or members of a trade union to contribute to the political work of the trade union should be changed.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Senator Kennedy is deliberately missing the point or ignoring the facts.  Nobody denies the right of a trade union to have a political fund. What is objectionable, and Senator Kennedy knows this, is a situation where members of trade unions have to opt out of the levy.  He knows, also, that there are many members of unions who do not support the Labour Party and who have no wish to contribute to a fund the greater bulk of which will go to the Labour Party.  It is not a question of anybody denying the right of trade unions to have political funds.  It is protesting against the fact that trade unions are raising funds and using them in a way with which the majority of the members disagree.  On the other hand, members in many cases, for the reasons that Senator Lenihan has mentioned, do not bother to opt out or do not wish to opt out.  That is the situation but it will add to the sense of resentment of many members if they are automatically brought into a situation that they were not in before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister genuinely wants a measure which will facilitate and encourage amalgamations, he should not allow anything in this Bill that is likely to prevent that kind of amalgamation, <Col N="1074" /> anything that is likely to influence the vote of a member of a union who is in favour of amalgamation but is annoyed at the fact that it is going to have a certain effect that he objects to.  If the Minister is genuine in wishing to encourage and facilitate amalgamations of this kind and if he wishes to know through the efforts he has put into the Bill, which is a worthwhile Bill, he should accept this amendment because the automatic imposition of the levy will be resented by many members of unions.  Consequently, there is no reason why the Minister should not accept the amendment. It will not interfere with the effectiveness of this Bill in any way. In fact, it will add to the effectiveness of the Bill without doing any harm to anybody or interfering in any way with the right of trade unions to have political funds.</P>

      <P>This amendment asks that the members of an amalgamated trade union which has not got a political fund shall, upon becoming members of an amalgamated union with such a fund, be deemed to have opted out of such fund.  This strikes me as being odd.  If one of two unions, say the smaller union, happens to have a political fund and is transferring its engagement to the larger union which has no political fund, is the larger union to say to the smaller union: &ldquo;We cannot take you because you have a political fund?&rdquo; There is a double-edged argument here.  One rule in any union group is that people have a right to opt out if they wish.  All other rules must be by way of resolution first and, secondly, notices must be displayed and forms made available for people who wish to opt out.  These are not confined to branch secretaries or to the general offices where the forms are available.  I agree that possibly most members belong to the Fianna Fáil Party and I would not like to impose my political view on them.  I have so far avoided that issue but I have evidence of where people who supported Fianna Fáil opted out of the fund.</P>

      <P>It should be understood that a resolution, which must be a resolution of the union, must be displayed for more than 12 months after being passed and that the nature of the form must be described to the people. It would appear in the light of that, that some bias has crept into this area, perhaps because of a misunderstanding of the total situation with regard to political funds.  If any of the other funds should run into trouble, say the strike fund, the political fund would be taken over for the benefit of the strike fund.  It is not the most important fund, probably the lightest one of them all.</P>

      <P>If somebody sits down to negotiate and if the smaller union involved has a political fund and wishes to transfer its engagements to the other union, the other union cannot say: &ldquo;You have no right to bring the political fund with you.&rdquo; Under their rules they would have passed a resolution and followed the prescribed procedure and the union taking on members would have no right to oppose this.  This is one of the weaknesses in the argument.  I will give you an example: I knocked at the door of a house in Kildare once and when the owner told me that he did not support Fianna Fáil I asked him whether he thought that the minority Opposition should have an opportunity. He said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  I replied that we needed funds to hold the election and would like his support.  I got a few bob from him.  If two bodies amalgamate it cannot automatically be assumed that a person has opted out because the amalgamation must be by resolution.  The forms are available if a group decide to join a union and have a political fund.  They can immediately decide <i>en bloc</i> if they wish to opt out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to add a small point.  I should like to join Senator Kennedy in asking that this amendment be withdrawn.  I have had a fair amount of political experience and I can claim that our party also have the support <Col N="1076" /> of a considerable number of trade unionists.  Senator Lenihan will probably agree with me in this, that by and large one finds the active trade unionist who is interested in politics is very often the person who will take on the field work of organisation in the political party of his choice.  He seems to be particularly well-equipped for that type of work.</P>
      <P>It is also true to say that our people, whatever particular economic strata they occupy, seem very politically conscious. That is a fact.</P>
      <P>If Senator Lenihan looks further into the argument he has made he will see&mdash;I am sure he did not intend it in this way&mdash;that to argue that trade unionists who are politically conscious, who are actively interested in a political party other than the Labour Party would lack the moral courage of opting out.  I do not believe that of the trade unionists here and certainly not of the politically active trade unionists.  They are strong minded and have plenty of moral courage and guts.  To suggest that it is necessary to bring in an oblique kind of protection to protect them against their own moral cowardice&mdash;although Senator Lenihan did not intend it in that way it seems to me to sum up the argument presented on behalf of this amendment&mdash;seems to be the height of insult to trade unionists.  If Senator Lenihan ponders more deeply on that argument, he will see that there is a grain of truth in the criticism I am making.  I know he did not intend it in that way but if he examines it he will see that it is open to that construction.  I do not wish to put it any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>For Senator Lenihan it was impossible to resist a discussion on a topic of this kind even though it has little to do with the Bill. He has resisted the tendency to stray away from the main effort and concern of the Bill which is to bring about amalgamation and transfer of engagements between unions.  The concern is to eliminate or at least attempt to reduce the large number of unions catering for too small a group of workers. The consequence has been defective <Col N="1077" /> service for many categories of Irish workers contributed to in no small degree by the number of competing unions.  Apart from Britain, we are alone in Western Europe in the number of unions competing for the same categories of membership.  Only the member suffers from the service he gets as a result of that situation.  That is the main thrust of this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is noteworthy that when the Senator's party were in power, and they were in power for many years, they did not sensibly attempt to intervene in this area.  They accepted the sense, as Senators have been saying, that this was an area where the politically interested member of a trade union, if his conscience did not go along with the contributions of his union to a particular party, is entitled to opt out. That position has obtained as far back as 1913.  If the influence of the Senator's party is as extensive as he thinks within the trade union movement, there is no problem.</P>
      <P>I agree that the whole question of how great an influence the wealthy have on our society, on a democratic society, is a big and interesting one.  It has troubled philosophers for many years.  The early philosophers wondered how the democracy may degenerate into an oligarchy and what provisions must be made to ensure that the State does not become merely the private family possession of the wealthy.  I agree this is a very interesting subject but one that is not before us today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this matter was raised in the other House by members of the Senator's party I said I would be in favour of the State taking over the financing of political parties.  If politics is group activity, if the way the citizen can improve the affairs of State is by joining open democratic parties, then the State should subsidise the parties which give the citizen the possibility of influencing the policies of the State.  Until that happens we are left in the unsatisfactory situation that the wealthy may have an influence out of all proportion to the weight of their vote in our society by financing parties such as the Senator's own whom they financed in years past.  The distinction <Col N="1078" /> must be made that, as Senator Kennedy said, the unions must report the political fund, the amounts involved in it, and the amounts contributed from that fund and they must be made available to the Registrar of Friendly Societies who publishes them annually.  We have this great distinction between the funds available from unions to political parties and those from private sources.  In one case there is a published account and on the other there is secrecy and the influence which goes with that kind of secrecy.  The affairs of at least one great democracy were brought down to a low level by that kind of abuse in the matter of funds to political parties.  I should like to see that avoided here but that is a subject and debate for another time.</P>
    <P>This amendment is not particularly germane to the matters covered in this Bill.  There is always the right of the individual concerned to opt out and there is no problem about that. In the other House, the point was made that persons who when they informed their shop-stewards of their intention to opt out of the union's political fund, were informed, Deputy Dowling said, that in the event of lay-offs and other difficulties they would not have the same protection as the member paying the political levy.  I denied that there and I deny it now.  It should be noted that under the 1913 Trade Union Act, which governs this area, a trade union with a political fund must adopt rules which must provide that a member who has opted out of the fund shall not be excluded from any benefits of the union or placed in any respect either directly or indirectly under any disability or at any disadvantage as compared with other members of the union.  Anyone who feels that is not carried through has, of course, the right of complaint to the Registrar of Friendly Societies.</P>
    <P>I should also like to make it clear that under the 1913 Act, which governs this area, where a trade union which has not got political objectives or funds amalgamates with a trade union which has, the members of the new amalgamated union <Col N="1079" /> must be given an opportunity of voting and passing a resolution on the adoption of political objectives and funds by the new amalgamated union.</P>
    <P>In all these serious areas, there is ample provision already for opting out, and on agreement in amalgamation. What Senator Lenihan seeks to bring about is a change in an area previous Governments refused to intervene in.  This amply covers the right of the individual to support the political party of his own convictions and to opt out if he so wishes.  I appeal to Senator Lenihan to attempt to ensure that this Bill goes through without too much partisanship of a political kind being displayed by Senators, partisanship which has little to do with the main intent of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of correction, this has nothing to do with the situation as existed heretofore in regard to the political fund or political levy.  I am practical about this.  It has been there for a number of years, since 1913, in certain trade unions. Although we disagreed with it, we in Government never attempted to interfere with it and no Government have attempted to interfere with it. This amendment is not trying to interfere with it; it is not seeking to interfere with the situation where existing trade unions have traditionally a political levy or political fund towards the parliamentary Labour Party.  This amendment is designed to protect the case of a union that has never had such a fund, whose members have never paid such a levy, and who now on amalgamation are being compelled to pay such a levy into such a fund which never existed in their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is happening in this Bill is that a new situation is being created.  I object to the political fund but I cannot propose in any positive form by way of legislation the elimination of the political fund as it exists.  It exists, I do not think it is right or proper but it is there.  I am not suggesting we can do anything about that but I suggest that we should not try to coerce people who have never paid <Col N="1080" /> and have never been obliged to pay this levy to do so now.  Why, as a result of a legitimate amalgamation, for the very positive reasons which the Minister has mentioned, should they now be compelled to contribute to a political fund?  That is the new situation which will be a consequence of the Minister's Bill.  We are seeking to ensure by this amendment that it will not be a consequence of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I would point out to the Senator that the persons concerned do have the opportunity, nor is it in the least abridged by the amalgamation procedure, of opting out. This matter has been considered by other bodies in the neighbouring island.  The Donovan Commission considered this question of contracting out quite recently.  They recommended that no change should be made in the practice of contracting out.  They felt that the question of political funds was more a matter of politics than of industrial relations.</P>
      <P>I am aware, of course, that in our own case no decision was taken to proceed in this area by previous Administrations. I am aware, from files in my own Department, that the then Minister for Labour, in September 1970, submitted a memorandum to the Government inviting the Government to discuss the question of amending the law relating to trade union political objectives and political funds.  I know also that in November, 1970 this item was removed from the Cabinet agenda without further notice. I would suggest that the Senator should abide by the wisdom of that previous Administration and withdraw this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I was opposed to this in 1970 and I am still opposed to it for the reason <Col N="1081" /> that I do not believe in stirring up unnecessary trouble even though the matter is wrong in principle.  What we are seeking to do in this Bill is to ensure that people who have not paid this levy should not be compelled, as a consequence of a legitimate amalgamation process under this Bill, to pay.  They should not be compelled by reason of the amalgamation, even with the opt-out clause, to pay.</P>

Social and economic factors will weigh on their minds when voting.  The question of being obliged to pay levies to a political fund will not, in 99.9 per cent of cases, be a matter weighing heavily on their minds.  The Minister is well aware of this fact.</P>

Even if the smaller number, the minority coming in, object they will almost certainly be out-voted.  In effect, they will find themselves in a situation where they have to accept the political fund.

If the matter is decided on a majority/minority basis it is only nonsense because the whole purpose of this amendment is to protect the members of the minority from having to pay a political levy which they have never paid.  What the Minister is now suggesting is that there will be a ballot but they will still be in a minority in that ballot.  That is not what I thought he meant.  That is nonsense.  We would vote against that proposal because it defeats the whole purpose of our amendment.  I would be satisfied if I got an assurance that there would be a separate ballot after amalgamation among the members of the minority union who have not been paying the political levy.  If every member voting in that ballot decided one way or the other that that decision would obtain, that would make nonsense of what we <Col N="1084" /> are suggesting here&mdash;that the majority union can, in effect, dictate to the minority union by reason of the conflict that takes place subsequently.  If the subsequent ballot took place among the members of the minority union, who have never paid the political levy, that is a different matter. I would be glad to agree to any amendment on that subject.</P>

      <P>This matter is becoming slightly tortuous.  As the Minister indicated, the matter is already regulated by law in the 1913 Act and, in my view, should be allowed stand. If the majority of the members of a union wish to have a political fund, that is the decision of the union.  If any individual member of the union disagrees he has a democratic right to opt out.  That seems to be an eminently, simple, sensible and democratic way of arranging the financial affairs of the union for political purposes. We should not encumber it with any of the very complicated mechanisms which Senator Lenihan has just adumbrated.  For example, if one was to pursue the logic of his arguments, in the case of the minority union, one can say that there might be a very substantial minority of the minority union who wish to partake and contribute to a political fund, but who have been denied the right because the majority of the minority union have decided against it.  They cannot opt in.  They can only decide to stay out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one who is intimately associated with what might be regarded as the most poverty stricken of all the political parties, I want to assure the Leader of the Opposition that I am extremely grateful indeed for this close attention to and his concern for political financing here.  This is an interest I share and I would be glad to reciprocate such interest, provided it is applied equally to other ways of raising political finance.  There is, for example, already on the Order Paper a Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1975, which, as I understand, will look at another area of the financing of political parties.  I hope and pray that the same reforming zeal which has been evident on the Opposition benches <Col N="1085" /> here today will be equally evident when the Second Stage of this Bill is moved.  I will be very interested to hear how people speak and also how they vote.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a very important observation earlier.  In this country we have politics on the cheap.  There is no question about that.  It is an affliction from which the three parties suffer.  Instead of engaging in this partisan exchange about what is essentially a small matter we should be looking at the much wider context of the financing of political parties in general rather than creating a situation where parties must go cap in hand seeking finance from people who may later feel they have got some claim or influence over them.  The Minister said the greatest democracy in the world was damaged at its very foundations by the abuse of political contributions. We have seen the most powerful democratically elected executive in the world humiliated beyond belief &mdash; humiliated in a fashion that no writer of fiction would ever have dared to invent in a novel or in a movie &mdash; because of the inevitable corruption that arises out of political financing done in secret and, in particular, done by big business in the hope that they will eventually reap a financial reward.</P>
    <P>In so far as the trade union movement is concerned, as the Minister has pointed out over and over again, the difference between a company, whether it be public or private, and a trade union is this; whatever the trade union expends on political purposes is regulated by law and must be recorded and submitted to the registrar. We in turn, submit to our own party conference and to the public details of every penny received and expended by us.  The same type of regulation should apply right across the board.  It should apply to all parties. Perhaps political parties should be required by law to indicate, in a very detailed manner, where they get their political finances and how they are expended.  For example as one Party does, there is no point in showing in a global fashion &ldquo;Income is so much and here is how it is expended&rdquo;.  It <Col N="1086" /> might be wiser to have it regulated by law that political parties would have to explain in great detail the sources of their finances so that the public could be assured that nobody is trying to abuse the influence that might attend with the presentation of finances.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this amendment raises much wider issues, although I can understand the temptation of the Opposition to introduce it.  The Minister has, however, correctly positioned the Bill within the context of his own reforming programme and labour law. He has indicated the major purposes of the Bill.  He said that in reality this is an unassociated appendage which has been introduced for a partisan reason.  Its introduction has destroyed what was a very constructive and amicable debate which the Leader of the Opposition adverted to when he got up, almost in an apologetic fashion, to introduce this amendment.</P>
    <P>It should be left aside and withdrawn. If the Opposition wish to debate the whole question of the financing of political parties, I can assure them that they will find on this side of the House very willing cooperators indeed.  We will be prepared to lay all our cards on the table, and our bank statements as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am puzzled.  How can one give people the right in a ballot to vote on about five different funds which exist and to opt out of one of the funds, while having that right to vote on every one of them? It does not seem to be consistent. When the amalgamation takes place members of the two unions will be voting together.  They will be voting on the new rules drawn up, the funds which exist and so on.  After having their say, how can you allow them to say: &ldquo;We vote in favour of the provident fund, the strike fund, the general purposes fund, the sick fund, but opt out of the other fund.&rdquo; All the funds are put there by resolution and after democratic discussion of the resolution at conference.  Therefore, it would not be practical to put that as a pre-condition in any enabling legislation. The whole measure could be <Col N="1087" /> defeated on a ballot vote.  If a man can vote on all these rules, amendments and everything else, what is the position?  He still has the right to opt out.  Therefore, I cannot see where the problem lies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of amalgamation, which is the main objective of the Bill, would be precipitated if this contentious matter was removed. If the voters of the minority union were allowed to vote for the rules and everything agreed upon in regard to the amalgamation, but not on the political levy, on amalgamation they would have the right to opt in but they would be deemed, as the amendment suggests, to have opted out as is the position in many trade unions at the moment.  These members of the minority would be deemed to have opted out voluntarily as has been their position heretofore when they did not have a political fund and did not pay a political levy.</P>
      <P>That matter, as Senator Harte rightly said, should not form part of the voting in regard to amalgamation. That would not be one of the rules under voting for amalgamation.  It would be a separate matter after amalgamation in which each trade unionist within the minority union would have the right to opt in to pay the political levy to the political fund of the new amalgamated trade union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put one point. &ldquo;Option&rdquo; means an individual right. If you draw up a trade union agreement for someone and put an individual into it, you will look for the right for him to opt out.  If you start talking about the right of people to opt out in bulk, some of whom might want to remain in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that the amendment deems that in regard to the amalgamating minority trade <Col N="1088" /> unions that never had a trade union fund, each member shall be deemed on amalgamation to have opted out of such fund.  That does not prevent the individual members of that minority trade union on amalgamation from opting into this political fund. If the whole lot of them want to pay the political fund on amalgamation they can do so, but they are deemed to have opted out until they decide individually themselves democratically to opt in and to pay the levy to the fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Harte suggested that this is creating a new situation and asked should the members of the unions who are thinking of amalgamating have the option to opt out of the various other funds.  That is obviously not possible.  The law already provides for opting out of the political fund.</P>
      <P>We are not suggesting anything new.  We are merely saying that, in accordance with the law which provides for the opting out of the political fund, in certain circumstances a member shall be deemed to have opted out. It is a question of deeming to be opting in at the moment.  We are up against a practical proposition and I am sure everybody in this House knows perfectly well the practical situation we are discussing here today: that where there is a political fund there are a great many members of the union who do not support the Labour Party and for one reason or another do not opt out even though they do not support the Labour Party. That is the practical situation we are dealing with and which this amendment is trying to remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not being unconstructive. We are being constructive.  We agree with this Bill.  We think it is a very good Bill and we are completely in favour of what it is trying to do.  What we are suggesting is something that will be constructive and ensure that the encouragement and facilities given by this Bill will be availed of and that particular union members who might be very anxious and enthusiastic about a particular amalgamation will not be discouraged <Col N="1089" /> from voting in favour of the amalgamation by reason of the fact that they will find themselves involved in a political fund which they do not want to be involved with.  This is a constructive and helpful amendment and it is dealing with the practical situation of which we are all fully aware.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, if he is really fully in favour of this Bill &mdash; I have no doubt that he is &mdash; to accept a constructive amendment which will ensure that the facilities available in the Bill will be availed of by members of unions who might otherwise be inclined not to vote in favour of amalgamation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to sum up, because we will have to come to some conclusion, I do not propose to accept the amendment.  I think the Bill, as drafted, meets the legitimate concern of Senators that the democratic decision reached will be fair to all concerned. It is fair, as I pointed out already, in the sense that if one of the unions do not have a political fund there is this opportunity given to vote in the amalgamated situation and of giving an authentic verdict to them whether a fund should be set up for the new situation.  All would be able to vote and if the vote was against the minority they would have the opportunity, if their convictions were strong enough to opt out.  If the Senators opposite are right in the power and influence of their organisation in the trade union movement they have no problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In talking about this question of financing of political parties I would say that we should consider again how the State could subsidise the political parties representing both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is a serious subject and one that would merit serious consideration with legal back-up.  The present Administration would look with very great interest at any all-party proposals along those lines.  The chief means of influencing State policy by citizens is by membership of political parties and if the open democratic parties are the main agencies through which State policy may be influenced then citizens should have the <Col N="1090" /> opportunity of knowing the policies of the parties concerned.  Those policies should be available in well printed booklets throughout the country so that citizens could come to a democratic decision on the merits or demerits of political parties.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Senators opposite that while their private funds may have been sufficient up to now, they will find in the years ahead that these funds decline, and it behoves all parties, especially those in Opposition, to consider the wisdom of that proposal of mine.  Certainly it is also for the good of democracy that the State should subsidise open democratic parties.  Democratic parties cannot raid banks for funds.  We must collect by voluntary means.  It seems to me that it is a disservice to democracy in the State, that the policies of the political parties which citizens support, or otherwise, should be dependent on the goodwill of a minority.  I would say to Senators who may be alarmed at the amount of funds that were coming to one political party, the Labour Party, from trade unions that the figures involved were very small indeed.  Not such as to cause the kind of scandal that we have seen in by-elections in previous years about the amount spent by political parties in pursuit of one-Member campaigns. The party opposite in their hey-day in Government lost more in petty change in their party accounts than we have received from the trade unions in the last ten years.  I will not accept the amendment.</P>

I have been a member of a trade union since I first got employment and I know of many others in the same position, and I resent this built-in condition in membership of having to contribute to a fund in which they do not believe.  It may be all right for the Labour Party to use this slick method to augment their own funds and to build up tremendous assets for their own benefit.  We should encourage people to become members of trade <Col N="1091" /> unions but we should not impose any condition such as this on them.</P>

      <P>I do not think the acceptance of this amendment will encourage even one person to join the trade union movement.  There are a big number of trade unions in this country who have no political fund and do not subscribe to the Labour Party or to any other party.  It is rather strange that on many occasions people who are on the executive of unions deal with the problems of people leaving the union that have not a political fund and joining the union that have a political fund.  That is happening every day of the week. Therefore I do not think that the argument that has been advanced and the amount of time that has been spent on this argument today has been really worth it because nobody is concerned with a levy of a penny or twopence a week for the political fund. It would not entice one more member into the trade union movement if this were abolished tomorrow.</P>

I am putting it here in an open democratic forum that we get this, we as a party and every one of the members of our <Col N="1092" /> party get this regularly at our meetings. Senator Fintan Kennedy is not here but Senator Halligan and the Minister are and they are members of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, the largest union in the country, and 90 per cent of the members of that union who are forced to pay a levy to the political fund are supporters of Fianna Fáil and are cumainn secretaries, cumainn chairmen, officers, militants, canvassers and workers for us.  I can tell the members of the Labour Party that we get the stick regularly about this and we are going to express that by voting on this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I propose to explain to Senators the main features of this proposed legislation.  Having done so, I will then talk about various other aspects of youth employment, some of which extend outside the scope of my ministerial responsibilities.</P>
      <P>When one comes to look at the broad subject of employment of young people in our society, it must be acknowledged that there is a scarcity of hard facts.  The official statistics do not contain enough data about the employment experience of young people.  While it may be true to say that the worst examples of exploitation of young people in employment relate to the last century, there is nevertheless evidence from intermittent complaints that all abuses have not been removed.  From time to time my Department receive complaints about the employment of children and young persons over long hours and at times for low wages.  There are also complaints about late night employment of young people.  In the circumstances I have considered it desirable to give priority to the introduction of this Bill dealing with the conditions of employment of young people in advance of general legislation on hours of work and related subjects about which I have been consulting the social partners.</P>
      <P>It may assist in understanding the general philosophy behind the legislation if I attempt to explain further in general terms the aims of the Bill. These could be summarised as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  To extend the scope of the legislative protection given to young people in employment.</P>
      <P>(2)  To raise the protective standards incorporated in the legislation in accordance with modern trends and international standards for the employment of young people.</P>
      <P>(3)  To improve the enforcement of legislative provisions relating to the employment of young people.</P>
      <P>(4)  To enlist the support of all sections of the community in the observance of this protective legislation.</P>
      <P>(5)  To increase the available information about the employment conditions of young people.</P>
      <P>(6)  To contribute towards awakening the interest of the community in the creation of a better working environment for our young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the detailed provisions of the Bill, I should firstly mention that under its definitions those in the 15 to 18 age group are regarded as young <Col N="1095" /> persons while those under 15 are deemed to be children.  The term employee used in the Bill relates to both categories.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the legislation will have very wide application and will cover young persons in almost all types of employment.  There are limited exceptions in respect of a few categories of workers, where the nature of their activities would pose serious problems of application.  These exceptions are confined to young persons employed as fishermen, light-house-keepers, out-workers, seafarers, and members of the Defence Forces, though I should add that these categories together with all others will be covered by section 4 which specifies the minimum age for employment.  I am taking power to bring excluded categories within the scope of the legislation if this appears to be desirable at a future time.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated already, there is a deficiency in the statistics available in this area.  While such data cannot be related directly to the scope of the Bill, it has been estimated that approximately 65,000 young employees in the age group 15 to 18 years would be covered by its provisions. Many of these have already had the protection of the earlier statutes but approximately one third of that total will be brought within the scope of this protective legislation for the first time and the provisions of the Bill in relation to maximum hours, rest intervals and so forth will apply where previously there was no statutory protection.</P>
    <P>While the extension of the coverage of the protective legislation to a greater number of young employees is a major improvement in itself, I should also mention that the various standards set out in the Bill have also been improved in favour of the young employee.  Compared with the Conditions of Employment Acts, 1936 and 1944, which cover mainly industrial work, there are changes in relation to the minimum age for employment, maximum and normal working hours of young persons under 16 years and in the night work restrictions.  The <Col N="1096" /> improvements are more marked when this legislation is compared with the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Acts, 1938 and 1942, covering employees in shops, hotels, restaurants and similar establishments.  Here the changes relate to minimum age for employment, maximum and normal hours for all young employees and night work restrictions.  I should also mention that under section 19, where the hours of work have to be reduced in order to comply with the provisions of the Bill, there would be no reduction permitted in the remuneration due to the employee.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides that the employment of children under 15 years shall be generally prohibited.  In setting the minimum age for employment at 15, the Bill removes the anomaly whereby the existing minimum age for employment is 14, although the school-leaving age has been raised to 15 years.  I recognise that for young people at school, some familiarity with working environment could be an important educational experience.  I was therefore disposed to grant a limited exception subject to strict conditions for the employment of children under the age of 15.  My idea for this exception is contained in section 4 which permits children over 14 years to do light non-industrial work.  In the discussions on the Bill it was suggested in the Dáil that instead of stipulating the age of 14 years it would be preferable if the Minister for Labour had the power to set the age by ministerial order.  However I did not accept this suggestion because I felt that the choice of age for this limited exception was a very important one which should be made by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The limited exception in favour of children over 14 years permits them to be engaged on light non-industrial work during school term for up to two hours a day outside school hours and during holiday periods they may be engaged on such work up to seven hours a day subject to a maximum of 35 hours per week.  The additional conditions are that the work must not be harmful to their health or normal development and must not prejudice their attendance or performance at school.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> While the formula in the section of two hours daily during school term seems to me to be the most appropriate, I realise that there are diverse views on this question.  In the debates in the Dáil it was suggested that alternatively there should be during school term a concentration at week-ends of the permitted working hours for children over 14.  I have not finally made up my mind on that suggestion and I would welcome any views which Senators might wish to put forward in relation to it.  In addition to that aspect of the subject, I have taken power to vary the provisions regarding working hours of children in the 14-15 age group subject to Affirmative Resolution by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  If in the light of future experience it seems that a change would be warranted, I can put a proposal before both Houses and seek their approval to it.</P>
    <P>Section 6 also deals with the minimum age for employment and contains a power to specify a higher minimum age for entry in respect of any work which might endanger the health or safety of young persons.  This power, which would of course be exercised after consultation with the social partners, gives me a measure of flexibility in dealing with special situations.  The provision is in line with the general thinking on the subject of the International Labour Organisation. I have no immediate plans to make use of this power but I would be willing to consider any proposals supported by adequate evidence which were put to me.</P>
    <P>Section 5 requires employers to obtain proper evidence of age before they take children or young persons into employment.  They are also required to keep records of ages, working times and rates of pay.  An important addition was included in the section following consultations with youth organisations and the views expressed by Deputies in the Dáil.  This is the requirement that employers must obtain the written permission of parents or guardians before they employ children under the school-leaving age.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the case put to me I was prepared to include this additional <Col N="1098" /> requirement but I considered that it was unnecessary to have a similar requirement in relation to the 65,000 young persons in the 15-18 age bracket.  These general requirements in regard to evidence of age and record-keeping have been strengthened to facilitate enforcement of the legislation.  Contraventions by employers and complicity by parents or guardians will be offences.  I expect that the application of these provisions will enable me to monitor the conditions of employment of young people more adequately and should the need arise I would be prepared to initiate further corrective measures.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 deal with maximum working hours for young persons and section 9 covers their normal working hours.  Normal working hours are those which an employee works before overtime payment becomes due.  The maximum hours required is essentially a protective measure and constitutes an absolute maximum beyond which it is unlawful to permit the employees to work.  I would like particularly to draw the attention of Senators to the more favourable provisions under both headings for young persons under 16 years.</P>
    <P>I consider that these young people, undertaking their first experience of full-time employment, are deserving of special consideration and these provisions should help to assist in their transition into the working environment. There are provisions in section 7 and 9 for averaging hours within the overriding limits in accordance with the terms of collective agreements, employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements but I have not made any such provision in section 8 because it would, in my view, be inappropriate for young persons under 16 years.</P>
    <P>The various levels of working hours specified in those three sections represent the best possible compromise following consultations with unions and employers.  It will be noted particularly in section 7 that the overriding limits in relation to the maximum hours in a four-week period and the maximum hours per year impose an additional constraint which must be complied with.  Indeed the annual <Col N="1099" /> maximum limit means effectively that maximum hours must be cut on average to 43 per week for a young person in the 16-18 age group.  There can of course be differences of opinion as to whether these are the right levels to specify in the Bill at this point of time.</P>
    <P>I consider, having heard a variety of conflicting opinions, that these levels are reasonable.  However I have taken power by affirmative Resolution of the Oireachtas to vary the hours specified in sections 7, 8 and 9 in order to take account of future developments in the trends of working hours in employment generally.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that time spent with the consent of the employer on vocational training during normal working hours shall be deemed to be hours worked by the young person for the purpose of calculating the maximum working hours.  I should mention that in the discussions in the Dáil a totally different concept was raised and I should like to explain the distinction in order to avoid any confusion. The other concept discussed related to the right to paid leave for undertaking vocational or training courses solely at the choice of the employee.</P>
    <P>This is a totally different concept which would be outside the scope of this Bill.  It has been the subject of a convention and recommendation adopted by the annual conference of the International Labour Organisation in June, 1974.  These instruments define paid educational leave and leave granted to a worker for educational purposes for a specified period during working hours, with adequate financial entitlements.</P>
    <P>The member states of the ILO, which feel able to adopt these particular instruments, would be required to formulate appropriate policies in this area.  In common with the other member countries Ireland will be examining these suggestions to see to what extent their implementation would be practicable.</P>
    <P>I should however emphasise that the proposals contained in the two ILO instruments would have wide-ranging <Col N="1100" /> implications in regard to the assessment of potential demand for such facilities, the evaluation of the capacity of our education and training systems to provide such facilities on a wide scale, the financing arrangements, together with related questions such as the integration of these proposals with existing policies in regard to employment, education, training and hours of work.  Other questions would arise in regard to the forms of participation by public authorities, social partners and education and training authorities.</P>
    <P>Until all these implications have been examined in detail by the various Government Departments and agencies involved, it would be quite impossible to indicate what our approach to these international instruments would be.  This is quite clearly an instance where there must be adequate preparatory investigation before we could embark on this new area of activity.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 deal with intervals for rest.  Following a period of five hours work, an employee must be allowed an un-paid half-hour break.  Before he commences overtime expected to last more than one-and-a-half hours, the employee must get an un-paid break of a half-hour.  This particular break may be varied by agreement provided the revised break is not less than 15 minutes and is paid for.  In addition, an employee, who works more than five days in a week and more than three hours on a Sunday, must be allowed a 24-hour break without pay every seven days.  In this respect, a similar but more restrictive provision in the 1936 Act will continue to apply to young employees engaged on industrial work.</P>
    <P>While the provisions in sections 11 and 12 of the Bill set out the minimum legislation standards, they do not debar the negotiation of better terms in regard to rest intervals under the collective bargaining system.</P>
    <P>There are restrictions in sections 13 and 14 on the employment of children and young persons at night.  The enactment of these provisions will enable us to ratify two ILO conventions on night work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1101" /> It will be noted that under the terms of section 13 a young person must stop work at 10 p.m. and must also be given a 12 hours overnight break.  I have received representations from employer interests that a later hour than 10 p.m. should be specified.  In addition there was some discussion during the Dáil debates as to whether I was choosing the right time for stopping work.  However, no specific suggestions about alternative times were put forward.  I consider that the hours chosen are reasonable both in relation to our own requirements and to international standards.  Nevertheless, I would welcome any views that Senators might wish to put forward.  I consider however that we must be rather careful about what we do in this regard so as to avoid possible exploitation of young people in the course of late night employment.</P>
    <P>Senators will have noted that I am taking powers in section 16 to grant exemptions by regulations or licence. Having regard to the previous experience of administering similar protective legislation and to the various problems suggested to me by the employers and unions in relation to general hours of work legislation, I consider it essential to have some such powers provided to ensure the Bill will be a flexible instrument of social reform.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the section I am required to hold consultations with the appropriate workers' and employers' organisations.  Following the debates in the Dáil, an additional subsection was inserted with my agreement which will require me to publish notice of my intention to make exemption regulations and to allow a period during which interested persons may make representations.  I think it can be said that there will be ample scope for consultations with all interested bodies prior to the granting of exemptions.  For my part I should make it clear that such powers of modification would be used only in cases where I am convinced by the evidence presented that special measures are essential.</P>
    <P>I should like to direct attention particularly to subsection 5 of this section. <Col N="1102" /> This permits of licensing arrangements by me in consultation with the Minister for Education which would meet the requirements of combined schemes for work experience and education or training.  There are few such schemes in existence at present since the general concept is at its infancy and many adjustments have to be made to perfect such arrangements. Nevertheless, the subsection will facilitate such desirable developments in the future.  Following publication of the Bill it was suggested to me by youth organisations and people involved in child welfare that a special provision along these lines should be made.  The subsection recognises that, though the school leaving age is 15, the idea of introducing selected non-academically inclined children to carefully controlled experience of employment before finally leaving school would have much to commend it.  The subsection will ensure that the provisions of the Act do not inadvertently constitute a barrier to the development of such schemes.  I will refer later to certain other developments which could influence the active promotion of these schemes.</P>
    <P>The task of enforcing this legislation would be undertaken by the inspectors of my Department.  Over the past year I have increased the number of staff engaged on such enforcement. Section 26 deals with the powers given to inspectors in the execution of their duties and is similar to provisions in other legislation.</P>
    <P>Sections 21 to 23 deal with prosecutions and penalties.  In line with a general consensus among Deputies during the debates in the Dáil, the penalties have been set at £100 for a first offence with £10 per day for a continuing offence.  For a second or subsequent offence the fine would not exceed £200 plus £20 per day.</P>
    <P>I would ask Senators to read these provisions concerning prosecutions and penalties along with those sections 5 and 25 concerning evidence of age and the keeping of records.  From such examination I think it would be clear that I have considerably strengthened the formal provisions related to the <Col N="1103" /> enforcement of this legislation. Nevertheless, I do not in any respect underrate the magnitude of the task which will be involved and I would therefore welcome the co-operation of all sections of the community in ensuring that the very necessary provisions of this legislation will be observed.</P>
    <P>I intend to monitor closely the additional data on employment conditions of young people which can be obtained under the mechanisms created by the Bill and if necessary I will be ready to bring forward proposals for additional legislative measures.  Following enactment of the legislation I also intend to arrange for publicity material setting out its provisions in simple terms.  This will be made widely available so that all sections of the community may join me in what I hope will be a voluntary co-operative effort towards ensuring observance of this law.</P>
    <P>You will have noted that power has been given to me under various sections to alter the standards set down there.  This gives a necessary measure of flexibility to the legislation which is desirable so that it can be adapted to changing hours of work and other conditions of employment. I have nevertheless been conscious that the Oireachtas must play its appropriate role in relation to major alterations.  Consequently there is a requirement in section 27 that drafts of orders in relation to major alterations in the sections dealing with non-application of the Act, hours of employment of children, maximum hours and normal hours must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas with a view to securing their approval by means of affirmative resolution.  In this way, it will not be necessary to introduce amending legislation on each occasion when a change would be warranted.</P>
    <P>The rights of parents and guardians in regard to their children in employment were discussed at some length when the Bill was before the Dáil. In response to representations by Deputies and by youth organisations, I have ensured that the specific role of <Col N="1104" /> parents and guardians is recognised in two sections.  In section 22 they had the option to initiate proceedings in relation to an alleged offence under the Act.  In section 17 their right to bring proceedings for recovery of money due to an employee is also recognised.  On the other hand I should point out that parents and guardians have serious obligations under sections 4 and 5 of the Bill in relation to the minimum age for employment requirements, the giving of their written permission for the employment of children and the correctness of age evidence produced.  I confidently expect that parents and guardians by playing their parts in these matters will help to ensure that the employment of young people is in accordance with the terms of this protective legislation.</P>
    <P>Early on, I acknowledged that there were many aspects of youth employment which, though important, were outside the scope of this Bill.  The discussions during the Dáil debates and the representations which I received from interested groups indicated that one of my aims, namely, arousing interest in the employment of young people, was being achieved. Many of the subjects raised in these discussions were not merely outside the scope of the Bill but even went beyond my own ministerial responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In response to the considerable interest already around concerning the diverse aspects of youth employment, I have already indicated my intention of holding a seminar which will examine the whole range of problems associated with youth and employment. I intend to invite a wide range of interested groups to be present.  I would hope that the participants from their specialised experience will be able to give an indication of the range of problems and the possible priorities. The seminar or meeting may also be able to develop ideas concerning the kind of co-ordinating links needed between the efforts of Government agencies and private organisations.</P>
    <P>One of the topics raised during the Dáil debate on the Bill reflected a further idea of mine.  This was a <Col N="1105" /> suggestion that an advisory committee would be set up representative of various interests.  This suggestion was related to the specific scope of the Bill but my own idea is that the advisory committee would have wider terms of reference which would cover other aspects of the youth employment question.  I do not wish to comment in more detail on the possible functions of the advisory committee until after I have had the benefit of the views of the interested groups at the proposed meeting which I referred to earlier.  However, I consider it desirable to give Senators a full outline of my thinking for further action in this general area.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should say that I would welcome the suggestions of Senators on any aspects of the Bill which they consider might be improved.  If there is general agreement in favour of such changes, I would be happy to agree to their being made.  In taking the Bill generally, I consider that it represents a positive legislative advance in the conditions of employment of children and young persons.  I would, therefore, recommend the Bill to the House and look forward to the passage of all its Stages.</P>

      <P>We on this side of the House welcome the Bill.  Indeed, anything that helps in any way to ensure that people have adequate protection of their health, their morals and their standards is commendable.  There are quite a number of people who, for various reasons are not working and those who are working have to carry them by way of contributions, if you like, and by keeping the economy going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> Down the years various Governments have made efforts to try to frame legislation of benefit to the work force. A reasonably contented, efficient work force is a very important arm of any economy.  One of the best methods of ensuring we have such a force is by the enactment of laws ensuring reasonably good conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>This legislation deals with youth employment. People talk about youth and the part they are playing in the development of the nation.  Youth today have many advantages that their forefathers never had.  In particular, they have post-primary education which gives the majority of our young people now a fair chance of acquiring for themselves post-primary and even higher education.  We can now look forward to having a more educated population and we can safely assume that our youth in the years to come and, indeed, at the moment are much more advanced intellectually and better equipped to deal with conditions than their forefathers were. We did not have a great tradition of industrialisation until we secured native government but it was not until the late 1930s that much useful legislation was framed giving to the work force, in particular those employed in offices and industry, the benefit of a regulated number of hours per week, half-days and holidays with pay and so on.  That was a substantial and important advance.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about people at a very impressionable age, people who are leaving the national school and who have not finished post-primary education.  There are numbers of such people.  It has become the custom in later years, especially in the cities, for many of these people to try to support and help their parents by taking some job during the holiday period.  We should encourage this because I remember reading long ago of students in America and in various other countries who worked during the vacation period and, by doing so, they were able to get together some cash to augment the money being spent on them by their parents.  Indeed, many of them educated themselves through their own industry during the holiday period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> We all know that holidays in the post-primary schools are reasonably long.  Most adults get only two weeks' holidays.  Therefore, it would not be unreasonable to say that adolescents, having the benefit of post-primary education and three or four months' holidays as well, would be more gainfully employed in some position and earning some money.  This would have the twofold advantage of taking these young people off the streets and at the same time would inculcate in them the habit of working and earning some money.</P>
    <P>Manual work has been downgraded for far too long.  Everybody should have the experience of some manual work.  A little work does nobody any harm.  The Bill provides for a certain number of hours.  Certain individuals feel they do not owe the community or their parents anything by way of compensation and that they can spend all their time enjoying themselves. They forget they have an obligation to their parents as laid down by the Fourth Commandment.  The country is now passing, in a fairly prosperous state, to the young people.  They have amenities which their parents did not have.</P>
    <P>It is wrong for anyone to think he is above work.  Germany is an example of a successful nation where, after the war, nobody thought they were above doing any type of work.  We should encourage people through education to take on different types of work &mdash; at home, on the farm and in the factories &mdash; in order to augment their college fees and so on.  Our future citizens would be none the worse off for having done this.  It might remove both a sense of inferiority complex and snobbery and prepare them for the hard knocks which people get irrespective of how rich they may be.</P>
    <P>There are a few points on which I should like the Minister to comment. The main provision in the Bill is to safeguard young people and it is only proper to have such legislation.  Since the Industrial Revolution in England many young people have been exploited in factories.  They had to work <Col N="1108" /> long hours and the remuneration was very small.  If they suffered injury they were not compensated.  There was the case of Michael Davitt, who lost an arm while working in a factory.</P>
    <P>Children who are studying cannot be expected to work long hours, but it is no harm to allow them to do a little.  Many parents ask me to try to get employment for their children during the summer holidays.  It would be too bad if these people were denied that employment if it was available. This situation could lead to emigration during the holiday period and perhaps some of the young people would return not having much regard for law and order or for the continuance of their educational career.</P>
    <P>The protection of children between the ages mentioned in this Bill is accepted internationally.  The labour movement in general deserve credit for their activity in this area.  In later years these children will appreciate the protection afforded them.  Had these regulations been in force in the past many people who lost limbs might have been saved these injuries or, at least, they would have got much better compensation.  It would be unfortunate if people went through life maimed and without proper compensation because of lack of proper legislation.</P>
    <P>The protection of young people is reasonably safeguarded in this Bill. However it is possible in legislation of this kind to go to the other extreme and cases may occur where the legislation, although designed to protect people, may prove too difficult for some employers to observe because the type of employment concerned may not be suitable in terms of this legislation.  For instance, mention is made of a 10 p.m. limit on the working hours of young persons.  There may be cases where it would be necessary to have children employed at a later hour.  For example, travelling companies going round the country performing plays may have children employed.  These shows often continue later than 10 o'clock at night.  Often these companies visit seaside resorts and might remain there for the holiday <Col N="1109" /> season.  I wonder how they would be affected by this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that there would be consultations on difficult points which arise.  I am glad to note the interest of youth organisations in this matter.  People who own restaurants and hotels will need clarification of the legislation.  They must know what the conditions of employment will be before the summer season begins.  Some of them may not be able to stay in business because of this legislation.  How would a family man be affected by this legislation?  Would he be allowed to employ a member of his own family?  In many family businesses children of various ages lend a helping hand and there is nothing wrong in that; but, perhaps, because they are not employed they may not be affected by this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of evidence of age, but this is a minor point which I am sure will be rectified.  On the whole I consider the Bill to be a good one. It is no harm for young people to be employed.  It is beneficial both for themselves and for the nation but it is important that there be some regulations such as those proposed here when young people take up their first positions in life.</P>
    <P>The fact that they will be under discipline and taught responsibilities such as arriving and leaving on time, is very important.  The training they get when they are in these part-time jobs is very important.  It will be their first opportunity of earning money. Those in charge of saving certificates should contact them because from 15 to 16 years is a delicate age and if they have an overflow of cash they might start off on the wrong foot.</P>
    <P>Far too many young people are frequenting &ldquo;singing pubs&rdquo; and such places.  I am not a kill joy but where these people are placed in employment is important.  To have them working after 10 o'clock, in some cases, is not correct and it might start them off on the road of no return.  The youth of today are responsible and it is just a matter of the right standards being set and the glorification being taken out of places where people drink and take drugs.  There are other ways of <Col N="1110" /> enjoying life and people should be taught that it is a noble thing to work.  It is very important for every young person to realise that they have a duty to their parents and to the nation and that they are expected to make a reasonable attempt to pay their way on all occasions.  If these standards are observed and if this is made known to them everything in this Bill will right itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the concept of this Bill.  Nevertheless, I object to some features of it.  I should like to ask the Minister to confirm that all workers are covered by this Bill, other than those specified in section 3.  I am anxious to have his confirmation that agricultural workers and telecommunication workers are included.  I should also like the Minister to give an assurance that he will consult with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions before he makes any order under section 3.</P>
      <P>On section 4, I am opposed to the employment of children of school-leaving age during the school term because such work would be harmful to the health or the normal development of the child.  There is a possibility that such work will affect the attendance of the child at school or the child's capacity to benefit from the instruction given him therein. Section 4 states:</P>
      <P>An employer may, subject to the conditions specified in subsection (3) of this section, employ a child who is over the age of 14 years to do light non-industrial work...</P>
      <P>This work should not be harmful to health or affect attendance at school or capacity to learn.  Who will ensure that the work is not harmful to the child or that it will not affect attendance at school or capacity to learn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not trying deliberately to be critical when I say this but I am assured by educationalists, and others, that work during the school term would have the effects I described in many cases.  I do not think there is any way in which the Minister can ensure that these things will not take place.  Whose function is it, for instance, to ensure that work during the school term will <Col N="1111" /> not affect the health of the child or his capacity to learn?  Will this be a function of the inspectors in the Minister's Department?  If it is, what authority have they to make such assumptions?  How do they go about dealing with the capacity of the child to learn if he is working during the school term?</P>
    <P>Apart from that I do not see that this section, and the specification about the number of hours a child may work during a day or week, can be implemented.  Even if the Minister had an army of inspectors he would not be able to ensure that the provisions of the Bill were implemented. The Minister has indicated that he intends engaging additional inspectors but the job would be far beyond even a doubling of the present number of inspectors.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that under section 13 (1) of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, employment of children under 14 years of age is prohibited.  The Minister spoke of children over 14 years &mdash; admittedly there is one year of a difference &mdash; but the same principle embodied in the 1936 Act should be applied to this Bill in respect of industrial and non-industrial work.</P>
    <P>During the discussions between the Minister and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, congress indicated that they:</P>
    <P>would accept a provision whereby the Minister had power to permit the employment of children, over 14 years of age, during holiday periods in employments specified by Ministerial Order.  Such Ministerial Order should specify the number of hours to be worked and such employment should be limited to a period of weeks.  Children so employed should be registered and the provision of Ministerial Orders should be such as to guarantee adequate protection against exploitation and the provision of adequate supervision.</P>
    <P>I know there are problems arising in respect of sections 7, 8, 9 and 13. I do not propose to refer to these sections because I am aware that <Col N="1112" /> talks between the Minister and congress have not been completed.  I ask the Minister, in finalising those talks with congress, to bear in mind what I have said and to indicate to congress, and to this House, whether he is prepared to accept the suggestions put forward by congress.  My suggestions are put forward in a spirit of helpfulness.  I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill which has many fine points in it but the trade union movement are worried about the sections I have referred to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other Senators in giving a general welcome to the Bill.  It will do much to tidy up the whole area of employment of youth and it will give a new awareness of the importance of youth in work.  It is coming at a time when it will make a useful contribution to the whole outlook of youth.  I hope all of us will be serious and constructive about the Bill because it deals with our youth and they are the most valuable asset we have.  I welcome the Bill. I disagree with a few sections but I agree with most of it.</P>
      <P>In section 4 the Minister gives himself power to grant a licence.  I would have thought this should have been done in a different way.  I would imagine that rather than have inspectors or agents from a Department finding out the particular type of area where there is suitable employment for people under 15 years of age it would have been easier to specify the types of employment in the Bill.  If the Minister cannot do it when a Bill like this is being drafted and introduced how can he expect with much more restrictive machinery, to come up with a more correct result?  It would have been useful to specify the type of business that people under 15 years could be employed in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one aspect of the Bill with which I would not agree is the change in the employment age from 14 to 15.  The age should have been left at 14.  It is important to realise that educational standards have improved.  To qualify that, I agree with Senator Kennedy who said that no school-going child should be employed during the school <Col N="1113" /> term.  It is a dangerous practice to allow a child to be employed for two hours because this gives an opportunity that can only be abused.  I would strongly oppose the employment of a young person during the school term.</P>
    <P>Outside the school term I would strongly support the authority of employers to employ youth from the age of 14.  Most of this employment would be during the summer season and a boy or girl who has reached the age of 14 is certainly fit for general work. There should be restrictions on the type of work.  Heavy industry or any type of heavy work should be excluded and it should be excluded in the Bill rather than putting the onus on an industry to apply to the Minister for a licence.</P>
    <P>I am personally interested in the hotel industry and have a knowledge of the value of young people in that industry.  In this area I could see hardship being imposed because of the vast number of youths who apply for work. The Minister should give serious consideration to the hotel industry.  We were very glad to have the Minister in Donegal not too long ago to present prizes to hotel trainees there.  I am sure the Minister realises the value of young people who make a good contribution to the hotel industry and who are engaged in a useful training job.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to examine the question of hours.  In section 13 the Bill provides that a youth may not be employed after 10. p.m.  One could not expect a youth in the hotel industry to finish his working day at 10 p.m.  Many people would be very disappointed if meals were not served in hotels after 10 p.m. Certainly in counties like Donegal where the industry is largely dependent on youth to work in seasonal hotels &mdash; it benefits the youth and the industry &mdash; we should not prevent children over 14 years of age being employed after 10 o'clock.  I would ask the Minister to change this to 12 o'clock.  At the same time I would ask him to change the hour from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m.  It is unreasonable to ask a child of 14 years to begin work at 6 a.m.  I would ask the Minister to look at this aspect of the matter <Col N="1114" /> again because it will not be an arrangement which will be satisfactory either to the employer or to the employee.</P>
    <P>I think the Bill is a very important one.  The whole scene is changing and we need to encourage youth to work.  We are living in an age in which there is a tendency not to work.  Those of us who do work find, as somebody said recently, that for every man who works there are two sitting on his shoulders for whom he has to pay for education and social welfare and to subsidise housing.  The incentive to work is becoming less and less.  If we are to spread the burden evenly there should be an awareness of the importance to teach young people to work and survive in an ever more competitive world.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will be supported and I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister rightly sees the necessity for control in this field, which is a very emotional field. This is a very emotional field.  The more one ponders on the subject of the Bill the more one's emotions are involved.  That there have been abuses in the past in regard to young persons employment is a fact without question. Sometimes we are inclined to think that those bad old days are gone for ever and we cannot envisage such abuses being repeated.  But the pressures of society, be it the cost of living or otherwise, have produced the present situation.  As more young people are finding employment, there are increasing opportunities for abuses.  The Minister rightly recognises this danger and he sees the need for control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, to be really effective and successful will call for a considerable amount of vigilance by the Department and by the public, who will have to play their part in bringing abuses to the Minister's notice.  There is no doubt that the Minister can expect to receive repeated representations from many quarters from time to time for exemptions and reliefs in regard to the provisions of this Bill.  I ask him to resist these representations because I can think of very few other <Col N="1115" /> fields in which a person, it given an inch, will try to take a mile.</P>
    <P>Part-time work by young people is a worthy practice and should be encouraged. It can go a considerable way towards strengthening the character of schoolgoers and giving them a broader outlook on what life will eventually hold for them when they leave school.  But if it is a desirable practice, it can be abused.  It is unfortunate that these abuses can be compounded by complicity, a knowing complicity, a silent complicity or worse still an open complicity on the part of parents.  I have seen young people of 15 and 16 years of age employed in hotels serving drink to people at midnight.  This is reprehensible. Some of these young people were on the point of falling asleep. Being young people they take a certain pride in working.  I am afraid that in some instances when parents ask if they enjoy their work, pride being what it is, they are inclined to say &ldquo;Yes, I love it&rdquo;.  In other cases parents do not ask their children how they are getting on at work.  I am completely against any extension of the 10 p.m. embargo included in the Bill.  Unfortunately in practice 10 p.m. possibly means 10.30 p.m.  As I mentioned earlier, extending 10 p.m. under law to 11 p.m. will mean almost a midnight cessation for young people. I do not contemplate that with any great pleasure.</P>
    <P>The fact that the work is only part-time can also be a factor.  When parents are considering the severity of conditions of employment, the tolerance of those conditions and the feeling that it is perhaps only for a week, or a few weeks, in the summer holidays can have a lessening effect in their attitude towards late night finishing.  I agree with the Minister when he said 10 p.m. is an adequate time and 8 p.m. for children under 15 years is also an adequate finishing time.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of schoolgoers working other than at the weekends. The young person attending school has enough to do if he attends his school tasks and lessons.  He should not do anything which would interfere <Col N="1116" /> with his education.  He has only a few years in which to educate himself. It would be remiss of us to do anything which may, even marginally, affect the end product.  I therefore ask the Minister to consider an embargo on working at night time by schoolgoers.</P>
    <P>There is a need for ample publicity for this Bill.  It is necessary that the public be acquainted of its provisions. Pressure from the public can have a very important effect on any employer. First, the employer should be told there is a Bill in existence and that the public are aware of it.  Pressure from the public can have a very considerable effect on any unscrupulous employer.  The inspectors in the Minister's Department will have an invidious task.  They will be subjected to pressures to turn a blind eye to certain abuses.  The efficacy of this Bill in the final resort depends on the vigilance these inspectors show in their work.  If the Bill is complied with, it will prove of benefit to all concerned in our State.  It will prove to be of the greatest benefit in the protection of young people.  It is the young people who must receive priority under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I was not here for the Minister's opening speech.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately I have only just arrived from Brussels.  I tried to read his opening speech in the time available. I join in the general welcome this Bill received.  There is no doubt it was needed.  Even in the places where one may disagree, the Bill is an improvement on the existing situation. Therefore, I congratulate him on introducing it.</P>
      <P>This Bill will cause problems for the Department, for certain sections of the economy and particularly for families and parents, who have been used to the idea that when children reached a certain age they were able, in a fairly unrestricted way, to take up employment. This was a help to the family. This is primarily a Committee Stage Bill.  It is fairly detailed, technical legislation.  At this stage I should like to make just a few points on the various sections which I think could be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> I am a little puzzled by some of section 3.  This section exempts certain types of employment.  The categories exempted are fishermen, lighthouse or lightship keeper, an out-worker or a seafarer.  One can see that these occupations would raise problems, particularly with regard to hours of work.  I should have thought that section 5 could be very usefully included in that part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As it stands, it means that a young person, or indeed a child aged 14 years, could work as a fisherman or a lighthouse keeper, without the permission of his parents, without the necessity for the provision of a birth certificate, without any obligation on the employer to maintain a register or a record of the particulars set out in section 5.  When one comes to subsection (2) (b) one finds with regard to the Defence Forces, that section 5 is included with section 4 in the parts of the Bill which apply.</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister not provide that parents' permission should be obtained in the case of young persons working in these sectors?  Surely a seafarer or a lighthouse keeper would be employed by organisations which are well able to comply with the provisions of section 5.  I cannot see any reason why they should be allowed to conduct their business in this casual way, and it would be a bad thing if they were allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>We come then to section 4 which deals with young people between the ages of 14 and 15 being permitted to work.  I agree completely with what has already been said by Senator Kennedy and others.  There can be no justification for the employment of children between the ages of 14 and 15 on schooldays.  I am not too sure about weekend employment because this does not appeal to me, although it is less undesirable than their employment on schooldays.  I can see no objection to employment during school holidays, under the safeguards of this Bill.  As the Minister said in his opening speech, familiarity with the working environment would be an educational experience.</P>
    <P>The Minister has provided in section 4 (2) (b) that employment is only allowable provided the child's capacity <Col N="1118" /> to benefit from the instructions given to him in school is not affected. The Minister could go separately to every school teacher in the country and I do not think he would find one teacher who would not say that a child's capacity to benefit from instruction would clearly be unfavourably affected by spending two hours working after a long day in school.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are more than two hours involved, because time must be allowed for travelling to and from work.  He may have come home at about 4 o'clock after a long day in school.  Having had a meal, he goes off to work so there is no question of his being able to do homework.  He is, in fact, merely putting in time in school until such time as he may be able to leave.  There can be no other attitude on the part of the child or of his parents.  This situation is clearly undesirable and in the unlikely event, at this stage, of an amendment being put down to eliminate altogether the possibility of this type of employment, I hope the Minister will accept it.  This is a serious defect in what is otherwise a highly desirable Bill.</P>
    <P>The hours set out are too high for children and young persons between the ages of 15 and 16 and 16 and 18 years.  In section 11 the Bill says that an employee, which includes these young persons and also children aged 14 years, can work for a period of five hours without a break.  This is an excessive period.  One would be appalled to think of children working for such a long time.  I hope this period will be reduced.  Even allowing for the fact that these are maximum hours, and that many people would work for shorter periods, they seem excessive.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that an EEC directive has laid down that by the end of this year there is to be a universal 40-hour week, it seems undesirable that in legislation of this type there is provision for the working of up to 50 hours in a week.  A 40-hour week presumably means a normal working week; anything beyond this would be overtime working.  The introduction of a 40-hour week only makes sense if it means that it is a normal working week.  There can be no justification <Col N="1119" /> for bringing in a 40-hour week and then working on as before for longer hours.  There may be more money to be made in overtime pay. The introduction of a 40-hour week is to provide more leisure time for workers to relax and enjoy themselves. There is no justification for legislating for a 40-hour week, and allowing people to go on as before, working long hours but making more money.</P>
    <P>The Minister should further study this directive from the EEC and he will see that 40 hours is the desirable maximum.  In view of this, to allow young persons to work 50 hours seems a retrograde step.  The Minister said in the Dáil that to legislate for a working week of 40 hours would mean that a person could not earn overtime.  Overtime working should not be available to young persons as it is a highly undesirable form of economic activity.  A 40-hour week should be the maximum allowed to them.</P>
    <P>Many young people are not members of trade unions and do not come within the provisions of trade union agreements.  They are mostly employed in small concerns where the employers have no particular regard for trade union arrangements.  If it is laid down that they may work for 50 hours a week, in many cases that is the number of hours they will be expected to work.  I hope the Minister will reduce this figure and, indeed, other hours mentioned in various sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In section 7 (1) (a) it says that a person of 16 years cannot work more than ten hours in any day, or such other number of hours which may be specified in an agreement, which is defined in section 1 as a collective agreement.  This seems to imply that a collective agreement could increase the number of hours which could be worked in any day.  I hope this would not happen.  It should state that a lesser number of hours could, by agreement, be worked.  Certainly, to leave it open to having the already long number of hours increased &mdash; the same applies to the 50 hours a week in paragraph (b) &mdash; seems undesirable.</P>
    <P>Going back to section 4, there is a <Col N="1120" /> small matter of a technical nature which I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister.  On Report Stage in the Dáil the Minister introduced a new subsection (4) saying that he may, by order, vary the hours specified in subsection (3) of the section applicable to children at school. This was a desirable amendment on which the Minister is to be congratulated. He is to be congratulated also for having brought it in in such a way that, under section 27, it can only become law if it is agreed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>But this has created a problem.  If the Minister will look at subsection (9) of section 4 he will find that he may, by order, revoke or amend an order under this section, which includes of course the new type of order he has introduced under subsection (4).  But this is a different kind of order.  Under the second subsection of section 27, he can do this and lay it before the House, which is the usual procedure. It becomes law immediately and can be revoked only by a decision of either House of the Oireachtas.  This is not the Minister's intention.  What has happened, in fact, is that the Minister can, once having made an order under subsection (4), vary this order.  He can amend this order without, as he had intended doing, providing that there must be the earlier agreement of each House of the Oireachtas.  It is a small technical flaw which I think ought to be remedied.  I will try to devise an amendment which would meet this requirement.</P>
    <P>There are various other points which I will raise on Committee Stage.  For the moment I will do no more than mention these matters and congratulate the Minister again for bringing in a Bill which, in spite of what one must deem to be defects, is nonetheless a very considerable improvement on the existing situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite right to say that we have had many complaints over the years about young children not only working late at night but also getting up very early in the mornings to work with people on milk floats and so on before going to school. Of course, we have heard the question <Col N="1121" /> of the long hours in bars.  We have not had any reference at all to some of the underlying causes.  The Minister, in bringing in this legislation, could not possibly take account of everything in this respect, in the sense that very many of these children who work at night or before going to school in the morning do so of necessity.</P>
      <P>One cannot cover every aspect of society when one brings in legislation of this kind.  In my view it is a good Bill.  There is in it scope on which to build and it lays the foundation for the future with regard to the employment of young persons.  This Bill seeks to remedy the questions of long hours and low wages, to extend the scope of legislation to protect young people in employment, even to protect the standards incorporated in the legislation to keep up with modern trends and international standards, having regard to our membership of the EEC. These are all good things to have embodied in legislation and everybody would agree that they are very desirable.</P>
      <P>While I think the Bill is heading in the right direction and has great prospects, I would express one or two reservations, not in the same way as did Senator Kennedy.  I refer to the question of employment of young children, on the basis that sometimes it is of necessity.  When one speaks about the protection of young persons, even though there are other types of legislation, is it not right also that, in a Bill of this nature, which sets out deliberately to protect young people, there should be some indication given in it of the social responsibility on companies to respect the dignity of all employees, particularly of young persons.  We know that the trade unions, through their own collective bargaining strength, can exercise a lot of influence in this direction. As was said earlier, not every job is organised and not every boy or girl joins a trade union when they come into a business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the reason that I mentioned this question of the employer having this obligation, or where it might be written in, is that one can go into <Col N="1122" /> jobs, in general good jobs, but there may be areas where the symptoms of unrest lie in a particular area, where there may be dissatisfaction, excessive absenteeism and so on.  In some cases there may be even an unclear indication of the responsibility falling on the child.  I know it may be difficult to write that in in any specific section but it is something worthy of serious thought.  If we want to build a healthy labour force, we must begin with the young or, at least, we can begin with the young because we have got to have the balance in the age groups.  At least the young should be encouraged by responsibility being shown by the employer when he is placing them in employment.  Apart from knowing everything about their age, having their parents' consent and so on he should try to place them in an area where they can reap the greatest advantages of a good environment.  This is part of the protection of young people.</P>
    <P>The other question is that of the new training grants being given by the industrial training authorities.  If one wants to protect young employees it might be necessary to encourage companies to do so by some means. It may cost money but it would be very worthwhile.  There should be some sort of pre-employment period during which people might undergo a brief course of three or four days, perhaps a familiarisation course because training is about people.  If we can manage to put across that the organisational aims are within an industry, then place people in the proper organisational section of the company trying to avoid the areas of unrest the company knows exist for various reasons, a good job could be done in this respect.</P>
    <P>The other point on which I would like to touch is that of the best way that a young boy or girl can be protected. This can best be achieved also by understanding what are his or her rights.  For example, it is all right having legislation on the question of minimum notice and terms of employment and so on.  But in the familiarisation course this could well be one of the subjects that should be explained <Col N="1123" /> to them.  Their rights regarding holidays should be explained to them.</P>
    <P>The final point I should like to make is with regard to handbooks. They cannot be provided in all forms of employment but where it is possible, and where the organisation or the enterprise will allow for it there is no reason a young employee should not be provided with a handbook stating the aims and objectives of the enterprise, and how it operates in general as to welfare and health safety and other protections that are available. All of these are in other forms of legislation but if they are not written for a young employee it is likely that the employee will not be protected to the fullest extent.  If there is not some form of handbook for the employee this can lead to accidents and a lack of knowledge of fundamental rights, and in the long run may mean a lesser contribution to the enterprise.  It can also lead to a lack of ambition if the employee is put into an area of unrest, and if this is not taken cognisance of by the employer before placing the employee.</P>
    <P>In general the Bill is a good beginning. To some extent I share the reservations of Senator Kennedy.  I realise there may be a cause for young people being in employment but unless you can remove the reason for their having to work you cannot deal with the effects.  Young people may have to work before or after school hours in order to bring in more money to supplement the family income and I realise this may be a difficult problem. At the same time the general principles should be observed.</P>
    <P>The question of immediate medical examination and periodic medical examinations thereafter should be a matter of law.  It should be incumbent on the employer, even if he has no medical facilities himself, to see that a young employee has a regular checkup. The employee may have some disorder that may be aggravated in the course of employment.  These are my general observations.  I think all aspects have been well covered by the other Senators that have spoken.  I <Col N="1124" /> would hope that some of the points I have made will be incorporated in section 5.  We should be serious about the protection of young employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the start I said that, taking it up on a statistical level we were dealing with an area which does not give us full account of the facts in that area.  That is why it will prove of some assistance to us that there is this obligation devolving on employers that it is part of their obligations under this Bill to keep records of age, age of entry of the young employee and hours worked.  This will prove of assistance in building up a factual statistical record of the extent of youth employment and of the ages covered by this Bill.  At present the official position is that we do not accurately know the extent of this.</P>
      <P>At the outset I should also like to thank the Senators for their comments. These fall roughly into two categories, as they fell into similar categories in the Dáil.  Some people felt that the cut-off point at 15 years &mdash; allowing for certain exceptions between 14 and 15 &mdash; was at too high an age level and others felt that it should be a lower age.  Generally there is room for this difference of opinion between both points of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the difficulty is that there has been such little intervention by the State in this area of law over so long a period.  I think the last time any legislation was started or passed in this area was between 1938 and 1940. It is after a long interval of nonintervention by the State in this area that this legislation is coming into being.  Over that period a lot of practices that might not otherwise have come into being have been accepted, perhaps too uncritically.  When I developed my own interest in this area it was really because I had received a number of complaints from around the country about allegations of late-night working by very young children. There were the well-recorded cases of the horror of tourists who were always pointing to the scandal of young children working in lounge bars, supermarkets, public houses and hotels and contrasting this unfavourably <Col N="1125" /> with the customs in their own countries where this was not permitted. This is the kind of background on which I acted and I should like Senators to understand that this was the initial background which suggested that there was need for legislation on the part of the State.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy was worried whether all employees under 18 years of age were covered.  All those are covered except those excluded by section 3.  Section 3 gives the areas that shall not apply: fishermen, lighthouse keepers or seafarers.  Under section 4 we have only limited permission to work under 15 years of age. There is a difference about this question. Senator Kennedy, rightly perhaps, looked upon it as others have looked upon it and said that work under 15 years should not be permitted. Yet all of the youth organisations working in this area with whom I have discussed this matter are pretty strong on the idea that there should be controlled exceptions permitted under the age of 15 years. They point to the practical situation where this happens widely, perhaps too widely, and they make the point that it would be impossible to depart from present practice completely. They suggest that if it is controlled it need not interfere with the educational progress of the child.  Among educationalists there is a strong opinion that work in this controlled fashion can be an ideal complement to work within the school.</P>
    <P>The formula we hit on under section 4 is that two hours per day in school-term during the week, permitting a longer period at weekends, was a fair compromise.  There is some opinion about whether we should give greater latitude to work at weekends; and we are looking at this.  When we come to the Committee Stage we may have further amendments along those lines.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy asked whether the inspectorate would be up to the task of enforcing the hours of work under section 5.  That is a good question to ask in any area under this legislation. We have doubled the inspectorate in the past year, but it is still a small force. There are a number of separate pieces <Col N="1126" /> of legislation which I intend bringing in during the next year in relation to unfair dismissal, worker participation, the whole area of anti-discrimination, which will make this a vast area for enforcement. If there is no co-operation forthcoming from the public and the employers, then they will not be up to the task.  But I hope that we have reached the point at which our society as a whole can agree that the provisions of this legislation are worthy of support.</P>
    <P>I had a similar experience in considering this question of enforcement of rates of pay in the hotel industry under the Conditions of Employment Bill which was passed last year.  I discovered that we did not bring prosecutions because of some convention that the tourist industry should not be obliged to obey the law in this area, that it was a weak industry.  I changed that, because I believe that, however difficult the competitive position of an industry may be, it should comply with the law.  We initiated prosecutions where there were grievous cases of underpayment.  In one case in County Wexford we collected £800 arrears of wages due to employees in the hotel concerned.  It is the example of such enforcement in a locality that is the important thing.  Only a minority of employers refuse to carry out their civic duty but they give the majority of good managers a bad name.  The short answer to the Senator is that if the inspectorate had to work alone against the full spate of public and employer hostility towards it, they would be inadequate, but I do not conceive that that will be the situation.</P>
    <P>Employment under 14 years is, of course, totally prohibited.  After such a long lapse of years of non-activity in this area, we had to take an age point which might be regarded by some as impractical but to go under which would have been very bad socially.  Therefore we decided that employment under 14 would not be countenanced under the law.  We are permitting exceptions between 14 and 15.  I made the point that youth organisations do not agree with total prohibition of employment under the age of 15, and the compromises we have reached are on that basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> Senator Kennedy referred to meetings with both youth organisations and trade unions.  We have been in constant touch with them to see how far we could meet the conflicting desires of the various interests involved in order to enact the best legislation. This legislation cannot simply be invented out of the heads of civil servants or a Minister in a Department. The legislation which emerges is the result of much meditation and discussion with the interests concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator Dolan asked whether young persons helping their parents or working in holiday periods would come under this Bill.  If their parents are so hard-hearted that they insist on exploiting their children by having them work the kind of hours outlawed in this Bill, they certainly will be prosecuted.  I do not think this is likely to happen.  In the past there has been some evidence of complicity on the part of parents or guardians in permitting exploitation of their children by long hours in over-heated conditions late at night in hotels, public houses and so on.  The Senator raised the question of light non-industrial work during the holidays. I must say that other Deputies and Senators raised this question of the kind of work which could be described as light non-industrial.  That will be for me to decide, but I will be taking the criteria adopted and used in other ILO instruments in deciding what is light non-industrial work.</P>
    <P>I think it was the same Senator who raised the question of the employment of children who referred to the question of late-night working. Section 14 provides that under 15 years, they shall work up to only 8 p.m.; between 15 to 18 years, up to 10 p.m.  It must be remembered that there must be a rest period after the young person finishes work after 10 p.m. Senator Yeats referred to the early start at 6 a.m. but there must be a 12-hour break in between, so it would be illegal for a child or a young person finishing at 10 p.m. to start again at 6 p.m.</P>
    <P>The same Senator raised the question <Col N="1128" /> of the power to make exemptions and regulations.  I have that power, but I would need real evidence of a variety of circumstances that would lead me to bring in these exemptions.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan felt that the minimum age for employment should be left at 14 years, and that viewpoint illustrates the dilemma in choosing any formula that would meet with agreement on all sides.  The Senator advocated youth employment right across the board.  Admittedly the Senator qualified this by saying that he wished to exclude heavy work, but I would say that long hours, even in the hotel industry, constitute heavy work, and I would certainly be against long hours for people under the ages of 15 or 16 in the hotel industry.  He referred also to the important work being done by young people in the hotel industry.  I am all for their doing important work in the hotel industry with good staff accommodation, of course, but, the hours must be controlled; otherwise we have the kind of scandal which this Bill seeks to tackle, that scandal which saw young people who are eager to get pocket money, not too concerned about working long hours and, therefore, exploited in seasonal occupations such as hotel work by a minority of employers. Young persons who for one reason or another took up jobs during the summer holidays were not averse to working long hours thus endangering their health, and so the employers escaped the charge that they were exploiting such young people.</P>
    <P>I and other Ministers, and perhaps other representatives here in local authorities, may have down the years received the shocked comments of visitors to our country who are not impressed by this exploitation of Irish children in the hotel industry.  It is only a minority who are doing this, but they are giving a bad name to a very important service industry.</P>
    <P>The question was raised whether those in the 15 to 18 age group should be permitted to work after 10 p.m.. You come back to the argument as to the hour at which you say &ldquo;not after this hour&rdquo;.  There is the 12-hour break which I referred to in another <Col N="1129" /> instance.  I think Senator McGowan was also interested in the definition of types of non-industrial work at which children under 15 could be employed.  Section 2 defines that industrial work for the purpose of the Bill, and consequently the types of work which are non-industrial.  By exclusion you can see what would be regarded as light non-industrial work.</P>
    <P>It is my intention at a later stage to produce a pretty clearly understood handbook so that workers in industry around the country may understand their rights, obligations, duties and so on.  I intend, subsequent to this Bill going through, to publish material on the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats referred to the exempted categories and the non-application of records of section 5 to these excluded groups.  I will look at this point on Committee Stage and it may be necessary to improve the drafting as he suggests.</P>
    <P>The conditions in section 4 (2) for light, non-industrial work are in line with the provision of the ILO Convention on minimum age for employment. He mentioned hours of work in general.  I will look at the case for variation downwards of normal hours but it must be considered that there is a difference between the normal and maximum hours of work.  In this legislation, under the various sections, there is a maximum hours clause and a normal hours clause.  Naturally, there is a big difference between the two.  When the Senator referred to the recommendation of the EEC he is referring to normal hours of work and it will be quite some time before that recommendation of the EEC becomes a directive.  When the hours of work situation changes, I will certainly look at the question of varying the order under my control.  The maximum hours are a different conception completely. If one looks at the maximum hours permitted, one sees that ten hours per day are permitted in section 7 (1) (a) but when it is worked out over the entire year it will be seen that the average is cut down to 43 hours per week; it must be measured between the yearly average and the daily average permitted under <Col N="1130" /> maximum headings.  There is a complete difference between the maximum and the normal.  After the maximum, there is an actual breaking of law; an actual offence is committed, carrying heavy fines.  The fines under these headings are pretty large, up to £100 per day; these arise if the actual maximum hours of work clauses are infringed.  Under the normal hours clauses it is a completely different situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey referred to the problems of enforcement.  I have already covered that question in reply to another Senator.  This problem will require a great deal of co-operation from all sections of the community. Senator Markey also raised the question of exemption and I will look very closely at any requests for exemptions, for hotels or any other sectors. However, I will need considerable persuasion before I give anything away in terms of downgrading certain of the provisions contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I accept the need for publicity on some of the terms of this Bill because they could be considered as rather arcane, hard to understand; when one thinks of the people who must gain advantages from them, they might, perhaps, be the last to understand their provisions.</P>
    <P>It was at the annual meeting of the National Federation of Youth Clubs in Gormanston this year that I announced this Bill.  I hope with the aid of the youth organisations to make known the provisions to their members.  It may not be very popular with many of their members when it prevents them from working under the age of 14 but it is undoubtedly in the interests of young people in the long term that this Bill should go through.</P>
    <P>There are other interesting sections here which we will probably look at in more detail in Committee.  The section on which I hope to have this meeting, at a later stage, with all those concerned with youth employment with co-operation between the Department of Education, my own Department, employers and other bodies interested in this area is bringing in a kind of educational experiment which would permit young people <Col N="1131" /> to have a blend of work and school for particular age groups.  That is possibly outside the scope of this legislation but I would hope that the enactment of this Bill will lead on to measures of that kind.  It seems to me in all of the legislation going through the Oireachtas, over so many years &mdash; I have to mention the figure of 30 years &mdash; the plight and problems of young people in our society have not been dealt with.  If any of the Senators were listening to a news bulletin this morning, they would have heard that of all the EEC countries we have the largest population under the age of 14; of all the EEC countries in coming years, this country will increasingly be one of young persons.  The legislation of the Oireachtas must come to protect their real needs and reflect their problems more and more in our society.  It would be my contention that we have not done that up to now.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for the points they have made.  I hope we may come back and answer or meet some of their suggestions on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I think we could adjourn <i>sine die</i> but it may be about 9th April.</P>

      <P>On that question, while I appreciate that it is not yet known on what day the House will resume, might I urge the Leader of the House, if at all possible to avoid 9th April because the European Parliament is meeting that week?  While it is not always possible to avoid clashes with the European Parliament, at the same time if there is any choice, I should prefer 16th April.</P>

      <P>Yes, if we can facilitate the Senator, certainly, but Senator Yeats knows the problems. We shall do the best we can. We are conscious of the points raised.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.25 p.m. <i>sine die.</i></P>
