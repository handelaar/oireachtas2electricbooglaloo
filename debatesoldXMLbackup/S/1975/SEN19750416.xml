      <P>Before we commence business I should like to indicate to Senators that the slight delay in starting was due to a breakdown in machinery.  Senators must bear in mind that it may be necessary to record the proceedings of the House by shorthand.  Senators who have been accustomed since the introduction of the recording to lowering their voices will please raise them back to their normal level.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for having, as is the custom of the House, given me prior notice of his intention to request leave to move the adjournment of the Seanad on a definite matter of urgent public importance.  In order for such a matter to be allowed it must be both urgent and of public importance.  The matter is undoubtedly one of public <Col N="272" /> importance, but, taking recent developments and the current position into account, I do not consider that it possesses the degree of urgency requisite under Standing Order No. 26 for the granting of the Senator's request.  In the circumstances I must rule that the motion is not one contemplated by the Standing Order.</P>
      <P>This ruling is, of course, without prejudice to the right of the Senator or, indeed, of any Senator, to give notice of motion in the usual way in respect of this matter.</P>

      <P>Fishermen with whom I spoke last night completely disagreed with what the Parliamentary Secretary said in the Dáil last night.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that the Government were doing everything in their power to help the fishing industry.  The price of white fish has remained the same for the past 20 years.  Unless this Government do something concrete for this industry quickly, the fishing industry as a whole will come to a halt.  In view of all this, does the Chair not consider that this House should be given an opportunity to debate this very urgent matter?</P>

      <P>I have considered the application from Senator Augustine Martin to raise, on the motion for the adjournment of the House tonight, the following matter:</P>
      <P>The financial plight of certain secondary schools.</P>
      <P>I consider that this matter is so wide that it should not come forward for discussion on the adjournment but rather by way of substantive motion. Such questions cannot be regarded as proper subjects for the adjournment owing to the inadequacy of the debate and the lack of provision for coming to a decision.</P>

      <P>We are not discussing the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>I have notice from Senator Mary Robinson that, on the motion for the adjournment of the House tonight, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The fact that the annual Reports of the Board of Visitors to the National Museum have not been printed or laid before the House since 1969-70 report which was laid in 1971, and the fact that the House is thereby deprived of the opportunity to scrutinise the work of the Museum, and in particular its supervisory role on archaeological excavations.</P>
      <P>I am accepting that notice and the matter will be taken from 9.30 p.m. to 10 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Order of Business and from what was said earlier by Senator Quinlan, I submit that this urgent problem arises because of the inadequacy of capitation grants.  With that in mind Senator W. Ryan and I put down Motion No. 28 on today's Order Paper:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the impending collapse of Post Primary Education in Ireland owing to the total inadequacy of capitation and fee grants.</P>
      <P>Would the Leader of the House take that as a priority for immediate debate?  As I said, this situation arose because the system is in danger of collapse.  Capitation grants have hardly increased over a period of eight years and are not being paid at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Senator Lenihan's plea to have Motion No. 28 discussed.  I suggest it be discussed tomorrow because of its urgency.  It is very hard to watch the system being strangled through lack of finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine every Member of this House who puts his name to a motion thinks it is in most urgent need of consideration.  I, too, would like to ask the Leader of the House to facilitate a number of Senators from both sides in giving time for an early discussion of Motion No. 27 which reads:</P>
      <P>That a Select Committee of the Seanad, consisting of nine members of whom three shall form a quorum, be appointed to examine the implications of varying the parity exchange rate between the Irish Pound and the Pound Sterling and report from time to time on such aspects of this matter as the Committee may select; and that the Committee have power to send for persons, papers and records.</P>
      <P>This is not a political motion in the sense that I would hope it would have the full support of Members from both sides of the House.  Already it is supported by many Senators from widely differing backgrounds and political views.  Nothing could have more emphatically or dramatically underlined the necessity for taking this motion at an early stage than yesterday's British budget which was of a severity that underlined the present economic plight in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>The motion on the Order Paper does not prejudge the issue.  It asks that a Committee be set up to examine the issue.  Therefore, it is not a case of trying to put forward one point of view over another.  This is of sufficient urgency to merit immediate attention.  There is one argument against the taking of this motion which I would like to dispose of: that a discussion of this type would rock the boat <i>vis-á-vis</i> Northern Ireland. That is a superficial view.  If one looks at the situation one will realise that it is time we gave full consideration to and had a full and open discussion of our dependence on the United Kingdom and of seeking to break this dependence by violent means&mdash;the bomb and the bullet&mdash; means which I reject and deplore.</P>

      <P>I hope that when I start the clock will go back.  I want to underline that this motion, by its very nature, needs to be discussed at once. If we are too late, if there is a large sterling devaluation and we have not examined the position and done something about our parity with sterling, then we will be in severe difficulties. Therefore, I would like the Leader of the House to do his utmost to arrange a debate on Motion No. 27 at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my urgings to those of Senator Lenihan on Motion No. 28.  In doing so, I am not in any way decrying the importance of the motion referred to by Senator West, No. 27. Obviously, it is both an important and interesting topic, but, I think, of less immediate urgency than the problem of post-primary education.  I would urge the Leader of the House to try and put this motion on tomorrow, and, while many of us are interested in the Wildlife Bill, I would suggest that as between discussing wildlife tomorrow and discussing post-primary education, Senators would prefer the latter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will appreciate that, in so far as it is the desire to have Ministers present for motions, it would not be reasonable to expect me to give any assurance without consulting the appropriate Minister or Parliamentary Secretary, as the case may be.  Senator Lenihan's request, supported by Senator Yeats, does create some difficulty, in that Senator Lenihan has already given us an order of priority in respect of Fianna Fáil motions, and we have been endeavouring to honour what was not a precise commitment but an understanding that we would take them as suggested.  We have succeeded in making definitive arrangements for the taking of the motion dealing with agriculture.  There is a request now that that should be jettisoned in favour of Motion No. 28.  We shall have to look at it and see if it is possible to take No. 28.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Senator West's plea for <Col N="277" /> Motion No. 27, if it is possible to arrange to have this taken early I shall be very glad to do it.  The problem here is purely a physical one, that the Minister for Finance cannot be in two places at the one time.  He is, of course, heavily engaged on financial matters.  How soon it will be possible to arrange it, I do not know; but I shall have a look into it with a view to having it taken as early as possible.</P>

    <Title>Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1975: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate on this Bill was adjourned I was about to examine the proposal to establish a broacasting complaints commission under section 4.</P>
      <P>I welcome in principle the idea of a broadcasting complaints commission but I join with the other Senators who criticised the cumbrous and bureaucratic structure of this proposed commission as set out in section 4.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately the Minister did not give the House any background details of the number and nature of complaints handled by the present complaints advisory committee which he established last year.  The only reference to this body in his Second Reading speech was a brief reference in passing when he said:</P>
      <P>This system seems to have worked well and the commission provided for in the Bill is to give a statutory basis for this solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, I have no objection in principle to having a complaints advisory <Col N="278" /> committee set up on a statutory basis, but I think this proposal is unnecessarily top heavy in achieving that desirable object.  It contains certain provisions which I do not at all welcome, such as that contained in subsection (2) which reads:</P>
    <P>The Commission shall consist of a Chairman and not less than two other members who shall be appointed by the Government.</P>
    <P>This suggests that it could grow to quite a large body, as there is no restriction on the number of members of this body, and these members shall be appointed by the Government and may be removed only by resolution passed by both Houses.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (7) provides:</P>
    <P>There shall be paid to members of the Commission such remuneration (if any) and allowances (if any) as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, from time to time determines.</P>
    <P>Again this gives one the idea of a very substantial body with the possibility of fairly full-time people on it who would require remuneration and allowances. This can only be justified if the circumstances warrant it.  Subsection (13) reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Public Service should assign to the Commission such officers and servants as in his opinion are necessary to enable it to perform its functions.</P>
    <P>It would appear, therefore, that the proposals for a broadcasting complaints commission would envisage a body which would require a team of civil servants to help them discharge their functions, once again giving an image of a very bureautic structure. We must be very careful in this respect, because the financing of this body will come out of the licence fees, as provided for in section 9, paragraph (a) (iii) of which the Minister will deduct:</P>
    <P>the amount of a grant or grants made by the Minister under section 18A of the Principal Act (inserted by section 4 of this Act),</P>
    <P>Therefore the more money that is spent on that body the fewer resources will <Col N="279" /> be available for programmes on RTE. There is a very real need for restraint in this matter in establishing a broadcasting complaints commission on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>However it is in relation to one of the functions of the commission that I have the gravest disquiet; in fact this is perhaps one of the most invidious proposals in this Bill, that is, the proposal that the complaints commission and the Minister would have a function in relation to the internal code of the authority.</P>
    <P>When I began my contribution to this debate I said that there were certain provisions which I would be opposing specifically.  I have already dealt in detail with section 6, relating to open broadcasting.  This is another provision with which I take substantial issue and which I hope will be excised from the Bill during the debate. The provisions in question are under section 18b of the Bill which provides:</P>
    <P>Subject to the provisions of this section, the Commission may investigate and decide any of the following complaints&mdash;</P>
    <P>Then paragraph (e) reads:</P>
    <P>(e) a complaint that a programme broadcast by the Authority and so specified contravened a code to which this paragraph applies,</P>
    <P>In order to understand that provision one must go through this highly technical section until one comes to subsection (13) (a) which provides:</P>
    <P>Where a code is drawn up by the Authority governing standards and practice for programmes (apart from advertisements) broadcast by it, the Minister may, if he thinks fit, after consultation with the Authority, give a direction in relation to the code, and in case the Minister so gives a direction he shall, as soon as may be, inform the Authority of the direction.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) provides:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, after consultation with the Authority, cancel a direction given by him under this subsection, and in case the Minister <Col N="280" /> cancels a direction given by him under this section he shall, as soon as may be, inform both the Commission and the Authority of the cancellation.</P>
    <P>This is a new and, in my view, quite unwarranted power which the Minister is seeking, a new function for the complaints commission and a new power to himself to issue codes in relation to either the existing or the future internal functions of the authority.  This is both an unnecessary provision and one which runs counter to the whole basic principle behind the Bill, which I welcomed&mdash;the reinforcement of the independence of the authority: that they are an independent authority, that they have a function as public trustees, that they have duties imposed on them including the maintenance of impartiality. Yet here we have a provision for a completely new encroachment on the executive, on the internal codes of the authority.</P>
    <P>I would have the strongest objection to any such proposal.  I think it would substantially erode the authority's present responsibility in the field of programmes and that it is contrary to the basic principle behind the establishment of an independent authority. I would hope the Minister would be prepared, in the light of the criticisms made by the various Senators who have contributed, to bring in a much simpler version of his complaints commission on the basis of what is a realistic workload, of establishing a complaints commission to act as a body to scrutinise and take up unanswered complaints by members of the public.</P>
    <P>One of the functions of the complaints commission is in relation to the duties this Bill would place on the authority prohibiting them from unreasonably intruding on the privacy of the individual.  I view that provision as placing a statutory duty on the authority which, if the authority are not prepared to carry it out, might give rise to damages to an individual who had been unreasonably intruded upon, who would have recourse to the courts and get damages rather than go through this complaints machinery where there is no power in <Col N="281" /> the commission either to impose any sanction or to award damages.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that a commission of this sort will be required to report annually.  This is one of the advantages of giving them a statutory basis.  The present advisory committee have not got a statutory obligation to report and we do not know the extent of their present workload.  I hope the Minister in his reply will give some information on this aspect.</P>
    <P>One other section which I should like to refer to in detail is section 17, relating to programming.  To my mind the explanatory sentence at the side is deceptive.  It refers to &ldquo;Regulation of local programmes for distribution on cable systems&rdquo;.  If you examine with care the actual provisions of that section it seems to me to be the regulation of the distribution of cable systems.  I think that at this time in relation to cable television and the enormous potential of it, we should be going further in a Broadcasting Authority Bill than providing for the regulation of distribution through licence by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The whole idea of cable television is the major growth area in relation to television.  It has immense potential and could provide very creative and welcome opportunities for local community programming on the basis of using closed circuits.  In this Bill we should be thinking ahead as to how to regulate standards of local programmes. Though I would require more information before I could be sure this would be the right solution, I would be personally strongly in favour of local control of local programmes, of having democracy operated in the real sense at local level and not to try to centralise local programmes.</P>
    <P>Though it is important to regulate the distribution of local programmes on cable systems, I do not think this section really touches on the whole issue of cable television and the potential of this type of communication and the impact it could have on local communities.  Therefore, I would welcome more details from the Minister on this aspect and some indication of his thinking on the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="282" /> Finally, because I have already had a generous opportunity of making clear my views on the Bill, I should like briefly to return to what I consider to be the major key issue in the Bill, that of the future of television in Ireland and what is to happen in regard to the second TV channel. It is clear that the primary function of a second channel is to redress the unfair balance of geography, the unfairness of the situation that part of the country is excluded from the advantage enjoyed by the other densely populated part of the country because of its geographic proximity to Britain and the fact that it can avail of multichannel viewing.</P>
    <P>I come back again to the Minister's obvious preference for BBC 1 as the second channel to be rebroadcast under the present proposal in section 6.  Having thought about the matter since we debated the Bill last, there are various problems posed by this proposal.  If BBC 1 were licensed by the Minister to be the broadcasting service in the Republic on the second channel, RTE would be faced with very serious consequences.  First, it is obvious that public money would have to be invested in the network facilities for broadcasting BBC 1 and a substantial sum of public money would have to be spent annually on acquiring programmes rights.  These moneys would come from whatever would be the total resources made available to finance broadcasting in the Irish community.  Therefore the funds available to finance broadcasting and the resources available to RTE would be diminished accordingly or would not be enlarged to the same extent because there would be this further cost from the total pool.</P>
    <P>Secondly, RTE would have the serious problem of being faced with competition from a broadcasting service which is designed to compete.  The development of BBC 1 has been the corporation's answer to commercial broadcasting in Britain.  It has been tailored and directed to be competitive and this is being backed by all the skill and talent which the BBC have at their disposal.  The object is to secure the largest possible slice of the British audience.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> Because they have the advantageous position of a two-channel service, the BBC are able to discharge their public function as well as competing for the largest audience possible.  It is highly debateable whether RTE, working from much smaller resources, would ever be able to win in a straight battle for audience against the BBC.  One must be aware that there are only two options for RTE if BBC 1 is to be rebroadcast in Ireland and to be effectively a second channel.  I have already dealt at some length with the first of these options, which is to enter into direct competition with the BBC.  Undoubtedly a national service cannot go into direct competition with a basically commercial competitive service such as the BBC without losing or having to shed some of their public service obligations. It is not reasonable to envisage that RTE could have, for example, farming or education programmes or programmes in the Irish language at peak times and compete with BBC 1 during those periods.  Inevitably, there would be a tendency to cut back on virtually all serious broadcasting.  Apart from the capacity to compete in terms of finance&mdash;undoubtedly, the BBC have much greater resources than are available to RTE&mdash;there is also the necessity to compete in terms of talent and skill and these assets are much fewer here than in Britain, partly because many of our talented actors have emigrated and partly because the pool from which they are being drawn is so much smaller.  If, for example, RTE were to compete in the field of light entertainment, from where would they get these programmes?  Would they buy them at, presumably, high rates from ITV or would they buy American entertainment programmes and also endeavour to mount some such programmes of their own?  With the resources available to them could they compete with the vastly greater resources of the BBC?  Therefore the contest would seem to be a most unequal one from every point of view &mdash;finance, manpower, the obligation on RTE to provide a national service and so on.  It is very difficult to see <Col N="284" /> how RTE could compete on any sort of favourable terms.</P>
    <P>The second option and, in my view the only other option, is for RTE not to compete.  This means that RTE would have to accept their role as a second service, as a minority channel, approximating in some respects to BBC 2 in Britain.  In other words, they could decide to discharge to the full extent their public service obligations without paying attention to the size of the audience viewing their programmes and without trying to attract a major audience.</P>
    <P>The effect of this would be very serious in regard to RTE's capacity to earn revenue from advertising because the advertising would not be forthcoming if RTE were not drawing major audience rating.  It is arguable and an important consideration that RTE, as a second channel of this nature, might hold more of an audience because of their being a national product.  A significant proportion would view RTE because they would be providing a national programme with which the audience could identify, but it is difficult to see how that size of audience could be more than an average of 20 per cent on a regular basis of the viewing public.</P>
    <P>I have read some of the comments made at the time when the BBC had the option either of entering direct competition with ITV or of becoming a second channel, of becoming the cultural channel in Britain.  That was before the division between BBC 1 and BBC 2.  The BBC rejected forcefully the argument that broadcasters cannot voluntarily abandon the service they provide to a major audience. In a sense there is no doubt that in the long term a service commanding only a small section of the viewing audience would lose, first, the respect of the public and, secondly, the capacity to draw on public money.</P>
    <P>I repeat a point made earlier, that is, that it is very difficult to see how any Government, however well intentioned, would have the political will to support a minority programme not holding more than 20 per cent of the audience.  Having had an opportunity <Col N="285" /> to reflect on the implications of rebroadcasting BBC 1 here on a second channel as a policy decision, I have concluded that the implications for the national service would be extremely serious.  This is a situation about which we should think much more deeply and with much more information at our disposal.  It is a matter that I would like to see deferred rather than that it would be decided on in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to see section 6 being withdrawn and the whole question reconsidered because this is one of the most important matters to come before the Oireachtas for many years.</P>
    <P>As a final comment on this aspect, there is substantial merit in the original perspective in which the Minister was considering his concept of open broadcasting, namely, the idea that television could make a very important contribution to a better understanding among people of this country, North and South, because we do not know enough about the life style, habits, customs or even humour of the people of the North and they do not know enough about such characteristics so far as we are concerned. The result of this has been suspicion, prejudice, bigotry and the tragedy of this country.  That basic idea should not be lost although the reality of it appears not to be possible and I say &ldquo;the reality&rdquo; because it is clear that in the present proposal for rebroadcasting BBC 1 there is no element of reciprocity, that RTE would broadcast in Northern Ireland.  Despite the fact that it is not possible to achieve the full idea of a liberal and free exchange of programmes and viewing between the two parts of this island, and indeed in the islands generally, it should be possible in whatever scheme for the second channel comes forward eventually to incorporate the very positive idea that the programmes which originate in Northern Ireland, whether BBC or UTV, programmes which originate there&mdash;current affairs, news, farming programmes or whatever they may be, programmes involving local people, showing their attitudes and viewpoints&mdash;should be rebroadcast on the second channel or <Col N="286" /> rebroadcast in Ireland on one or other of the channels depending on how the overall scheme would be structured.</P>
    <P>In that context I tried to make some inquiries about the proportion of programme services coming from Belfast, whether BBC or UTV or home-produced, and I was not able to get an entirely satisfactory answer on this.  I am sure the Minister would have much better resources than I would have and therefore I would welcome some clear figures on the proportion of home-based Northern programmes which are broadcast either on BBC Northern Ireland or on UTV because it is my understanding that it is a relatively small proportion and that a much more significant proportion is made in either Manchester or London or indeed, probably, Hollywood.  Therefore, in talking about open broadcasting in the sense of programmes coming from Northern Ireland one must realise that quite a small proportion of these programmes is actually home produced in Northern Ireland and it would be possible to have these programmes rebroadcast.</P>
    <P>I think there would be a very real possibility of having specific programmes from Northern Ireland which are home-produced in the North rebroadcast here and have reciprocity at the programme level rather than at the programme service level where you open up your airwaves in that sense.  There is a very real value there and that value should not be lost by Senators who object to the idea of opening up the airwaves to the foreign broadcasting service which could rebroadcast as the second channel in this country.</P>
    <P>I wanted to have an opportunity of expressing a view on this because I look forward to the Minister's reply to the viewpoints he has heard expressed on this question which I think is a very fundamental one in this Bill.  I should like to conclude by again thanking the Minister for bringing this Bill into the Seanad.  I regard it as one of the most important Bills to come before the Oireachtas for a considerable time. I am glad that in this House we have had the opportunity of examining it <Col N="287" /> before it goes before the Dáil and I hope the Minister will have benefited from the debate in this House.</P>

      <P>Like most other Senators who have spoken, I should like to express my appreciation of the fact that the Minister has brought this Bill into the Seanad and also my appreciation of the manner of his presentation of the Bill to the House.  Certainly, I should have thought that the Minister's approach to the presentation of the Bill did not call for the type of unqualified, all-out opposition which was, as I understand it, promised by Senator Lenihan.  I thought the Minister was extremely reasonable in his invitation to the House to consider the terms of the Bill and in his assurance that he <Col N="288" /> wanted a proper and full debate and consideration of the proposals in the Bill and in his further assurance that amendments which might be tabled for the Committee Stage would receive careful consideration.</P>
      <P>Speaking as a Senator supporting the Government, I want to say that many times when I was on the opposite benches I should have been very glad to welcome a Minister coming into this House with that kind of approach and presentation.  From time to time I did have the pleasure from those benches of welcoming such an approach particularly, as far as I can recall, on occasions when the late President Childers, as a Deputy, came to this House with legislation.  It was right that the Minister should have referred to him in his opening remarks.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's invitation, so far as I can, to discuss this Bill possibly rather critically, as regards some aspects of it but to discuss it from the point of view of putting forward points which I hope the Minister may be able to consider and possibly deal with, if he regards them as useful, on subsequent Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very necessary when we are considering a Bill dealing with the national broadcasting service that we should be very clear in our minds that there is a very big distinction between a medium engaged for the purpose of a national broadcasting service and other types of media. Here, we are dealing with a medium which has been described by more than one speaker&mdash;rather, the authority has been described&mdash;as a trustee for the State.  We are dealing with a situation where not merely the bricks and mortar but all the services which are being provided by this broadcasting authority are being provided by the people of this State and they should be provided for the people of this State.  I do not want in any way to denigrate the status of journalists for whom, not merely as a politician but personally, I have a great regard, because I know the extremely difficult task which faces journalists throughout the whole scope of their operations. I know their tasks are very <Col N="289" /> often difficult and very often thankless. I do not want to appear in any way to be criticising journalists as such.</P>
    <P>In the context of a State service provided by the people for the people, the position of the journalist engaged in the broadcasting service should not be the most important consideration in our minds.  The paramount consideration should be the ordinary member of the public who is paying for and entitled to expect to get the service he requires from the national broadcasting service.  I say that deliberately because in my view it would be completely erroneous to approach this Bill predominantly from the point of view of journalists or those engaged in the operation of the broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>Their position is important.  Their goodwill and services are essential to make the broadcasting service a success. I do not believe it would be a correct approach to put their interest first.  There is a distinction between the national service provided by the State under the national broadcasting service and other media.  This distinction is spelled out in this Bill.  So far as newspapers, cinemas or any other privately controlled medium is concerned, they are, of course, entitled to editorialise in whatever way they like.  They can adopt different policies on matters of public concern or public controversy and change them from time to time if they desire.</P>
    <P>A service operated as a national service for the State by a broadcasting authority is in a different position. Consequently it was considered necessary in the past, and it is considered necessary under this Bill, to put in statutory provisions regarding balance and impartiality.  The provisions are in section 3 of this Bill and section 18 of the previous Bill.  From a politician's point of view impartiality is one of the most sensitive areas in broadcasting and television.  It is true to say that imbalance can arise in a variety of ways.  It can arise by a specific point of view being plugged by a commentator or reporter on radio or television.  It can arise by the weighting of a panel in a panel discussion or by the weighting of an <Col N="290" /> audience, when a studio audience is chosen.  It can also arise in the allocation of time, even where a panel is evenly balanced with views for and against a certain topic.  All these things are important.</P>
    <P>It is obviously a very difficult job for a Minister drafting legislation or presiding over a Department to which the broadcasting authority is answerable to so arrange things that there will be perfect balance and perfect impartiality.  While dealing with the question of impartiality, I should like to draw the attention of the House to a discussion here last week on the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill.  I saw one television newscast in which the proceedings of this House were reported.  My recollection is&mdash;and I am open to correction on this&mdash;that it referred to the speeches of six Senators. Five of the six speeches were from Senators opposing the Bill and one from a Senator who supported it, namely myself.  I do not regard that as a properly balanced newscast.  That could quite legitimately be the subject of a complaint to the Authority or to the complaints' commission being for-malised under this Bill.  I am sure those responsible for compiling that newscast thought they were reflecting the debate in this House, because there was a preponderance of speakers against taking the Bill on the Order of Business.  There was not such an overwhelming preponderance in terms of speeches, in my view, to justify a five-to-one recording on a newscast. I do not mind if my words are conveyed to RTE&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  My primary reason for raising this is to point out the sensitive nature so far as politicians are concerned on impartiality and also the difficulties experienced by those responsible for balancing programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 deals with impartiality. It also contains what has become a matter of serious controversy in connection with this Bill: it prohibits the inclusion in programmes of matters which might incite to crime <Col N="291" /> or lead to disorder.  I have had representations from the National Union of Journalists in this connection.  I want to say clearly that I do not agree with the submission from that union in connection with section 16, or (IA) of section 3, of this Bill.  Section 3 (1 A) provides that:</P>
    <P>The Authority is hereby prohibited from including in any of its broadcasts or in any matter referred to in paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of this section anything which may reasonably be regarded as being likely to promote, or incite to, crime or to lead to disorder.</P>
    <P>Various objections have been expressed in regard to the phrase &ldquo;lead to disorder&rdquo;, and it is conceded that it is quite proper to preclude anything which might be likely to lead to crime. The argument is made that the phrase &ldquo;lead to disorder&rdquo; is vague and that it may give rise to problems.  I would quote from the representations made to me by the National Union of Journalists.</P>
    <P>The prime difficulty is in defining &ldquo;disorder&rdquo;.  It could embrace many now almost conventional degrees of protest and political action, including strikes, sit-ins, farmers' blockades, and even the housewives' temporary blocking of a road to focus attention on the need for a pedestrian crossing.  To report or comment on any of these could be held to invite imitation.</P>
    <P>That puts in a nutshell the argument that has been made against this provision. I can see the anxiety there. I can see that any reasonable person would say that, merely because the presentation of something on the television screens or the reference to it in a radio broadcast could cause someone else to imitate it, should not automatically be a ground for excluding the particular matter from the screen or from the radio.  I think most people would go along with that, but where do you draw the line?  Even if there were not particular reasons for it&mdash;and I intend referring to a particular reason in a minute&mdash;I feel very strongly that it is necessary for someone in authority, and here it happens <Col N="292" /> to be the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, to be able to take a firm grip of the situation and say where the line should be drawn.</P>
    <P>Why should a broadcasting service, whether it be television or radio, have the right or demand the right to indulge in activity, through their screens or through their microphones, which may lead to disorder?  Surely it is up to all of us&mdash;and it does not apply only to us as public representatives but to the ordinary law-abiding citizen&mdash;to see that the national broadcasting service, either deliberately or accidentally, will not be allowed to incite to disorder.  I do not care whether the disorder is grave disorder or a lesser category of disorder; I think it is necessary to take that power.  The power was there previously, but it is put in a slightly different way this time.  Apart from that, a considerable time ago the people of this country placed an onus on the person who happens to be Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for the time being to ensure that radio or television or any like media would not be used so as to undermine public order or, putting it in another way, would not be used so as to incite to disorder.  That is contained in the provisions of Article 40 of the Constitution. It has already been quoted here, but it is no harm to quote it again in this context where it says:</P>
    <P>The right of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.</P>
    <P>that is one of the fundamental rights which are guaranteed, and then it goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The education of public opinion being, however, a matter of such grave import to the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.</P>
    <P>I do not know that the Minister made this argument in connection with the Bill, but it seems to me that, even if <Col N="293" /> the Minister wanted to get rid of this responsibility, he could not do it because there is a constitutional obligation on him to shoulder this responsibility of seeing that the National Broadcasting Authority cannot be used to undermine public order or morality.</P>

      <P>I am not going to set myself up as a judge of what should or should not be shown on the screen, but if the Senator's interjection is intended to mean&mdash;I am sure it is not&mdash;that the television authority should have a right to show things which would incite to public disorder, then I would say it should not be shown and that they should not have that right.</P>

      <P>Presumably someone has come to the conclusion that Senator Gus Martin and Senator Michael O'Higgins are not going to get out in their rowing boats and imitate the trawlermen, and that there is little danger of inciting to disorder which would undermine the authority of the State.  I am talking about a matter of general principle not about detail.  I think that is all we can discuss on this Bill, and I want to come down very firmly and categorically on one side of this argument and say that, as a matter of principle, I think it is right that this section should be there and that there is a constitutional obligation on the Minister to have the powers proposed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Passing on from that, I think section 3 (1) (b) was criticised by Senator Lenihan and, oddly enough, Senator Lenihan himself provided the answer to the criticism.  It says in effect that the &ldquo;foregoing provisions&rdquo; including this one I have been talking about which prohibits the inclusion of matters likely to incite to crime or to lead to disorder, will not apply to anything which is rebroadcast by the <Col N="294" /> Authority pursuant to a direction given by the Minister under section 6. If one reads that without going into it very much further it seems to be an extraordinary provision and people would obviously ask why on earth should the Minister be in a position to give a direction the result of which might be even against the wishes of the Authority itself, because they, of course, must comply with his direction, the result of which might be to force the rebroadcasting of a programme which would or which might be, for example, partisan, which might be such that it was likely to incite to disorder.</P>
    <P>My first reaction on seeing that provision before I considered it more deeply was that I would be content for the Minister to have the power to redirect broadcasting but that I would not be happy that his direction should result in flouting what I regard as a very necessary and very excellent key section of this Bill.  However, when one considers it further&mdash;and realises that the Minister made clear in his opening speech that when he refers to rebroadcasting he is referring to the rebroadcasting of the full service and not of individual items&mdash; obviously, in such an event&mdash;once the direction is given and the authority must comply with it, the matter is out of control, so to speak, so far as subsection (1) (a) of section 3 is concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan raised a point also&mdash;and I have some sympathy with this&mdash;in relation to subsection (1) of section 3, where it is provided that in applying the balancing provision of this subsection two or more related broadcasts may be considered as a whole provided that every interval between such broadcasts is reasonable. My general reaction to this is that I am not enamoured by that provision. It would be reasonable that the power to balance by providing a programme after an interval should exist as a residual power in the authority, but if it could be achieved I would prefer that the Minister would seek to achieve that the impartiality would be, and would be seen to be, in the programme being broadcast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know to what extent it would be possible to achieve that.  I agree with this power as a last resort measure if there has been an inadvertent, accidental imbalance in the presentation of a programme on any topic.  I should like the Authority to have the power to try to counterbalance that situation even after an interval.  But if it were possible to deal with it in the other way, I would prefer that other way. I am sure the Minister will have considered this matter and I look forward, when he is replying, to hearing his view on it.</P>
      <P>Again, on section 3, another matter which was referred to critically by the NUJ was the provision in subsection (1) (c) of section 3 whereby the Authority are prohibited from unreasonably intruding on the privacy of any individual.  This is another area in which I must differ with the journalists. I recognise the difficulties of their vocation, that by and large they must make their living by getting news and that, willy-nilly, they may be put in the position of trying to lift veils, open windows and reveal secrets.  I can see that a provision such as this might hamstring to some extent, but is the provision unreasonable from the point of view of the ordinary individual?  To look at it in another way, would it be reasonable to give <i>carte blanche</i> to anyone to intrude on a person's privacy?  The wording of this subsection is that the authority are prohibited from unreasonably intruding on the privacy of any individual.  Therefore, if reasonable steps are taken by journalists under the aegis of the Authority and if these steps cannot be classed unreasonable, it is still open to the Authority through their journalists or other agents to take those steps.  What they are precluded from is unreasonably intruding on the privacy of any individual.  That is an execellent provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the complaints commission which is dealt with in section 4, again the innovation here is excellent. While I have no criticism to offer regarding it, I should like to present <Col N="296" /> this idea for consideration to the Minister. I doubt the wisdom of the stock exclusion in section 4 of Members of the Oireachtas.  This type of provision has become a stock one in legislation when any bodies are being set up.  It is regularly provided that no Member of the Oireachtas may be a member of that body, that if a person who is a member of any such body becomes a Member of the Oireachtas he will be required to resign his membership of the former.</P>
    <P>I understand the motive behind such exclusions.  It is an entirely commendable motive.  My personal recollection is, and this is open to correction, that the long line of these present exclusions that now appear regularly in legislation started with the National Newsagency Bill which was being brought before the Dáil by Mr. Seán MacBride who, at the time, was Minister for External Affairs.  That would have been about 1949.  There were provisions such as these in some of the earlier Acts dealing with the ESB but the present line of exclusions stemmed from the National Newsagency Act.  I wonder if the time has not come to look at this provision again and to consider it on its merits.  It seems to me that to put it into legislation as a matter of course is a little demeaning of politicians generally.  Even from that point of view we should look at it again.</P>
    <P>In relation to the complaints commission referred to here I ask the Minister to give this provision very special consideration because, as I have said already on the question of impartiality, probably the most sensitive people in the country are politicians, Secondly, the politicians are in a unique position to reflect what is referred to generally as grass roots opinion, to reflect ordinary public opinion with regard to programmes.</P>
    <P>I think the presence of politicians on the complaints commission might be a very good idea.  It might strengthen the commission.  I would go so far as to ask the Minister to consider the desirability of writing into the Bill a right to the recognised political parties in the Dáil each to nominate a member of the commission or a panel from which the Minister or somebody else <Col N="297" /> could choose whom the actual nominee would be.  I have not thought this out very fully but it seems to me offhand that the commission might be strengthened by the presence of politicians among them and that public confidence, certainly political confidence, in the structure of the commission would be established and maintained by giving the right to political parties to nominate representatives.</P>
    <P>Section 13 has been subject to comment already and I wish to add my own.  Paragraph (a) deals with the general duties of the Authority and states:</P>
    <P>be responsible to the interests and concerns of the whole Community, be mindful of the need for understanding and peace within the whole island of Ireland,</P>
    <P>I have no objection to that.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>ensure that the programmes reflect the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of the whole island of Ireland,</P>
    <P>What I want to ask the Minister to consider is whether that phrasing of the paragraph does not effectively amount to a blanket exclusion of all other programmes because the duty of the authority is to ensure that programmes will reflect the varied elements and so forth.  Supposing there is some other type of programme, say one dealing with rock formation or something like that, which has nothing to do with the people of Ireland, is the Minister confident that such a programme is not excluded because of the statutory duty being imposed on the authority to ensure that programmes will be reflective of particular things? Most of the comment on this section has been with regard to paragraph (b):</P>
    <P>uphold the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution,</P>
    <P>I should like to join the few others who would ask the Minister some questions on this, to ask him to look at the wording of it again.  I appreciate that the Minister was most reasonable in his opening remarks in indicating he would like assistance in working out how these duties should be spelled out.  Why single out &ldquo;democratic <Col N="298" /> values&rdquo;?  What are the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution?</P>
    <P>I have gone to the trouble of looking through the Constitution to see if I could find out what the democratic values are.  The word &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; is mentioned once in the Constitution, in Article 5 which defines the State as being a sovereign, independent, democratic State.  I do not think &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; or &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; is mentioned anywhere else in the Constitution. The Constitution does clearly and manifestly set up a democratic structure.  It provides for a freely elected Parliament responsible to the people and a Government responsible to the Parliament.  It provides for adult suffrage, it provides for a democratic form of election, and, though the provision was opposed by the successors of those who framed the Constitution, it provides for proportional representation&mdash;all structures of a democratic State.</P>
    <P>But what are the democratic values?  Is it the structures that are intended to be referred to in this paragraph? If so, it seems to me it is probably unnecessary to impose a statutory obligation on the Authority to uphold the democratic structures because they will do that anyhow.  If it is the structures that are contemplated I should have preferred that word used in the Bill because whatever values in a political sense&mdash;using the word broadly&mdash;are enshrined in the Constitution seem to me to be values applicable in a democracy but which would not necessarily be out of place in any other form of State structure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to come around to that.  There are clearly values spelled out in the Constitution but they would not necessarily be regarded as democratic values.  There is the concept of the common good, which is referred to throughout the Constitution&mdash;for instance in Articles 6, 41, 43 and 45. There is the concept of public morality, referred to, for example, in Article 40, which I have quoted already, <Col N="299" /> and Article 44.  These are values which are enshrined in the Constitution but there are also fundamental rights which are regarded as values in the sense we are talking about.</P>
      <P>But all these, whether they be rights or values, could be equally relevant in a form of State structure other than a democracy, and consequently I am not sure that that paragraph could not be amended with benefit.  I would be attracted to the suggestion of Senator Quinlan that instead of referring to democratic values it should simply refer to the values enshrined in the Constitution.  However this is a matter which I imagine the Minister, because of his invitation to the Seanad in particular, will consider further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another what I might call subsidiary point to which I shall refer, not in order to be mischievous but because I think it is relevant.  If we refer to the Constitution in this Bill and to a duty on the Authority, which would exist anyway, to uphold the Constitution, we are doing so in a climate in which it is said there is a move for change.  It is the present Constitution we are referring to in this Bill, and let us be clear about it.  I do not know to what extent there is a mood for change as regards the Constitution. As a person who, if he had been old enough to vote when the Constitution referendum was taking place, would probably have voted against it because the whole discussion at that time was in the political arena and was dealt with on the basis of something which was politically controversial, it is right to say, and I think I have heard my colleague, Senator Alexis FitzGerald say this, that the Constitution has proved to be a valuable document and it has fairly well stood up to the test of time.  Certainly, talking for myself, I would like to be able to see and study and understand very clearly any alternatives that were proposed before I would feel justified either in considering for myself or recommending to others that we should depart from the existing Constitution at the moment.  The point I started to make was: let it be clear <Col N="300" /> that we are referring to our present constitutional values under this section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have said most of what I want to say about the Bill.  I think the Minister has done an extremely good job not merely in coming forward to this House with these proposals but in his general approach and his general analysis of the position.  He does not ask us to subscribe to all of the arguments he made and the questions which he posed, but to my mind he dealt with some of the problems with regard to national broadcasting and television, some of the problems concerning the State, in an outstandingly excellent manner.</P>
    <P>I was particularly taken by a portion of his speech which appears at column 788 of the Seanad Official Report of 12th March, where he says:</P>
    <P>Commentators insist on the failures of democracy and yet tend to assume the survival of democracy as something to be taken for granted.  A strong overt commitment to democracy is less than general: indulgent attitudes to certain of the enemies of democracy are frequent. A free Press, whose life-span can be no longer than that of the democratic State under which it exists and under which alone it can exist, has on the whole turned its critical attention more closely on the faults of that State than on the forces which threaten it.</P>
    <P>That was a very profound observation by the Minister and it is one which I hope we will all think over because it is one which bears very deep consideration by everyone engaged in public life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin, since there will not be a great deal else in this Bill which I can thank the Minister for, by thanking the Minister as others have done for introducing this Bill in this House.  Unlike another Bill which we will be discussing next week, this is a very suitable Bill for initial discussion in this House.  Therefore, I join with the other Senators in thanking the Minister for having taken the opportunity of bringing it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have just heard an interesting <Col N="301" /> speech from the Leader of the House, one with which I did not wholly agree but to a large extent I found myself in agreement with the things he was saying.  I should like to refer to one of his early remarks about a statement by Senator Lenihan that we would be resisting this Bill in various Stages, and he suggested that this was perhaps an unreasonable threat to make in view of the fact that the Minister had said in his opening statement that he would be open to consider amendments on the Committee Stage.  Of course, we were happy to hear him say this.  We would be even happier if, in fact, he did agree to substantial amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that we have to take this Bill as it stands and have to consider our attitudes to the Bill as it stands on Second Reading. Obviously, the Bill cannot be amended in any respect until the following Stage. Therefore, all we can say is, as Senator Lenihan has said, that the Bill as it stands is totally unacceptable to us and therefore we are forced to vote against it on Second Reading.  What happens later, of course, is another story.</P>
    <P>This Bill has two distinct aspects. I think one can say in its first aspect, an aspect which I suppose takes up the greater part of the Bill, it is essentialy technical.  It makes changes of lesser or greater importance, lesser or greater controversy in the existing administration of our television and radio services and the RTE Authority.  Some of the sections concerned are controversial, others less so, but they are essentially technical matters and not of outstanding importance in the sense of being changes in the law which would affect the life of this country for many years to come.</P>
    <P>The second aspect, though, covers certain very important, indeed vital, matters of principle in regard to the entire nature of the television programmes that are to be transmitted in this country for many years to come. It is this second aspect which is really vital and it is this second aspect of the Bill which to my mind is extraordinarily dangerous.</P>
    <P>If I may deal first very briefly with the first aspect of the Bill&mdash;I will go <Col N="302" /> into more detail later on&mdash;there is the question of the status of the RTE Authority, a change in the method of their removal, a change which in general though not of profound importance is to be welcomed.  There is the question of the statutory rules with regard to objectivity, which was dealt with at some length by Senator O'Higgins.  I will also deal with this later on.  There is the creation of the new complaints commission.  There is the question of local programmes&mdash; again to be welcomed, I think on the whole.  There is the same controversial matter of the ministerial instruction with regard to incitement to violence, disorder, and so on.  Then there are a variety of miscellaneous financial and other provisions such as one tends to see in Bills of this kind.  These, as I say, I will deal with in more detail later on, and of course we will discuss them at some length on Committee Stage.  As I have said, some are more or less controversial but none is of really fundamental importance.  They leave the basic structure of Radio Telefís Éireann essentially unchanged and, indeed, the relatively minor nature of these changes is of some significance.  It suggests that those who originally founded Radio Telefís Éireann, laid foundations that have stood the test of time fairly well, as indeed the Minister pointed out in his opening speech.</P>
    <P>However, the second and vastly more important aspect of the Bill is what one can only describe as the attempt by the Minister to scrap the entire television service as it has existed until now and in effect to reshape and refashion it after his own image.  In simple terms, what the Minister proposes to do is to try to ensure that more than half of all the television programmes transmitted in the Republic of Ireland will derive from Britain, and, indeed, these British programmes, whether BBC 1 or UTV, are deliberately excluded in the Bill from any semblance of Irish control. Allowing for the fact that at present approximately 50 per cent of RTE's own programmes are created in Ireland&mdash;I am not sure what the figure is but it is somewhere around that <Col N="303" /> figure&mdash;three-quarters, in fact, of all the programmes transmitted in the Republic will be foreign, more in fact, because, as the Minister knows, both BBC and UTV have much longer hours of transmission than RTE and so in actual terms of time expired it is quite clear that the total proportion of foreign material transmitted by RTE, whether directly or indirectly, will be probably well over 80 per cent of the total.</P>
    <P>We get on then to the relatively small proportion of programming which is to originate in Ireland and here we find that so far as there will be any Irish programmes, the Authority's instructions, as laid down in section 13, are in effect&mdash;in the wording devised by the Minister&mdash;to disregard the entire concept of an Irish nation or of Irish nationality.  In fact, had the marvels of modern science developed sufficiently so that television could have been inaugurated in 1900 this is just about how it would have been in the conditions when we were still part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister's justification for section 6, which delivers a great part of our television service over to the management of the BBC?  It originated in the Minister's initial concept of open broadcasting, a concept now lost&mdash;one assumes&mdash;irretrievably.  I never understood it completely but, so far as one could understand it, the concept was that on the one hand RTE would be completely available as to 100 per cent for the population of Northern Ireland and, on the other hand, one or possibly all the programmes originating in Northern Ireland would be available to all the population of the Republic.  This was a concept which created many difficulties, not least the fact that the greater proportion&mdash;whether 90 per cent or 98 per cent, I am not sure, but certainly by far the larger part&mdash; of programmes transmitted from Belfast, in fact, come over the landline from England.  Apart from the problem created by that situation one could see the obvious advantage that the people of Northern Ireland, whatever their political or religious creed, <Col N="304" /> would be able to hear something of how we feel down here and equally, from our point of view, it would be some advantage to be able to increase our understanding of how people feel in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Nobody, least of all myself, would object in the least to RTE transmitting programmes which originate and are created in Northern Ireland. If the Minister were to suggest that all UTV or BBC or other television programmes that originate and are created in Northern Ireland should be transmitted here, I would be entirely in favour of it.  We would lose nothing and would gain a great deal from hearing say, Ian Paisley or William Craig or Brian Faulkner or members of the SDLP whom we hear anyway. I should like to be able to hear the culture programmes, many of them quite good that originate in Belfast and certainly folk music and entertainment programmes generally originating in Northern Ireland.  These would be a valuable addition to our television service.  Even for the Minister and those who think like him it would be quite useful to discover that the people of Northern Ireland are not perhaps as orientated to English ways as I think he sometimes tends to feel.  For example we all essentially share the same folk music.  I do not hold the slightly romantic view that I admit some people hold that Northern Protestants are essentially well-meaning people temporarily misdirected from the true light who, any day now, will turn into full-blown Irish republicans. I do not think that is in fact the position but I think that after 300 years&mdash;and more&mdash;in Ireland, however much we may disagree with them on many issues or they may disagree with us, they are certainly not English. They are far more Irish than English.</P>
    <P>Even their Orange songs which contain sentiments that few of us would be willing to agree with are very often set to Irish tunes.  &ldquo;The Old Orange Flute&rdquo; has a tune which is the tune of hundreds or scores of ballads and songs both in Irish and English including that rather entertaining Dublin ballad of the Grand Canal called &ldquo;The Return from the Thirteenth Lock&rdquo;.  &ldquo;The Boyne Water&rdquo; is set <Col N="305" /> to the old Gaelic tune of &ldquo;Rosc Catha na Mumhan&rdquo; which we learned at school.  The rather curious little ditty called &ldquo;The Lament of the Protestant Emigrant&rdquo; goes to the old Gaelic tune &ldquo;Grá mo Chroí&rdquo;.  There are many more.</P>
    <P>However non-Irish our Orange friends may think sometimes they are they certainly use all the best Irish tunes.  The problem is that only a very small proportion&mdash;I have seen 2 per cent suggested and this seems a bit low&mdash;of television programmes broadcast from Belfast originate in Northern Ireland.  In general, programmes broadcast either from UTV or BBC originate in England.  The Minister has dealt with this by saying &mdash;it seems to be rather <i>non sequitur</i>&mdash; in the Dáil on 13th June, 1974, as reported at column 1160 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The situation whereby the services that come to us from Northern Ireland are linked with the British services, ITV and BBC, exists because the majority of the population of Northern Ireland have wanted it that way.</P>
    <P>That is a very dubious statement; I suspect things are that way because there is not enough money to produce any more programmes in Belfast.  If you ask any Northerner, whatever his politics, if he would like more home-produced programmes from Belfast he would say that of course he would but the money is not there.  We all know of these problems of money. The Minister says that this is the way things are because it is the way they want it and that it follows from that that is the way we ought to want it which is where there is a <i>non sequitur.</i> I cannot see the reason behind the argument.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister misunderstands the rationale behind the existence of our television service.  Suppose we had completely open broadcasting or even a united Ireland so that our own television service was sent to all parts of Ireland one could then put up a good argument for saying that at least 20 per cent of our programmes should be geared to the needs, wishes, desires <Col N="306" /> and the principles of our Unionist fellow countrymen.</P>
    <P>As the Minister admits, for some time to come the output of Telefís Éireann will go only to the Twenty-six Counties, with a relatively minor overspill to 10 per cent or 15 per cent of the population of Northern Ireland. Therefore we are not sending our programmes to the inhabitants of the Shankill or Sandy Row.  I do not understand why we should gear our programmes to the wishes of the Northern Unionists.  I am not saying that we should go out of our way to insult them.  But, whether we like it or not, we are programming for the people in the Republic.  I should have thought that this was the way we would look at it and not try to cater for 20 per cent of the Irish people who do not agree with our principles and traditions.  We could modify our attitudes to suit them, if we had a 32-county Ireland.</P>
    <P>The first justification for the curious wording of section 6, which is to bring in the BBC or UTV as a second channel, was that this is the way it is done in Northern Ireland. It is said that since the people there like it, we should also adopt that principle. The second justification is that we must take the BBC or UTV, as the case may be, because they are already available on the east coast. Because of their geographical situation people on the east coast can get these channels.  Therefore, these channels should be available to everybody else.  This is an irrational argument.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, television from Britain is available to those living on the east and south-east coast because of their geographical situation.  Other European countries have land frontiers and in many cases have access to television stations in other countries. For example, in Luxembourg they get television reception from three countries&mdash;Belgium, West Germany and France.  None of these countries has taken the Minister's attitude.  On the contrary, they have tended to take the attitude expressed by Senator Alexis FitzGerald, who said at the end of his speech, reported <Col N="307" /> at column 816, Volume 79, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>If we Irish fail to put things Irish first, nobody else will put them first.</P>
    <P>That is a very sound attitude.  This is the attitude adopted by various European countries.  There is no genuine case in any European country where what the Minister proposes in section 6 has been carried out.  The fact that there may be people living along the frontier who can receive programmes from another country has never been used as an excuse for bringing the whole concept of foreign broadcasting into their countries, as suggested here in section 6.</P>
    <P>We must look at the second channel for RTE and forget about the chances of geography which have brought BBC and UTV to a certain proportion of homes along the east coast.  Not all homes along the east coast get very good reception unless they have cabled television, which covers approximately one-quarter of the population of Dublin.  The problem is simple.  We have the possibility of a second channel for RTE.  What is the best that can be done?  To my mind it should be left under Irish control, presumably that of RTE, and used to broadcast a selection of the best programmes available from Great Britain, the United States, Europe and elsewhere. There will be certain problems of language with programmes from Europe but to some extent they can be overcome.  There would, of course, be no language problems with programmes from Britain or the United States.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the debate in this House before Christmas that people from Cork, Waterford and Limerick did not want to have their programmes censored in Dublin.  He is an expert in using emotive words. Naturally if one goes to any Irishman and says: &ldquo;Do you want your programmes censored in Dublin?&rdquo; if he does not live in Dublin he will say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I prefer to put it another way. I would ask people in Cork, Waterford <Col N="308" /> or Limerick if they want their television programmes to be chosen by an Irishman or an Englishman. The answer I get will be very different from that given to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister used the word &ldquo;censoring&rdquo; when he meant &ldquo;choosing&rdquo;.  In every country somebody in the television or radio station must decide which programmes are to go out.  He is the censor, although he is not called that. Under section 6 the Minister is to be the chief censor; he is to overrule the authority and decide what programmes are to be broadcast so far as the BBC are concerned.  That is an exceptional and, I hope, temporary situation.</P>
    <P>The Irish people would prefer these matters to be decided in Ireland rather than England.  It is suggested that we get the entire programmes of the BBC from morning till night.  We would then be dominated completely by a foreign sense of values.  We would be dominated by the slanted news which we know so often exists with regard to Irish affairs on the BBC.  Because of the problems presented and the nature of the BBC broadcasts, the Minister has at all stages in the Bill had to exclude them from any effort to maintain cultural values, avoid incitement to disorder and so forth.</P>
    <P>On St. Patrick's Day I was looking at a BBC programme from America which interviewed supporters of the Provisional IRA.  Under this Bill, and the existing law, those interviews would be forbidden to RTE.  As everyone knows Daithí Ó Conaill was interviewed on BBC on a number of occasions.  As I said, the Minister made specific inclusions at every stage so that, despite the fact that RTE programmes were to be governed by the provisions of this Bill, BBC or UTV were to be specifically excluded from any semblance of Irish control.</P>
    <P>I will agree with the Minister to this extent.  There is a feeling in Ireland, particularly in the areas which receive only one channel, that they do not want a second RTE channel. I put it to him that while insisting&mdash;<Col N="309" /> and the Irish people would want him to insist&mdash;that the second channel should be kept firmly under Irish control, he should try to introduce an element of competition.  Ireland is too small to be able to afford a second television authority which would be a very cumbersome way to deal with the situation.  Under the aegis of the existing television authority it should be possible to introduce an element of competition between the two channels&mdash;for example, the two directors general could be in competition for listeners, advertising and so on.</P>
    <P>If one could do this and in particular could show the public that there was this element of competition between the two channels, many of the difficulties which undoubtedly exist at present would be eliminated. I accept completely that there is a feeling among people who are in the single channel areas that they are being kept out of something the other people have.</P>
    <P>What would the result be of having these British programmes transmitted in the manner suggested by the Minister? It is quite clear that RTE could not compete in the production of these programmes with the kind of money that is available to the BBC.  The average income per head in Britain is almost 50 per cent greater than ours, and they have about 60 million people where we have three million.  We would be swamped by this new form of competition. We would be dominated even more than we are at present by a foreign culture, by foreign standards of taste and by slanted news.  We have been independent in this part of Ireland for more than 50 years.  It is not untrue to say, I think, that even to this day the dominant external influence in our lives is still Britain, socially speaking, culturally, in sport, trade, economics and in many other ways.  Much of this is inevitable because of our joint history; much as we may regret it, we did have a history in common.  Much of it is inevitable because of the chances of geography.  Nonetheless it has always been our consistent effort to try <Col N="310" /> as far as we could to escape from this dominant influence and to create an Irish society of our own.</P>
    <P>We entered the EEC for a variety of reasons mainly, I suppose, of a practical and economic nature, but undoubtedly one of the reasons we entered the EEC, and one that persuaded a considerable number of our people to vote for entry, was the feeling that inside the European Community we would be able to expose ourselves to a wider variety of cultures and that we would escape from this dependence on Great Britain.  The proposal of the Minister would completely reverse this decision the people took in joining the EEC.</P>
    <P>The television has, above all other cultural influences, an overwhelming impact.  With the aid of section 6 of this Bill we would be thrown back to a greater dependence on Great Britain than at any time since the nineteenth century.  The Minister knows a good deal better than I do that towards the end of the nineteenth century one of the compelling reasons behind the whole concept of the Irish literary revival was that at that time the books were not published in Ireland and the people did not read anything written in Ireland; they only read the third rate novels that came from England, the nineteenth century version of television. One of the main reasons the Abbey Theatre had to be founded was that at that time there were no professional actors or actresses.  Those who were writing plays at that time had to import these professionals from London, therefore one of the main reasons, perhaps the main reason, why the Abbey was founded was quite simply to create an Irish company able to act in Irish plays.</P>
    <P>No matter what happens with the television service, we are not going to be thrown back completely to the nineteenth century.  Fortunately, we now have the ability to maintain our own cultural influences.  We have publishers, theatrical companies and so on, but nonetheless in many respects we shall be as much under the domination of our near neighbours <Col N="311" /> under this system, if it ever operates, as we were at any time in the nineteenth century.</P>
    <P>One wonders sometimes just who wants this English second channel. Certainly it was not wanted by the Broadcasting Review Body because they suggested, as I have suggested, that the second channel should be given to RTE with a view to their broadcasting the best programmes available from other countries, including Britain, but not exclusively Britain.  One can only assume that the RTE Authority do not want the provisions of section 6.  Under the 1960 Act the RTE Authority have full power to broadcast programmes from anywhere they like.  The only point, as I understand it, about section 6 is that it gives the Minister power to force the RTE Authority to carry out this power in a certain way.  It does not give them any power they did not already possess but enables the Minister, as a dictator, to dominate the RTE authority, and to say: &ldquo;I know you do not want this, but more than half of your television services are to be taken from this British source.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister says the people want this service, but the alternative has never been put to the people in the single channel areas of an Irish programme which would, as I have mentioned, broadcast the best that can be had, and I am not talking about the best in the sense of programmes of high cultural standards.  I am talking about pop programmes, every kind of programme that appeals to all kinds of people, highbrow, lowbrow.  If one put it to the people that the second channel should be Irish and could take its programmes from all over the world, I think they would go along with this.  If we were to explain to them that something more is involved than simply suggesting that they would not want their programmes censored in Dublin, we would find there would be an overwhelming vote against the provisions of section 6.</P>
    <P>There are, perhaps fortunately, extremely complex legal problems involved.  The way the Minister has put <Col N="312" /> it one would think that all that had to be done was to sign on the dotted line and say: &ldquo;All right boys, you can take our programmes from now on.&rdquo;  There are copyright and other considerations involved; possibly hundreds of people in relation to any particular programme would have rights of one kind or another.  The legal problems are so complex that&mdash;it may be wishful thinking on my part&mdash;it seems to me that they are insoluble.  One can only hope they are.</P>
    <P>On a more practical level there is the question of the viability of RTE and, in particular, of those who work there.  This is a matter on which one must place great importance. However, one must insist that the basic dangerous problem arises&mdash;not so much the immediate problems, though these could be very grave for those who work in RTE&mdash;of the cultural situation in Ireland for generations, perhaps centuries to come.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned I was dealing briefly with the legal problems involved in the rebroadcast by RTE of one of the British television channels.  The problems seem to me to be pretty well insoluble.  It is difficult to see how in respect of any individual broadcasts there would not be more than 100 people in a position to sue either RTE or the BBC for fees or payments of various kinds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the viability of RTE in the event of this kind of competition being forced upon them, <Col N="313" /> there are two issues.  The first is naturally of immediate interest to the trade unions concerned, the problem of large scale unemployment of highly skilled workers in the almost certain event of RTE having to cut back on their activities in competition with the enormously richer channels across the water.  The Minister has said that in this event the Government would come to the aid of RTE, or rather that he would ask the taxpayer to make up whatever loss RTE suffered.  In that event there would be less unemployment, though it is difficult to see how any additional money provided in that way could provide work for people whose services were no longer required.  But the long-term prospect raised is one which is more serious than what simple temporary or permanent unemployment would be caused.</P>
    <P>One has the picture first of all of more than half of our television services coming from a foreign country and that part of them which originates in Ireland gradually running down, becoming less and less viable in itself.  You would have this rich, prosperous television organisation in Britain coming in on our wavelengths and at the same time, correspondingly, the Irish part of television output gradually running down and becoming of less and less importance.  And as it runs down the standard of the programmes would decline still further.  There is the prospect that fewer and fewer of our own people would be drawn to watch our own television service.</P>
    <P>Apart from this provision, in section 6 the power given to the Minister to force&mdash;the only word one can use&mdash;the RTE Authority to rebroadcast simultaneously a channel from Britain, we have section 13 which, while of less practical importance, in principle is equally objectionable. It is an important reflection of the Minister's thinking.  The wording of this section, which is obnoxious, undesirable and dangerous, is of interest in showing to some extent the way in which the Minister's mind has been running; and it provides us with some kind of guidance as to the <Col N="314" /> reason the section is framed in this way.</P>
    <P>First of all, a point to consider is: where did the Minister get the wording of this section?  The answer is that in its essentials it comes from the report, at page 20, of the Broadcasting Review Committee, 1974.  All of the items in section 13 were recommended in that report, in particular the need to consider the cultural attitudes and requirements of the whole of Ireland.  This was mentioned by the committee, who referred to the relationship between Ireland and the other EEC countries. The difference is that the Minister has turned the whole proposal of that body upside down.  It would be best if I read into the record the proposal which was made by the Broadcasting Review Committee as to the type of policies which ought to be carried out by the RTE Authority:</P>
    <P>Broadcasting should be concerned with safeguarding, enriching and strengthening the cultural, social and economic fabric of the whole of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The broadcasting system should provide a service which is essentially Irish in content and character and which in particular encourages and fosters the Irish language.</P>
    <P>This service should:&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i)  be a balanced service of information enlightenment and entertainment for people of different ages, interests and tastes covering the whole range of programming in fair proportion;</P>
    <P>(ii)  be in Irish and English with appropriate provision for other languages;</P>
    <P>(iii)  actively contribute to the flow and exchange of information, entertainment and culture within Ireland, and between Ireland and other countries, especially her partners in the European Economic Community; and</P>
    <P>(iv)  provide for a continuing expression of Irish identity.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister has rewritten these requirements the whole content and principles behind these change utterly. <Col N="315" /> There is nothing in the Minister's text about safeguarding nationality or strengthening the cultural, social and economic fabric of the whole of Ireland.  There is nothing in this about the service being essentially Irish in content and there is nothing which would suggest that we ought to encourage and foster the Irish language.  Far down the list there is a rather weak suggestion that we should have special regard in particular for the Irish language simply as one of the elements which distinguish the culture of the people of the whole island of Ireland, nothing about encouraging or about fostering it. Where the review body had suggested that the service should actively contribute to the flow and exchange of information, entertainment and culture within Ireland, and between Ireland and other countries, especially our partners in the European Economic Community, this emerges in the text as &ldquo;promote understanding of the values and traditions of other countries, particularly the EEC&rdquo; but there is no question apparently of the exchange of information, entertainment and culture. There is nothing to suggest that Ireland is a nation or one with an ancient national tradition.  In paragraph (c) of this section we even have a statement:</P>
    <P>have regard to the desirability of promoting understanding of the values and traditions of countries other than the State....</P>
    <P>Why the State?  Why not &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; or &ldquo;the nation&rdquo; or some phrase like that?  We have the neutral political word &ldquo;the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Curiously enough, while, as I say, the Minister's text on section 13 of this Bill has absolutely no reference to the concept of Ireland a nation or fostering Irish traditions, culture or anything like that, the Minister's memorandum, whoever drafted it, goes quite a bit further.  We find in paragraph 14 of the memorandum which explains this Bill the statement:</P>
    <P>Section 13 widens and clarifies the general duty of the Authority in regard to their obligation to provide a national broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> I am sure that is what whoever wrote this hoped would be done, but the Minister's text at no stage suggests that we are operating a national broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>Therefore we have the situation that on the one hand a large part of our television repertoire, if that is the word, is to come from a foreign country and, on the other hand, even where we do produce our own programmes there is no obligation of any kind on the RTE Authority to consider in any way the fact that they are an Irish television service, that the Irish language and culture generally ought to be fostered.  There is apparently no concept of nation, of nationality, to be allowed.  In this the Minister seems to follow what one can only describe as a latter-day Redmondite policy, where it seems to forget history and tradition, at least so far as this Bill is concerned.</P>
    <P>One thinks of the extraordinary statement which he heard last week from a Senator opposite when he said we should forget about James Connolly who, after all, was dead for more than 50 years and it is time we forgot such people.  The problem is that under the present Government and under the present Minister with regard to this Bill we apparently are expected to forget our national past. We no longer celebrate the Easter Rising at Easter.</P>
    <P>It would seem that the views of Northern Unionists are, if not more important than, at least as important as our own.  I have the greatest respect for the views of Northern Unionists.  I have been on very close terms with some of them at least in former days.  I never agreed with them on anything, but I have the highest respect for them as individuals. We can have the highest respect for our Northern brethren who disagree with us politically without at the same time lying down on this sort of doormat before them.</P>
    <P>It seems now that anyone who utters any kind of national sentiments or who reveres, as very many of us still do, the people who created the Irish State is accused in some way <Col N="317" /> of being an apostle of violence.  I can assure the Minister that I am not an apostle of violence; I abhor the type of violence taking place in our country today.  I suggest to the Minister in all sincerity that possibly no individual in the country does more to build up the so-called, modern IRA than he himself does.  I know that is not his intention but he and people who think like him constantly think of the so-called Provisional IRA as descended from the IRA of the early twenties, 1918, 1919 and so on.</P>
    <P>This is false propaganda accepted by too many people and put across by the so-called IRA of today.  They are not in any way descended from those who created our modern State.  I would remind the Minister as a historical fact that we would not have obtained a separate Government in Dublin at the time we did had it not been for what are described as the men of violence.  But there is&mdash;and I am perfectly certain the Minister accepts this as much as anybody else; in fact, he has enunciated this himself on many occasions&mdash;a basic, clear distinction between those who fought for Irish freedom before we had an independent Government and those who defy the only army of the Republic that exists at present.  I appreciate that the Minister understands this clear distinction but I put it to him that by constantly associating, as he does, those who have respect for Irish traditions, particularly the Republican traditions, particularly for the Republican traditions which in the course of our War of Independence brought about the creation of an Irish State, in suggesting that such people are in some way aiding and abetting, creating or encouraging the type of mindless violence that we see in Ireland today, he is doing no one a service.  He is certainly not doing our party any harm, but I think he is building up the present so-called IRA in a most dangerous way.</P>
    <P>I urge him to abandon this and to abandon the type of approach which we can see in this Bill where, whether he means it or not, the whole implication <Col N="318" /> in the wording of the Bill is that we are to forget about our past, about our traditions, about our separate culture and our Irishness, which is the only thing that distinguishes us from anybody else.  We are to accept the whole paraphernalia of culture that comes from abroad. That comes in any event and we can do nothing about it, but we do not want to encourage it to the extent of giving over a large part of our television service to this kind of influence from abroad.</P>
    <P>To show what I mean, the Minister recently wrote an article which I shall not go into in any detail&mdash;it is neither relevant nor necessary&mdash;which I think was called &ldquo;Shades of Republicanism&rdquo; about the Fianna Fáil Party.  I disagree with almost everything in it but there was one paragraph which, when I had read it, caused me to burst out laughing.  It seemed to me the funniest thing I have read since the late Myles na gCopaleen died. This was the picture it presented of a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies in some room in Leinster House on a certain occasion, singing that well-known ballad &ldquo;Down by the Glenside&rdquo;. The Minister produced this as an awful, ghastly example showing that, whatever their protestations, at heart these Fianna Fáil gentlemen were really wild and woolly men of violence.  This, I found extraordinarily funny.  That ballad is my favourite of all ballads; it seems to me a moving ballad with a beautiful tune and the thought that one cannot sing it without being accused of being some kind of fellow traveller with the Provos struck me as ludicrous.</P>
    <P>The problem is that we are not now dealing with an article of a highly propagandist nature written by an individual in a newspaper but that this type of outlook which presented itself in that article comes out now in section 13 of the Bill&mdash;the concept that Irish nationality, the old ballads, the Republican tradition, which many will, I think, insist on revering, must be abandoned because the Minister feels that their perpetuation is in some way perpetuating the IRA.  I <Col N="319" /> suggest it is he more than anybody else who is helping to perpetuate the IRA.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed some surprise, I think, in the course of his article at how, despite all the things he complained about in Fianna Fáil, Fianna Fáil in office were often the most effective people in dealing with the IRA.  I think he was right because Fianna Fáil have always been able to take a coherent line in regard to the IRA&mdash;that there is only one Republican Army and that there is every possible distinction to be made between those who fought for Irish freedom at the time when we had no Government and those who purport to fight for Irish freedom and, in particular, who make war on their fellow countrymen in Northern Ireland. There is every distinction between the two and that is why Fianna Fáil in office were often, as the Minister admits, the most effective people in dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>These are the basic reasons, I think, which have impelled the Minister to bring in what in other circumstances one would look upon as extraordinary provisions in this Bill.  If somebody said to me two or three years ago that the day would come when a member of an Irish Government would introduce a Bill solemnly proposing to hand over our television service in this way to another country and emasculate the Irish element to such an extent that any real Irish approach, is rendered irrelevant, I would have said it was ridiculous, that it could not happen. It has happened.  I urge the Minister &mdash;he said he would be pliable and would accept reasonable amendments &mdash;to think again particularly in regard to sections 6 and 13 of this Bill and agree to amendments which we would certainly put down to deal with the points I have raised.</P>
    <P>I can deal with the other matters in the Bill more briefly because we will be dealing with them again on the Committee Stage.  In section 2 there is the matter of the removal of the authority.  I agree in principle that this is an improvement&mdash;that <Col N="320" /> they can only be removed by resolution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am dubious about how much practical benefit it is to them as long as we have the situation under sections 6 and 16 they are subject to the Minister more than ever and more than ever subject to his direction.</P>
    <P>A number of people have spoken on section 16 and I will not go into detail on it.  Several people asked &ldquo;What is disorder?&rdquo; and what is meant by &ldquo;inciting or promoting to violence&rdquo;? There are humanists who say that &ldquo;Kojak&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tom and Jerry&rdquo; could incite to violence.  I do not feel that one need worry unduly about these programmes.  Once we put in the words &ldquo;incite to crime&rdquo;, without saying it for so-called political crimes or crimes against the State, one wonders precisely what is meant.  The problems presented to the Minister by those who work in RTE suggest that, in spite of all the criticisms made, there was something to be said for the vague wording of section 31 of the original and Principal Act.  Once we start to define things in legal terms we get into trouble.</P>
    <P>I was glad Senator Martin raised the question of the fishermen who favoured the blockading of ports.  That could easily be held to incite to crime or disorder.  I feel that is not what the Minister had in mind.  Under section 16 we should be considering crimes directed against the State.  I accept that the blockading of ports is calculated to lead to disorder, but it is not directed against the State.  Vague as the original section 31 was, it was clearly intended to deal with illegal armies by people who did not recognise the State and whose energies were directed against the State.  I would be sorry to see the new section 16 used for what might be described as civil crime or civil disorder.</P>
    <P>We will now deal with the impartiality of the authority.  While detailed reasons are laid down for impartiality, forbidding the promotion of or incitement to crime and so forth, none of this applies to the section of the service which is to come from abroad.  In so far as it does apply, I agree with much of <Col N="321" /> what has been said about the requirements for impartiality.  Much of it was good.  But I would be worried, as others have been, about the new provision that impartiality need not necessarily be in one specific programme but may operate over a number of programmes, provided there is not too long a gap between them.  This could lead to very grave problems, especially in the dimension mentioned by Senator O'Higgins.  In my view this could usefully be amended on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister's views on section 3.  The Minister said it is impossible to require from the BBC impartiality and an absence of incitement to disorder.  As the programmes are to be broadcast simultaneously, nobody except the British can control them.  We have no control over them.  Yet under section 3 the prohibitions from unreasonably intruding on the privacy of the individual applies to the BBC.  If one can require them not to intrude on an individual's privacy, one can require them to be impartial, not to incite to crime and disorder and so on.  I cannot understand why section 3 has been set out in this way.  The Minister seems to be having it both ways.  On the one hand the Minister says it is impossible to control the BBC and, on the other he is attempting to control them.</P>
    <P>I agree that the complaints commission will be very cumbersome. What would happen if RTE rejected the findings of the commission?  This Bill does not cover British broadcasting, except for safeguarding the privacy of the individual, neither does it cover this famous section 13.  There is not much in that section which one would want to defend.  Nonetheless, if anyone felt the cultural provisions were not being observed by the RTE Authority, there is no way in which these matters could be raised with the complaints commission. Experience elsewhere, especially in Sweden, suggests that this commission can lead to ill-effects.  The danger is that once we have a formal commission it becomes a court and a chain of precedents begin to build up. The programme producers then find <Col N="322" /> themselves constantly referring to the law books built up by these commissions and asking if such and such is allowed.  In other words, a legal situation arises with precedents being established by the courts.  From the point of view of the freedom of broadcasters, I suggest there is a serious danger here.</P>
    <P>I agree with the provision for local programmes.  It could be said that Deputy Colley, when Minister for Finance, originated the concept of local broadcasting with Radio na Gaeltachta.  I suggest that the licences issued by the Minister should be published, perhaps in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> In his opening speech the Minister said that in licensing these local programmes one of the considerations would be the actual programme to be shown.  He should have another look at this section, because it is not adequately stated that in issuing licences he can lay down conditions about the programmes.  That may be his intention but I am not sure if he has given himself adequate powers to do so.</P>
    <P>There is a variety of miscellaneous matters which are not very important that I will leave over until the Committee Stage.  While I hope the Minister will improve this Bill on Committee Stage, as it stands we have no alternative but to vote against it because it seems to be extremely dangerous to the cultural future of Ireland.  If it comes into force as it stands it will have irretrievable ill-effects on the future of Ireland as an independent cultural entity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be improper not to thank the Minister for initiating this profoundly important legislation in the Seanad.  On a previous appearance in this House he undertook to introduce his Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill in the Seanad and he honoured that promise here on the 19th March when he gave his Second Reading speech on that very Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are grateful the promise has been kept because the debate comes at a time when there is justified public concern with the efficacy and the efficiency of the Seanad and, indeed, <Col N="323" /> with parliamentary procedures in general.  In a sense the Seanad is on trial during the passage of this Bill and its relevance to Irish society will be judged by the manner in which it handles the subject matter before it. I have every confidence that the Seanad will continue to acquit itself well in processing this legislation and will prove itself to be not just an institution where there is a boring repetition of Dáil debates, but a forum where there can be analysis, criticism and proposals marked as much by freshness of approach as by partisan commitment to a party position.</P>
    <P>This debate is a challenge to the Members of this House and if we fail we cannot blame the occasion, the subject-matter, the Government, the media or any other handy scapegoat. We can only blame ourselves and submit to whatever parliamentary reform an impatient public will demand of the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we have or shall fail and I therefore deeply regret that agreement had not been reached prior to the opening of this debate on the proposal to broadcast Seanad proceedings, because not only would the subject have been a most appropriate introduction for live broadcasting but the style and content of the debate would have greatly enhanced the reputation of this House and of Parliament in general.  We have foolishly lost that opportunity through our own tardiness and it is we who will prove to be the biggest losers in the long run.  I hope that one of the beneficial by-products of this debate will be to confirm the belief that if we, as legislators, are sincere in our professed concern for the future of broadcasting, then it should be exemplified in a tangible and concrete manner by opening up our deliberations to the broadcasting media.</P>
    <P>However, having welcomed this Bill for the opportunity it gives to the Seanad to prove itself worthy of handling legislation of this sort before it goes into the Dáil, I wish to welcome it more particularly for permitting us to deliberate on what I believe are some of the central elements <Col N="324" /> in our democratic system and for forcing us to reflect on those issues in an atmosphere which is free of current controversy.  This Bill and, indeed the Minister's speech on it, compel us to examine our concepts of liberty and the right to freedom of expression, and to analyse more clearly the tension which exists between private freedom and the exigencies of the common good, to reflect upon those things which make us what we are as a distinct people so that we can truly look inwards at ourselves and finally to evaluate the role, the influence and the power of television and radio in our society.</P>
    <P>These are obviously very weighty concepts, and we should be grateful that a decade and a half after the enactment of the Principal Act we have a Minister who has the courage to reopen the debate on these fundamental concepts and the courage, perhaps one could say the foolhardiness, to propose that they might be translated into legislative form, in the light of 15 years' experience, with greater precision and definition.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the Bill contains 11 central propositions, and I intend to deal with these in the order in which they appear in the Bill.  They are: the removal of the authority, the question of objectivity and impartiality in news, the prohibition on the incitement to crime and disorder, the protection of individual privacy, the broadcasting complaints commission, open broadcasting, the functions of RTE, its financing, its general duties, ministerial orders, and the question of cable television.</P>
    <P>In looking at section 2 one must go back to the fundamentals of the Principal Act which pivots around two subsections namely, 3 (1) and 16 (1).</P>
    <P>Section 3 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>There shall, by virtue of this section, be established on the establishment day an authority to be known as Radio Éireann....</P>
    <P>Section 16 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>The Authority shall establish and maintain a national television and sound broadcasting service and <Col N="325" /> shall have all such powers as are necessary for or incidental to that purpose.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in the Principal Act the State has retained in public control the right to engage in television and radio broadcasting and has not permitted the establishment of commercial television or radio stations, and the amending Bill, rightly, does not propose to depart from this principle.  There is inherent in this decision&mdash;and I think this to be very important&mdash;a general philosophy which permeates the other provisions of the Principal Act and also of the amending Bill and which must be kept clearly in mind when reading the provisions of both.  It is a philosophy which contends that private ownership and control is appropriate to newspapers and other forms of communication but not to broadcasting and that the ethos of one is not to be the ethos of the other.  The purpose of broadcasting is to be solely the provision of a public service whereas in newspaper publication there are parallel commercial considerations which may in certain instances prove decisive.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (1) of the Principal Act therefore frees broadcasting from private control and from the constraints which are a necessary concomitant of private ownership and commercial criteria.  The Principal Act imposes a different set of constraint when in 16 (1) it defines the basic function of the new authority and therefore creates an entirely different environment in which radio and television are to be conducted.  The effects of that decision are elaborated in sections 17, 18 and 31 of the Principal Act and refined and extended by sections 3, 6, 13, 16 and 17 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>If RTE is to be a public corporation providing a public service, then it cannot assume to itself as of right or through the default of others, either the Legislature or the Executive, the task of defining the public interest which it was established to serve, because the decision to opt for public control of broadcasting was anterior to its establishment and was based on a <Col N="326" /> pre-existing concept of what constituted the public interest.  Legislation must therefore indicate in broad terms the nature if the public interest as conceived by both the Executive and the Legislature, and the intent of that legislation in the spirit and in the letter must be observed by the authority established thereunder.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I believe there is nothing either draconian or oppressive in the reserved powers which the Executive retains to itself for use in specified circumstances.  Indeed, it would be an outrageous abandonment of its responsibilities if the Executive were to establish a public corporation, provide it with public finance and then permit it to operate without social supervision or accountability.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that many who criticise the operational freedoms given to other public corporations as being too liberal criticise the provisions of this Bill as being too restrictive.  It is ironic but not surprising, because uniquely different standards are applied to RTE than are applied to other State corporations. They deal in such mundane things as sugar, electricity, transport or fertilisers, whereas RTE deal in information, education, ideas and entertainment. Society rightly regards these as being central to its own vitality, its own continuity, its own sense of development, and I believe they are related to these things in a unique way.  Therefore it requires a system of control for RTE which is significantly different from that which applies to the other State corporations.</P>
    <P>There is a consensus, and this has been evident so far in the debate, which favours non-commercial broadcasting and the vesting of managerial responsibility in a body outside the civil service, a body created specifically to discharge a range of duties defined by the Oireachtas.  But while the consensus extends to a broad understanding of those duties it also includes a determination to ensure that the Broadcasting Authority operate within the very broad latitude given to them, in other words, the Legislature does not simply off-load responsibility to the RTE Authority and then step back and take no further interest in their operations until such time as the <Col N="327" /> members of the authority must be appointed at defined intervals.  The Legislature empowers the Executive in particular to retain final control for certain specified purposes of national importance.</P>
    <P>The consensus also is that RTE should have an independence which is seen to be real and objective, especially in relation to political parties and government, but which also is qualified by limits which are contained within the consensus. When the authority transgress those limits their mandate, to act in the public interest should be terminated. It is this power which is reserved in section 2 of the Bill and which replaces the very sparsely-worded section 6 of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>While this new section has been welcomed to some extent, it has been claimed by others that its new provisions are no more than window-dressing, that they are a cosmetic presentation of what is an arbitrary power.  This is a mistaken viewpoint. The section contains two new requirements which make it qualitatively different from section 6 of the 1960 Act.  First, the removal of a member from the RTE Authority must be now for stated reasons.  Secondly, both Houses of the Oireachtas must pass resolutions calling for the member's removal.  Both of these requirements virtually ensure that in day-to-day affairs, the RTE Authority can operate in full independence, secure from political pressure and secure also from arbitrary dismissal, because no government of the type to which we have been accustomed throughout the period of the existence of the State will dismiss any member of the authority for trivial, personal, partisan or party political reasons, if they have to state publicly the reasons for the dismissal and, then, submit them to Parliament for scrutiny.  It would be only for reasons of high politics related to transgressions of the national consensus that a publicly conducted dismissal could occur.  The present Act provides the opportunity of a loophole for an unscrupulous Government if they require one in so far as members of the Authority can <Col N="328" /> be removed without public or parliamentary examination.</P>
    <P>In a book published in 1962 by the Fabian Society and entitled <i>The Lessons of Public Enterprise</i>, Mr. Roy Jenkins wrote a foreword from which I quote:</P>
    <P>In practice the conception of authority openly conducted and publicly accountable has been stood on its head.  Because the relationship between Minister and board chairman is loosely defined, it is informal in character.  Because it is informal it is often secret. Because it is secret it is unaccountable. The facts emerge, if ever, only when the immediate crisis is over and public judgement, often unjustly hostile to the industry concerned, have been informed.</P>
    <P>He referred in that foreword to what he called &ldquo;backstairs pressure by Ministers on board chairman.&rdquo;  That danger is as prevalent today as when it was written of in 1962.  This section consciously removes ministerial temptation to engage in backstairs pressuring for party advantage or for petty reasons.  It forces the Minister and/or the Cabinet to conduct their relationship with RTE in an open, explicit conversation.  The Minister is to be complimented for his Pauline fortitude in resisting temptation and for placing his faith in the good works of both RTE and the Government for the future.  This new section not only strengthens and enhances the independence of the authority but enhances also the role of Parliament by engaging it in a very decisive way when determination must be reached as to whether there has been a failure by RTE to discharge their public trust.</P>
    <P>It is unlikely that even so well-drilled a party as the Opposition would vote, if in Government again, to confirm a capricious dismissal of a member of the authority for reasons which were related transparently to circumstances other than those expressed by the Government as constituting grounds for dismissal.</P>
    <P>The strength of this section rests in a faith in the inherent decency and integrity of the ordinary legislator <Col N="329" /> who, as those of us who are involved in party politics know, can impose real limits on Government, sometimes more effectively at the party meeting than in the Houses of the Oireachtas; but no Government has <i>carte blanche</i> from the back benchers in the exercise of power.  Any Government would think twice before using that power with malice or deceit.  A Government which did not think twice would not deserve the opportunity to do so, in any case. For these reasons the charge of window-dressing in relation to the two new provisions of this section is either born of a misunderstanding of the nature of the political process or of a partisan opposition which should not be counted.</P>
    <P>This section forces us to think on the nature of the public corporation which was established by the Principal Act and which is continued by this piece of legislation.  The power vested in the Government to remove a member of the authority is reserved precisely because there is no necessary equation between the interest of the broadcasting authority and the public interest.  Most, if not all of the time, that is the situation in practice but there could be deviations from what the Government conceive to be the public interest and what the authority conceive it to be.  If such deviations occur the Government must have the authority to resolve these differences conclusively.</P>
    <P>I am not pretending that this is an ideal institutional model.  We must not be fooled by a liberal rhetoric which alleges that an ideal exists somewhere if only it could be replicated by the Government and by this Legislature, providing it had the wisdom and the courage to do so.  The public interest is not necessarily protected by independent commercial broadcasting institutions or by State-controlled institutions or by public corporations such as RTE or by any permutation of all these.  I am not claiming that there is any necessary coincidence between the State's conception of the public interest and the public interest in the broadest sense.  But I am alleging that a public corporation, freed and insulated from the political pressures of a transient administration, represent the best <Col N="330" /> balance, in the context of existing democratic structures in this State, between the public interest as seen by the Government, by the broadcasting authority and by the various elements which constitute our society.  This is not a static balance but it is a dynamic one capable of adaptation to new social forces.  It is a flexible arrangement which allows for genuine independence by the broadcasting authority in a changing social context.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (1) of the Bill amends and extends the mandate of the authority to be both impartial and objective in the presentation of news and current affairs.  The subsection has generally been welcomed for its more explicit presentation of these journalistic criteria.  In general it must be stated, in all fairness, that the highest standards of objectivity and impartiality have been maintained by RTE television and radio news presentations and current affairs programmes since the establishment of the original authority. RTE has developed its own distinctive and discernable ethos with high internally imposed criteria for handling news and current affairs.</P>
    <P>I believe this to be greatly to the credit of the authority and the journalists, given the fact that in dealing with television as a medium and the explosion in news features and current affairs programmes on radio, they were dealing with a virtually new situation with few domestic precedents to guide them. The style, tone and approach were created <i>de novo</i> as it were and they are to be commended on a contribution of permanent worth to the philosophy and practice of broadcasting in this country.</P>
    <P>A journalist working for RTE confronts two important differences from a colleague employed in a newspaper. Firstly, the newspaper is privately owned&mdash;and in this country this is literally true of the four national dailies&mdash;whereas RTE is a public corporation.  Newspapers have traditionally been propagandistic, each having a fairly distinct position in the spectrum of public opinion.  An <i>Irish Press</i> editorial flattering the <Col N="331" /> National Coalition Government or critical of the Fianna Fáil party is as rare as a day of sunshine in an Irish summer.  RTE is instructed to fix itself firmly in the middle of the spectrum and not only to refrain from having a corporate viewpoint on current affairs but also to ensure that individual journalists do not give to news or current affairs programmes a slanted version of what is happening.</P>
    <P>This difference of approach is deeper and more significant than generally realised or, indeed it seems to me, appreciated by the journalists themselves.  It results in the news being presented by a reader who is not himself a journalist and who therefore has no personal involvement in what is written or selected for verbal and for visual presentation. Much of the news is therefore anonymous in its origin and there is sufficient of this type of material in the normal newscast to colour the rest of the material in the same impartial hue even though there is recourse to identifiable correspondents dealing with specialised topics.</P>
    <P>There is another consequence flowing from this approach and it is the effect of editorial choice on the type of stories included in news bulletins and selected for treatment in feature programmes.  Raymond Williams in his book entitled <i>Television</i>, published last year, refers to a study in communications carried out in 1966 in Britain which compared lead stories in newspapers. This comparison &ldquo;showed marked variations of priorities in different kinds of paper.  A further comparison with broadcast bulletins showed that broadcasting priorities were, on the whole, those of the minority press.&rdquo;  He says: &ldquo;The world view indicated by the selection and relative priority of news items is very similar as between broadcast bulletins and the minority newspapers which are written by and for the relatively highly educated.&rdquo;  In other words, the neutralisation of an explicit corporate or personal viewpoint results in a certain type of partiality which is generally accepted as being impartial. I think it important for us to recognise <Col N="332" /> and confront this reality rather than to pretend that impartiality and objectivity are ontologically achievable. They are useful abstractions which can be given an acceptable version of reality along the lines indicated earlier.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan, in his striking and comprehensive contribution, remarked that every good journalist achieves objectivity by the seat of his pants.  This is precisely the point.  It is not possible in communications to be free of value judgements but it is possible to achieve the irreducible minimum.  Objectivity is perhaps one of that category of phenomena which is best defined in the negative&mdash;you know what it is when it is not there. The effects of applying this standard to news bulletin preparation and presentation are to push the editorial emphasis towards the heavy end of the news spectrum.  Williams concludes: &ldquo;the results of this are complex.  It can be said that the broadcast bulletins impose certain priorities and that amongst these are characteristic definitions of high politics, with a centralising emphasis on the acts and words of political leaders.  Yet, though this is in general true, the national television news than all but a very few newspapers. Moreover, they provide it to a very wide public, in ways that would not happen if we had only a &lsquo;minority&rsquo; and a &lsquo;popular&rsquo; press.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I believe this observation to be generally true of the Irish situation and I have dealt with the analysis at some length because I wished to establish that when we talk of impartiality and objectivity we are talking of a certain type of impartiality and objectivity which we find acceptable and which RTE journalists by and large find congenial.</P>
    <P>But we are not talking of something which exists in the real world of journalism as it does in the world of philosophic speculation and this distinction is important, particularly for other subsections of section 3. Therefore I hope we can agree that this analytical approach leads us to conclude that although the journalist <Col N="333" /> in a newspaper operates within certain parameters and the journalist in RTE within others, the broadcaster's parameters are not necessarily more restrictive or limiting but are simply different because the technology of the medium is different and the social role of the medium is different from that of the newspapers.  The second difference for the journalist in broadcasting as compared with the journalist in the more traditional medium of print lies in the mode of presentation. Not only is the medium completely different&mdash;words and images as contrasted with print&mdash;but the sequence of presentation is distinct from that of a newspaper.</P>
    <P>The modern newspaper is a mosaic of news items simultaneously presented admittedly with explicit editorial choice both as regards to inclusion, position and treatment.  On the other hand, a news broadcast is linear, each item fitting into a sequence of news items which has been predetermined by the news staff.  This order is itself an even clearer expression of editorial choice.  Indeed as Williams comments &ldquo;The broadcast news bulletin tends to retain more apparent editorial control of priority and attention&rdquo; than a newspaper. The linear nature of the news broadcast therefore puts great strain on the radio and television newsroom because the elements of choice are obvious immediately to listeners and viewers.</P>
    <P>But the position is inescapable because the linear nature of broadcasts in inherent in the technology of the medium and if it is inescapable then the journalistic discipline must be quite distinct from that of newspapers and must be recognised as such both by the public and by the journalists. Otherwise problems can develop which are regarded as ethical but which happen in fact to be technical and this confusion can lead to unnecessary tension between the journalists conception of his job and the reality of his job.</P>
    <P>The mode of presentation in television is also different from both radio and newspapers because of the combination effect between words and pictures.  It is not true that the <Col N="334" /> actuality, and in some cases the immediacy, of news as seen through a camera is incapable of distortion. The very choice of the area in shot is distortion.  The position of the camera is distortion.  We know, as Williams says, that whether in a riot it is looking over the heads of the police or over the heads of the rioters is important to our perception of what is being reported.  But, allowing for all that, there is always a core of objectivity in the camera that is unmatched by any other medium. When you see a person on screen you see the whole person, the physical appearance and the voice fusing into the totality of what we recognise as another living person communicating with us and very different from the effect of the disembodied voice on radio or the reported speech in cold print.  There is the minimum of mediation in good television news reporting and for that reason it has a place in news technology which is <i>sui generis.</i></P>
    <P>If we might take one concrete example.  Anyone who saw Guy O'Brien's news report of the Derry civil rights march of October, 1968, is not likely to forget it.  The camera was with the marchers and what it shot, once the RUC attacked, was a much a matter of chance as of deliberate decision.  But allowing for all that, it gave an insight into the Orange State so penetrating that it instantaneously altered one's attitude towards and one's understanding of the Orange State.  I do not believe that there has ever been a more important single piece of news reporting on RTE than that filmed report from Derry.  By analogy we know of the impact which TV reporting had on American attitudes towards their own involvement in the Vietnam War.</P>
    <P>Tom Hardiman, the immediate past Director General of RTE, said in an <i>Irish Times</i> interview on 29th March: &ldquo;Television is a medium more of impact than of influence.&rdquo;  The point I am making here is that impact can be influential and that influence can be enduring and profound as in the two examples I have quoted.  Thus the way in which the impact as mediated is of itself profoundly important and hence <Col N="335" /> the necessity to stress in section 3 (1) (a) the requirement to strive after objectivity and impartiality.  I hope by now I have established that in operational terms this provision is far more important than would be suggested by a casual perusal of the Bill and we would be foolish to skip the implications of this subsection.  There are two other points I want to make in relation to this subsection.  In 3 (1) (b) current affairs, broadcasts on matters of public controversy have to be fair to all the interests concerned and must, again, be objective and impartial.  Now &ldquo;fair to all interests concerned&rdquo; can be interpreted as meaning not only a balanced presentation of the facts relating to each interest but also the presence on a programme of a representative of each interest involved in the controversy.  If this is interpreted rigidly then it gives to the various interests involved the right of individual veto over any programme through the simple expedient of refusing to go on air.</P>
    <P>The brodcasters response to this tactic has been to employ the &ldquo;empty chair&rdquo; device which puts the responsibility for any resulting imbalance on those who have failed to accept an invitation to appear.  I believe it is a practice which should be defended as a legitimate interpretation of 3 (1) (b) and I should be glad to hear the Minister's comments when replying.</P>
    <P>The other point is a comment on the new provision that balance need not be achieved within one single programme but within two or more broadcasts provided every interval is reasonable. I believe this to be a welcome legislative recognition for established journalistic practice and I do not believe we should strain this new code by debating too closely what is meant by an interval which is &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Clearly, some matters are so immediate through the nature of the controversy that one or two days would constitute a reasonable interval, particularly when handled through the format of studio discussions.  Other issues could be debated on a weekly or even a monthly basis, say using film reports and still achieve balance. <Col N="336" /> I believe the broad principle should be simply that material should be broadcast at a time when it is still relevant to the determination of public attitudes&mdash;for example, there is no point in giving one side of a controversy when the issue is dead.</P>
    <P>This legislative addendum is important and will, I believe, be of considerable value to serious broadcasters in the current affairs area.  It will enable them not only to concentrate on different sides of a controversy in successive programmes rather than trying to push everybody into one programme and very often securing nothing other than a brawl, but will also enable them to mount long investigative series which have to be viewed as an intergrated whole rather than as a sequence of discreet programmes. If the subject matter of a series were very sensitive, but nonetheless an on-going controversy such as the contraceptive issue, then this new provision would be vital in defending individual programmes within the series on the grounds that, while individually they would of necessity be biassed, their overall achievement would be one of balance. We would be foolish, however, to deny that a problem will still exist. People tend to react to television on the spot, which was Tom Hardiman's point.  This provision is a welcome aid to the broadcaster who says that an issue needs to be looked at calmly over a period rather than being disposed of in a single programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly joined together in his own speech the provisions of 3 (1A) and section 16, and I intend to follow that example.  The prohibition on broadcasting anything likely to promote or incite crime or to lead to disorder has met with a mixed reception. There is widespread agreement on the necessity to prohibit broadcasts which could lead to crime but some criticism of the provision in respect of disorder.</P>
    <P>The circular of 18th March addressed to Senators by the National Union of Journalists exemplifies this response in the following comment:</P>
    <P>Accepting that no reasonable objection can be lodged against the <Col N="337" /> law prohibiting the broadcasting of matter likely to promote or incite crime, it is our view that the extension of the prohibition to matter, which in the Minister's opinion, would be (or may reasonably be regarded as being) likely &ldquo;to lead to disorder&rdquo; goes far too wide.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech recognised three different types of reaction to his replacement of section 31 (i) of the Principal Act and by the combination of 3 (1A) and section 16 of this Bill.  At column 771 of the Official Report on 12th March he described the reactions like this:</P>
    <P>Those whose main objection to the old section 31 was its blanket character, and therefore its susceptibility to arbitrary abuse, will regard the present amending legislation as constituting at least a significant improvement.  Those, however, who reject any power of Government censorship applied to the State broadcasting system&mdash;even reserve powers to be exercised in the interests of the security of the people&mdash;those who take that position will certainly regard the legislation which is designed to replace section 31 as constituting little or no improvement on that section. And there is plenty of room in between&mdash;for example the view that while the State should have some authority to intervene&mdash;that is to say to censor, let us not be afraid of the word, whether or not we are afraid of the thing&mdash;yet the State's powers should be more strictly limited than they are in the draft legislation.</P>
    <P>It is to the last category that I would consign the NUJ and I think their analysis of the word &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; is worthy of serious consideration, although I do not agree with their conclusion.  The prime difficulty in relation to &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; is, they say, its definition:</P>
    <P>It could embrace many now almost conventional degrees of protest and political action including strikes, sit-ins, farmers' blockades, and even the housewives temporary blocking of a road to focus attention <Col N="338" /> on the need for pedestrian crossings.  To report on any of these could be held to invite imitation.  It may well be that the intention of those who framed the Bill is directed at much more serious matters but we feel these are adequately covered by the reference to &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; should be deleted from the Bill.</P>
    <P>That I believe is an unfortunate <i>non sequitur.</i>  I believe the disquiet expressed by the NUJ is legitimate, but I believe also that it can be dispelled by a more concentrated form of wording which I believe the Minister himself has already given us, not once but many times in his own speech.  It is evident, I presume, from my earlier remarks, that I consider it an inescapable obligation on the State to reserve certain powers to itself in the control of broadcasting and I hold that these should extend not just to matters likely to promote or incite crime but also to matters which could endanger the security of the State and I do not believe this latter consideration can be covered by the prohibition of matters relating to crime as the NUJ suggests&mdash;and I say this while accepting their criticism of the word &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us the origins of this form of wording; it appears in British legislation where it has caused no trouble as of yet.  It was actually suggested for inclusion in the Principal Act by a Senator in the original debate in 1959 but the Government of the day preferred to reserve to themselves the sweeping powers of section 31 (1):</P>
    <P>The Minister may direct the Authority in writing to refrain from broadcasting any particular matter or matter of any particular class, and the Authority shall comply with the direction.</P>
    <P>And the operative word of the Fianna Fáil Act is &ldquo;any&rdquo; which is used twice with a rather frightening double effect.</P>
    <P>The Minister, at column 794 of the Official Report on 12th March described that power &ldquo;&mdash;a power which is without limitation of any <Col N="339" /> kind whatever.&rdquo;  He then explained the objective of his substitute sections, saying:</P>
    <P>I obviously wanted to get rid of this absolute power, so obviously capable of manifold abuse, but I wished the power substituted for it to remain wide in the area where its exercise is justificable.  The area is that of security.</P>
    <P>If the area is that of security&mdash;and I accept that it is and does not encompass those other areas mentioned by Senator Horgan and the NUJ&mdash; then I believe it should be expressly stated as such in the Bill.  I have previously brought to the private attention of the Minister the wisdom of a best selling Australian novelist who was a friend of mine and an expert on ducks.  She used say: &ldquo;If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck &mdash;and say so.&rdquo;  This is a perfect example of the duck test.  We are in fact talking about national security when referring to the word &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; in this subsection and not about strikes, sit-ins, blockades or housewives sitting on the roadway. We are talking about the IRA and other subversive organisations who do not accept the legitimacy of this State, who do not obey its laws and who are a danger to its continued existence and to the lives and livelihoods of its citizens.  That is what we are talking about and that is how it should be put in the Bill.  If that is done there will be only two types of reaction to the principle contained in the subsection&mdash;the reaction of those who believe that the property of the Irish people should be denied directly or indirectly to subversives and those who do not.</P>
    <P>The Minister is himself the best advocate of the amendment I propose. All the references I am about to quote are taken from his Second Reading speech of 12th March.  At column 765 of the Official Report he first explained the new provisions as follows:</P>
    <P>Because the Government responsible to Parliament must retain the <Col N="340" /> final say in the particularly difficult and sensitive area of the security of the State, I propose to retain, while modifying, the power to issue directives.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the sensitive area of the security of the State.</P>
    <P>At column 784 he said:</P>
    <P>A line which we might legitimately seek to draw&mdash;though it is very hard in practice&mdash;is that which would set apart, as belonging to the sphere of action amenable to law, all forms of play on the emotions, through words or images, in ways likely to arouse fear and hatred, to cause acute distress, or to endanger the lives of citizens and the security of the State responsible for those lives.</P>
    <P>&mdash;endanger the security of the State.</P>
    <P>At column 785 he said:</P>
    <P>The Government of the State has a particular responsibility in relation to broadcasting, and specifically the responsibility to ensure that broadcasting is not used to endanger either the security of the State which licensed it, or the lives of the citizens who pay for it.</P>
    <P>&mdash;endanger the security of the State.</P>
    <P>At column 787 he referred to:</P>
    <P>...the reserve powers retained by the Government and Parliament as relating to security&mdash;and security only.</P>
    <P>&mdash;security only.</P>
    <P>At column 794 he used the following words which I have previously quoted in respect of the area where power of control is justifiable:</P>
    <P>The area is that of security.</P>
    <P>And finally, at column 795 he concluded his reference:</P>
    <P>...thus the Government shall retain an adequate reserve of power, for security reasons, as a principle which the Government is determined to safeguard and, therefore, any amendments seriously weakening that would be resisted.</P>
    <P>I do not propose that the reserve power &ldquo;for security reason&rdquo; should <Col N="341" /> be weakened, but I do propose it should be more accurately specified. If this is conceded I am convinced the amendment will satisfy all those who genuinely disapprove the use of RTE for the propagation of material dangerous to the security of the State but who at the same time are unhappy about the possibilities of abuse in the present formulation of section 3 (1A). Of course this amendment will not satisfy those who object to any form of State censorship, or internally imposed RTE censorship for that matter. And it will not satisfy those who would reject the broadcasting of material which might encourage rape, contraception, promiscuity, homosexuality, prostitution or abortion but would nonetheless permit the broadcasting of material which might encourage knee-capping, car-bombing, political robberies and sectarian killings, historically privileged crime, as the Minister called it.</P>
    <P>So I am not claiming that this amendment will silence all critics of this section, but I contend it will limit them in the main to those who have either an overt or covert regard for the perpetrators of political violence on this island and it will prevent such people from masquerading in the public debate as the champions of free speech when they are the conscious or unconscious champions of the gunman, bomber or assassin.  I suggest these are very important considerations indeed and I trust the Minister and the Government will seriously evaluate them between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the provisions of section 16 which constitute, given the acceptance of the State's right to intervence, an enormous advance on the existing Act by requiring the Minister to lay before the Oireachtas any order directing the authority to refrain from broadcasting particular matter and by empowering either House of the Oireachtas to annul the order.  At the moment the Minister could, under Fianna Fáil Act, direct the authority to refrain from broadcasting any matter without stating a reason, and <Col N="342" /> could dismiss the entire authority, again without stating a reason, and do both without reference to either House of the Oireachtas.  Section 16 is thus a companion piece of section 2 by requiring the Minister to go before the Oireachtas and to open his directives to public scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I believe this section meets the requirements set down by the Broadcasting Review Committee and the criteria laid down by Tom Hardiman in his interview of 29th March in <i>The Irish Times</i>, where he said:</P>
    <P>In many democratic societies regulation is achieved by the provision of publicly owned media, operating in the public interest but the State should and must retain the possibilities of control; that is as it should be in a democratic society.  Parliament on behalf of the people must say what the mandate of the publicly owned media shall be and set out the means by which the possibility of direct intervention by the state is to be achieved.  Whenever a statutory intervention is made it is important that it be specific and say clearly what is precisely involved, and I think it important that such a strategy be itself open to public inspection.</P>
    <P>Section 16 meets these criteria, that intervention be specific and that it should state what is involved and, finally, that it be open to public scrutiny.  It is interesting to hear what he says in respect of the effect of the direction on RTE of October, 1971, under section 31.  He said:</P>
    <P>It is a fact that the requirements of this direction have on occasion taken precedence over normal journalistic criteria.  But I am satisfied that in news reportage no important subject has been left uncovered and that the news has not stepped back from what has been happening.</P>
    <P>Oliver Maloney, the new RTE Director General, in a radio interview last Sunday gave me the impression that he agreed explicitly with the last part of Tom Hardiman's observations. I advisedly say &ldquo;impression&rdquo; because <Col N="343" /> I do not have a transcript of the interview but I do recall him also saying that he felt journalists had made more of these restrictions than was warranted by the facts.</P>
    <P>In considering these two related parts of the Bill we must also give consideration, not just to the impact of certain broadcasts on our democratic institutions but additionally to their impact within Northern Ireland as the Minister said at column 794 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>Where there exists among the majority a widespread impression that this State is in some kind of collusion with the IRA.</P>
    <P>If there were to be no restrictions on RTE then presumably we could get the sort of interview on radio or television, such as Cathal Goulding gave to <i>The Irish Times</i> on the 8th March, which in the state broadcasting system would appear to confer quasi legitimacy on the IRA, while confirming the worst fears of the Northern majority that this collusion existed between this State and the IRA, an impression which the Minister stated is directly dangerous to life, both in Northern Ireland and here.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote at some length from the interview in order to prove this point.  Goulding, who is styled as the Chief of Staff of the Official IRA, was asked to explain the attack on John Taylor, the murder of Senator Barnhill and the Aldershot bombing. He replied&mdash;and just imagine what effect this would have, North and South, if it were done live on &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Well, John Taylor was Minister for Home Affairs at the time of the attack on him and was using repressive legislation and was contemplating even more repressive legislation. He was also vindictive and tough in his handling of what was his brief. I suppose you could say that, well, Brian Faulkner should have been the target since he was in charge but then, like everything else, the availability of the target matters too.</P>
    <P>Barnhill's was a mistake, if you could call it that.  He was supposed to <Col N="344" /> be away at the time and the Republican movement was burning houses owned by the wealthy and middle class Unionists then as retaliation for the wrecking of working class homes in the North by the British Army.  Barnhill was part of the establishment.</P>
    <P>Now Aldershot was a military target and the attack was in retaliation for the murders by the British Parachute Regiment on Bloody Sunday.  It went very wrong.  I felt crushed after it, that only working class women had been killed by the explosion and that was really all that happened.  It was a catastrophe but, if you compare it with the Provos campaign, a calculated campaign against civilian targets, Aldershot was just one attack that went wrong.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And his global exculpation of guilt: &ldquo;We make mistakes.  We will maybe make more mistakes, but you won't find us making the same mistake twice.&rdquo; Mistakes?&mdash;an attempted assassination, a murder and a house burning and the slaughter of innocent cleaning women.  &ldquo;We will maybe make more of these mistakes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it irrefutable that these remarks, if made on RTE, would have an electric effect on the audience, North and South, and if made on television would have a catastrophic effect.  The reminiscences of a guerilla leader may be good television provided the guerilla leader has retired or is operating in another country so that interest in either case is no more than curiosity.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - National Museum Board of Visitors' Report.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity of a debate on the adjournment in order to highlight the fact that the reports of the Board of Visitors of the National Museum, although written and presented to the Minister for the past four years, have not been published and have not been laid before the Oireachtas.  I must refer to a motion in the names of Senator Horgan and myself which <Col N="345" /> now following the passage of time, is at the top of the list of motions on the Order Paper.  It reads:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the Report of the Board of Visitors of the National Museum of Science and Art for the years 1970-71 and 1971-72.</P>
      <P>In our innocence we thought that by tabling that motion we might encourage publication of the reports and, consequently, have the opportunity of discussing them in this House.  That motion has been on the Order Paper for several years and that is why it is now at the top of the list. The last report to be published was that for 1969-70.  This was dated 25th August, 1970, and was laid before both Houses during 1971.</P>
      <P>Prior to that the record was rather erratic.  The reports for 1965-66, 1967-68 and 1968-69 were all published during 1970.  It is my information, and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to confirm this, that the reports of the visitors have been presented to the Department&mdash;a combined report for 1970 to 1972, a report for 1973 and one for 1974 but that these have not been published despite the very clear obligation and a fiduciary obligation in trust placed on the Department to have the reports published and laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I refer to an agreement of March 1st, 1881, between the Department of Science and Art&mdash;now the Department of Education&mdash;the Commissioners of Public Works and the Royal Dublin Society.  In article 17 of this agreement it is stated that the duties of the board of visitors shall be to make annual reports to the Department on the condition, management and requirements of the museum and to advise on points affecting its administration and that copies of such reports should be laid before Parliament by the Department. This matter is all the more serious because the Government undertook a fiduciary position at the time to take care of and control of our National Museum and of the very valuable collections which form part of our heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is all the more <Col N="346" /> scandalous because of the terms of the foreword to the last published report of the board of visitors.  This is one of the saddest reports to be laid before this House as is reflected in the language it uses.  This was a report for 1969-70 and I quote:</P>
    <P>Nearly half a century ago, the Irish government took over control of the National Museum and responsibility for it.  At that time, in the aftermath of a world war and the Irish War of Independence, the Museum's staff was few in numbers and its facilities were gravely deficient. Today, after virtual neglect in the intervening years, the Museum's divisions, with one exception, are forced to function in even more straitened circumstances.  It reflects poorly on us as a nation that our National Collections, which are a priceless cultural asset, fared far better at the hands of the former alien governments, under whose influence they were, in fact, initially assembled, than they have under our own governments.</P>
    <P>The blame for the present situation must rest with successive governments since 1922 and their administrative departments.  The Board of Visitors is merely an advisory body and it has no powers to improve matters.  Time and again over the years it has called attention to defects and inadequacies in the provision made for the Museum and to difficulties with which the staff has had to contend.  It has noted and deplored the unsafe condition in which major parts of the Collections have been kept.  Yet there is little evidence that anything more than scant attention was ever paid to the Board's views as expressed in its Annual Reports and in representations made to various Ministers for Education.</P>
    <P>That is a very sad indictment of what appears to be continuous Government indifference, lack of concern and lack of attention to this very central part of our national heritage, what we should hope to pass on to our children.</P>
    <P>This House has played a valuable role in the past when the annual reports have been available to us.  We <Col N="347" /> have had useful and constructive debates on the subject and I am sure these have been encouraging to the board of visitors as well as to researchers and the staff of the museum who have to work under these appalling conditions.  We are deprived now of even that role, of that possibility of public debate on the condition of the museum, because the reports which have been written and submitted have not been published.</P>
    <P>Apart from these annual reports there is another report which I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have published because it contains matters of public interest.  This is the report compiled by the National Museum Branch of the Institute of Professional Civil Servants in December, 1969, on conditions in the National Museum.  Copies of this report were deposited in the Royal Irish Academy and in the RDS. However it was not generally published and circulated.  Again, this report is a clear indictment of the present position and it summarises the acute shortages and lack of resources in all the areas of the museum.  I am aware that on the adjournment I cannot go into the substance of the problem under which the museum must labour, but I should like to refer briefly to some of the points in this 1969 report which make clear the very critical situation in this institution. In relation, first, to acquisition, the report states that:</P>
    <P>Due to shortage of staff and lack of adequate finance the rate of acquisition of new material to the collections is far lower than it should be.  No new material is being acquired for some collections.  In the case of other collections valuable and essential material is being lost forever to the National Museum and the nation.</P>
    <P>In relation to conservation, the report says:</P>
    <P>Due to shortage of staff and the conditions under which much of the material is accommodated, proper inspection of the reserve collections, <Col N="348" /> with the view to necessary conservation, is impossible.  The technical staff and the laboratory facilities are inadequate to deal with the new material being acquired, not to mention the existing collections.</P>
    <P>There is criticism of the lack of accommodation for reserve collections and for exhibition space.  There is criticism, too, of the almost total absence of research resources.  In this connection I quote from the report:</P>
    <P>Research work of any sort is practically impossible in official time, due to the shortage of staff. Individual Professional Officers undertake such work in their private time.  Research work should include the preparation of catalogues, monographs, guides to the collections and the provision of material for labelling the exhibitions.</P>
    <P>There is criticism of the lack of any proper library facilities, of the very limited photographic facilities and the increasing pressure on the existing photographic facilities; of the lack of proper laboratory facilities and of accommodation for students and members of the public.  The report goes on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to end with a very short summary of the services the museum wants to provide, is unable to provide and about which we are unable to comment because we do not have these reports published. This is essential if we are to carry out our responsibilities in relation to the public.  The report states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Museum has a duty to disseminate knowledge to the general public, both Irish and foreign, by means of exhibitions, printed guides to the collections and public lectures.  There is a printed guide for only one exhibition.  Public lectures are not given.  Some of the exhibitions are so overcrowded or hopelessly out of date as to be practically <Col N="349" /> useless from the point of view of conveying information to the public.</P>
    <P>I may be taken up by the Parliamentary Secretary on quoting from this unpublished 1969 report.  It would have been helpful if that report had been published.  Other than that, I should like to quote briefly from a more recent though not necessarily more authoritative source&mdash;the editorial columns of <i>The Irish Times</i>, 7th November, 1974:</P>
    <P>Some alarming and sad facts have emerged from recent reports on the condition of the National Museum, where over the last 30 years a shortage of money, staff and space have taken their toll.</P>
    <P>Government subvention towards running the Museum in the last year was only £153,000 more than it was in 1944, despite increases in the cost of everything since then.  The National Geology Collection is not only not exhibited, but it is decaying in sub-standard storage in the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham, and a geologist is not to be appointed to look after the collection.  And now we learn that a number of displays in the Museum itself, as well as those in storage, are deteriorating. Most disturbing, perhaps, is the fact that the Board of Visitors&mdash; the Museum's governing body&mdash;is being, and has been, consistently ignored when they have made recommendations and given their advice.</P>
    <P>We cannot know in detail the recent advice of the Board of Visitors except as it is contained in the published reports.  I note in the 1965-66 report what was a very commendable recommendation at that time and is still a very valid one that I hope can be taken up.  In the first page of that report it is stated:</P>
    <P>In fact, we would stress&mdash;as a general principle&mdash;the need for an authoritative group of specialists to act as a liaison between any academic institution and the administrative body to which it is responsible, since basic differences in outlook and approach may frequently be involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" /> There is still a very strong case for that proposal.  Apart from criticisms of the resources, staffing, accommodation and general conditions in the museum, we find that the museum &ldquo;is exercising a very important role in relation to our physical heritage&rdquo;. It is now playing a major role in relation to archaeological digs.  In relation to the dig at the Wood Quay-Wine-tavern Street site Dr. Nuala Burke had a letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 21st November, 1974.  This has not got the attention it deserves.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Some facts concerning the excavations at Winetavern Street-Wood Quay will enable the public to judge whether or not there is reason for &ldquo;grave disquiet&rdquo; expressed by An Taisce in August and echoed since then by academics, journalists, concerned members of the public and by volunteers whose services have been refused by the National Museum of Ireland.</P>

She is a renowned expert on the archaeology of the city of Dublin and has championed the need for proper excavation of this site and a proper archaeological survey.  She points out in this letter that the adviser to Dublin Corporation has been exclusively the director of the National Museum and his staff and that the director is not himself an expert archaeologist but a folklorist who has never carried out an excavation in an urban area.</P>

      <P>Rather than criticise the director of the National Museum, Dr. A.T. Lucas, I should like to quote directly from an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 30th January, 1974, in a reference to the preservation of the site at Winetavern Street-Wood Quay.  It is headed: &ldquo;Little left to preserve on site of Viking settlement&mdash;Museum reports to city manager.&rdquo; It states:</P>
      <P>While the Government has stopped work on the £5 million Dublin Civic Offices site at Wood Quay, the Director of the National Museum of Ireland, Dr. A.T. Lucas, says that the structures which have been found on the site do not lend themselves to preservation.</P>
      <P>In a letter to the City Manager, Mr. Matthew Macken, and circulated to Dublin City Commissioners, Dr. Lucas says: &ldquo;The great majority of the structures were of comparatively flimsy construction, the walls being, in great part, constructed of wattlework.  The preservation of this would present insuperable problems.  Such large timber as was used was confined to footbeams, doorposts and pathways and it would be meaningless to attempt the preservation of isolated bits and pieces of this nature.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Dr. Lucas's views were expressed in a reply to a letter written to the City Manager by Professor P.V. Glob, Director of the National Museum, Copenhagen, who had welcomed the Viking find in Dublin. &ldquo;This momentous find,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;has attracted attention all over Scandinavia and many archaeologists have visited these important excavations...&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am trying to establish that there has been a great deal of conflict of evidence and disquiet in relation to the Wood Quay site.  Forty-one senior academics signed a letter in November, 1974, again addressed to the national newspapers, calling for a supervisory body to be established in relation to the archeological dig.  In a press release of 7th April, 1975 An Taisce described what is happening on this site as &ldquo;institutionalised vandalism&rdquo;.  I quote briefly from this and will end with this:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is happening could be described as institutionalised vandalism. Nobody seems to want this outrage, yet it proceeds.  Spokesmen from Dublin Corporation have, from time to time, stated that the responsibility rests with the National Museum.  City Councillors have been reassured that anything the Museum requested would be done by the Corporation and that the Museum would be allowed the necessary time.  A letter from the Museum dated 10th March, was circulated to City Councillors saying &ldquo;We hope to finish our investigations of Area 1 of the Wood Quay <Col N="353" /> site by the end of this month.  We are completely satisfied that all significant data have been successfully retrieved and recorded to date and confidently expect to accomplish the same in remaining fraction of the site within the time agreed upon.&rdquo;  An Taisce feels sure that this was written in good faith and must be true in some very limited sense. It is difficult however to reconcile these statements with the fact that a large archeological team is still working on Area 1 on April 7th and still, obviously, has much work to do, or with the fact that broken sections of mediaeval structures are to be seen in the trench being prepared for the tanking wall.</P>
    <P>There is obvious conflict between what is happening physically at the moment and what is being stated by Dublin Corporation relying on the advice of the National Museum.  We in this House must be concerned about what might be regarded as minority issues. The museum is not a practical bread and butter issue.  But it is of very critical concern to us as a nation and it involves the heritage we must pass on to our children.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that annual reports are published forthwith and also that the 1969 report which I mentioned is published.  I would call upon him to establish an overall scrutiny body to supervise the excavation and reporting of archeological digs in future and I would draw his urgent attention to the disquiet at present.</P>

      <P>I made arrangements with the Stationery Office for the printing of the report of the Board of Visitors to the National Museum for the years 1970-72 and 1972-73.  Both reports have in fact now been printed and have been submitted to the Government.  Following their presentation to the Government and not beforehand, they will then be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I expect that the reports will thus be available to the Members of both Houses within a couple of weeks.  This is the normal <Col N="354" /> parliamentary procedure followed in the case of the laying of such reports before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The House will appreciate that there is some considerable delay necessarily incurred in the printing of these documents and this is a matter which is outside the control of my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Senator there is delay involved in the printing.  In the meantime I have been active in regard to the matters referred to.  In the first place I have arranged that the reports be issued under a more attractive cover.  The colouring and lay-out of the cover in each of the two reports in question is brighter, the quality of the paper better, and the general appearance more becoming a report of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the subject matter of the reports themselves, I have taken advantage of the intervening period to consider how best the matters referred to might be remedied.  As I said in the Dáil on 31st October, 1973&mdash;Volume 268 columns 1007 and 1008 of the Official Report&mdash;the major problems to be faced by the National Museum are lack of accommodation, lack of staff and the need to bring the museum's riches to the notice of a larger number of people.  Whilst one can do a certain amount about each of these problems independently of the others, in fact the lack of accommodation impedes progress with the other two to a substantial extent.  Accordingly, the main efforts of my Department towards solving the museum's problems are being concentrated on the question of the provision of additional accommodation.  Meetings to discuss this have been held as between officials of my Department, the director of the National Museum, officials of the Office of Public Works and officials of Dublin Corporation and I am hopeful that the outcome will be satisfactory.  Let me add also that similar discussions have taken place with the relevant interested parties with a view to obtaining an alternative site for the Folk Life Collection now housed at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham. These discussions too are continuing. The whole question however, <Col N="355" /> as the House will appreciate, is complex and inter-related, and admits of no instant solution.</P>
    <P>During this period also I have had numerous discussions with the director of the National Museum, and both he and I together with officials of my Department have met the board of visitors twice in the last two months and one further meeting is envisaged next month.  I think I am correct in saying that I have their understanding of the problems involved and their goodwill in the matter of various proposals, ranging over a wide field, that I have disclosed to them.</P>
    <P>Plans are well advanced for the installation of the museum photographic studio in part of the space formerly occupied by the botanical collections.  Another room in the section has been used to provide accommodation for the newly-appointed librarian and the artist staff have been accommodated in another section of the space.</P>
    <P>Regarding the five vacancies for assistant referred to in the reports, one has been filled, a competition has been held to fill another and competitions to fill the remaining three vacancies are being arranged.  Two supernumerary assistants are being recruited in place of the two assistant keepers for which there are vacancies on the staff.  The question of the appointment of a geologist to the staff of the National Museum has been under consideration.  I would hope to arrange, with the sanction of the Minister for the Public Service, to have an additional post created to which a geologist would be appointed. I am not convinced, however, that the creation of a separate Division of Geology as suggested in the reports is warranted.</P>
    <P>At the present time the museum is engaged in excavating the site of the proposed civic offices at Wood Quay, Dublin.  The director of the museum is satisfied at the progress of the work and at the facilities provided by the corporation, which also provided some funds for the purpose.  Finally, I would like to inform the House that I am currently reviewing the complex problem of the National Museum in its <Col N="356" /> entirety, having regard to the need for additional accommodation, additional staff and an expansion of the role of the museum into the provision of additional services to schools and the public generally.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Wood Quay excavation there is every reason to be confident in the opinion expressed by the director of the museum.  I would remind the Senator that the museum covers a number of divisions of which archaeology is only one.  Therefore, it is not necessarily the case that the director should be himself an archaeologist as all the sciences are involved in the museum.</P>
    <P>The director has available to him in relation to any decisions he may make on this matter a number of qualified geologists of whose identity I am sure the Senator is well aware and to whom she did not refer in castigating the opinions expressed on behalf of the museum by the director.  These opinions were, of course, expressed in consultation with these other men, including people who are in fact undertaking the excavation in question, who are members of the staff of the museum and who therefore have the best firsthand knowledge of what is happening on the site, the people carrying out the excavation. These are members of the staff of the museum who would be advising the director in relation to any pronouncements he should make in regard to the suggestions currently being made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator made many points of a general character which are worth looking into in relation to the general co-ordination of archaeological policy. I hope to have this matter examined in connection with the overall review <Col N="357" /> of museum policy which I am undertaking in conjunction with my more immediate task of trying to get additional accommodation for the museum.  In conclusion, I would stress that until we get additional accommodation for the museum it is very difficult to find the physical space for more staff or to develop the type of services which we all, including the Government, agree are desirable in a museum of this kind.</P>
