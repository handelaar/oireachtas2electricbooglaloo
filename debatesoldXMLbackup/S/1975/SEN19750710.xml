      <P>We have no objection to taking this Capital Gains Tax Bill today.  In view of the constitutional provision that we only have three weeks to deal with a Money Bill of this nature, it must be taken at the earliest possible moment, but I do think, nonetheless, that it is, to say the least of it, unsatisfactory that we are in the position of having to debate this Bill today when the actual copy of the Bill as finally agreed to by the other House only arrived in our pigeon holes in Leinster House this morning.  There were a number of changes made on the final Stages of the Bill last Tuesday. In view of this, one can only once again protest at the slipshod manner in which this Government are consistently conducting their legislative business.  It will mean that we must discuss a Bill that in certain respects is a new Bill and has only reached us a few minutes ago.  In particular, I would like to protest that it is quite unreasonable to expect us to discuss this extremely important and complicated Bill without an adequate memorandum.  The only explanatory memorandum we have is the one that was issued on 20th December last with the version of the Bill as initiated.  Since then somewhere around 30 or 40 amendments&mdash;it may well be more&mdash; have been agreed to in the course of discussions in the other House.  Some of these are of a fairly far-reaching nature and yet all we have is an explanatory memorandum which relates to the Bill as initiated.  This is not of such <Col N="226" /> great importance, though obviously it is material in respect of the Second Reading debate, but I would urge the Government that it is absolutely essential before the Committee Stage debate on this Bill that we should have an adequate memorandum, even if it is only a duplicated document, either in the form of an explanatory memorandum which incorporates all the amendments or else if it was preferred&mdash; I suppose it would be adequate, though not as good&mdash;some kind of document explaining the amendments that had been made along the line, in other words indicating in what way the Bill diverges from the up-to-date position, because I cannot see how we can adequately discuss a Bill of this nature without some such explanatory document.</P>

      <P>It has become a thing for Fianna Fáil to feel they are obliged to raise some kind of protest on the Order of Business.  Senator Yeats is well aware it was the intention of the Government to take this Bill as soon as possible.  Let us look at the position realistically.  Senator Yeats is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  He makes no secret of that.  I daresay he takes some pride in that.  He is a man who is in the confidence of the leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party and whose advice is sought by the Fianna Fáil Party.  He is clearly a man&mdash;and he has given evidence of this time and time again here&mdash;who is prepared to devote himself to research in dealing with legislation in this House. I have no doubt that he is on the mailing list, as everyone else is, as regards the Dáil Debates, and I have even less doubt that being on the mailing list through the good offices of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Senator Yeats gets his copy of the Dáil Debates; and I have yet less doubt again that Senator Yeats is a man who goes through the Dáil Debates line by line and he is very well aware and very much up to date, probably more.  So than most Members of this House, with the arguments which have been presented in the Dáil and with the changes which have been made in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact this Bill was discussed for 17 days in the Dáil and consumed a total of 98 Dáil hours, every one of which I have no doubt has been digested fully <Col N="227" /> by Senator Yeats, and while I do not want to create any crude images I imagine some of what has been digested will be emitted here in the course of this discussion.</P>
    <P>All of us appreciate the courtesy of Ministers and the work of their Departments when they produce explanatory memoranda.  That is purely for the assistance of Deputies and Senators, with clearly no obligation to do it, and I feel quite sure the Minister will be more than capable of explaining everything in the Bill.  If Senator Yeats or anyone else feels that his opening statement does not explain the position adequately, he will have an opportunity of raising any points he wishes and the Minister will be in the position to clarify any matters that require clarification when he is concluding the discussion.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is the first of the three new capital taxation measures to replace estate duties included in the Government's programme of capital taxation reform as set out in their statement of intent published in February, 1973, before the last general election and detailed in the White Paper on Capital Taxation published on 28th February, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with that programme the old system of estate, legacy and succession duties was abolished by the Finance Act, 1975, in respect of deaths occurring on or after 1st April, 1975. It now remains to give legislative effect to the provisions for replacing these duties, namely, to the Capital Gains Tax Bill, now before the House, and to its companions, the Wealth Tax and <Col N="228" /> Capital Acquisitions Tax Bills.  Under these Bills capital will now be subject to tax in times of liquidity, in small annual amounts and, in the case of transfers, in relation to the amount received.  This contrasts with the system it is replacing whereby estates were either burdened once in a generation with a heavy estate duty which could and did impair the efficiency of the medium-sized farm or business and, in some cases, could threaten their very survival; or escaped all or most liability to capital taxes by reason of avoidance practices which the law allowed.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before you provides for a tax equivalent to the lowest rate of income tax, namely, 26 per cent on realised gains arising on or after 6th April, 1974.  It is intended to remedy the inequitable and anomalous situation which heretofore existed whereby those who could afford to take their income at irregular intervals in the form of capital gains were allowed to take it tax free as compared with those who, with little or no notice as to the form in which they might take their rewards, bore the full burden of income taxation.</P>
    <P>In response to the invitation to consultation set out in the Government's White Paper on Capital Taxation, comments and suggestions were received from a great many individuals and organisations on the outline proposals for the new taxes.  In addition to these representations I received deputations from many of the organisations concerned and discussed with them the implications of the proposals for the various sectors of the economy.  Everywhere it seemed there was general acceptance of the desirability of introducing a capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>Views naturally varied in relation to a number of important aspects, principally the rate of tax and the exemptions. The views received were carefully evaluated and the Bill as initiated reflected many of these views.  Each of the other eight member states of the European Economic Community have taxes on capital gains, all of them chargeable at rates either in excess of the rate of 26 per cent proposed for Ireland or at normal income tax rates. Capital gains taxes are also a general feature of most taxation systems, including <Col N="229" /> those of the United States of America, all Scandinavian countries, Spain, Portugal and Austria.</P>
    <P>The wide range of exemptions and the threshold levels which are provided in the Bill will ensure that Ireland will continue to have an advantage for investors compared with other countries. At the same time, the introduction of a capital gains tax in Ireland will contribute to the equity of our taxation system, particularly in view of the fact that capital gains are normally made only by those fortunate enough to own assets from which gains can be realised. Subjecting capital gains in Ireland to taxation is a long overdue tax reform which recognises that gains which may arise in a variety of ways should be treated as analogous to income and therefore should be taxed.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is concerned with the various definitions used in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is the main charging section and levies a tax of 26 per cent on all chargeable gains accruing in 1974-75 and subsequent years of assessment. However, an alternative basis of charge for individuals is provided for in section 6.</P>
    <P>Section 4 applies the tax to all persons, including companies, unincorporated bodies and trusts as well as individuals.  Persons resident in the State will be liable to capital gains tax on all gains realised on the disposal of chargeable assets, wherever those assets are situated.  Non-residents will be liable only in respect of gains on the disposal of real estate, mineral rights, or business assets within the State or of exploration or exploitation rights on our continental shelf.  Non-residents will also be liable when disposing of unquoted shares which derive their value from such assets.</P>
    <P>Under section 5 the due date for payment of the tax is either three months after the end of the tax year in which the gain accrued or two months after the date of assessment, whichever is later.</P>
    <P>Section 6, as I have already mentioned, deals with an alternative basis of charge which will in certain circumstances be applied to an individual whereby capital gains tax would be <Col N="230" /> charged in an amount equal to the additional income tax which would be payable if half of the first £5,000 of his capital gains and the whole of any excess over £5,000 were treated as income for income tax purposes.  In response to suggestions made in the Dáil I moved an amendment there on Committee Stage to change the terms of this provision so that it will not be necessary for a taxpayer to make a claim to have this alternative basis applied to him.  It will be applied automatically by the Revenue Commissioners in any case where it would result in a lower amount of tax being payable.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that in general all forms of property shall be assets for the purposes of the tax, whether the property is situated inside the State or outside it, including incorporeal property generally.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with disposals of assets.  Disposals will include all changes of ownership of assets whether by sale, exchange, transfer or gift.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that the acquisition and disposal of an asset will be deemed to be for a consideration equal to its market value.  Where assets are transferred otherwise than by a sale on the open market, for instance, by way of gift, the market value of the asset must be substituted for the consideration, if any, given or received.  It was found necessary to treat gifts as disposals as otherwise gift arrangements could be fabricated to avoid capital gains tax.  It is provided, however, that disposals of assets by way of gift prior to the date of publication of the Bill, namely 20th December, 1974, will not give rise to chargeable gains or allowable losses.</P>
    <P>Section 10 indicates the time at which a disposal and acquisition are deemed to be made and provides specifically for such transactions as conditional contracts, compulsory acquisition of lands and hire-purchase contracts, compensation and insurance receipts.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with the computation of chargeable gains and applies the rules embodied in Schedules 1 to 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with capital losses which will be computed on the same <Col N="231" /> basis as chargeable gains and which will be allowed for set-off against such gains.  As a general principle a loss will not be allowable if a gain on the same transaction would not be a chargeable gain.  Allowable losses to the extent that they have not already been allowed may be carried forward for set-off against subsequent capital gains.</P>
    <P>Under section 13 disposals of assets between a husband and wife will not give rise to a chargeable gain or to an allowable loss.  The gains and losses of a married couple will be aggregated and the husband will be liable for the tax on the total gains.  A husband and wife may, on application, be assessed separately on their individual gains but this will not have the effect of reducing the total tax liability.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with situations arising out of deaths.  The passing of assets on death shall not constitute a disposal for a capital gains tax charge. The legatee will be deemed to acquire the assets at their cost to the deceased and any gain on a later disposal will be calculated by reference to that cost.  An allowable loss made by an individual in the year of assessment in which he dies may be carried back, for offset against capital gains for up to three years of assessment before death.</P>
    <P>Section 15 deals with the treatment of trusts and trustees.  The trustees of a settlement will be treated as a single and continuing body of persons and will be chargeable on the disposal of any trust assets on this basis.  Detailed rules are given for the charge to tax on termination of interests.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides in the case of an individual, including a married couple, for the exemption of the first £500 capital gains in any year.</P>
    <P>Section 17 exempts from tax sales of chattels by an individual, including a married couple, where the proceeds do not exceed £2,000.  Chattels would include such items as paintings, jewellery, silverware.</P>
    <P>Section 18 exempts from tax tangible moveable property which is a wasting asset such as a motor car.  Generally a wasting asset is one with an expected life of less than 50 years.  Special <Col N="232" /> treatment, however, applies to plant and machinery used in a business.</P>
    <P>Sections 19 to 21 and section 24 indicate the types of assets which will be exempt.  Examples are Government, local authority and State-sponsored body securities, land bonds, prize bonds and sweepstake winnings, life assurance policies, superannuation funds, and compensation for personal injury.</P>
    <P>Sections 22 and 23 indicate the bodies which will be exempt, namely, charities, local authorities, health boards, vocational education committees, committees of agriculture, trade unions, friendly societies and the Central Bank of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 25 exempts gains accruing to an individual on the disposal of his principal private residence including grounds of up to one acre.</P>
    <P>Section 26 grants relief from tax in the case of disposals of farms or businesses by persons of 55 years and over for a consideration of up to £50,000.</P>
    <P>Section 27 grants similar relief in the case of a disposal of a farm or business by an individual of 55 years and over to one or more of his children or to a nephew or niece who stands in the shoes of a child for a value or consideration of up to £150,000.  In the case of both sections where the consideration exceeds the limits indicated marginal relief will be given.</P>
    <P>To prevent abuse these reliefs can be availed of only once in the lifetime of the owner and, in the case of the relief for the sale to the immediate family, this will be withdrawn if the farm or business is subsequently sold outside the family within the following ten years.  I may add that provision is being made under section 30 to exempt from the consideration received for disposal of a farm payments made to a farmer under the European Communities (Retirement of Farmers) Regulations, 1974.</P>
    <P>I should mention that in response to suggestions made in the Dáil I have on the Report Stage in the Dáil amended the definition of qualifying assets for the purposes of these two sections so that the period of ownership of such assets and the period of full-time working directorship of a deceased <Col N="233" /> spouse would be added to that of the surviving spouse in applying the ten-year test.  Other amendments ensure full continuity in relation to the replacement of assets, the incorporation of a business and the disposal of a family farm or business through shares in a family company.</P>
    <P>Under section 28 it will be possible to claim deferment of tax in respect of gains made on the disposal of certain specified business assets provided the proceeds of sale are spent on new business assets for use exclusively in the business.  In addition to trades, professions and farming, this relief will also be available to public authorities, woodlands managed on a commercial basis, non-profit making bodies, trade associations, and athletic and amateur sports bodies.  The period within which the new assets may be acquired for the purposes of relief under this section will extend from 12 months before to three years after the date of disposal of the old assets.  Discretion is being left to the Revenue Commissioners to lengthen these periods in individual circumstances.</P>
    <P>Arising out of suggestions made in the Dáil during the Second and Committee Stages of the debate I have extended the roll-over relief provided in this section to cover the case where there is a change of business.  To qualify for relief the taxpayer must have carried on the old business for a minimum of ten years before he disposes of it and he must have commenced the new business within two years of disposing of the old.</P>
    <P>Section 29 allows deferment of the charge on compensation money received in respect of the damage or destruction of an asset where the money is used in restoring or replacing the asset.  The charge is not imposed until the asset or the asset replacing it has been disposed of.</P>
    <P>Section 31 sets out the general rules for applying the tax to unit trusts. Distributions of capital from the unit trust assets will be treated as part disposal of units by the receiver and taxed accordingly.  Where the gains made by a unit trust are gains which would not be chargeable in the hands of the unit holders or where assets of a unit trust are all non-chargeable assets, <Col N="234" /> such as Government securities, then the gains made by the unit trust will not be regarded as chargeable gains.</P>
    <P>Section 32 goes on to provide special arrangements whereby a unit trust registered in this country with large public participation and provided certain conditions as set out in the section are satisfied may enter into arrangements with the Revenue Commissioners so that the effective charge to tax on the trustees is confined to the chargeable gains not distributed to unit holders. In this way the unit holder will get the benefit of reliefs applicable to individuals.</P>
    <P>Sections 33 to 37 of the Bill contain certain measures to deal with tax avoidance, such as transactions between connected persons at artificially low prices, transactions involving disposal of assets in separate lots, transfer at under-value by controlled companies or by the transfer of assets to companies and trusts abroad.</P>
    <P>Section 38 empowers the Government to enter into arrangements with the Governments of other states to provide relief from double taxation on capital gains similar to reliefs now applicable in the case of income tax.</P>
    <P>Section 39 provides that in the case of disposals to the State, to a charity, or to certain other national institutions and public bodies such as the National Gallery, the section 9 provision whereby in certain circumstances the acquisition and disposal of an asset will be deemed to be for a consideration equal to its market value will not apply and the tax will be charged by reference to the unadjusted gain.  Losses, however, will not be allowed.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill&mdash; sections 40 to 51&mdash;contain miscellaneous provisions dealing with the assets of insolvent persons, the position of company liquidations, the treatment of funds in court, the position where gains accrue abroad but cannot be repatriated and also where consideration money is paid by instalments over a period exceeding 18 months and where assets are switched or extinguished.  Another of these miscellaneous provisions is that debts, apart from loan stocks, will not be a chargeable asset in the hands of the original creditor.  Section 47 deals with <Col N="235" /> options.  This section was partly redrafted by an amendment introduced at Report Stage in the Dáil in order to meet criticism during the Committee Stage debate that it was somewhat obscure.  Section 48 deals with the rules for determining the location of assets which might otherwise be difficult to determine, while section 49 deals with the determination of market value with particular reference to shares and securities.  Section 50 brings capital gains tax within the ambit of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927, which would enable a change in the rate of the tax to be made by a Financial Resolution of the Dáil.  It also places on the Revenue Commissioners the same responsibilities to account for capital gains tax as are imposed on them in relation to other taxes.</P>
    <P>The final section of the Bill, section 51, applies the Schedules and enables their provisions fixing the amount of consideration in a transaction to have effect before 6th April, 1974, where it is necessary to compute a chargeable gain by reference to circumstances before that date.  Schedules 1, 2 and 3 contain detailed rules for the computation of capital gains and Schedule 4 sets out the rules and procedures governing the administration of the new tax.  Arising out of a suggestion made in the course of the Committee Stage debate on Schedule 1 in the Dáil I introduced an amendment on Report Stage providing for relief in respect of interest charged to capital in the case of companies.  In Schedule 4&mdash;Administration&mdash;I have, in response to representations received, deleted the reference to section 176 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which, on reconsideration, was felt not to be necessary in view of the many other provisions relating to the supply of information for the purposes of the tax.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in the Dáil, I am satisfied that the draft Bill now before the House contains a fair and reasonable scheme of capital gains taxation, and I intend to maintain its fairness and reasonableness by appropriate adjustments to the thresholds from time to time which would cater for inflation. These will be in addition to the built-in allowance which has been made for it <Col N="236" /> by the application of the lowest rate of income taxation to capital gains.</P>
    <P>We have deliberately made this scheme of capital gains tax as simple as possible in the initial stages having regard to the inherent complexities in the area in which it must operate.  I do not expect it to be the very last provision on capital gains to come defore the Oireachtas.  Time and experience and changing circumstances will no doubt call for modification, and I assure the House that for my part I will try to ensure that such modifications as are necessary to improve the efficiency or to increase the equity of the scheme will be put forward.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill which is before us is, in principle, acceptable to this side of the House.  It is recognised that the abolition of death duties applying to the immediate family of the deceased would deprive the Minister and the State of a certain amount of taxes, and it was necessary to introduce legislation to replace those taxes.  This is probably the most acceptable way to raise the money involved.</P>
      <P>Quite apart from the practical problem of raising taxes, I think the principle of taxing gains is not unreasonable, and as the Minister pointed out in his speech, this kind of capital gains tax is now applicable in most of the other EEC countries.  I think it is acceptable that, if those who earn money by their labour, by their services, by their expertise, are assessable to income tax, in the same way those who gain money, gain profits by the disposal of assets, should be assessable to some sort of tax.  It would be indefensible to say that in no circumstances should a person who gains money by the disposal of assets be susceptible to tax.  If we look at certain businesses which consist of buying and selling goods, to a certain extent we have had in these businesses a capital gains tax for many years in the past, because they would be subject to income tax on the profit they made by disposing of assets at a gain.  Therefore the principle is not an entirely new one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In looking at any new method of raising taxation, we must realise that it <Col N="237" /> will have certain adverse effects.  It will, to some extent, diminish the enterprise, initiative and energy, of at least some people whose activities, not only from their own point of view but from the point of view of the development of industry and agriculture, play an important part in the economic development of the country.  It may also have some effect in slowing up the disposal of property, the disposal of industrial plant and farms, which, again from the national point of view, it would be better to dispose of and put in the hands of younger and more active people. People who are faced with the fact that if they dispose of their property they will be subject to capital gains tax will, in some cases at least, be reluctant to dispose of it.</P>
    <P>As I said, this to some extent will have an adverse effect on the national economy.  It may have that effect on firms, farmers and so on, who contemplate disposing of their property in the near future, in five years ahead or some such time.  It may have the effect of discouraging them from keeping their property in good condition because to keep it in first-class condition would mean that when they sell the property, it will fetch a higher price and, consequently, they would have to pay more capital gains. It would be more advantageous to them in that situation to put the money that they might spend on improvements into their pocket and get slightly less for the property when they sell it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there are certain adverse effects of a tax of this kind.  I mention them not because I believe that these adverse effects in this case are so serious as to make one doubt whether this Bill should be introduced, but because I think that where Bills are introduced which involve taxes one must look at all aspects of the Bill.  We must analyse the various effects of the Bill and if there are adverse effects they must be taken into account and noted. It must be realised that a Bill of this kind could go so far as to have such adverse effects that it would do more harm than good.</P>
    <P>We must realise that anything that ttifles enterprise or initiative is someshing to which serious consideration <Col N="238" /> must be given.  We are living in a capitalist society whether we like it or not.  There are some people in this House who do not approve of the fact that we are living in a capitalist society. For the moment we are in that society and we must consider any Bill of this kind for the effect it will have on the society in which we are living.  We are depending very largely on the <i>entrepreneur,</i> on the person whose enterprise, initiative and activity makes the kind of society we are living in work. We must examine and measure the effect on that kind of person of any Bill of this kind and analyse the adverse effects as well as giving credit for the useful effect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>When I mention these matters I do so to make the point that nobody should approach this Bill on the basis that it is a great Bill, that it will raise taxation, and that it will give the Minister for Finance extra revenue with which to do good.  It will have some adverse effects. It will stifle initiative.  To that extent one must realise that there are adverse features of this Bill as well as good features.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill is, in general terms, acceptable and the criticisms of it are mainly criticisms of detail.  They are mostly matters which can be dealt with more adequately on Committee Stage. I should like to make a few comments on certain aspects of the Bill on this Stage.</P>
    <P>The first point I should like to make is to regret the fact that no distinction has been made between the various kinds of capital gains.  No distinction has been made between short-term gains and long-term gains.  No distinction has been made between gains made in respect of which the holder of the assets has contributed little or nothing to the improvement of the assets&mdash;the kind of person who is very often a short-term speculator&mdash;and the holder of the assets who has contributed a great deal of hard work and sacrifice over the years.  Such a person would have contributed in the course of these years a great deal of income tax to the State as a result of the income he has received from providing the improvement in the asset.  Very few people would object to a capital gains tax, even <Col N="239" /> at a higher rate than 26 per cent, on quick gains to which the owner of the asset contributed little in the way of effort.  He should not be equated with the person who has made a gain which has accumulated over many years, a gain created by very hard work, by enterprise, by sacrifices and so on.</P>
    <P>These are four different kinds of gains&mdash;short-term, long-term, a gain in which a great deal of effort has been contributed and a gain in which little or no effort has been contributed.  It is a great pity that some effort was not made by the Minister and his Department to distinguish between these different kinds of gains and to have different rates of taxation or in some way to recognise that they are very different and should be treated differently.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the Dáil that there are difficulties in this respect but these difficulties should have been faced up to.  Even if it would be difficult to administer the Bill an effort should have been made, although it may not have been successful&mdash;I understand it was decided that it was not successful in the UK&mdash;to have some distinction between these different gains in this country. The Bill is, from that point of view, lacking in discrimination and sophistication. It is a heavy-handed Bill.  The reason why it is lacking in discrimination is apparently that it would be easier to administer it as it is at the moment. This is an argument that is put up for so many things but ease of administration, in this Bill, in particular, is not justified.</P>
    <P>The biggest danger in the Bill and the one which we are all conscious of is the effect of inflation.  In present circumstances inflation here is running at the rate of 25 per cent per year.  Therefore, we must realise that any gain made at present is partly, if not entirely, due to the effect of inflation.  It would be manifestly unjust to charge capital gains on illusory gains, on gains which are only nominal and gains which are only due to the effect of inflation.  Every effort must be made in the administration of this Bill and in the way in which the Bill is finally passed to ensure that <Col N="240" /> capital gains tax is only charged on real capital gains.</P>
    <P>We do not know how inflation will progress during the next few years. Many people are of the opinion that it will worsen.  The optimists hope the situation will improve but I do not think anybody takes the view that inflation will disappear entirely.  Most of those, even of an optimistic nature, are talking in terms of bringing inflation down to single figures and they would be happy if inflation could be held at something in the region of 8 or 9 or even 10 per cent.  But no matter what way we look into the future, no matter how optimistic we are, we are faced with some inflation and the general view would be that something around 8 or 9 or 10 per cent would be quite acceptable. In the next few years inflation will be very much higher than that figure, but even into the future we will have inflation and inflation will have a very serious effect on the way in which this Bill is administered.  Unless it is framed in such a way that inflation will be provided for, great injustice will be done to the taxpayers and the people who come within the ambit of this Bill.  At the present rate of inflation, to give an example, property worth £10,000 at present will be worth about £20,000 in something approaching five years, possibly even less.  If you take that as an example it means that a property of that kind in five years will apparently have increased by £10,000 and the tax on that will be £2,600 so that there will be no real gain.  If that kind of situation is to happen, this Bill will be manifestly unjust and those who accept it now as being a reasonable Bill in all the circumstances will certainly regard it as anything but reasonable in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he will provide allowances or that the Bill will be modified, at least from the administrative point of view, to provide for inflation. But there is nothing in the Bill to deal with this.  What the Minister is saying is that the Minister for Finance of the time each year will make an <i>ad hoc</i> decision and will provide some relief for the fact that the tax would be increased unjustly because of the effect of inflation.  From a practical point of view, we all recognise that this will not <Col N="241" /> work because the Minister each year will have to make a decision as to what allowance he will make.  Some years he would probably plead that in the particular circumstances of the year, because of a difficult financial and economic situation, he should not make any allowance.  Every Minister at every budget time has problems.  He needs extra money and the temptation not to do anything about increasing the allowance so as to allow for inflation will be very strong.  He will be faced with a situation that if he needs more money he can put an extra penny on income tax or on the pint or he can do nothing about the inflationary effect on capital gains or he can do something quite inadequate.</P>
    <P>Most Ministers in such situations will not put the penny on the income tax or on the pint but will turn a blind eye on the inflationary effect on capital gains and the person who is subject to capital gains will be paying more.  More people will be coming within the net unjustifiably because the gains upon which they will be taxed will be illusory gains, will be due to inflation.  Unless something is put in the Bill which will be used as a yardstick, which will ensure that each year the Minister will take full cognisance of the effect of inflation&mdash; he may merely make a gesture which would be in many cases quite worthless but merely giving the undertaking, although given in good faith, is not enough.  I am quite confident that as years go on that will not be enough, that it will have the effect on this Bill that something which is reasonably acceptable now will become quite unjust.</P>
    <P>I want to mention the kind of situation that arises in these cases.  To take two examples within the last year of measures in which the Minister could have and should have done something to allow for inflation and did not do so&mdash;we had the Finance Bill here a short time ago in which we were dealing with the personal reliefs for those subject to income tax.  The personal reliefs were undoubtedly improved as compared with the previous year.  But they were not improved anything like enough to allow for the effect of inflation.  That is the kind of situation that will almost certainly develop in relation to this Bill. <Col N="242" /> Again, we had the situation where, a year or two ago, the Minister restricted the extent to which money earning interest would be allowable for income tax.  He fixed a figure of £2,000 at that time.  No increase has been made in that figure since that time.  If inflation has taken place since then, everything else in relation to the taxpayer's position is going up because of inflation and some increase in that should have been allowed.</P>
    <P>These are just two examples and I am sure there are many examples of the kind of situation which will develop where the Minister, although having given an undertaking to make allowances for inflation, will either not give a sufficient allowance or will give no allowance and will plead, with some justification, that in the circumstances in which he finds himself he is unable to do so and that other sections of the community or other situations deserve to be considered first.  He has to put aside the question of allowing for inflation in this or that situation.  My point is that unless it is built into the Bill in some way, unless there is some yardstick inevitably allowed for inflation, it will not be given as years go on. It should not be beyond the ingenuity of the Revenue Commissioners or the draftsmen of this Bill to devise such a method.  Many people are apathetic towards this Bill because they are convinced that its provisions will never affect them but many of these people will find themselves, in a comparatively short time, coming within the ambit of the Bill not because their real wealth has increased, not because their financial circumstances have increased, but because inflation will bring them within the net.</P>
    <P>There are certain other aspects of the Bill which are not as important as the question of inflation but on which I should like to comment briefly.  It is regrettable that gifts should have been included in the Bill.  The Minister has said that this was necessary because otherwise the situation could be abused. I gather from what he said that he regretted having to do it but considered it necessary because of the possibility of abuse.</P>
    <P>Again, something is being done for <Col N="243" /> administrative convenience, although it is acknowledged that it is regrettable that it should have to be done.  Many things are done in this Bill and other Bills because of administrative convenience. Whoever coined the phrase, &ldquo;Patriotism, what sins are committed in thy name!&rdquo; could have said also, &ldquo;Administrative convenience, what sins are committed in thy name&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill which provides that a person selling a business and investing the money in the same business would not be assessable to capital gains tax is a good one.  In the original Bill it was rather restrictive but I gather from what the Minister has said today that an amendment has been made so as to allow a person to change from one business to another.  This is a welcome amendment.  It would be entirely undesirable that a person who sold a declining business and wanted to move into some worth-while area should have been restricted to the same business, which may not have been a competitive one or one of any great benefit to the community.  I take it that the Minister has amended it so as, in <i>bona fide</i> circumstances, to allow a person to change from one business to another.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify whether it would be possible when this Bill is in operation for a person to be assessable for capital gains tax and income tax on the same transaction. For instance, if a small firm sells some assets and as a result is assessable for capital gains, and if the shareholders get increased dividends from the profits made from the sale of the assets, will they be assessed on those as well?  It seems unjust that a person should be assessable to income tax under two different headings in respect of the same transaction.</P>
    <P>This Bill is generally acceptable but I would not go so far as to welcome it. It is hard to welcome anything that will impose more taxes.  If the precautions which I have mentioned, particularly in regard to inflation, are included, the Bill will be a worth-while contribution to our taxation system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the <Col N="244" /> things I have to say in relation to this Bill are rather painful for me to say. My nature is to rally to the support of my friends and my friends are in Government.  My particular concern arises from the position we are in in the Seanad in dealing with a Money Bill. This difficulty with regard to Money Bills does not arise generally and it has never arisen in such an acute form before.  This Bill is part of a package which, according to my computation, consists of 156 sections, six Schedules and 155 pages.  It is a code which will affect, for good or ill, the life of everybody in the country.</P>
      <P>The Constitution entitles us to make our recommendations in regard to a Money Bill within 21 days of receiving it.  I take it that today is the day we have received this Capital Gains Tax Bill.  Therefore, we have until 31st July to go through a Bill which, even taken on its own, is infinitely complex.  Its parallel in the United Kingdom was described as the most complex piece of fiscal legislation ever introduced there. We have 21 days to consider this.  Every cat that purrs in the corridors of power knows that the Government propose that the Dáil will dissolve at the end of this month.  Therefore, I labour here today under a sense of very considerable discouragement as to the enthusiasm with which any points I may be capable of making can be received in this situation by the Minister, if he has to bring this Bill back to the Dáil, where it has been for nearly seven months.</P>
      <P>Those who contributed to that debate performed very valuable public work and helped in improving the Bill.  I do not criticise those who participated in the debate for their contributions. There was some filibustering on other elements of the code which has been counter-productive in every possible sense.  If the Government have guillotined business in the Dáil by the resolution which was passed yesterday and if they persist with their intention, as expressed, of completing the second element in this code by 30th July, they will not merely have guillotined the business of Dáil Éireann but will have castrated the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will be the function of Senators on the day when we receive the Wealth <Col N="245" /> Tax Bill?  Is it to be thought, if anyone is bright enough, viewing from any point of view, to discover some grave defect in it, to discover that it is tainted by some awful malignancy, that the Government will reconvene Dáil Éireann to listen to the recommendations of the Seanad?  This happens in relation to the Finance Bill almost every year.  But that is an annual measure; it is not a radical transformation of a whole capital code, which is what we are talking about.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister, who has&mdash;it is about time I paid him a compliment&mdash; been extraordinary receptive since the publication of the White Paper on Capital Taxation to suggestions from all sorts of informed people and whose initial Bills reflected considerable reception of these points, most strongly to invite the Government to reconsider their proposal with regard to the second leg of this double.  I urge them to adopt the procedure which has been adopted with regard to the third, that is to say, to have a resolution imposing the wealth tax in accordance with the terms of the Bill when enacted.  There may be more difficulty in framing that resolution, but it is capable of being framed.</P>
    <P>This is directly related to this Bill for a reason which I will later develop.  I share the view expressed by Senator E. Ryan with regard to the effect of inflation on the gains.  I would not have put it quite as he put it in describing this as unjust, because that begs the question as to whether there should be a tax of the nature of a taxation of wealth.  If one does not allow for inflation one is enacting a selective wealth tax, varying in its rate according to the rate of inflation.  This can be demonstrated.</P>
    <P>There is one obvious cost to the Revenue, but I am unable to estimate what it would be.  It would involve a postponement of the collection date of the 5th October, which is the date under that Bill on which one will not be subject to interest if one does not pay wealth tax for the year.  Obviously, that date would have to be a date, depending on the resumption of the Dáil, 5th December or something like that, that would give us the possibility then of <Col N="246" /> having consideration given in this Bill to the kind of appropriate adjustments which should be made to cope with that element here which amounts to a wealth tax.</P>
    <P>In making this comment from this place I am encouraged to think that there is in the tradition of my party a liberal element, that there have been members of this Government, not excluding the Minister present, who did not feel shy about expressing their own minds from time to time.  I am not excluding the Taoiseach, nor am I excluding the present President of the High Court, who when a Dáil Deputy practically obstructed the business of the House opposing a measure introduced by his own Minister for Justice. The late Deputy Sweetman was another.</P>
    <P>I seriously urge the Minister to give consideration to this and, as early as he is able to, on this measure where we have a fair run&mdash;we can in 21 days do our work&mdash;give us encouragement.  If we do our work and if he sees any validity in the points we make, that he will make efforts, despite all the other burdens he carries, because of the enormous importance of what is involved here, to meet these points with appropriate recommendations, drafted, no doubt, by his parliamentary draftsman.</P>
    <P>As to the Bill in its general terms, it is useful for me to make a point with regard to this.  One thing that can be said about capital gains tax is that it in no way disturbs a climate favourable to capital.  In no way can it be so represented, nor should it be so represented. One of the earliest countries to introduce capital gains taxation was the United States of America.  I do not know whether everyone in this Assembly knows it, but the first capital gains taxation introduced in Britain was introduced not by the socialist Government, not by the Labour Government&mdash; it was introduced in 1962 by the Conservative Government, accepting a recommendation of the Royal Commission made in 1955.  They took some time to accept it but they did accept it. It did come in.  At that stage it was only short-term gains.  The only unfortunate element surrounding the White Paper was that there were some phrases in it <Col N="247" /> which were fastened on by interested or anxious people to build up a view that there was some hostility by this Government to capital.</P>
    <P>I should like to express my view that that is absolutely untrue.  In relation to capital gains tax, I think it is justified. One writer put it rather well.  He said that the justification for a capital gains tax is simply that the inequities of having one are less than the inequities of not having one.  It is, if one likes, a type of social solace.  It is justifiable from the point of view of equity. Capital gains constitute economic power; they cost one spending power and they represent a taxable capacity. Such a tax does affect efficiency, insouciance.  It tends to correct the distortion that we all experienced whereby the intelligence of the man with any money and enterprise was always directed towards so exploiting his money that it resulted in a nontaxable capital gain rather than an income generating taxable income asset. Therefore a capital gains tax tends to correct that distorting effect.  Without it that distortion would continue.  It therefore provides a useful function of that technical nature, apart from the equitable sense it generates.  If one is satisfied that a more equal distribution of property is desirable it tends to achieve this, the more it seems to be an acceptable proposition that the more wealth a man has the bigger proportion he can afford to hold in the form of a capital gain yielding type, whereas the man with a little has got to make it work to produce him an income because he needs it.  This tends to equalise this&mdash; to take from the man with that much more the proportion of the gain he makes from his realisations.</P>
    <P>The trouble about the capital gains tax code everywhere is the administrative cost.  The fact is that there have to be, as there are in this Bill appropriate for our circumstances, somewhat arbitrary decisions on different matters.  It is very hard to justify, in principle, a lot of the distinctions, a lot of points, at which lines are drawn and the very considerable compliance cost from the point of view of getting valuations made where one does not have actual transactions <Col N="248" /> and two valuations made where one has people employed to make computations to determine that one is not liable for capital gains tax.  That is a compliance cost which has got to be borne by the taxpayer who is not even liable for the capital gains tax.  The balance of my judgment would be that the terms of equity, efficiency and equality make this tax one which should be adopted.</P>
    <P>With regard to my first main point about the Bill, I accept the concept of capital gains tax.  I am very concerned at the absence of a correction for inflation and I completely agree with what Senator Ryan has said on this.  I agree that, if this correction is not made now, it will not be possible to make it in the future.  It will give rise to social and political difficulties.  It would never be a popular thing to do.  It would never be possible to justify this without, at the same time, making some alteration in relation to personal allowances which might be infinitely costly to concede compared to the cost of conceding this.  One might ask what is worrying me.  Why not if £10,000 becomes about £20,000 let them pay the £2,600?  But we are talking about a wealth tax then.  That wealth tax code has in its terms provisions for exemption, provisions of thresholds.  There are no such thresholds in this.  The small man would not be subject to the wealth tax at all because he has not got £100,000 and his children's wealth aggregated with his and his wife's leave him outside the wealth tax.  But he is subject to this gains tax, no matter how little he has.  I know, for example, of a man who was given £3,000 and during his period of retirement, by careful investment, he made it into £20,000 to provide for his handicapped child.  It is difficult to maintain that child on the income of that £20,000. Would it have been proper to have treated that person as wealthy because the £3,000 grew to £20,000, largely because of inflation?  There is a certain amount of wisdom in investment but the point is that it is not even thought of under the wealth tax code.  Let us face it, we are doing it under this capital gains tax code.</P>
    <P>The matter has been referred to in a <Col N="249" /> book, which I found very useful reading, by a man who favours the wealth tax.  It is called <i>Taxing Personal Wealth,</i> by C.T. Sanford.  I will take one sentence out of it:</P>
    <P>Yet the argument for taxing monetary gains as a form of wealth tax is fundamentally unsound.  If we want to tax wealth let us have a wealth tax.</P>
    <P>It is a selective wealth tax because the person who has wealth in this form can elect and may be able to elect not to pay it by not realising.  The more wealthy the man is, the more replete with funds he is likely to be, the less need he will have to realise his gain. That particular form of wealth tax will, perhaps, never impact on him or not impact on him for a generation.</P>
    <P>It is well to remind ourselves what we are talking about in terms of inflation. If one had £100 in July, 1914, according to the latest figure I have, it would have bought what one would require in January this year up to £1,316 to purchase.  If I am correct, and if we have a 25 per cent inflational rate and a 26 per cent tax, that seems to work out at 6½ per cent wealth tax.  That 6½ per cent wealth tax is imposed on the 1 per cent wealth tax which is under the Wealth Tax Bill.  The same writer has said with regard to this that there may be difficulty in solving the problem. His suggestion is that it ought to be done on the basis of a revaluation of the costs of acquisition indexed to the retail price level.</P>
    <P>That may be in certain circumstances embarrassing for the tax collector.  One could see a revaluation in a situation where there was a greater rise over a period of time in question in the retail price level than there was, for example, in the property cost level.  For example, I do not think that the inflation for the last 12 months can be discovered in the prices of houses at this moment. There may be difficulties in determining how to do it.  The Swedes have done that, I think, in relation to properties and it seems to work there.  They have a different system with securities; if I am correct in my recollections, it is according to the length of time they are held.  One pays a very high rate if one sells quickly and then it tapers off <Col N="250" /> down.  I do not see why you just simply increase the cost of acquisition.</P>
    <P>Agreed it is difficult but with regard to this kind of tax one has to be arbitrary about it.  If one recognises that it is unfair to impose without a threshold a wealth tax of 6½ per cent, assuming that is the continued rate of inflation or 2½ per cent, if it is cut down to ten one is forced to an arbitrary solution if one does not introduce into this, which would seem to be inconceivably difficult, thresholds to provide at least in relation to gains as distinct from gifts.  There should be some threshold provision there.  Another disadvantage is that one has got this hanging over one's head as a possible liability.  The tendency will be that one will stay locked in to what one is in.  The economic disadvantages of that, generally, may be considerable.  Of course, what people do in a free society with their resources affects not really themselves but affects everybody else.</P>
    <P>The point I have made is accentuated in this Bill by one provision contained in it, which I think is not right.  I refer to the provision in section 14 in which the matter of death is dealt with.  There must have been a decision with regard to this.  There is a clear departure here from the UK code.  As I understand the position at present, and I do not think they changed it in the last Finance Act, the provision in the UK code is that death does not involve nowadays&mdash; it did up to 1971&mdash;a realisation.  Neither does it involve realisation here.  Under the UK code the heir gets it at the market value as of the date of death. This does not matter, looking backwards to situations where the relevant date for a host of transactions is going to be the 6th April, 1974, but in the future it is going to be the date on which one's father bought the thing, say 1975.  He passes on to his heir in the year 2000, and that heir is forced to sell it in 2001.  God knows what capital gain he would have made in that time. Under the UK code it would be revalued on the date of one's father's death in 2000 and it would only be the gain that the heir made after his death which would be taxable.  I do not think, particularly in an inflationary period, and as acutely inflationary as this <Col N="251" /> period alas is, that we should have the carry forward principle.</P>
    <P>On the question of trying to save compliance costs I should like the Minister to consider carefully&mdash;he has had to consider all this very carefully&mdash; whether, having regard to the nature of our property code the fact that leases of more than three years and three months are not even short leases under our property code because of the rights attendant on the lessee and the tenant in question.  The Schedule sets about eroding the cost at which one acquired this so-called wasting asset. We will have a situation in which artificially a man may sell at a loss and find he is paying capital gains tax, because he is not allowed charge in the cost of acquisition at its full figure.  The figure has had to be recalculated in accordance with the most gorgeous formula, which is similar to that in the UK, and in the table, accepted mercifully, the second decimal point has disappeared.  This will involve us all in getting Japanese equipment in our offices.  It will be very difficult.  I raise the question as to its usefulness in terms of the revenue it will bring in if the cost of complying with it will be awful.</P>
    <P>There are two points on that, firstly the short lease.  I have had the experience where the accountant was reducing the value of the lease annually as the value of the lease was increasing&mdash; naturally, because inflation was increasing the value of the lease even though its time was running out.  Inflation is inflating upwards the price and at the same time we have the actual legal situation here somewhat different from what I understand it to be in the UK making inappropriate that Schedule. On this question of compliance, the Bill contains provisions for giving exemptions of release for gains of £500 or under, and chattels of £2,000 or less. Why not any assets of £2,000 or less? Why not make that figure somewhat more?  Think of all the transactions that would not have to be looked at by either the Revenue or the taxpayer and where the compliance and administrative costs would surely outweigh when <Col N="252" /> taken together whatever tax benefits will come from the 26 per cent figure.</P>
    <P>Rather late in the day the Minister introduced an amendment to paragraph 11 of the Fourth Schedule.  I may be missing the point.  I thought I might have been from some words the Minister used when opening the debate this morning.  There has been an extension of the obligation where one is obliged to retain, if the transaction is £50,000 or more, the capital gains tax on one half of the consideration.  This seems to have been extended beyond land, minerals and exploration rights to include now shares in a company deriving the greater part of their value directly or indirectly from land, mineral exploration or exploitation rights.</P>
    <P>I have two points really to make about that.  Firstly, does this apply to a publicly quoted company?  Are we expected to know whether or not the shares derive the greater part of their value directly or indirectly from land, mines or minerals?  What is the position of a purchaser, a stockbroker, if it does apply to quoted transactions?  I can see the situation the Minister is trying to cope with where there is a property-owning company, where the shares are transferred and the property passes by virtue of a share transfer.  It should be limited to a non-quoted company to get rid of that particular difficulty. Secondly&mdash;I do not want to get into drafting points at this stage&mdash;there is provision here that one can get a certificate in certain circumstances and let us hope the certificate will come as quickly as one would want it.  Certificates under section 6 of the Finance Act used come quickly; they did not hold things up.  Let us hope that this will be equally speedy.</P>
    <P>There does not seem to be provision for the case where the person is exempt under the Double Taxation Relief Agreement.  He is not ordinarily resident in the State but he is exempt because he is resident in the United Kingdom, for example, with which we have the Double Taxation Relief Agreement. Surely in that case too he should be entitled to get a certificate.  The other thing that worried me is if this affects the legal rights of the purchaser and vendor?  What if the chap who retains <Col N="253" /> the 26 per cent sits on it?  What happens to the interest on the money?  Say, it is £26,000, whose money is that?  Is there a claim by the vendor against the purchaser?  I do not know.  I ask the question and it seems to be worth mentioning it.</P>
    <P>On the exemptions, it struck me that there did not seem to be provision for exempting bodies corporate under the Health Bodies Corporate Act we passed here when the late Mr. Childers was Minister for Health.  Certainly, a number of bodies corporate have been incorporated under that.  Presumably it would be intended that they should get like exemptions as the other bodies mentioned, local authorities, and so on. Another one is the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  Any relief and assistance that body could now get would be useful to them and useful for the State to give it.</P>
    <P>There is another development I favour very much.  There are more people involved in enterprise on the employment side who are concerned to get their employees interested in their business than is realised.  I know of one quite substantial business where the man who built it up has already given certain significant amounts to executives and intends to give to all permanent employees a substantial block of shares. Under this code these gifts make him liable to capital gains tax.  There ought not to be any discouragement of such a person; in fact he should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>There is provision for gifts from husband to wife.  Why is there no exemption, even such as there is, for example, in the Wealth Tax Bill, for a discretionary trust for the benefit of an incapacitated child?  Surely there should be a similar exemption of gifts to a permanently disabled child in need of completion of education.</P>
    <P>I could not find in the Bill any provision for the making of rules, but here I may be just missing some section of the Income Tax Act that has been adopted for dividing of liability for capital gains between partners.  I have some interest in this to see that there are appropriate rules in existence for <Col N="254" /> determining who is to pay and in what circumstances.</P>
    <P>With regard to sections 26 and 27, both admirable sections, I would have only one criticism.  Is there no way of encouraging a man who is what they call a &ldquo;burnt-out case&rdquo; before he is 55 years to dispose of the business or farm? Is there something sacrosanct about this?  Is this one of the things that must be arbitrary in practice&mdash;or have I handed the Minister his reply to me already in that phrase I have used? There should be some system under which it could be established to somebody's satisfaction that the chap was physically disabled, which would affect also this question of the full-time working director, because he was not able to work full-time.  I wonder if there is a necessity for that.  I presume it is to prevent tax avoidance being operated.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I must not get involved in tax avoidance any more, if we can avoid it.  I thought I would give him the text from Hindu Sacred Law to comfort him.  The Hindu Sacred Law is very strong on the necessity of telling the truth in all circumstances but one text says that, if a man speaks an untruth at the time of marriage, in sexual intercourse, when his life is in danger, or when he is likely to lose his property, these untruths are not sins. So do not be too severe on the tax avoider or the tax evader, because he is a little bit like the Chinaman on his pillow.  I brought my daughters up never to believe what the Chinaman would say to them on his pillow.  The taxman should not expect the taxpayer to tell him too much of the truth either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is not unfair to suggest that the salient feature of this legislation is irrelevant to the real problem that faces our country at the present time.  We all know that we are at the moment faced with an unprecedented and grave situation of inflation in which month by month, week by week, the value of the currency is being reduced, in which, week by week, the prices we have to pay for all commodities are going up.  We face a situation in which the number unemployed is unprecedented in the past 30 <Col N="255" /> or 40 years, with over 100,000 out of work, with every prospect of this number increasing still further in the autumn and very little prospect of any substantial reduction in this number until well into next year, if even then. There is also an enormous deficit in the current budget, even according to the Minister's figures, of over £240 million.  Some £300 million is to be borrowed abroad this year by State and other bodies.  The whole financial administration of the country is in complete disarray.  There is a situation, in other words, of very grave national crisis with no real prospect of any improvement in the next 12 months or so.</P>
      <P>There is considerable prospect of even further disasters facing us.  Now, under these circumstances, the entire time of the House and a great deal of the time of the Minister for Finance, who is responsible for the entire financial administration of this country, has been taken up with this Bill and the other capital taxation Bills, which, as I say are, whatever their intrinsic merit, utterly irrelevant to the needs of the country.  This piece of legislation will not put one man to work.  It will not reduce in the slightest the rate of inflation.  It will not help to the slightest degree in the next year or so in solving the exceedingly severe budgetary problems that the Minister faces.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, these capital taxation Bills, if they have any effect at all, can only have the effect&mdash;whether the effect be great or small one cannot yet say&mdash;of reducing the possibilities of getting the necessary private investments on which we rely so heavily in trying to reduce unemployment, increase national income and increase the well-being of our people.  In present circumstances these Bills are useless and irrelevant and to some extent positively dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter, as has been touched on already in this debate, has effectively ended the legislative work of the other House.  It cannot end the legislative work of this House because, as Senator Alexis FitzGerald has pointed out, the constitutional position is such that we cannot spend more than a very limited <Col N="256" /> and quite inadequate amount of time in considering these Bills.  Nonetheless for months past the work of the other House has effectively been centred around these Bills to considerable effect.  Some 30 or 40 amendments have been made to this Bill in the Dáil.  The length of time taken on this Bill was necessary.  Nonetheless it was essentially a waste of time in the sense that the Dáil and the Minister could have been far better employed in dealing with what are the real needs of this country.</P>
    <P>The result of this completely ludicrous legislative situation in the other House has been this draconian guillotine that was introduced there yesterday. There are five Bills, some of which have not yet been seen, and the Government have decreed that only two hours will be allotted for the discussion of each Bill, including the Second Stage and all the other Stages.  This is complete abuse of the legislative process, and it would be much better if the Minister did these things by regulation and forgot about the Oireachtas altogether.</P>
    <P>However, I do not propose to continue any further on this point.  I am merely referring to this in passing because I feel it is an aspect which one must consider when proposals like these come at the wrong time.  The Minister may say that for those who pay taxes there is never a right time to pay them.  Nonetheless, proposals such as this could have a positive value if they came at a time when things were going well in the country, when employment was going ahead, when the cost of living was relatively stable and when the national budgetary situation was on some reasonable kind of even keel.  When they come at a time of grave national economic and monetary crisis nobody could describe these Bills as anything but irrelevant.</P>
    <P>This type of irrelevance is typical of this Government's approach.  They have consistently ignored the matters that needed to be dealt with and have consistently chased after various legislative hares which have nothing to do with the real needs.  While the other House has been engaging in these complicated financial discussions of a nature which are of no help at all to the country, we in <Col N="257" /> this House have been engaged in ridiculous legislation like the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill.  It is also farcical for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to try to impose outside television on our people.  Neither of these has any real relation to the needs of the country.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that point, but I refer to this merely in passing.  I think these passing references are necessary in order to advertise the fact that this Government's approach to legislation is such that the real matters that need to be dealt with are not in fact dealt with.</P>
      <P>As Senator Eoin Ryan has said, we are not against the principle of the Bill. We agree with the general principle of a capital gains tax, even though we feel that the Government would be far better employed in doing something more useful.  The Minister accepts there is effectively no revenue to be had from this Bill in this year, but we agree with this legislation in principle, so long as one does not accept any suggestion that has been made by the Minister and his allies on occasion that this is in some way a transfer of resources from the rich to the poor or a redistribution of national wealth.  It is nothing of the kind.  The amount of money that will be available for some years to come will be very small indeed.</P>
      <P>I am glad that in introducing the Bill in this House the Minister did not indulge in some of the rather high-flown hyperbole in which he indulged when he introduced it in the Dáil.  At column 1100, Volume 277, of the Dáil Official Report of the 28th January, 1975 the Minister said:</P>
      <P>In the Government's view the existing tax system is inequitable and indefensible in that huge tax-free capital gains can be made by people of means while less fortunate people are inescapably obliged to pay significant slices of their regular income in tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole concept that people are <Col N="258" /> making huge capital gains is, to put it mildly, exaggerated.  Certainly in present circumstances one cannot imagine anyone making capital gains, huge or otherwise.  I was also rather puzzled at the suggestion that less fortunate people pay income tax, whereas the wealthy do not.  That is not a true picture of the situation.</P>
    <P>In so far as capital gains are made by speculators, there could be no possible objection to them being taxed.  They ought to be taxed.  The problem is, as has already been said, that this Bill taxes all concerned on the same basis. However, the Minister also in his introduction of the Bill in the Dáil stressed the need for business motivation and economic efficiency.  That is one of the problems that we face with this legislation&mdash;whether business motivation and economic efficiency will be helped.  I think it is very doubtful. One must accept the need for capital gains tax on speculative transactions, but in its present form I think it is likely to reduce business incentive and thereby reduce economic efficiency.  There will, as the Minister said, be very little yield in the early years.  Certainly it is unrealistic in the extreme to talk in terms of capital gains at this present moment.</P>
    <P>The greatest single problem is that we are running the danger of inhibiting genuine enterprise as opposed to speculation. The man who has built up a family business over 20 or 25 years by his own efforts and those of his family, because he finds it necessary or wishes in old age to retire and sell his business, has to pay 26 per cent capital gains on this in the same fashion as the speculative gentleman who buys a piece of land and sells it again a year or so later&mdash;in normal times not in present times&mdash;for an inflated price and makes a rapid capital gain on the transaction.  It seems wrong and contrary to principle that these two men should both be treated equally.</P>
    <P>I accept that from the Minister's point of view and from the point of view of the tax gatherers it is much easier to deal with it in this way.  It is much simpler to say that all taxable gains should be taxed at the same rate. It causes less problem for those raising the money.  But more interest should be <Col N="259" /> taken in the result on those who pay.  It was suggested by Fianna Fáil speakers in the Dáil that a relatively simple method of dealing with that would be to have a sliding scale, a maximum for gains after a few months or a year, gradually lowering until after 15 years this would disappear altogether.  The answer was given, if answer is the word, that a speculator could evade tax altogether by waiting 15 years.  I do not think the type of speculator we are after is likely to do this.  The old lady who has a field that she might sell for building could well wait, but one doubts very much if the sort of fly-by-night speculator the Minister has in mind would be prepared to wait such a long, long period in order to avoid tax.  Even if a few fish got away from the net, it would seem to be worth it in order to avoid long-standing family businesses built up over the years being mulcted to this excessive extent.</P>
    <P>The problem with the overall imposition of a 26 per cent rate is that, in searching for some sort of principle of redistribution of wealth and so on, you are running the risk of still further damping the forces of private enterprise. You are running the risk that energetic people who wish to build up or increase the value of their businesses by their own hard work will have no incentive to do this because of the existence of taxes such as this.  The most serious single problem presented by this Bill is the built-in problem of inflation. I know the Minister has said that this will be dealt with, and he repeated this again in his introductory speech today when he said in relation to the draft Bill:</P>
    <P>I intend to maintain its fairness and reasonableness by appropriate adjustments to the thresholds from time to time which would cater for inflation.  These will be in addition to the built-in allowance which has been made for it by the application of the lowest rate of income taxation to capital gains.</P>
    <P>That is a point I simply do not understand. I cannot see how you can possibly cater for the effect of inflation by imposing a single rate of 26 per cent. <Col N="260" /> If you were to say: &ldquo;All right, 26 per cent this year, 20 per cent next year and 15 the year after&rdquo;, I could understand it, but for the Minister to say he is catering for inflation by imposing any particular rate on these transactions does not make sense.  However, the problem with promises such as the Minister's are that only too often Ministers who, no doubt, have excellent intentions at the start, find themselves unable to carry them out. For example, the Minister said in his budget of May, 1973, that he proposed from then on to keep income tax allowances in line with the cost of living. I have no doubt he wished to do this and I have no doubt he would still wish to do this, but he has not done it. In the budget of January last and the Finance Bill which we passed through the House last May, the increase in allowances for this present financial year was approximately 15 per cent as against a cost-of-living increase of 25 per cent.  In the budget of next January or whenever it comes, allowing for likely movements in the cost of living in order to bring back the allowances to the equivalent level in money terms of May, 1973, the Minister would require to give improvements in income tax allowances of some 30 per cent or more. We all know he will not be in a position to do this.  It would be enormously expensive and I am absolutely certain the Minister even now realises he will not be able to bring back income tax allowances ever again to the level of May, 1973.  So much for such promises.</P>
    <P>On the introduction of the Capital Gains Tax Bill in the Dáil he said at column 1265, Volume 277, of the Official Report of 29th January last, on this problem of inflation:</P>
    <P>I have said on numerous occasions and I repeated it in introducing the Second Stage of the Bill, and I am now saying it again, that it is my intention to adjust the various thresholds in the capital gains tax system so as to take account of inflation.</P>
    <P>I gave very earnest consideration to the possibility of building a regulator or indicator into the Bill itself which would be automatic.  The great difficulty is that various assets which come to be taxed here have different <Col N="261" /> rates of inflation.  Their values vary for a multitude of different reasons. Some can vary in value because of the customary over-emotional reaction of the stock exchanges.  Other can vary in value at rates quite different from the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>Taking the second point first, this of course is correct, but you cannot deal with that situation by not making any effort at all to deal with the problem of the fall in the value of money.  I would have thought that one simple index the Minister could use is the price index. Over the years it would mean that some people would gain because their particular assets would have increased more rapidly than the price index.  On the other hand, others would lose because their assets had increased less than the price index.  But overall it would probably work out evenly enough and would be reasonably representative of falls in the value of money.</P>
    <P>However, that apart, the Minister did, as I said, give a very definite promise: &ldquo;I have said it on numerous occasions and I repeat again that it is my intention....&rdquo; This sounds fine if only one does not remember that in this Bill the Minister has already broken this promise. The base date for the assessment of capital gains is 6th April, 1974.  By the middle of this month some 15 months will have passed since then.  The fall in the value of money in that period will have been very nearly 30 per cent and no allowance is made for this in the Bill.  Already you have had a fall in the value of money of 30 per cent not in any way considered by the Minister or allowed for by the Minister in spite of this most categorical statement of his in the introduction of the Bill in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I am afraid we would be innocent in the extreme to assume that inflation will be provided for to any adequate extent in future years.  There has been a rise since 1950 of some 350 per cent in prices.  It is highly probable that in the next 25 years the price rises will be very considerably more than this.  One suspects with some horror that it is more likely to be in the region of 1,000 per cent than 350 per cent.  It is clear that as a result of this type of inflation, even though one hopes the rate will fall <Col N="262" /> onsiderably in future years belo w what it is at present, over a period of ten or 15 years the value of assets increases enormously in money terms while the value to the owner of the asset may increase relatively little.  Yet this blanket 26 per cent, or whatever the figure may be in future years, is levied on all this. An asset that was worth, say, £10,000 on 6th April, 1974, is now worth, on average, around £13,000, so that under this Bill £780 falls to be paid in a case of this kind by the taxpayer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned I was speaking about the built-in problem in this Bill of the process of inflation.  This is particularly important when one remembers that if one has an inflation rate of, say, 20 per cent, in four years the price is doubled.  This means that on average everything that is sold and is liable therefore to capital gains tax has doubled in price and that, automatically, people become liable to very large elements of capital gains tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has promised to deal with this to keep abreast of the rate of inflation in the provisions of this legislation but already he has failed to live up to this promise in that this Bill makes no allowance for the fact that since April of last year, when the valuing of assets begins for the purpose of this legislation, although the fall in the value of money has been around 30 per cent there is no allowance of any kind made for this.  Already the promises made have not been kept. One can only assume, both from this experience and past experience with <Col N="263" /> income tax allowances, that Ministers will as a matter of practice not find it possible to keep abreast of the inflationary process.  Therefore it seems unfair to the taxpayer that he should be taxed on notional profits on sales of assets which in many cases are not real profits at all.  There could be a situation where an asset was sold for a real amount which was less than was spent on buying it and yet there could be a considerable amount of tax at 26 per cent payable to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment briefly on the problem of compulsory acquisition. The Bill provides that where property is acquired compulsorily the owner is liable to pay tax at 26 per cent.  It seems outrageous that where one has a fixed property, be it a house or land but does not wish to sell it, the local authority are enabled to buy it against one's wishes.  It seems unfair that, when it has been bought under these circumstances, tax has to be paid at 26 per cent.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which ought to be dealt with in the Bill.  I can see that to exclude compulsory acquisition from the Bill could lead to other problems. Obviously those negotiating with local authorities or with public authorities of any kind would be inclined to refuse to sell land and would be determined to wait until the process of compulsory acquisition was carried through if they were to pay tax in the one case and not in the other.  But some kind of an adjustment could and ought to be made to provide for the case where an unwilling owner was forced to sell his land.  The fact that there are difficulties involved in a matter such as this is not sufficient to prevent the Minister from taking any action in the matter.</P>
    <P>It is all right to say at this stage that we are in favour of the general principle in this Bill, whatever problems we may have with regard to certain details.  The difficulty is that there are many other far more important matters which we should be discussing.  There are far more important problems facing the Government and we can only wish that it was legislation dealing with these matters we were discussing and not this <Col N="264" /> Bill, which is quite irrelevant to the present needs of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept that this Bill is one of a package of three capital taxation Bills which are on the stocks to replace death duties and we must look at the question of some legislative taxation measures being necessary to replace the revenue which came from death duties.  The figure that accrued annually from death duties was in the region of £12 million to £15 million and it behoves us to look for some source from which to replace that amount.  This Bill will prove less contentious than the Wealth Tax Bill.  To that extent it is gratifying to see that it is being welcomed on the opposite side of the House, as indeed it has been welcomed outside this House by various bodies.  Both the IFA and the Confederation of Irish Industries have accepted it in principle, although disagreeing with certain details of it.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that, to replace the revenue which accrued from death duties, something in addition to the wealth tax is necessary.  The wealth tax provisions are applicable at assessment dates each year.  As there can be a certain change in capital between assessment dates in the buying and selling of properties and so on, it is necessary to have some legislative measures which would take account of the revenues accruing from such buying and selling transactions.</P>
      <P>There has been comment from the opposite side of the House that the Bill might stifle enterprise.  I find that a bit difficult to imagine, especially when we see that the biggest capitalist country in the world, the USA, has for long had capital gains tax.  We know also that the great majority, if not all, of the EEC countries have capital gains tax.  As long as Ireland keeps its rate of tax at par with or below&mdash;which I think is the case in certain instances&mdash;the rate of capital tax in those other countries, I do not think it will harm in any sense free enterprise and the activities of <i>entrepreneurs.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an inflationary element which must be taken into consideration in this wealth tax legislation.  The <Col N="265" /> Minister has intimated that this inflationary element will be considered every two to three years.  He has indicated that the thresholds would be subject to review in 1977 and that that review would take into account inflation in the meantime.  An indication on those lines would be welcome in regard to capital gains tax because the effect of inflation on property values, making its real value a different matter from its nominal money value even over a short term because of the present inflationary tendencies in the world, is something which has caused reservations. I would look forward to the Minister perhaps giving us some indication that he would at least review the thresholds and so on in the capital gains tax legislation within the same period of time as in the case of the wealth tax.</P>
    <P>Apart from the necessity to bring revenues into the Exchequer as a result of the abolition of death duties, we must look at capital gains tax from the viewpoint of its being equitable and being a social measure which has been long warranted.  Taxation has as one of its principles that a person shall pay to the best of his ability towards the running of the country.  Unfortunately, it is income tax which has very largely borne the burden in this regard.  Wealth creates wealth, they say.  For a long time in this country we have seen people accumulating wealth through speculative ventures, perhaps by buying and selling properties over a short term or a long term and being able to evade taxation.  There is a call under the heading of equity to put a tax on capital accumulation and capital wealth.  From that point of view this legislation is warranted.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the ordinary income taxpayer has for long seen evidence of people making considerable fortunes almost overnight.  There is no question but that such speculative ventures should be subject to taxation. The point has been made&mdash;and I accept that there is some justification for it&mdash;that a different rate should apply that there should be a distinction between short-term and long-term capital undertakings.  But, by and large, the legislation has been warranted in the light of experience and I cannot see <Col N="266" /> it impeding in any way any <i>entrepreneur</i> undertaking investment in this country.</P>
    <P>These three taxation measures coming before us at the one time have created a certain confusion in the minds of the public, particularly in the minds of the people who consider that they might be affected by them.  My own experience of spelling out the details of the Wealth Tax Bill has been that people are not fully aware of its details, and in regard to the Capital Gains Tax Bill they may not be fully aware of the exemptions included in the legislation.  If this Bill goes through this House as quickly as the Second Stage debate today it would seem to indicate that it will be in operation within a very short period and then we can move ahead to the more contentious Wealth Tax Bill.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to attempt to discuss each of these Bills in isolation from the other. As the Minister has said, they are all part of the same package replacing the revenues that accrued from death duties. When the unease in regard to these Bills has been allayed, I think it will be found they are not as fearsome as they may seem at this stage.  It is impossible to indicate what revenue will accrue from them but that question is only secondary to the equitable and the social aspects of the legislation.  All Governments have accepted commitment to have a more even and equitable distribution of wealth.  This is a demand which has come from the public and from practically every democratic country. These legislative measures are part and parcel of the effort by this Government to bring that about.</P>
    <P>Certainly anybody who expects to be taxed, when up to now he was able to avoid taxation or was exempt from taxation, will be dissatisfied with these measures.  But when fully explained and when fully read into I think any such dissatisfaction should disappear.  The year 1975 will be a very notable year in the history of legislation here, the year in which there was a very commendable bid to bring about that more equitable distribution of wealth I referred to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill and the principle behind it and commend the Minister for Finance and the Government for bringing it in. <Col N="267" /> There are probably some problems of detail about the Bill, but in broad principle I support it.  I have supported for as long as I have been in this House, any measure of this kind.  In the debate on the Finance Bill in 1970 this whole question was brought up by me, as reported at column 1197 of the Official Report for July 28th, where I said that:</P>
      <P>The whole question of capital gains should be examined.  As long ago as 1962 a proposal in favour of a capital gains tax was put forward by a Minister of the Fianna Fáil Party who was not then Minister for Finance, to the then Minister for Finance.  There may have been some reasons, political as well as economic, for crushing the proposal.  The fact remains that there are very few people in this country who would now object to at least a limited capital gains tax.</P>
      <P>We have come a considerable distance in the five years since 1970, both in terms of the general acceptability of the idea of a capital gains tax and indeed of the scope to which a capital gains tax should be applied.  There has always been one objection to a capital gains tax and it is often one which tends to be made by Government Ministers in a tight corner, that is, that the vast majority of people would object to it.</P>
      <P>I think that the vast majority of the people here would not object to a capital gains tax because the vast majority of them have nothing to fear from a capital gains tax but have everything to gain from a capital gains tax, maybe not as much as I would like them to gain but at least they would have something to gain.  If I were lucky enough to be in a category caught by the provisions of this Bill, in terms of liability to pay capital taxation, I would count myself a very privileged person and would be glad to pay my tax, subject to whatever avoidance measures might be sanctioned by Senator FitzGerald and his colleagues with a heart and a half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the features of a capital gains tax outlined by the Minister in his early statement was its relationship to income tax avoidance generally and to evasion. <Col N="268" /> I do not believe the Minister specifically mentioned evasion but to my mind it is even more relevant than the question of avoidance.  The Minister in his statement suggested that capital gains tax was a good and valuable way of dealing with the problem of tax avoidance.  Tax avoidance, as we all know and as Senator FitzGerald has never ceased to remind us, is perfectly legal.  It is a legislative and fiscal oddity in a way, and we should be attempting to devise a number of legal instruments which, if they do not catch people in one direction, will catch them in another.  Part of the experience of the Revenue Commissioners, I imagine, is that people who are extremely wealthy and who make enormous capital gains, and their advisers, are usually one to two jumps ahead of the Revenue Commissioners in terms of finding loopholes in the laws that are drafted by them, discussed in Parliament and passed very often after a lengthy delay and long after their initial provisions were first known.</P>
    <P>I should be inclined to put the problem of tax avoidance on one level but the problem of tax evasion on another because if there is one thing, hopefully, that a capital gains tax will do, it will catch some of the considerable amount of tax evasion which goes on here today. I can do no more than point to the speech made by another member of this House, Senator Mullen, in Cork yesterday about tax evasion.  The strictures he made on that occasion about the extent and the degree of that practice were justified.  They represent a trend of which nobody, least of all its practitioners, can be proud.</P>
    <P>The other main matter to which I would like to address myself at this stage of the debate is the argument that a capital gains tax will in some way lead to a lessening of public confidence, to a lessening in the amount of resources available for productive investment. Superficially, this is true.  It is quite possible that, if this Bill is passed and if the tax begins to operate even at the very low rate at which it is set at the moment, certain people may be discouraged from coming here and that certain other people who are here may be encouraged to leave because they feel that their personal wealth or their <Col N="269" /> capital gains stand in some danger of being milked by this very modest tax.</P>
    <P>I would suspect that quite a few of these people are those whose real contribution to the economy of the country is marginal.  I would suspect that, in so far as capital gains and more especially the grosser type of capital gains tend to come from speculative investment, they tend also to return to speculative investment.  In other words, money which is made by speculation will go back into speculation.  It is a source of investment which adds very little if anything to the real wealth of the country.  It adds very little if anything to the employment potential in the country.  It adds very little if anything to the sort of resources we need if we are to protect and develop the position of a country which is in a singularly vulnerable economic position.</P>
    <P>It is almost extraordinary, when one thinks of some of the objections to the capital gains tax, to remember that we already have a value-added tax.  A value-added, tax is a tax on value which has been added to items by productive work.  If there is a justification for a tax which is added to material, the value of which has been increased by productive work, how much more justification is there for a tax which addresses itself to an increase in value which may not have been due to any productive work, may not have been due to any work at all, but simply may be related to inflation, to speculation or to undesirable practices of that kind.</P>
    <P>I maintain strongly that there is no need for any serious lack of confidence, any serious flight of capital from the country, after the passing of legislation such as this.  It may be true that it will happen to a certain extent, but it will be much more superficial than is generally supposed.  It will be, at least in some cases, in respect of persons and institutions whom the country can do as well without as with.</P>
    <P>I should like to make the counter argument that there is a much deeper and more fundamental relationship between resources and confidence to which this Bill addresses itself.  It is not the general one that has been described in the terms I referred to.  The fundamental <Col N="270" /> relationship between confidence and resources in the kind of society in which we and many others live is that nobody who has resources has any trust or any confidence in anybody who has not.  In other words, we tend to run society very much on the principle that, &ldquo;To him that hath shall be given and from him that hath not even the little which he hath shall be taken away&rdquo;.  It is as plain as the nose on our collective face that anybody who wants to go looking for money for investment, for capital, his prime qualification must be, certainly where most of the financial and lending institutions are concerned, that he must already have capital.  The system is loaded enormously against people who do not come in on the first or second floor.  The people on the ground floor are completely cut out. They have no access to capital, and the more their situation disimproves the less chance they have of any access to capital, irrespective of their personal merit, their sense of initiative, their sense of involvement or their willingness to work for their community.</P>
    <P>I am all in favour of a piece of legislation like this and of a tax like this, which will cream off the capital gains made by people who, generally speaking, in order to have made these gains, were already fairly wealthy and hopefully to put the money created by that taxation to more productive use than these people themselves would ever have been prepared to put it.  I am not saying that all people who make capital gains are sharpers and speculators, of course, this is not true.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency for money to seek safe havens and when one gets the combination of a safe haven and a high growth rate one will find an investment system which discriminates enormously against the smaller business, the person who has less capital to start off with, the person who has, perhaps, the greatest possibility of growth.  That is the kind of climate in which one also finds the greatest recourse to easy capital gains. I am thoroughly in favour of this tax. I believe that the rate, unfortunately, is low.  I hope that, if it is going to be revised, it will be revised upwards rather than downwards and I commend the Minister for bringing it before us.</P>

      <P>I support this Bill.  It is necessary because the Government removed death duties, as they had promised to do.  They made this promise to the people because it was generally accepted that death duties were unfair, particularly at a time when people were least able to bear this type of tax.  Now that death duties have been removed it is only fair, as has been pointed out, that some other sort of tax should be imposed in place of this in order to keep necessary finances flowing to the State.</P>
      <P>This capital gains tax has been accepted by the people as a fair tax. When people make a capital gain over a short period it is only right and proper that they should pay a fair share of this tax to the State.  Considering that workers at all levels have to pay taxes on their work and on their business, it is only right that people who make gains in this way should have to pay tax.</P>
      <P>At the same time it is no harm to point out that wealth tax in general, whether it be capital gains tax or under any other heading, ought not to be any higher here than in other countries. We are an undeveloped nation.  We need many more jobs, not alone jobs for the people who are becoming redundant in industry.  The unfortunate conditions that obtained over the years were that in order to solve our unemployment problem people only had to get on the boats and seek employment elsewhere. It is fortunate for us that those conditions no longer apply because employment is not readily available outside this country.  If we are to live up to our responsibilities and provide work for our own people in the long run it will be for the betterment of this country.  The more people employed here, the better for everybody.  It is unfortunate, in a sense, that we had such an easy way out over the years.  We need huge amounts of capital injected into our economy in order to provide the employment that will be necessary in the future, not alone for the redundant but for the increased population that we will, hopefully, have working here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to do that we ought to have a favourable rate of tax that will induce people to invest capital here.  There is no use in being sentimental and saying people will invest money in Ireland just <Col N="272" /> because they happen to be third, fourth or tenth generation Irishmen or because they like the country or because they like the colour of our hair or the brightness of our eyes.  They will not do that.  People will invest if they believe they will get a fair return or a better return than they might get elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Those are the facts of life we have to face.  I have no particular interest in making the tax rate favourable for the people who own the capital.  But I have an interest in making the rate of tax favourable in order that capital will be induced into the country to provide work for the betterment of our people.</P>
    <P>We have had in many places criticism of privately-run industry, and I am sure there is plenty of room for criticism. But, by and large, private industry tends to be run more efficiently than State-run industry.  It is necessary to have State participation in many of our industries, particularly in the service industries, but it is debatable whether it would be to the benefit of this country or of the workers that there should be large-scale State participation in ordinary industry here.</P>
    <P>It would be more acceptable if it were possible to have worker participation and worker ownership in industry.  It is one thing to be earning a certain wage, or salary, and spending all of this upon the ordinary necessities of life or the little luxuries of life we believe we are entitled to.  There should be a more favourable attitude taken towards workers if they were in a position to reinvest some of their earnings in industry in the firms in which they are working.  It would have the advantage of general ownership and private ownership. It would mean that their participation in industry would become greater year by year.  This would be a healthy arrangement if we could bring it about. If it could be managed that money earned by people in industry be reinvested in industry in order to maintain and increase employment, and could be treated in a more favourable way in regard to tax, it would be good for the country in general.  This is the situation that would be more acceptable to the people.  It would be better than State ownership or private ownership in the sense that the latter is often <Col N="273" /> referred to as capitalist industry and has its disadvantages.  We ought to gear our taxation to encouraging people to invest in industry and to encourage capital from outside to be invested here to everybody's advantage.</P>
    <P>We will need a greater amount of capital in the future.  If the opportunities were made favourable people would be prepared to take a greater interest in the ownership and in the running of those industries.</P>
    <P>This measure is to be welcomed.  It is a step in the right direction provided we, and the Government, consider the need to allow that there be an incentive to people to invest in industry here so that we may continue to have growing employment.</P>

      <P>I thought the real juicy piece occurred when Senator Markey, my neighbour, was speaking but there was better to come when my learned friend, Senator Horgan, spoke. I listened with great interest to Senator Whyte, who was more rational and better balanced if I were to judge.  I am a pretender to be a judge and pretenders in recent history have gone places.  I was amused when I heard Senator Markey speaking about workers and the inducement to creating wealth while everything around is falling down around their feet.  He knows better than I because he comes from an industrial county.  He knows that quite often people of his age group, who are physically fit and capable of work, are idle.  They find it much more remunerative to be idle or on a three-day week.</P>
      <P>Senator Horgan quoted from a speech that was made some time ago but I do not think that will convince anybody.  He went on to say that he would welcome the tax collector.  This is the guy with no manners, modesty, scruples or discretion.  It is a pity Senator Horgan has because he is a very intelligent fellow and very enlightened, I am sure.  Notwithstanding his ability to put his speech over in a dignified way, much more than I could ever hope to do, he has not convinced me that his philosophy and his way of thinking are the best for the Irish people.</P>

      <P>The question of the introduction of a capital gains tax as part of the total packet to bring about an equitable taxation system is a great source of joy to the people who were burdened by direct taxation, PAYE and the system that obtained before it. Whether we like it or not they were the people who were carrying the load.  It is a great day for those people.  As a worker I am one of those people and I am speaking for the bulk of the working-class people who were carrying a tremendous burden of taxation through this direct means.</P>
      <P>Most workers would agree that it is a source of joy to think that there is a Minister who has the courage to introduce a package of this nature. This is merely one aspect of the package which will see that the term &ldquo;equitable&rdquo; is properly applied to the community as a whole.</P>
      <P>We have a Minister who listened to the pleadings of the various organised groups and who came to terms with regard to who was paying tax and who was avoiding tax.  As a result of that exercise the Minister found it possible, and desirable, to introduce a package of taxation that demonstrates to the nation that this Government are prepared to stand up and be counted on the question of treating all the people equally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be wrong to say that this was the beginning and end of all of our ills with regard to taxation.  It would also be incorrect for me to say that all of the answers have been provided in this Bill, or even in the package.  This is our first venture into taxes of this nature even though they have been working in many of the highly-industrialised societies of the world for some years, particularly the United States.  Even though it is not going to solve all the problems&mdash;it may make some of the problems less acute&mdash;it is the beginning of a process that will inevitably lead to a <Col N="276" /> more equitable application of the system of taxation.  It does not matter whether one calls it acquisition tax, wealth tax, turnover tax or direct tax, it is an endeavour to demonstrate to the public that at last we have a Minister who has the courage to produce a package which will help the people who for years have been burdened with taxation on an inequitable basis.</P>
    <P>Going back to the time when it was necessary for the then Government to consider the introduction of the turnover tax, one can see the inequities in that tax.  It was only 2½ per cent in the initial stages.  In regard to a person earning £10 a week, in addition to paying his ordinary taxes, turnover tax took about 5s. out of that person's £10. If one took 5s. out of a person's earnings of £10 a week and took 50s. out of a person's earnings of £100 a week, the person who lost the 5s. was not being treated equitably; he was being discriminated against.  Everyone will agree that we are now heading in the right direction with this taxation.</P>
    <P>A great feature is&mdash;I must give credit to the Opposition in this case&mdash;is that they have acknowledged by their contributions that there is no reason why people who are earning the kind of money mentioned in the Bill should not be assessable for tax.  I share their criticisms to an extent.  While I would prefer a socialist society eventually to evolve&mdash;I do not say that in a doctrinair way&mdash;inevitably we will probably finish up with a mixed economy.  This would be the end of the road and we are heading in that direction.  I agree with the Opposition that so far we are living in a capitalist society and we must live up to the realities of that society.  We must face up to the problems that present and deal with the circumstances in which we find ourselves in that society.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Opposition that when we are looking at taxation systems we should see what effect it would have on the initiative and energy of many people who are involved in trying to help society develop and grow.  While I might be in conflict with many of the systems of our society, I realise that one can live in conflict and, at the same time, co-operate with the systems <Col N="277" /> necessary to take society along the correct road until sufficient people have decided that society should be changed.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Opposition that the problems in our society, the run down of promises and so on, must be taken into consideration when thinking about taxation.  There has been a fair measure of consideration in respect of those things in the Bill.  Senator Eoin Ryan said, it is an argument of detail rather than an argument of principle.  In that respect I agree that there is probably room for argument in the sense of bringing in some detail.</P>
    <P>The question of long-and short-term taxation was mentioned.  This is our first venture into this type of taxation. It has had a hard time in the other House and rightly so because of the nature of the new tax and the type of society we live in.  People are entitled to make their points of view known and to be given ample opportunity to express them.  In the final analysis nobody has claimed that this is the most sophisticated way of collecting taxes. The Minister has admitted that it may be necessary to have a look at some aspects not only of this Bill but of all the Bills that go to make up the package. As a consequence it may be necessary, and desirable to introduce some changes in the future.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the workers can say they have moved away from the position where they themselves, even though they were the biggest group of organised people in society, were the people who were mostly burdened, not only because of the amounts they pay but because of the circumstances in which they had to pay it and the means by which they paid it such as turnover tax and so on. This type of Bill brings us away from that kind of thing.  This is a welcome development.  As I said earlier on, it is not the end of all of our problems but it gives satisfaction to the people who for years have been shouldering the weight of the nation's taxation problem. This is a clear indication to them that the Government of the day are prepared to see not only that people get rights but that they also live up to their obligations.  I welcome the Bill and admire the Minister for his courage in bringing it in, and I look forward to <Col N="278" /> seeing the other two parts of this package being implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a few brief remarks.  Most of the points I wanted to make have already been made, some of them by the Senators in the opposite benches.  In the great welter of discussion that has taken place in the other House the original purpose of this Bill and of the two concomitant Bills, the Wealth Tax Bill and the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill, tends to be forgotten.  When the National Coalition went before the country some two-and-a-half years ago on the 14-point programme, they stated categorically that it was their intention to remove estate duties, legacy duties and succession duties.  In order to do that alternative tax would have to be found.</P>
      <P>This is probably the most acceptable of the three Bills which the Minister is slowly but surely piloting through the Oireachtas.  Judging from the remarks made on all sides, it is fair to say that the Bill is generally acceptable in principle.  In fact I think these are the words with which Senator Eoin Ryan opened his remarks this morning.  Apart from detailed criticisms, some of which I will advert to myself in a moment or two, Senators generally accept the fact that profits made from capital gains, whether fortuitous profits, because perhaps of inflation or because somebody was lucky enough to buy a parcel of land on the outskirts of a growing urban area or because&mdash;and this is the most likely&mdash;a man or men have worked hard all their lives and have added value to their assets, whether a farm or business, and in the latter end of their days have decided to dispose of this, if not to a member of their own family possibly to a nephew or niece or perhaps even a friend's son or daughter.</P>
      <P>It is only right and proper that we should bring our taxation system into conformity with those of our partners in the EEC.  In this case we are not only doing that, but we are also putting ourselves on a par with what might be described as the last bastion of capitalism; the United States, in introducing capital gains tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some criticism has been made of the percentage of tax, that 26 per cent is <Col N="279" /> too low.  This is a criticism that has been made both in this and the other House and outside both Houses.  It would be a grave mistake if the Minister were to increase the rate of 26 per cent, for several reasons, reasons which I hope will be regarded as practical and sensible.  We require in this country and will require for many years to come outside capital to provide industrial and commercial employment and to help in the expansion of our country's assets. That is a fact of life.  It would be nice to think that we could generate inside this country sufficient punts to develop the country economically and to provide all the required employment for people at present unemployed and for school-leavers coming out each year. We cannot do that.  That has been accepted on all sides of the House and all sides of the other House.</P>
    <P>Therefore we must continue to be an attractive country for the investment of outside capital.  I am not suggesting that we should welcome all capital.  There are undesirable capital developments which I think we should eschew.  But, generally speaking, industrial and commercial employment, development of agriculture and ancillary industries, is something that should be welcomed. To do that I think for many years to come it would be wise and sensible of us to have the edge in regard to our capital and other taxes.  I believe the Minister had this very much in mind. After all, we are only a few points below the British rate of capital gains tax at 30 per cent.  We should try to maintain, certainly for some years to come, that differential.  We should be seen to encourage outside capital by indications, we are not going to take action that will result in endangering their capital investment, that we are a country that welcomes outside capital and gives it a fair deal.</P>
    <P>The Bill should have certain objectives. Reading through the Bill, I believe it has succeeded in so doing. The first is to bring the capital gains within the general taxation system.  This has been a bone of contention for many years.  Senator Harte has referred to the fact that the workers have carried more than a fair burden.  More than <Col N="280" /> the workers have carried more than a fair burden.  The farmer, the small shopkeeper, the tradesman, the men working in offices, have all had to pay their share of taxation down through the years.  It has been a point of irritation, to say the least of it, that people who have been accused of making substantial profits more or less overnight have up to now escaped their fair share of taxation. This state of affairs will now be eliminated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Secondly, and a point I want to dwell on for a few moments, there is the intention in the Bill to encourage owners of assets getting on in years to dispose of those primarily and desirably to members of their own family, if possible, if not to dispose of them to others, younger men or women with the necessary drive and initiative and ambition to get on in life and make better use of these assets.  I would suggest that the figure of £50,000 which the Minister has included in the Bill is too low.  Early consideration should be given to increasing that figure.  It might be better also, instead of naming a figure, to base the capital taxation on the profit actually accruing, the capital gain, with an exemption of £10,000 or £15,000 as the case may be.  A man selling his property would know beforehand that at least it would be free of a certain measure of capital taxation.  It may not commend itself to the Minister but at least it has the merit of encouraging ageing owners to part with viable assets of which younger men with more drive and initiative could make better use.</P>
    <P>Some play has been made about a differential capital gains tax.  It has been suggested that the man who makes what might be called a swift buck should be taxed at a higher rate than the man who holds on to an asset for five, ten or 15 years.  In theory that has a lot to commend it.  In practice, I am wondering how it would work out.  It has been suggested that if an asset is sold within, say, 12 months it will carry a higher rate of capital gains tax like, 40 per cent or 45 per cent, gradually reducing over a period of years.  I do not think that can stand up to close examination.  Why should time be the sole judge of whether a profit is a <Col N="281" /> speculative profit or a profit taken because the man is prepared to take a risk, which is successful, perhaps, and gains him a generous reward, and at the same time brings benefit to the community in which he is resident?</P>
    <P>It is possible that over a period of longer than one year a person could make far greater speculative profit. For instance, if a man buys land on the outskirts of a growing urban area, holds on to it for five years and sells it at a very substantial profit.  In fact, by the mere length of time he would have qualified for getting a lower rate of capital gains tax, where in principle his type of profit would be the one which proposals for a graduated or differential tax would try to get at.  However, a flat rate of tax is probably the best one, and when this Bill becomes an Act and has been in operation for some years and the Minister has had an opportunity of looking at the outturn of the capital gains tax, there may be a case for introducing a differential or graduated system of taxation.</P>
    <P>There is not sufficient evidence to indicate what is a grossly speculative profit and what is a genuine profit.  The man who by his own endeavour and hard work and by denying himself some of the joys of life, by reinvesting his income, is entitled to get the best possible price for his asset.  He has added to his assets.  Every encouragement should be given to owners to hand over their property, be it a farm or a business or a factory, in the best possible condition.  They should not be discouraged from spending money by any penal clause in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to ensure that productive assets are exempted from penal or any taxation.  We must rely to an increasing extent on the investment of capital in new machinery and the replacement of out-of-date machinery.  It is even more necessary that we remain competitive and are efficient and enterprising now that we are members of the EEC.  These three desirable objectives would add up to wealth.  Whatever criticism may be levied at the accummulation of wealth I know no method by which a fair distribution of wealth can be brought about unless the wealth is there to be distributed.  It should be a simple <Col N="282" /> equation to say that the bigger the cake the better.  We should do everything possible in our taxation system to ensure that the enterprising section of our community, whether farmers or businessmen, workers or tradesmen, are given the best possible incentive to get on with the job, to earn a good profit and to pay a fair degree of taxation. That is the ideal to be aimed at.  If this Bill and the other Bills do that, they will achieve their objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like other Senators, welcome this Bill.  If we look on the circumstances of the people as a whole, their general application to the production of wealth either by the work of their hands or return on investment, I think we will come to the conclusion that for the promotion of the betterment of the people we must have a method of taxation which will bear evenly on everybody.  It is not just that the man or woman who invests in the skill or work of their hands should pay tax on their income, while people who, because they have vast financial resources, have control of the means of investment, are acquainted with the goings on in various parts of the world, and can manipulate certain investments to enhance their income by hundreds and thousands of pounds, escape the income tax net.</P>
      <P>We know that the transfer of investments from this country to other countries is not always in the best interest of the nation, but if there was not that freedom for the citizens and for the investor here, we might regret that people would be debarred from investing here.  For that reason it is only right that people should be allowed to invest their money abroad or at home as the opportunity presents itself to them, but it is only right that they should pay tax on the profits they make. It would be an injustice to the workers, the farmers, the professional or business people who are compelled to pay tax on what they earn if a foreign investor were to go scot-free.  That has been the situation for a long number of years. For that reason this Bill is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industrial production depends on the ability of the Government and of the Minister of Finance to infuse wealth into various industrial efforts.  It is to the <Col N="283" /> advantage of the nation if taxation that should have been collected and has not heretofore been collected should now be put at the disposal of the Department of Finance and at the disposal of the Government to enable grants and industrial support to be given to enterprises throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Several people have complained that this will impose a very serious injustice on a great section of the people. Whether that section is big or small, to my mind the tax imposed is fair relative to the tax imposed on other sections. But the fact remains that the only people who are complaining are those who believe they should either get off with everything, without paying the same as their neighbour, or those who are expanding in an inordinate way and investing extensive capital in lands, stocks, shares or other investments. They are not worthy of any pity because they are not prepared to meet the just obligation that the extensive property of which they are possessed imposes on them.</P>
    <P>The people of the country generally, in common with their representatives in this House, welcome this Bill.  They see in it an opportunity of providing a source of income which is much more acceptable, broadly speaking, than the extortion of death duties, which was one of the very serious burdens very often imposed on the widow and the orphan.  As a consequence of the death of a breadwinner or a parent the livelihood and future of a family were often threatened.  Thank God that day has gone.  We now have in its place a system of tax collection which will replace the amount raised under that objectionable system and which will not bear heavily on any family or individual. This is the principal reason why we should welcome this Bill.  I wish the Minister every success with it and commend him on its presentation and drafting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers, I welcome the principle of the Bill which is a principle in equity of taxation and also it is a step in replacing the death duties which had become an intolerable burden in recent years due to the impact of inflation.  Death duties <Col N="284" /> are a type of taxation that were unable to cope with inflation.  They have no built-in regulators to adjust for it and the exemption limits were not adjusted in accordance with decreasing values. From that point of view anything that would remove the grave threat that death duties posed to so many people is welcome.  What is really being introduced is some type of pay-as-you-live type of procedure which recoups some if not all of the contribution that death duties had made in the past to our taxation yields.</P>
      <P>The Bill as it stands is a rather complex one.  We welcome the principle and I think nobody can quarrel too seriously with the base used, that the taxation would be at the minimum rate of income tax, that is at 26 per cent, and, indeed, there is an alternative way of computation as well by treating it as income. However, while we cannot quarrel with that, there are many facets of the Bill that we would like to tease out and debate very closely on Committee Stage.  Unfortunately it looks at present as though we will be presented with our usual yearly dilemma in the Seanad of discussing Bills at a time when the Dáil has risen when there is no possibility of making real amendments or changes.  That is to be deplored. That is something which has happened at all times.  I do not think it should debar us from making a thorough analysis of the Bill on Committee Stage.  If we are in the dilemma that the Dáil has risen by the time we get to the Committee Stage of this Bill or some other Bills that may be coming, and if the Minister gives us certain assurances that in some amending Bills later our views will be incorporated or if Ministers would commit themselves to the desirability of certain changes arising out of Seanad discussions, then our discussions might be a little less unreal than they are likely to be in the present circumstances.</P>

      <P>That will give us more scope for investigating the present Bill, because for one thing it does seem that the United States approach of distinguishing between long-term gains and short-term speculation is a valuable one, that in the US where an asset has been held for a number of years there is a consequential reduction in the assessed capital gains on it.  That is worth while because it encourages the putting of capital to long-term productive projects. I do not think any of us would like to encourage the quick-kill, playing the stock exchange and selling shares within six months or a year or two years.  That is of little use to the economy.  It is a type of practice that always leads to instability.  It should be discouraged and penalised under capital gains whereas on the other hand gains that are realised after five or ten years as a result of the natural operation of business and development should be encouraged by every means possible. I hope that on Committee Stage we may be able to get down to that in detail.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that there is any real recognition of the inflation situation. How are capital gains calculated? There does not seem to be any commitment at present that the inflated cost of an article will be used as a base.  As an example, let us take a house bought, say, four years ago at £6,000.  The same house today would sell at at least £12,000.  Surely no one reckons that the person who bought a house for £6,000 12 years ago and sold it today for £12,000 had made a capital gain of £6,000.  It is merely the same asset so there should be provision for that type of adjustment.  Otherwise, it is getting perilously near to confiscation of capital assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all realise how much as a nation we are dependent on initiative, on investment, on development and so on. As the Taoiseach rightly pointed out in the Dáil recently, we are in a very competitive market for investment and if we cannot provide competitive conditions, then other countries will attract the investors.  We need these people. <Col N="286" /> Our development depends on them. Therefore, that should be a first priority. In all this package of capital taxation I would like to be assured that the Government are fully satisfied that any of the measures proposed are not likely to have adverse effects on our efforts to attract capital into our industry.  That goes for the private investor, too, because we are in a situation where we are anxious to encourage thrift.  We are anxious to encourage people, rather than spending all their salaries on expensive holidays or on other such luxuries, to save and that those savings be put to some productive work within the country.</P>
    <P>We must ensure attractive conditions for such investment and the main incentive we have for this is either that the person saving and investing in that way is working within a plan for his retirement.  We would need to make it worthwhile for him to deny himself at his productive stage so as to set up capital assets or income from capital assets that will be of value to him in his retirement.  That is one reason, but perhaps the greater incentive is that the person saving wishes to be in a position to leave something to his family.  Therefore, again we have to make that sort of saving more attractive than either lavishing it on the family at an earlier stage or squandering on day-to-day living.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, with the competition of inflation, we have reached the stage where each of us has to ask ourselves: &ldquo;What is the use in saving £500 or a £1,000 over any period of time because with the way inflation is going, how much will that be worth in ten years time in terms of money today?&rdquo;  That is a very dangerous philosophy.  It is a philosophy that undermines totally any appeal to savings.  At present when we, like many other countries, are forced to resort to such a dangerous level of foreign borrowing, borrowing that will have to be paid for eventually, the only way we can cut that down or keep it within some proportion, is to encourage our own people to save as much as possible.  Savings are at least as effective as borrowing, in fact more so, in providing the capital assets we need for our development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> I ask if the Government have given any thought, any leadership, or any exhortation to our people to save.  I do not think they have.  In all the crisis that has been the one note that has not been struck.  Yet, to my mind, it is the keynote. It is the one that can give us some cushion against the peril of the level of foreign borrowings we are forced to indulge in.  Appeals to save carry no weight today.  In the past one could see what money meant when a Post Office certificate would be worth £1.50 six years after its purchase.  That made some sense.  But anybody told that a £1 invested today will be worth £1.50 in six years would ask what the £1.50 will be worth in today's money.  One would have to tell them that it will brobably be worth 60p or 70p by then.  In other words, there is the prospect of a loss on savings.  This leads to the philosophy where one asks what is the point in saving?  with inflation rates as they are. Consequently, we reach a stage of squandermania.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give us leadership in this regard, to try to think of some imaginative programme that will encourage savings.  Savings are intimately involved with the right of the individual to pass on property, big or small, to his family.  What else are savings for?  You cannot take the money beyond the grave and all one can do is try to provide something for the family. It may be only being able to give them some help to acquire homes of their own but whatever it is, it is the incentive that is required.  Therefore, the present package of capital taxation has to be vetted very carefully.  One must ask whether it is encouraging savings or whether it will undermine the whole philosophy of savings.  I do not wish to pursue this much further, but to my mind it is the key issue and it is the one on which I cannot recall a speech from any Minister for the last two or three years.  I cannot recall any appeal for more savings.  There has been no imaginative savings campaign, no scheme or bonds being issued in the past two years.  Surely such a scheme is absolutely essential today when we are faced with a budget deficit of £240 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> Let us not be penny wise and pound foolish.  Let us not at this critical juncture in our history with inflation at such a dangerous level make the mistake, simply for the purpose of being doctrinaire and for tax equalisation of chasing after the doctrinaire and accepting the few pounds that those taxes will bring in while losing the millions that our people could be encouraged to save if they were given the proper incentives.  When I speak about people being encouraged to save, I am not speaking of millionaires.  I am speaking of the ordinary rank and file of our people at every level.  There should be room for savings.  Those are the savings that would close that budget gap, that would decrease our dependence on foreign borrowing and would keep the interest involved circulating within our community rather than having to pay it to the Arabs, the Europeans or to any other group.</P>
    <P>Most of the other comments I wish to make on this I would prefer to leave until Committee Stage, when we will have the benefit of being able to concentrate on the various sections of the Bill and have the benefit of an effective discussion with the Minister as the sections proceed.</P>
    <P>In principle I accept what is being offered in the package of Bills, especially in the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  For many years I have wondered why this had not come about.  It was in every other country.  I cannot understand why we delayed so long in bringing it in.  Now I am afraid that the fact we have not made a distinction between long-term gains as a result of activity, enterprise, and planned development over years, and short-term speculation is a great defect in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Seanad for the manner in which they have received this Bill.  I hope I will not be faulted in another place if I say with conviction that, if they had handled the Bill with similar dispatch and relevance, the Capital Gains Tax would have reached the Seanad weeks ago.  Nobody would have been more happy about that than the Minister.  I can well understand the sense of frustration that Senators experience about receiving the Bill at <Col N="289" /> this comparatively late hour with scarcely three weeks before the Dáil goes into the Summer recess.</P>
      <P>I said yesterday in the Dáil that the debate had been a useful one, that many improvements had been made in the Capital Gains Tax Bill in the course of discussion in the Dáil and that, as a Member of the Dáil for some 16 years, I was proud of the part which the Dáil, as a legislative organ, had played in the improvement of the Bill.  However, that did not take away from the validity of my criticism, which was to the effect that up to two-thirds of the time had been wasted in the Dáil on emotive, irrelevant, partisan and political contributions which did not touch the merits of the Capital Gains Tax Bill and which were not related to the principle of taxing capital gains.</P>
      <P>The Government were reluctant to bring in a time limit on discussions of the Wealth Tax Bill but we were concerned to bring to an end the long agony through which this country has been going because of the unnecessarily protracted discussion to which the Bills have been subjected.  If the debates in both Houses in future are relevant and on the merits of a particular section or amendment, I am certain that we will get through the legislation without untold difficulty, without any serious inconvenience and that the legislation will be discussed adequately.  Therefore, I am exhilarated by the manner in which the Seanad approached the Bill today because, apart from a few political comments for which I forgive the contributors, the debate has touched most of the time on the merits of taxing capital gains and on the particular merits or suspected limitations of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the record, so that Senators may know, I should like to point out that the Bill was circulated first on the 20th December, 1974, following the White Paper published on 28th February, 1974.  The only reason for the lapse of ten months between the publication of the White Paper and the publication of the Bill was because people and organisations were anxious to see me.  I have met innumerable deputations.  Then we had long consultations with technical experts, people who were qualified to speak in this field.  These consultations <Col N="290" /> went on from the beginning of March to September and immediately after that the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the parliamentary draftsman got down to preparation of the detailed particulars of the Bill.  We should congratulate the backroom boys, who are often criticised, for the speed at which they worked in a very complex area.</P>
    <P>Every country that has introduced capital gains tax legislation has acknowledged that capital gains legislation is probably the most complex of all legislation, because you are not dealing with established facts like income or the value of an asset on a particular date&mdash; you have to look at more than that.  It is a volatile field.  Values can change for a variety of different reasons and there are so many different business and human arrangements that have to be looked at in order to ensure an equitable tax and an ability to pay the tax.</P>
    <P>The very length of the Bill here is a reflection of the complexity of the code on the one hand and also of our desire to trim the capital gains code in this country to Irish circumstances, to Irish requirements, to meet the very kind of problems Senator Quinlan was worried about.  He, Senator Russell and others were anxious to ensure that the encouragement of investment would not be stifled and to ensure that reward, just reward, was not made to carry an unfair burden or sacrifice.  There are many provisions in this Bill which you will not find in any other capital gains code in the world.  This is because we went out of our way to trim it as best as we could to the circumstances of Ireland in 1975 and, as far as we could foresee it, towards the end of this century.</P>
    <P>We do not think for one moment that this Bill is the last word in capital gains legislation.  We expect that in the light of experience some hardships may come to light, some difficulties may be exposed, some new arrangements may be devised which are outside the contemplation of even the most brilliant tax consultant at present and these may have to be adjusted in the light of experience, and no doubt they will be adjusted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> There has been a very full discussion on this Bill.  It was circulated on 20th December last and debate in the Dáil was initiated on 14th January.  The Second Stage took two days in the Dáil, the Committee Stage took 12 days and the Report Stage three days.  There was a total of 17 days spent on it in the Dáil, or 98 hours.  That is as long a time as has been given to legislation I can think of.  There was no effort by the Government to curtail discussion.  We pleaded time and time again for the elimination of irrelevancies, because we do not believe that it helps to have tempers frayed by irrelevant and petulant political comment.  But perhaps all that now is behind us and I do not want to say any more about it.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan asked whether there was a possibility that any activity or transaction could be subjected to both income tax and capital gains tax. The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  We have specifically provided that there would not be any instance of double taxation. There are a number of transactions carried on by people which constitute business and which at present are subject to income tax.  A person whose activity is that of a property dealer ought under the existing code to be paying income tax.  Such a person if engaged as a property dealer would not be subjected to capital gains tax on such dealings which were liable to income tax.  But a person who is not engaged in the business of a property dealer can nevertheless make profits, sometimes substantial profits, on capital transactions which would not under the existing code be caught for income tax but which under the capital gains code will be subject to the capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan and a number of other Senators complained that there was no distinction drawn between short- and long-term gains.  The suggestion was put forward that a gain made in a short period was necessarily a speculative one and to some extent of less moral standing then one made over a long period and that a long-term gain was not at all of a speculative nature.  The truth is that the greater the wealth of a person, the longer the period that that person can afford to wait to make the <Col N="292" /> gain.  Some very substantial gains have been made free of tax in the past by people of considerable means, who, having ample current income, were able to postpone the making of a substantial gain for a long period, thereby increasing the amount of gain made.  It is very difficult to draw the line between what would be the appropriate break-off between short- and long-term gains.  Some countries have done it by exposing short-term gains to the full whack of income tax by providing that over two-, three- or five-year periods, gains on property acquired or disposed of within such a period would be subject to the full whack of income tax.</P>
    <P>There is one drawback in having a varying rate of capital gains tax.  If you vary the rate so that it declines with the passage of years, of ownership of the asset, people may remain locked into assets in order to realise greater gains and that may have undesirable social and economic consequences.  Of course one can in certain circumstances bring compulsory powers to operate where a purchase is required for housing or road-widening purposes, but those occasions are quite limited.  We think it is better to go for a low rate which because it is a low rate imposes hardship at no particular point and leaves people free to make their decisions regarding acquisition and disposal of assets without looking over their shoulders to make complicated tax calculations.</P>
    <P>Rather unique exemptions are those to exempt a principal private residence, no matter what its size; to exempt capital gains of up to £500 per annum; to exempt chattels worth up to £2,000; and to exempt assets which are wasting assets, those which have not got a lifespan of more than 50 years.  All these will eliminate many transactions and indeed many gains, although I would acknowledge that one of the reasons we removed them was because if we had brought them in we would also have had to allow losses as well; and you can image the complicated business of trying to calculate whether a loss or a gain was made from the sale of a motor car or its replacement by another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The reality is the work on the small transaction.  If you have a multitude of small transactions the cost of administration would probably equal and, maybe in some cases be greater than, the cost of recovery. Therefore, it is not worth it.  But we have recognised these things in the legislation and that is one of its merits.</P>
      <P>We have been faulted because we have no built-in regulation about inflation.  It was my personal anxiety, which I spoke of in public, that, before the legislation got through the detailed drafting stage, to build in a regulator for inflation.  The truth is that there is no measure for inflation in Ireland. First, so far as property is concerned, its value may vary for a multitude of reasons which have nothing whatsoever to do with inflation.  It can vary because of new economic or social demands or merely because of fashion.  There are some items in antique shops today that were thrown out in the not-so-distant past because they were regarded as worthless but which now are fetching a very high price indeed, a price which is related to fashion or to some passing whim rather than to intrinsic value. Therefore, it is very difficult to find a suitable index to assess property value and we have not even got a suitable index for income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken on a number of occasions&mdash;most recently during your luncheon break when I was speaking in the Dáil&mdash;and drawn attention to the imperfection of bringing in taxation on luxuries like alcohol and tobacco for the purpose of calculating income increases when society generally accepts that, if taxation is necessary in order <Col N="294" /> to compensate the poorer people in our midst, that taxation should go on the luxuries of life.  Yet we have pretended in this country that the CPI and every aspect of it was essential to the maintenance of living standards when in fact it is not.  However, I do not want to get too much into that particular field because I have spoken about the importance of being all the time relevant to the issue of capital gains.</P>
    <P>We have been faulted because we have not exempted gifts from capital gains tax.  As we acknowledged in our White Paper, we had hoped it would be possible not to subject gifts to capital gains tax and capital acquisition tax but our examination of the matter, in relation to our own situation and observing capital gains and gift legislation in other countries, led us to the conclusion that it would not be possible to grant this exemption without opening the avenue to very easy avoidance and evasion of tax.</P>
    <P>It is no harm, as I have closed off this loophole, to explain how it could so easily be done.  Instead of selling property any person could make a gift of that property to a relation at its market value.  The day after, the relation could sell that property at the same value and make a gift of the proceeds of sale back to the person who made the original gift.  It is so simple as to be laughable.  Every effort we made to devise some means of closing it off seemed to generate further possibilities of avoidance and evasion. There could also be arrangements made to exchange assets.  You give me what you have and I give you what I have, and we both make a gift to one another and in such a situation there could be no liability to tax.  It could also be arranged that the property could be held for some time by another person who could then give it to a third, or even a fourth, party before it went back to the original party.  Every time one tried to devise some way of closing off loopholes it was found that we were inviting the tax consultants to devise some scheme, for which they would be very well paid, in order to help the wealthier people to avoid the impact of taxation.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald asked if <Col N="295" /> the Government would consider amending the Wealth Tax Bill so as to postpone the date for the collection of wealth tax.  We have already extended by three months the date for payment of wealth tax and we do not consider that any further postponement could be justified in any circumstances.  Estate duties have been abolished since April of this year and that is a gigantic relief for a vast number of people.  Even people of very small means, the owner of even a semi-detached house in the Dublin suburbs, a motor car and a bit of furniture, would find himself subject to the payment of estate duties.  These estate duties have been abolished.  We said that wealth tax would be introduced simultaneously with the elimination of estate duty and the wealth tax will, therefore, be payable by next October.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances it is necessary to complete the wealth tax legislation before the Summer Recess.  That is on another Bill; it is not dealing with the Capital Gains Bill but as it was mentioned in this debate I wanted to make reference to it.  Nobody regrets more than the Minister for Finance that the Wealth Tax Bill is not already before the Seanad.  It has been debated now for over 60 hours in the Dáil and this will be the thirteenth day.  It is clear that it has been examined in great detail.  If the debate there can be kept relevant in the days ahead it will be possible, I am sure, for it to reach the Seanad before the end of July.  For many reasons, including my ministerial responsibilities and the problems of administration which face the Revenue Commissioners and the ordinary taxpayer, the sooner the Bill is got through the better.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald said that this tax would not disturb investment.  I may use his remarks in reply to Senator Ryan, and, I think, Senator Yeats, on the possibility of capital gains tax disturbing the climate of capital investment. Senator Quinlan had certain worries also that capital taxation might disturb capital investment.  But we have the advantage of being able to speak with hindsight.  We have seen that in other countries which have these taxes <Col N="296" /> such disturbances have not taken place. Some of the principal bastions of capitalism in the world, like the United States of America and Western Germany, have capital gains tax for years. In fact, they have it in Germany since the beginning of this century and it has not disturbed capitalism.  It has not led to people getting out of investment.  If one was to translate the healthy atmosphere towards capitalism in those countries to the tax position then it would appear that capital gains tax can actually promote a healthy capitalistic climate, although I know everybody would not share the view of some people as to the wisdom of that particular climate.  Nevertheless, it exists in those countries that have capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>Probably one of the reasons it helps to stabilise societies is because where there is capital gains tax it removes the great sense of frustration and anger which an ordinary income tax payer must surely have if he or she has to pay income tax on regular income while other people with greater income and massive capital can avoid payment of tax on both capital and income.  Let nobody think that wealthier people pay as much income tax as people who have smaller incomes; they do not. There are various ways and means by which they can devise their affairs to set off their tax liability.  One of those ways we closed off in January, 1974. Senator Ryan referred to it today.  I see no reason for going back on what the Government did, but it was open to people to borrow vast sums of money in Ireland and to set off the cost of the interest on money borrowed here against their income tax liability.</P>
    <P>The greater a person's wealth the greater was the inclination to engage in such borrowing.  A great deal of such money was borrowed here from the Irish banking system and invested abroad to earn tax-free profits abroad. That also was possible until we got into power.  People were able to set off up to 80 per cent of the interest on money borrowed in Ireland against their tax liability here and use that money taken out of the Irish economy to generate for themselves tax-free profits abroad. Of course, that is a scandal.  The sense <Col N="297" /> of frustration which ordinary taxpayers feel would be a great deal more if they really knew the extent to which tax avoidance was carried on by people of comparatively substantial means until many of these avenues were closed off. It is because these avenues have been closed that we have so many vehement attacks upon this Government because of their taxation reforms.</P>
    <P>The accusations that have been levied about the flight of capital from Ireland are all without foundation.  The movement of capital here since we published our Capital Taxation White Paper is very substantially inwards, not outwards.  This gives the lie to the accusation that has been made about upsetting the atmosphere for investment and the confidence of capitalists in the Irish economy and the Irish society. Senator FitzGerald was right when he said that capital gains tax is totally justified in equity and not to have a capital gains tax is more inequitable than to have one.</P>
    <P>There was some criticism that the thresholds in the Bill are the same thresholds as were announced in February, 1974.  That is not true because we made several revisions as of May, 1974. But the same criticism would be made if we had not increased them since then. We have dropped the rate of capital gains tax from 35 per cent to 26 per cent, a significant reduction.  Our rate is now lower than in any European country. Therefore, there is a net attraction so far as investing in the Irish economy is concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald raised the question of the difference in treatment of deaths in Ireland and Britain.  He pointed out that in Britain the value of an asset acquired by a legatee is taken at its market value on the day of acquisition, whereas we propose that the value would be traced from the original acquisition value by the donor.  In Britain, originally, death was an occasion for the calculation of capital gain.  There are some in Britain who would restore this.  That will not arise in Ireland.  The only occasion on which capital gains will be paid in respect of property which passes on death would be when the legatee would eventually dispose of it.  If the legatee did not <Col N="298" /> dispose of it outside the family but passed it on within the family to the next generation, capital gains tax would not be payable.  That is because in Irish society we recognise that when so many businesses and farms stay within the family, we consider it appropriate that such businesses and farms should not be subjected in future, as they have in the past, to the payment of substantial penal capital taxation at a time of no liquidity.  In future, capital taxation will be paid only when liquidity arises, when it is a disposal of property and when the gain can therefore be paid out of the liquidity, or else it will be paid by the comparatively wealthy in small instalments annually.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald was in some doubt about our treatment of leases in the Bill.  We have good precedent to go by.  We have had regard to the code which applies under the Income Tax Acts.  There may be some anomalies but as we introduced the capital gains code we fitted it in, where it was practicable to do so, with the existing and understood code of income tax. The problem is complex enough without introducing a whole lot of new concepts into taxation legislation and practice generally.</P>
    <P>There were some queries about paragraphs 11 of Schedule 4 which deals with the disposal of assets by non-residents. We have had to take steps in relation to the disposal of assets by non-residents to ensure that, when a capital gain on Irish assets is made by a non-resident, the proceeds of sale would not go outside this jurisdiction so as to avoid payment of the tax.  Therefore, paragraph 11 contains a proviso which would require the purchaser to deduct a certain amount of tax from the purchase money before handing over the purchase money to the vendor.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 11 (1) (d) says that the paragraph should apply to assets which are shares in a company deriving their value from land in the State, minerals and exploration or exploitation rights. I have been asked if this applies to publicly quoted companies.  The answer is, yes, it does; but it is open to any vendor to apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a certificate of non-liability to tax.  If a non-resident vendor <Col N="299" /> applies in respect of shares in a publicly quoted company then, by virtue of section 4, he is not liable and a certificate would be given and there would be no deduction for the tax.  It should not cause any difficulty at all.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald wondered if certificates of exemption would be quickly issued.  He may be assured that the experience which he and his colleagues in the legal profession enjoyed in relation to section 6 certificates under the old Schedule A system on the sale of land will not exist in relation to certificates under the capital gains tax. Any person who applies for a certificate of exemption under paragraph 11 of the Fourth Schedule of the Capital Gains Tax Bill will get certificates without delay.  It is proposed to give priority to the issue of such certificates.</P>
    <P>The Senator also asked whether the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and bodies corporate under the Health Act would be exempt from capital gains tax. The Voluntary Health Insurance Board would not be exempt from capital gains tax but the Voluntary Health Insurance Board on reinvesting the proceeds of sale of its property in its business of conducting an insurance company for voluntary health would, of course, get roll-over relief.  In other words, it is a way of ensuring that there is no disposal of the property outside the authority of the Voluntary Health Insurance Act. It is a theoretical point that they are liable but as there would be roll-over the relief would be given.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald also suggested that the various exemptions which we have given&mdash;for instance, as to gift between husband and wife&mdash;should also apply on transactions between other relations.  There has to be a stop point in all taxation.  There has to be a stop to the generosity of the Exchequer in granting exemptions.  We think the various thresholds&mdash;for instance, on the Capital Acquisitions Bill in relation to gifts&mdash;are so generous by any standard that we would not be justified in making further exemptions and extensions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There was reference by Senators to the qualifying age of 55 years for the concessions in sections 26 and 27.  They <Col N="300" /> queried whether that was young enough. Senator FitzGerald referred to the problem of the burnt-out person who was unable to continue in business or continue the running of a farm and suggested there should be some special provisions which would take account of such problems.  Once again one runs up against the problem that one has to draw a line and anything on the wrong side of that line or near it is regarded as hardship.  I would prefer to regard it as hard luck rather than hardship.  Hard luck is not quite the same thing as hardship.  The age of 55 is a comparatively low age for retirement in Ireland, and we are looking at Irish circumstances. It is younger than any other statutory provisions here, other than the regulations made in relation to the retirement of farmers under the EEC scheme.  We think it is a generous age to take.  We would want to have some years experience of its operation before we would feel justified in bringing the age any lower.</P>
    <P>On the question of people who are incapacitated from holding on to or from continuing in business younger than that age I point out that there would obviously be very great difficulties in determining from a tax point of view whether or not the person was or was not medically fit to continue in a particular business.  It would open the door to an awful lot of uncertainty and difficulty if we were to allow assessments as to fitness to remain in business to be a determining factor in whether or not liability to tax would or would not arise.  What is the reality?  If some person is unable to continue in business they can probably so arrange their affairs that a manager can take it over and they would so arrange their affairs so that in many cases a manager would manage the business for them.</P>
    <P>There would be no rigid enforcement to the full-time attention to a business by the Revenue Commissioners.  The test in regard to full-time attention to a business will be whether or not the taxpayer in question is devoting time, substantial time, to another business. Somebody may become invalided or seriously ill for a long period and may be only able to watch the business from the bed.  That is not necessarily going to disqualify that person as long as the <Col N="301" /> person is not carrying on some more lucrative business elsewhere in using a claimed illness as the cause for not attending to a particular business which might be affected by capital gains tax. Notwithstanding their reputation the Revenue Commissioners are not inhuman. They are not lacking in human compassion and understanding of human situations and that is the way they apply the income tax law and other laws.  I think we have no reason to suspect that they could be unreasonable in the application of the capital gains law.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats said that the Bill was irrelevant at present times.  We might be a bit outside the scope of the debate if we were to chase him too far down the road on that issue, but I will put this point to him.  Do you think there will be much prospect of getting moderation in income demand, do you think there will be much patience on the part of the ordinary income man who has no other assets if the Government of Ireland were not seen to be asking people of substantial wealth to pay a fair share of taxation?  I think it would be futile to ask for moderation in income expectations if the Government at the same time were not proceeding in their determination to ask people of substantial means to pay a larger share of tax in future than they paid in the past.  I think it is very relevant to our present difficulties and to the response which the Government are seeking from our community.  The Government should proceed with all due speed to complete the implementation of their package of new capital taxes, which are fair to the people who will be affected by them, but at the same time the Government will have the benefit of convincing other people that everybody who is in a position to pay will in future pay a fair share of tax.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the Bill is a dis-incentive to save.  Senator Quinlan mentioned this point.  Senator Yeats mentioned this as well.  Consider the various exemptions which are granted. A person can have capital gains of up to £500 a year free of tax.  That is a fair gain on a fair amount of savings. Various other assets are exempt.  The home is exempt.  The home is in fact <Col N="302" /> the principal and only form of capital for many people.  They spend their lives paying off the mortgage and the house becomes the family's savings box. That is in no way discouraged by the provisions of this Bill.  There is positive encouragement to invest in Government savings which of course are used for the benefit of the community because Government investments are completely outside the scope of the capital gains tax.  Of course the family business, the family farm is also given very generous exemptions so that people who invest their savings and their efforts in building up such assets will have exemption up to £150,000 which is passed on to one family and up to £50,000 if it is being disposed of outside the family. Of course there will be adjustments above those figures so that there may be only small liability to tax where the consideration does not greatly exceed those amounts.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell queried the use of consideration instead of gain where exemptions have been granted in sections 26 and 27.  We had a very long debate on this in the Dáil and the reasons which I gave were and are still valid.  I give them here:</P>
    <P>If an asset has been held for a long time before it is disposed of under sections 26 and 27 the chances are that the consideration would reflect a very substantial amount of gain. The longer the period of holding probably the greater the amount of gain and therefore the consideration would reflect in fact the quite substantial gains which would be made over a lifetime holding of an asset. It will be recalled that the asset must be held for ten years before being disposed of.  There would be quite an amount of gain represented in the consideration at that time.  But the consideration also has the advantage that the Revenue Commissioners would not have to look at every transaction which they would have to look at if they had to measure the gain on every transaction.  They would have to look not merely at the price the assets obtained at the time of disposal, they would also have to look at the price at which the asset was previously acquired, maybe not <Col N="303" /> by the donor but by somebody who pre-deceased him.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the question of multi-rate, such as Senator Yeats suggested.  We had an amendment in the Dáil which would have involved up to 20 different rates of capital gains tax. One can imagine the complexities of trying to operate such a system. Theoretically it is convenient, as Senator FitzGerald said, but in practice I believe it would drive even reasonable people mad.  Even the tax experts might not consider any fees they collected to be worth the amount of suffering they would have in trying to administer such a very complex scheme.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats raised the issue of compulsory acquisition and he thought it was wrong that capital gains tax, if I understood him rightly, should be imposed where the proceeds of a sale were no more than compensation for what was compulsorily acquired, because he obviously had in mind that the vendor in many such situations is an unwilling vendor.  But if we were to exempt such transactions from capital gains tax we would no longer have any voluntary sales by people to public authority. Every person who might be affected by a sale by a public authority would refuse to agree a price even though the price would be acceptable because such a price would be subject to capital gains or they would agree a price only if the local authority or the State were to pay 26 per cent on top of the price which had been agreed.  Every case would then be pushed to arbitration. We know how long it takes us at the moment to acquire in the public interest some properties, even where there is voluntary agreement.  We certainly know how long it takes if there is compulsory acquisition, with inquiries and so on.  In truth it would muck up the whole process of acquiring property which is urgently needed for public use for many purposes, including necessary housing.</P>
    <P>But I should like to point out that the hardship is probably not as great as might at first appear.  First of all, if the compulsory acquisition is of the principal private residence, there would be no liability to tax.  If the property being <Col N="304" /> acquired was a business asset and the proceeds of sale were to be reinvested in a business, which is what most people in a compulsory purchase situation would do, though this is affected by the compulsory purchase they would be reinvesting in another business. The roll-over provisions will then apply; or if the vendor was over 55 years of age and not going to start in business he will still have exemption up to £50,000.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senator Markey once again, as I have on so many other occasions, that the Government will review the thresholds from time to time. The Senator suggested that the review should take place, together with the wealth tax review, over a three-yearly interval.  I would think that something of that nature might be appropriate, but we will look at it in the light of experience.  When we have time we must start thinking of a lesser inflation rate than inflation rate of 25 per cent, which is the one which seems to preoccupy people at the present time.  We are going to get back to a much lower inflation rate because if we do not we will not survive at all.  Therefore we are going to get back to a lower rate so that many of the fears that people at present have following a period of rapidly increasing inflation will not, I think, be justified in the years that are immediately ahead of us.</P>
    <P>I hope, a Chathaoirleach, that I have dealt with most of the points which have been raised.  I have explained the difficulties in relation to not being able to meet several of the points.  I should like to be able to meet them, but I think we must keep our tax as simple, as understandable and as workable as possible.  In the light of experience, when people are able to appreciate the system that has been introduced now, we may all be wiser and we may be able to improve it.  But as of now a simple and fairly direct code is obviously the one which is going to operate to the greatest advantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Bill will not discourage investment.  I believe we will have a much healthier economy and healthier society when the whole package is in.  I recall what a leading banker said to me some time ago.  He said: &ldquo;Do <Col N="305" /> not worry about criticism.  You will get hell when it is going through and some of your greatest critics will be your greatest supporters when they get experience of the new system, because the Irish tax situation was unhealthy and it was doing damage to the whole climate of investment in Ireland.&rdquo;  I am sure he is right.  That has been the experience in other countries and I am sure it will be the experience here, too. At the end of the day people will appreciate the wisdom of it all.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Opposition in the Seanad have accepted the principle of capital gains tax.  I know there was some doubts on their part originally.  Indeed, as recently as last week one of the Deputies in Dáil said that they were still opposed to it.  I suppose like any political party which crosses class and property boundaries it is bound to have people who agree and disagree with the principle of capital gains.  But I think our society by and large has accepted the principle of capital gains.  In the representations I have received nobody said that gains taxation was wrong, even those people who sought amelioration of the rates or changes or exemptions. My successors can check out the truth of what I am saying.  No representations received by the Department of Finance asked for cancellation of capital gains taxation.  That, I think, is something <Col N="306" /> which speaks for itself.  I look forward to a useful discussion in the Seanad on the Committee and Report Stages.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to adjourn until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 15th, and it is hoped on Tuesday to take the Restrictive Practices (Confirmation of Order) Bill, all Stages.  I understand there is an urgent motion to be taken with this.  There is also the Industrial Development Bill, which is a Certified Money Bill, all Stages, and Motion No. 5 on today's Order Paper approving the draft of the Election of Conservators Order, 1975.  It is hoped to conclude that business on Tuesday but some of it of course may carry over until Wednesday and, as I have said earlier, we will then go on hopefully with the Committee Stage of the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  We hope to conclude the Committee Stage of the Bill.  If we get it on Wednesday and Thursday, well and good, but we may have to sit on Friday.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 15th July, 1975.</P>
