      <P>We agreed to take this Bill today.  However, I wish to lodge a complaint about the way in which Government business is being done. The normal practice laid down in Standing Orders for legislation coming from the Dáil is that it should be on the Order Paper for three days before being taken up by the House.  It is a reasonable condition because it gives adequate notice that a Bill will be taken and it gives adequate time for Senators to examine the legislation concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are circumstances in which it is necessary to take legislation at short notice.  This arises from time to time in all Governments.  One must make the point that whatever way this Government have of doing business it results in the fact that time after time &mdash;indeed it is becoming a normal fact of everyday life&mdash;Bills coming to this House from Dáil Éireann are being taken at a few hours' notice.  It is not good enough.  It is an example of the utterly incompetent way in which this Government's legislative programme is being conducted.  I cannot see the slightest reason why it should be happening time after time.  I presume this Bill is urgent, but every Bill these days seems to be urgent.  It can only be assumed that the practice of the Government is that they think about these things only at the last minute. By the time they get around to bringing legislation before the Oireachtas <Col N="248" /> it is so late that it has to be rushed through in this hole-and-corner way. It is quite wrong.</P>

      <P>I got no Order Paper this morning.  It would appear that there is some agreement between the Whips.  We spent three days debating the Wildlife Bill.  It was amusing to hear so much talk about wildlife at a time when human life is being threatened all over the country.  It is very rewarding to find this morning, at a time when the country is threatened with a three-day week and short-time, the Seanad going on a four-day week.  I suppose it is a sign of the times in Seanad Éireann.  The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards seem to have a bank of knowledge.  Perhaps they could give us some advice.  They have suggested a four-day week.  In most cases we have a four-day week from 10.30 a.m. to 10 p.m.  It appears that, wherever else redundancies may occur, it will not be in Seanad Éireann.</P>

      <P>The bulk of Senator Brennan's remarks might have been more relevant if they were addressed to the House yesterday on the Wildlife Bill.  I am glad he approves of the Government's efforts as regards employment as far as the Seanad is concerned.  Senator Yeats's remarks were very much more theoretical than practical.  As a matter of practice, it is well to record that he and every other Senator were aware that we were to take this Bill today.  They were aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Bill, 1975: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to extend the period of payment of pay-related benefit from six to nine months.  The Bill also empowers the Minister for Social Welfare, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to extend by Order the duration of payment for a further period not exceeding three months.</P>
      <P>The proposals in the Bill represent a further advance in the social programme of the Government and are in line with the general trend of development which is desirable in our social welfare provisions.  The extension of the existing pay-related scheme is important in itself and the decision of the Government to bring forward these proposals after the first year of operation of the scheme is a reflection of their satisfaction with its general effectiveness.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains provisions of a somewhat technical nature which amend existing legislation in relation to pay-related benefit and may on that account be difficult to follow.  The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill is aimed at clarifying these provisions and I hope that Senators will have been helped by it in their examination of the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have previously given details of the pay-related benefit scheme but I will take this opportunity, for the information of Senators, to recall briefly the main features of the scheme.  The scheme results from the Social Welfare <Col N="250" /> (Pay-Related Benefit) Act, 1973, and was introduced in April, 1974.  Pay-related benefit is payable as a supplement to disability benefit, occupational injury benefit (if the claimant is otherwise entitled to disability benefit) and maternity allowance, for up to 24½ weeks of incapacity for work.</P>
    <P>It also supplements unemployment benefit for up to 24½ weeks of unemployment. There is a waiting period of two weeks which includes the three waiting days for flat-rate benefit.  The maximum period of 24½ weeks of payment thus terminates at the end of 26 weeks of payment of the flat-rate benefit.  The weekly rate of pay-related benefit payable is 40 per cent of the amount by which the person's reckonable weekly earnings exceed £14 but do not exceed an upper limit of £50.</P>
    <P>The main reason for the introduction of pay-related benefit was, of course, to make better provision against the loss of income suffered by insured persons and their families during periods of sickness or unemployment than could be provided by the system of flat-rate benefits.  Although the flat-rate benefits had been regularly improved over the years they were not flexible enough to provide adequately for the different needs of persons who, when working, had not the same levels of earnings and, as a result, had widely differing financial commitments.</P>
    <P>When the scheme was introduced, a period of 147 days during which pay-related benefit would be paid was considered appropriate&mdash;subject to review in the light of experience&mdash;for the purpose of bridging the gap until in the normal course an unemployed or sick worker again resumed employment.  It is, of course, true that a spell of disability or illness may last for more than the six-month period covered by the provisions of the original Act.</P>
    <P>Equally, the period during which a worker remains unemployed may, unfortunately prove, in many cases, to be longer than that which would normally obtain.  Moreover, the date on which pay-related benefit ceases under existing provisions may now coincide for many recipients, with a reduction in the standard rate of unemployment benefit <Col N="251" /> to the reduced rate which may be payable for the second 26 weeks of a period of interruption of employment.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned by the fact that the substantial fall in cash income which results for persons in the circumstances which I have mentioned may undoubtedly sharply accentuate the difficulties, and indeed hardship, which ensue for the families of very many unemployed workers. To help workers and their families, therefore, to maintain a reasonable standard of living during periods of interruption of employment, I propose to extend by 78 days, from 147 to 225 days, the period during which pay-related benefit may be paid.  This extension of the period of payment will of course apply both to periods of unemployment and to periods of incapacity for work.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that this proposal is not intended simply as an emergency measure to meet the current abnormal employment position.  It is, as I have said, a logical and necessary development of the social welfare system.  I made it clear, in introducing the Estimate for my Department in Dáil Éireann last year, that adjustments to the pay-related scheme would be made as indicated by experience.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that when economic conditions generally become more favourable, there will continue to be a substantial number of cases in which payment of pay-related benefit over the extended period proposed would be necessary to mitigate hardship, for example, in the case of families where the breadwinner suffers a prolonged spell of illness.  This proposal and the other proposals in the Bill will come into operation at an early date which will be fixed by Ministerial Order.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated earlier, the weekly rate of pay-related benefit payable at present is 40 per cent of the part of a claimant's reckonable weekly earnings which lies between £14 and the upper limit of £50.  The rate which will be payable in respect of the proposed additional period of 78 days will be 30 per cent of reckonable earnings between £14 and £50. This will mean an addition of up to <Col N="252" /> £10.80 a week in payments for unemployment and disability during the extended period.</P>
    <P>Pay-related benefit is payable only for days for which flat-rate benefit is also payable and may not, at present, be paid beyond the 159th day of unemployment or incapacity for work in a period of interruption of employment. These 159 days include the initial 12 waiting days.  At an early stage in the operation of the scheme a difficulty came to light in the case of persons who were suspended from, or disqualified for, the flat-rate benefit for some days in that period.  During such suspension or disqualification pay-related benefit would not of course be payable, because flat-rate benefit was not payable.  Because of the bar on payment beyond the 159th day of incapacity or unemployment, a person in the circumstances I have outlined could not get the full 147 days of pay-related benefit.  To deal with this problem, provision was made in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1974 that days of incapacity or unemployment in respect of which a person did not receive payment of flat-rate benefit because of suspension or disqualification would not be taken into account.  Now that the period of entitlement to pay-related benefit is being extended, similar provision is being made in the Bill in relation to the extended period of entitlement to pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>In providing for an extension of the duration of the period for which pay-related benefit will be payable a particular problem arises in the case of persons whose period of interruption of employment is continuing and who have already exhausted their entitlement to pay-related benefit.  I have given special consideration to the possibility of helping such persons. In the absence of a special provision to cater for these cases, a person might receive little or no immediate benefit from the proposed extension of the period of payment. To take an example: immediately before the proposed extension comes into operation, a man may have been unemployed for 230 days.  When the extension of the period of payment of <Col N="253" /> pay-related benefit comes into effect pay-related benefit will be payable up to the 237th day of unemployment and the man in question would therefore get pay-related benefit for only 7 days.</P>
    <P>To help persons in this or similar types of situation a provision has been included in the Bill the effect of which will be that where a person has been unemployed for not less than 159 days and has received pay-related benefit, he may, if the period of interruption of employment continues on or after the commencement date, receive pay-related benefit for up to 78 days, provided the total number of days of unemployment in the period of interruption of employment does not exceed 315 days, that is, the maximum period, including 3 waiting days, during which a person may be paid flat-rate unemployment benefit. The Bill includes a similar transitional provision to cover days of incapacity for work.</P>
    <P>The cost of the pay-related benefit scheme is borne by contributions from employers and employees and the annual cost of extending the period of payment by 78 days as proposed is estimated to be in the region of £1.8 million.  At a lower level of unemployment, the cost would, of course, be less.  It is expected that the existing contribution income will be sufficient to meet the cost of the improvement and it is not therefore proposed to increase the existing contribution rate.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes a provision to empower the Minister for Social Welfare, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to extend by order the duration of pay-related benefit for a further period not exceeding 78 days, and to determine the weekly rate at which pay-related benefit may be paid in respect of such extended period.</P>
    <P>This power will enable the Minister to effect speedily further improvements in the pay-related benefit scheme in the light of experience and in line with social requirements. Thus, the scheme will acquire a most valuable element of flexibility.</P>
    <P>The further extension by order of <Col N="254" /> the duration of payment of pay-related benefit is, however, subject to the condition that a person shall not be entitled by virtue of any such order to receive pay-related benefit after the 315th day of unemployment or incapacity for work in any period of interruption of employment.  Any such order must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by either House within the next 21 sitting days.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at some length about the technicalities of this Bill and this is of course unavoidable.  I want now to turn to a brief consideration of the working of the pay-related benefit scheme.  After just one year of operation, it can be stated without fear of contradiction that it has proved to be of great significance for very many families afflicted by the hardship occasioned by the illness or unemployment of the breadwinner.</P>
    <P>In the past year we have seen a most difficult economic situation and a continuing high level of unemployment. This has happened in a period of unprecedented inflation, the impact of which is clear and harmful. Beyond all its economic ill-effects inflation tends to make inequalities worse and it bears most harshly on the poor and on the various deprived groups in the community.  It can bear in this way on those who are unemployed, and on their families.</P>
    <P>The average worker in this country spends what he earns each week on his wife and family, seeking to provide a reasonable standard of living for them.  Very few of them are able to put by money week by week, especially in a period of high and continuing inflation.  If that worker is hit by unemployment, as so many are now hit in our country, then his family is at once confronted with very severe difficulties.  In these circumstances a family may easily go into debt.  Over the years I have seen many people unemployed through no fault of their own for prolonged periods.  I have seen them, and their families, put into the category of the poverty stricken from the beginning. This poverty could last for a very long time even after re-entering employment while efforts were made to <Col N="255" /> repay debts built up during unemployment.</P>
    <P>The pay-related benefit scheme does not give the average unemployed man more that he would get if he were at work but it keeps his head above water.  It can keep the family in reasonable comfort during a period of unemployment, up to six months at present and subject to the provisions of this Bill for the longer period proposed. It can also save them from the distress of living in debt for perhaps two or three years after resuming employment, and I have known such cases.</P>
    <P>It is the purpose of all income-maintenance payments to cushion a person to the fullest extent possible if he becomes unemployed or ill.  I believe that the benefits provided under the pay-related scheme do much to achieve this stated purpose, particularly since the scheme makes good some of the defects of the flat-rate system which represented far too low a proportion of the earnings of those on reasonable good wages.  Let me give one or two examples of the working of the pay-related scheme.</P>
    <P>I will take the case of a man, his wife and two children, at various levels of reckonable earnings.  I should point out that reckonable earnings are at present related to the fiscal year 1973-74.  At £20 a week reckonable earnings, which is equivalent to a rate of perhaps £27 today, flat-rate benefit would be £20.80 and no pay-related element would be payable because of the wage-stop which means that the total of flat-rate plus pay-related benefit cannot exceed earnings, unless flat-rate of itself is higher.</P>
    <P>At £30 a week reckonable earnings &mdash;equivalent to about £39 now&mdash;flat-rate would be £20.80 and the total benefit, including pay-related, would be £27.20, or 91 per cent of reckonable earnings.  That is about 70 per cent of the current wage level.  At £40 a week&mdash;equivalent to £51 or thereabout&mdash;the total benefit payable, including pay-related, amounts to £31.20.  This is equivalent to 78 per cent of reckonable earnings or 61 per cent of the current wage level. <Col N="256" /> At £50 a week&mdash;equivalent to £63 now&mdash;the total benefit figure, including pay-related amounts to £35.20. The percentage equivalent amounts to 70 per cent of reckonable earnings or 56 per cent of the present wage figure.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the average weekly earnings figure for male workers in manufacturing industries in the September quarter of 1974 was in excess of £43 a week.  This figure will have been raised to at least £49 at present, through the working of national wage agreements.</P>
    <P>I believe that these few examples show that the scheme has proved to be a real support for many families which would have been in serious distress in the past year and that this fact is its justification.  The introduction last year of the pay-related benefit scheme was a significant development in our social welfare code.  It represented this country's first undertaking in the field of pay-related benefits, which are an established and internationally-accepted feature of highly developed social security systems.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, the Government have decided to publish a discussion document on pensions which will indicate the various issues connected with the introduction of a national income-related pension scheme.  This may be seen as a logical and highly-desirable direction in which to extend the application of the pay-related principle.</P>
    <P>When speaking in this House on the Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill, 1975, I referred to some aspects of the financing of our social services.  I wish to say a few further words today on this matter.</P>
    <P>Total expenditure this year on social welfare and health will amount to more than £500 million, of which the Exchequer will provide approximately £380 million from general taxation. Expenditure has increased by well over 100 per cent since 1973.  While this represents significant expansion and improvement in the social services, there can be no doubt that the question of financing now raises a number of important issues.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> It is necessary to ensure that the best return in terms of real social service is obtained for such high and increasing levels of public expenditure. There is a need to keep all schemes and every category of welfare payment under review to guarantee that they are meeting their stated objectives.  We must take the necessary steps to direct scarce funds to areas of real need and to the relief and eradication of particular, hardcore problems.  We must look critically at the effects of what we are doing, a task which calls for planned research.</P>
    <P>Those who ultimately foot the bill have a very real interest in the question of the effectiveness of the system and, particularly, in the method of financing.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to see that research in relation to social welfare should be directed to practical goals and that it should make a contribution to policy review and evolution.  The establishment of the research and development section within my Department will provide a focus for such work and for appropriate contact with the various institutions of social and economic research.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the research element of the work programme of the national committee on pilot schemes to combat poverty will place a considerable emphasis on the adequacy and effectiveness of various aspects of our social services.  This programme will contribute in a most practical manner to the effectiveness of policy in the future.</P>
    <P>I have referred on more than one occasion to the inherent difficulties which arise from the traditional methods of financing the social services in this country.  By far the greatest proportion of this finance is derived from the Exchequer.  Only Denmark of the EEC Member states has a higher proportion of state financing.</P>
    <P>In this country a high proportion of public finance arises from indirect taxation which, of its nature, tends to be regressive.  In the case of employer and employee contributions, the great bulk is in the form of flat-rate <Col N="258" /> weekly payments.  Such payments can constitute a significant burden in the case of lower-paid workers, and I am aware of the particular situation of women workers whose average earnings are lower than those of men and who traditionally pay a stamp contribution only a few pence below that for a man.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, the Tánaiste has initiated a fundamental review of all aspects of the financing of the social services in relation to both health and social welfare.  I am hopeful that it will soon prove possible to bring about a more equitable and rational approach to this central aspect of the system.  What must be stressed is the need to bring about changes which respond both to the needs of those who must pay and to the needs of those who will benefit from the whole range of services. This is a matter for planning, and not for hasty or <i>ad hoc</i> decision.</P>
    <P>In considering an extension of the pay-related benefit scheme, the question of the working of the pay-related contribution principle must arise.  This approach is clearly more equitable and progressive than flat-rate contribution.  Its extension to other areas of the system, including pensions, would give rise to consideration of matters such as its relationship to benefits for the lower paid, the fixing of appropriate contribution ceilings and the special problems of those who are not covered by the PAYE tax collection system.</P>
    <P>I have referred on other occasions to certain criticisms of the pay-related benefit scheme.  I do not intend to add to my previous comments on the prevalence of ill-informed criticism claiming that benefits are too generous.  Suffice it to say that such generalised contentions have not been proved to be of substance in any significant number of cases.  It is most unfortunate that attempts to promote a particular interest should be made in such a way as to reflect on many decent men and women who are in receipt of benefits which are their right.</P>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill will <Col N="259" /> strengthen and bring to a higher stage of development the scheme which commenced last year and I am pleased to recommend the Bill for the favourable consideration of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill in itself is one that in the present economic and social circumstances is required to alleviate the very serious unemployment position that has developed and has unfortunately been maintained by reason of the tardiness of the Government in facing up to the challenge posed by an inflationary situation that was obviously generating 12 months ago and is not admitted to be our main social problem.  In that context and to use the Parliamentary Secretary's own phrase, there is a need for families to keep their heads above water in respect of continuing unemployment.  For that reason there can be no objection to the extension from six to nine months of the pay-related benefit scheme originally introduced in legislation by the previous Government, a scheme that is just in that it enables workers during a period of transition from one employment to another, during a period of unemployment, to maintain at least a measure of the standard of living to which they have been accustomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no objection to that.  My real objection is to the effect that in the extended three months the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government have seen fit to reduce from 40 per cent to 30 per cent the benefit accruing to the unemployed person.  That seems odd in the context of inflation running at the rate of 25 per cent per annum at the minimum. Indeed, if one was to take the 8 per cent increase in inflation for the first three months of the year one could argue that the inflation might be in the order of 32 per cent.  It is not only odd but inherently contradictory if there is going to be an extension of pay-related benefit not just, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, as an emergency measure, but written in statutory form&mdash;and one can visualise inflation of one form or another continuing, <Col N="260" /> hopefully not at the present rate, but continuing in the years ahead &mdash;that the extra three-month period should be reduced from 40 per cent to 30 per cent.  It raises the question as to the state of the fund.  The Parliamentary Secretary, under pressure in the Dáil, said that there was a surplus in the fund as of 31st March this year of £7 million.  If that is the case and if one has to by reason of the critical unemployment situation increase the period of pay-related benefit from six to nine months and if there is a surplus of £7 million in the fund at present, then why not maintain the rate for the extra three months?</P>
    <P>It would be a different matter if this was a question of ministerial order where it could be varied, but we are writing this into the Statute Book.  We are writing into the Bill specifically that after six months pay-related benefit, there will be a reduction from 40 per cent to 30 per cent in income as far as the worker at various rates is concerned. I appreciate that the Minister may by order then extend the period for a further three months, but written into this Bill before us there is a reduction in benefit from six to nine months, in a period in which inflation is running from 25 to 32 per cent, a period in which everything else is going up and it is proposed the benefit should go down.</P>
    <P>If the fund is in surplus to the extent that he mentioned, then why not do the right thing the whole way, if it has to be done in our present critical situation, and maintain the 40 per cent over the nine months rather than reduce it from 40 per cent to 30 per cent for the last three months of the nine?  It seems retrograde and to be flying in the face of the basic inflationary situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the inflationary situation which has been let get out of hand and is the cause of the necessity for the Parliamentary Secretary to be in the House at present.  It is now quite clear to everyone that inflation equals unemployment.  It is a simple equation and because the Government have let the galloping horse of inflation out the stable door and without any <Col N="261" /> jockey on its back then we have the present unemployment situation.  It is a basic fundamental equation.  Inflation equals unemployment, and there is no point in coming up here with gimmicks such as breaking the link with sterling. That is no answer in a critical economic and financial situation.  We can certainly discuss revaluation or devaluation or breaking the link with sterling or linking ourselves with another currency in a time of economic and financial stability and in a time of economic expansion.  That is the time to discuss a fundamental matter of that kind, but when one throws a matter of that serious nature into a highly inflationary situation and high unemployment, then it is merely talking through one's hat.  If we broke the links with sterling to deal with our present inflationary situation or adopted any measure of that kind, we would have to impose far more severe restraints and disciplines if we were to link with any other currency in the world than are being imposed by the present Government and that are consequent upon our relation with sterling.  I mention that as a passing comment and I thank the Chair for the indulgence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I appreciate that what the Parliamentary Secretary is bringing in here will ameliorate the situation in practical human terms for people who have been put into a situation of unemployment because of the Government's policy and the Government's ignoring the inflationary situation by reason of their incapacity to face up to the problem 12 months ago and their failure to take the unpopular decision then that would put us now in a situation where we would not have so many people unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are basic facts which we have discussed in various economic debates here.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to refer to some <Col N="262" /> rather alarming figures that have emerged recently and indeed of which he makes some mention in his opening speech.  He refers, and rightly so, to the over-reliance of our present social welfare systems on the Exchequer. Approximately £180 million of the £500 million spent on social welfare and health comes from general taxation.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that Exchequer returns as of now are £73 million lower than the corresponding time last year?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>It is £82 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Yeats says it is up £82 million.  My last figure was £73 million.  It is £82 million.  That makes it worse.  In other words, we are regressing not progressing in respect of Exchequer intake.  If we have an Exchequer intake that is now running at £82 million less now than this time last year, then I should like to know, what exactly, apart from this stopgap measure, the future situation in regard to our social welfare services generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me how he proposes to look at the logical necessity to increase our social welfare payments in the months and years ahead in the context of a situation where Exchequer returns are diminishing now and our receipts from Exchequer taxation are now running at £82 million less than this time last year, and I quote from the Parliamentary Secretary's opening statement:</P>
      <P>The Exchequer is providing £380 million from general taxation.</P>
      <P>General taxation is of course Exchequer receipts.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary goes on to say:</P>
      <P>There can be no doubt that the question of financing now raises a number of important issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I also said that this is a matter for planning not for hasty or <i>ad hoc</i> decisions.  That could also apply to contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed I was going to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary by referring to that paragraph and saying that this whole aspect requires very real and positive planning, not <i>ad hoc</i> interruptions or <i>ad hoc</i> contributions from Senators such as Senator Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Or <i>ad hoc</i> Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or <i>ad hoc</i> Bills, as I have just been reminded.  We must look at this in a cool manner.  Let us not get hasty about it.  The fact of the matter is that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are concerned about the fact that the fund is becoming over-reliant on Exchequer contributions, that is, Exchequer returns are now running at the rate of £82 million less in Exchequer receipts compared to this time last year.  The Parliamentary Secretary is rightly concerned about the fact that the fund is dependent on an Exchequer with diminishing returns.</P>
      <P>The planning which the Parliamentary Secretary suggests, and for which I compliment him, should be put into effect as quickly as possible.  Apart from social welfare being over-reliant on the Exchequer, there is another aspect in regard to social welfare financing, which again rightly concerns the Parliamentary Secretary and to which he referred, that is, that a very high proportion of public financing generally comes from indirect taxation and tends to be regress by reason of that, and the system of flat rate contributions from employer and employee for pay-related benefits is particularly regressive.  In other words you have equal payments right across the board from employer and employee irrespective of capacity to pay, and the Parliamentary Secretary rightly states, and again I quote:</P>
      <P>In the case of employer and employee contributions, the great bulk is in the form of flat rate weekly payments.  Such payments can constitute a significant burden in the case of lower paid workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> He goes on to refer, in particular, to the situation of women workers. There is no question about it that the flat rate contribution system is completely inequitable in our circumstances and that if you are going to have pay-related benefit, the logical thing is to plan towards pay-related contributions.  Forgive me if this appears to be said here in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner, but in my view it is very obvious and indeed formed part of our discussion when I was a member of a Government that introduced the first pay-related scheme here.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects to which we addressed our minds at that time&mdash;and one does not want a think tank or any marvellous investigations to see the justice of this&mdash;was that if there are to be pay-related benefits you should have also pay-related contributions.  While there may be practical administrative difficulties involved, this approach, as the Parliamentary Secretary rightly says, is clearly more progressive than flat rate contributions.  I do not see why there is a necessity for any further long-term investigation into the introduction of pay-related contributions side by side with pay-related benefits. This aspect was fully discussed and understood when we introduced this pay-related scheme in 1972 and I fail to see the reason for the delay in introducing such a scheme.  The present flat rate contribution system is blatantly unjust, inequitable and does not stand up.  Once the principle is accepted it is a question of giving a directive and letting the administration come up with the proposals for providing for pay-related contributions.</P>
    <P>It is important in this situation that we do something such as is proposed in this Bill for the numbers who are unemployed.  There is no question about that, but of very serious concern is the ability of the Government on the economic side. Social planning is excellent as long as one has economic expansion. Economic expansion means rising and expanding social development running parallel with it.  In the present situation where we have unemployment <Col N="265" /> continuing at a high level it is quite clear the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary can do no more than come in here with <i>ad hoc</i>, stop-gap measures of this kind designed to deal with an emergency situation and not even deal adequately with it, as I mentioned earlier on.  It is because the Government have failed to tackle the root of the problem, which is inflation, have failed to come up with a plan for employment by giving the required incentives such as bringing in disincentive taxation proposals, have failed to stimulate the economy, that we are faced with the necessity for these emergency measures.</P>
    <P>In so far as it is dealing with the problem the Bill is welcome.  In so far as no effort is being made to get to the root of the problem, which is the Government's fiscal, financial and economic policies, then we must deplore the situation.  We must go back to the thinking that economic development and expansion and incentives to stimulate the economy are all-important if we are going to have a progressive social charter for all the less well-off people and for everybody who is unfortunate in his or her passage through life.  We cannot have a comprehensive social charter that will guarantee complete equality not just in regard to benefits in the limited sense under social welfare but also in regard to health and education; we cannot have such a charter ensuring that people, from birth to death, are adequately catered for in every respect, unless we get our priorities right.  Our priorities at present must be to get the economic machine moving again to create the situation where the cake gets bigger and out of that cake we can give to all our people equal and fair redistribution.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a situation where we kill incentive by taxation proposals, where there is no encouragement to invest and to work, if we are to have a policy of unemployment rather than employment, we will see much more of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare.  I am sorry that that is the situation.  Obviously one cannot do anything in the present economic climate except introduce <Col N="266" /> stop-gap measures of that kind.  We should have proper social planning, the need for which the Parliamentary Secretary pays some lip service to here in the course of his contribution.  I agree fully with that.  This sort of comprehensive social planning which would provide for the greatest equality of opportunity we can get, and which I would envisage as being appropriate in any civilised community, but is just not possible until we get the economic machine moving again.</P>
    <P>While the Bill itself, is needed to ameliorate the disastrous situation in which unemployed people find themselves, it is a symptomatic of the total economic and financial mess in which we find ourselves and of the total bankruptcy of ideas which exists in the present Government.  What we are getting here is just staving off the evil day. It is, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, enabling people to keep their heads above water for another three months at a reduced rate in an inflationary period.  It does nothing more than that.  For that morsel we are thankful, but it in no way represents either a comprehensive approach towards the economic situation or towards the social welfare development to which the Parliamentary Secretary, according to what he has said on this Bill aspires.</P>
    <P>We want action from the Government, a bit of positive thinking and planning ahead both in the social and economic areas, rather than just stop-gap measures that are welcome in themselves but do not really go to the root of our economic and social problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that all the Members of the House will be very grateful for that extremely honest speech of Senator Lenihan.  It is probably the cleverest articulation I have heard in a long time of a certain philosophy, which I happen to regard as a dangerous one and which up to now has remained hidden.  He used a number of images which are extremely important, and I think that his last one was the best.  He spoke of the Minister's Bill as a morsel.  Yet earlier on, being consistent in his images he <Col N="267" /> had spoken of the national cake.  He told us in stark terms that a person can have the social welfare code when the economy can afford it.  He has put it into the record that we will have a social welfare code when the economy is in expansion.  He is a very honest man and is primarily committed to the private enterprise economy.  He is saying that we will allow people like the Parliamentary Secretary to develop what he referred to as a social welfare charter.  When profits have been generated it is people like the Senator who should be referring to their contributions as offering morsels.  That has been the approach of traditional economics, to offer crumbs to those who created the real wealth of this country. It is the classic private enterprise, capitalist viewpoint.  As I said, the House should be extremely grateful to Senator Lenihan for stating it.  At least we know now where we stand.</P>
      <P>We should be grateful too, to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare for stating the completely opposite viewpoint.  He has said in his speech in the Dáil and in his speech here this morning that he regards the receipt of benefits a matter of right that is not negotiable across the table of private enterprise profit.  In that he is correct.  It is quite pointless for many of us in this House to be pretending that you can reconcile those viewpoints.  You cannot.  You must come down on the side of investment profit maximisation, on the one hand, or on the side of people being accorded their rights, on the other hand.  The Parliamentary Secretary has quite correctly chosen the second opinion, and I am glad he has done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lenihan made a number of extremely important points.  He suggested that the Bill was a stop-gap measure and had to be considered in the general context of economic planning and the relationship of the structure of the economy to the social welfare services.  I respond to the invitation contained in his speech. I believe that social values and objectives must always precede economic decisions.  That is the <Col N="268" /> policy of the party of which the Parliamentary Secretary and I are members. We are committed to using the economy, in the short-term, to alleviate the immediate distress of the most vulnerable categories of the population.  We are, over a longer period, committed to ensuring equality of participation in all aspects of life to all members of the nation. The party to which Senator Lenihan belongs are committed to allowing people to participate when profits have first been assured.  The difference is a clear one.  The House has benefitted greatly by this fine clarification.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan referred to the discussion on the sterling link as a gimmick.  The relationship with the £ sterling, the idea, for example, of floating the Irish pound&mdash;or more accurately, as it has been proposed on the Order Paper, of establishing a commission to discuss that matter&mdash; is not a gimmick.  It is something that is urgent: it should be discussed. There was an ugly side to the speech also.  Not only were we told that the only way of expanding the social welfare expenditure was by expanding the national cake but we were told that it was dangerous to go for increased social welfare expenditure at a time when increased State revenue could not be guaranteed.  And, of course, this is dangerous thinking also.  It is not dangerous thinking if one is committed towards elevating the position of those in the vulnerable categories.</P>
    <P>Remember what the Minister for Social Welfare inherited.  I recall very well the Kilkenny report on poverty: I have referred to this on many occasions.  It is a great reflection on all of us to belong to a society that had sent one family in four and one child in five to bed in conditions of relative poverty.  By relative poverty I mean an income of something under £800 per annum.  This is the situation the Minister inherited. Therefore, the Minister had to make a decision.  What was he to do?  Was one to allow this drift to continue and as the economy galloped along to drop off more crumbs to an ever-increasing mass of the poor?  The <Col N="269" /> numbers of the poor were increasing &mdash;widows, people on low incomes and people with large families.</P>
    <P>The Minister decided to separate the project of eliminating poverty from economic expansion, as it was conceived up to that time.  He is right, at a time of present difficulties, to hold fast to that decision.  He is honouring the position of his Party in the short term.  It is the position of our Party ultimately to remove the great sources of inequality and, in the short term, to eliminate distress. Therefore, any suggestion that we can afford measures, when the economy is going again, are simply &ldquo;not on&rdquo;. We may all have to suffer to some extent if we are to raise the standard of the people who are in the worst categories of poverty.  I invite the Members on the other side of the House to be just as willing to share that experience as the people on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the other House, said that he was anxious that this legislation would come into effect as quickly as possible because it affects people in real need.  At this stage I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for drawing attention to the necessity for establishing monitoring groups on the poverty action programme. This is a matter of extreme importance.  I do not mean monitoring it with a view to cutting back on our attack on poverty at some stage but with a view to assessing the adequacy of our strategy.  Poverty programmes, generally, have a number of stages. One first assesses the extent of poverty; then one develops a strategy and then one implements it.  It is necessary, as has been the experience of other countries, that we should establish research groups to monitor performance.  The Minister in the third paragraph on page 10 of his speech, adverts to this when he mentions the importance of the research element of the work programme of the National Commission pilot schemes to combat poverty.</P>
    <P>I am very grateful to the Minister and to the Parliamentary Secretary for adverting to another important point.  That is the great danger there <Col N="270" /> is at present of attacking those who are in receipt of benefits to which they are entitled as a matter of right. This can be done very insidiously: it can be done very blatantly.  It can be done insidiously by those who make speeches of the following kind: &ldquo;The economy is in a terrible state; yet the social welfare bill is so high&rdquo; leaving unsaid the obvious conclusion&mdash;how dare you expand the social welfare services at a time of economic difficulty?</P>
    <P>There are the people who come out in the open and suggest that benefits are too high, as they have done in Galway City, even chambers of commerce. An individual counsellor said that it is now more profitable for people to draw benefits than to work. That kind of comment needs to be nailed at the very beginning.  Anybody who is drawing benefit, as the Minister points out, is drawing it as a matter of right.</P>
    <P>I refer to that section of the Minister's speech in the other House where he sensitively describes this kind of smear.  In referring to comments made by Deputy Meaney in the Dáil, I am quoting from column 1971, Volume 280, of the Official Report of 14th May, 1975.  On that occasion the Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how people can welcome a Bill and at the same time object, in the terms in which Deputy Meaney objected, to those payments being made to people who would be better off working.  Of course they would.  Nobody would more prefer to be working than they would.  If a man is unfortunate enough to be unemployed or to suffer from a prolonged illness he is not, in my opinion, the recipient of a handout....</P>
    <P>Further on in the paragraph he says:</P>
    <P>He is entitled as of right to get sufficient benefit to provide in a reasonable way for his wife and his children during those periods that quite a large number of working men suffer during the course of their working lives.</P>
    <P>This kind of talk and loose <Col N="271" /> generalisation does a lot of damage. One might be annoyed at outside people, who in some cases are described in very loose terms as leading industrialists who make general statements and when they are asked to be more specific, back away.  If they quote figures, on examination the figures are found to be inaccurate. While that is regrettable it is far more regrettable that Opposition Members of the House are apparently insinuating the same things.  They have an opportunity of readily examining how the scheme works.  They know that built into the operation of the scheme it is not possible, except in highly selective, isolated instances, for a person to get more money when unemployed that he would when employed.  The only instance which comes to mind is the case of a husband, wife and two children.</P>
    <P>If that man is earning £20 a week and becomes unemployed he gets £20.80 from social welfare.  I do not regard that as a reflection on the operation of the social welfare system.  I regard it as a reflection on some of the employers we have in Ireland who will ask a man to work for £20 a week.  That is where the examination should take place, not within the social welfare system. That is where the criticism should be directed and not towards the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>We have had a clear confrontation: social welfare as a residue of a profit-motivated economy from that side of the House and, in the Minister's speech, the defence of a right of those who receive benefits to receive them as a matter of right and to receive them quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill and will be happy to assist its passage through the House.  We regret that this Bill appears to be the only measure that has stemmed from this present Coalition Government to deal with the problem of unemployment. Senator Higgins in his speech gave a variety of views which he claimed he held and, more particularly, he <Col N="272" /> claimed that we on this side of the House held.  He claimed that Senator Lenihan said in the course of his speech: &ldquo;You can have your social welfare code when the nation can afford it.&rdquo;  I do not think that is how Senator Lenihan put the point.</P>
      <P>There is a point here that members of the Labour Party would be well advised to appreciate.  The way in which the budget for 1975 is working out shows very clearly the folly of trying to spend money when it is not there.  As Senator Lenihan pointed out the deficit today on this year's budget up to May 9th is £82 million higher than the equivalent deficit for the corresponding period last year.  If the situation continues, as seems likely, we would appear to be faced either with a very grave monetary crisis amounting almost to national bankruptcy or else, within the very near future, some form of supplementary budget.  It is quite clear from the way in which the budgetary figures have been going that something of this kind will happen.</P>
      <P>To say that you can have a social welfare code when the nation can afford it is merely a way of saying that no Government can indefinitely continue spending money unless the country is in a position to produce that money.  Governments do not spend their own money.  It is not a case of Ministers handing out large cheques out of their own pockets. Governments can only spend money in so far as they can get it ultimately from the pockets of the taxpayers who include workers and even members of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Higgins made a remarkable statement: &ldquo;Social considerations must always precede economic factors&rdquo;.  I should have thought a better way of putting it would be: social considerations must always be dependent on economic factors.  It is easy for the Government to claim to have a social conscience.  A social conscience is much better expressed by putting people to work than by carrying out policies which put people out of work and then introducing Bills such as this in order to pay them part of their ordinary wage while they <Col N="273" /> are out of work.  In Fianna Fáil we have always held that we have a social conscience.  The workers of the country have accepted this fact at election times by voting for us in much larger numbers than for any other party, including the Labour Party.  It was social conscience that was reflected in an anxiety to see that our own people were able to find adequately paid work at home.</P>
    <P>When this Government came into office we had a situation such that while unemployment was clearly far higher than we liked to see it, nonetheless it was considerably lower than it is today.  For the first time in well over a hundred years we had reached the situation where emigration had declined to nothing.</P>
    <P>We have 103,000 people unemployed. We have long-established factories closing day after day.  Inflation in the last three months was equivalent to an annual rate of some 36 per cent.  Allowing for some slackening in this appalling rate of 8 per cent in three months which would be equivalent to around 36 per cent per year I think it would be generally accepted that we would be very fortunate this year if we achieved an inflation rate of only 25 per cent.  In any previous year a figure like this would have been looked on as a national disaster.</P>
    <P>We have a Government, which apart from making speeches prophesying doom and disaster, take no action to deal with the situation.  We have Ministers, from the Minister for Finance downwards, making it clear as the months go by that they are hoping against hope that other countries will take the necessary measures to deal with the inflation situation, the unemployment situation, the balance of payments problems, in order that world conditions and European conditions will improve to such an extent that it will be reflected in our own economic problems.  They hope to be able to avoid taking measures which will be politically unpopular and that other people elsewhere will take these measures and that it will be reflected here automatically.</P>
    <P>This Bill comes as the only contribution <Col N="274" /> to the problem of the unemployed. It has been rushed before the Oireachtas in order to pay some little extra to those who have been unemployed for six months or longer.  One would like to think that it was merely the social conscience of the Government at work: one fears, on the contrary that it was the political awareness of the Government that lies behind this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in his opening speech said it would cost £1.8 million this year.  How many people will be covered by this sum?  How many workers will be getting additional benefits under this Bill?  Why is it necessary under section 3 to reduce still further the income of these unfortunates who have been out of work for six months or longer?  Why is it necessary to cut the rates to be paid under this scheme from 40 per cent to 30 per cent?</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand the reasoning behind this proposal.  Clearly the people concerned, who have been out of work for six months or longer, are in a position that any small savings they may have had have been exhausted.  They have to rely entirely on their social welfare payments.  They may have run into a certain amount of debt.  After six months they would need an increase rather than suffer a decrease.  Yet their payments are being reduced from 40 per cent to 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>One could understand this action being taken, even if one did not approve of it, if it was because of a shortage of money or because the funds of the pay-related benefit fund were such that it was impossible, without some further increase in taxation, to make these payments. The Parliamentary Secretary in his speech states:</P>
    <P>It is expected that the existing contribution income will be sufficient to meet the cost of the improvement and it is not therefore proposed to increase the existing contribution rate.</P>
    <P>In other words, these increased sums provided for in the Bill, the 30 per cent, would not involve any increase in the contribution.  Equally, they will <Col N="275" /> not involve any fall in the existing fund.  If, as the Minister, after many questions were put to him, unwillingly told the Dáil there is a surplus in the fund at present of no less than £7 million and if the Parliamentary Secretary is correct in his opening statement this £7 million surplus will not be decreased by the passing of this Bill, it is impossible to conceive why it has been decided in section 3 to reduce payments from 40 per cent to 30 per cent.  Even if to maintain the 40 per cent were to mean some marginal drop in this large surplus of £7 million, it would be entirely justified.  Obviously statements will again be made on the Committee Stage but for the present I shall confine myself to saying that it seems an outrageous measure and totally unjustified by the financial position of the fund.</P>
    <P>It is especially so in view of the fact that it must be linked with the normal cut in unemployment benefit which takes place after six months.  A worker unemployed for six months has incurred debts and any assets he may have had have long since been dissipated.  After six months he will get a cut in the basic rate of benefit and on top of that, under the provisions of this Bill, for no financial reason that one can divine, his benefit will be cut from 40 per cent to 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out that the average industrial wage at present is £43 per week. Taking the figures which the Parliamentary Secretary gave in his introductory speech and making allowance for the effects of inflation in the six months during which the workers covered by this Bill have been out of work, the proportion of the normal income of a worker with a wife and two children would be about 60 per cent; he has taken a cut of about 40 per cent anyway. His payment is being reduced still further because I presume, the effect of this legislation will be to cut his payment from 60 per cent of normal to about 50 per cent.  This seems totally unjustified and it does not in any sense <Col N="276" /> accord with the type of social conscience which our Labour colleagues proclaim the present Government have.</P>
    <P>Apart from that aspect and one or two others which I shall raise on Committee Stage, we on this side of the House welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome an opportunity of making some remarks on this Bill.  It is tragic that the Government have found it necessary to introduce such a Bill at a time when there are thousands of people unemployed who otherwise, instead of joining dole queues, would be making their contribution to the building of the economy.  Those people are frustrated and uneasy at the present time. The object of this Bill would appear to be the easing of tensions under which the unemployed must live at present.</P>
      <P>Senator Higgins, spoke about the right to work: we all agree on this right.  At the time of creation, God said man had the right to earn his bread.  Therefore the Government should make more positive efforts to create jobs and reduce the unemployment figures.  It is the duty of the Government to look after the weaker sections of the community.  I agree that this Bill is introduced for that purpose but it is only a stop-gap measure aimed at supplementing the benefit of the unemployed.  That is not enough: workers today need assurances for the future.</P>
      <P>We must try to imagine what the thinking of the unemployed person is at present.  He lives in a state of frustration; he looks to the Government for guidance and leadership.  This Bill is not the answer to his serious plight.</P>
      <P>Senator Higgins devoted much of his speech to an attack on Senator Lenihan.  He did not spell out the alternatives not did he give any assurances to the unemployed as to what their position might be in future.  Therefore, while this Bill will be welcomed by the unemployed, it is not adequate to restore confidence to a section of the community which has done so much to build up the economy.  Workers, by their skills and efforts, have contributed in no small measure to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> In 1973, we had a very stable economy.  It was stated that social welfare benefits were inadequate then but they were sufficient at that time because of the low rate of unemployment, because the cost of living was held in check and because we had not the galloping inflation we are experiencing now.  A great many things have happened in those two years.  The value of the £ has continued to fall and the rate of inflation has increased significantly.  People wonder where it will all end.  Will the £ have any value in future?  Will the pay-related benefits which the worker receives each weeek enable him and his family to exist. Something more positive is needed at present.  It is the duty of the Government to wake up to their responsibilities and ensure that the economy is put on an even keel with the creation of more jobs so that we can have a declaration of confidence again.</P>
    <P>The workers in no uncertain manner have contributed greatly to the improvement of our economy over the years.  Therefore, they should be given an opportunity to play their full part as Irishmen in the rebuilding of this nation.</P>
    <P>It will take years to get the economy back to where it was in 1973 because we are caught up in galloping inflation, which is not being checked.  No effort is being made to curb price increases. There is no good blaming outside sources for all our ills.  Positive and real measures are needed to get these people off the dole queues, back into employment and to ensure that there will be no need for any further extension of pay-related benefit.  This is only a stop gap measure, a temporary arrangement to stave off the evil day.  It is the duty of the Government, who are responsible for the running of our economy, and for our national housekeeping, to ensure that no effort is spared to get those people off the dole queues.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measure as a temporary solution to the serious problems which confront the thousands of people who are unemployed.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary has something more to offer them than this temporary measure which will <Col N="278" /> extend pay-related benefits, because that is not the answer to our real problems.  As I said, the answer to the real problem is getting people back to work and allowing them to play their part in rebuilding the economy.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the introduction of these extended proposals for the payment of pay-related benefits to our insured community.  Unlike Senator Keegan, I would not look on it as a temporary measure.  For many years the trade union and Labour movement have been calling out for the introduction of pay-related benefit. This does not relate only to unemployment, it also covers a substantial number of our insured working population who become ill or are injured in their employment.  This was the idea behind the 1974 Act and for far too long has been delayed.  The extension is very welcome.  The vicious criticisms we have heard on this Bill came from those who never suffered unemployment or deprivation themselves. I congratulate the Minister and hope this will not be of a temporary nature but will be a permanent feature of our social welfare structure.</P>

      <P>I regret that there are no Fianna Fáil Senators here at the moment, particularly those who have contributed so far to this debate, as I would like to reply to some of the issues raised.  I have always found it difficult, and particularly since coming into the Department of Social Welfare, to understand the neglect over a long period in that field.  This morning's contributions by some Fianna Fáil Senators have given me a better insight into why that neglect went on for so long.  They referred to this as an <i>ad hoc</i>, an emergency measure, and a temporary measure, because of the large numbers unemployed at the moment, although even that in my view is somewhat distorted. This Bill, as I stated in my opening remarks, is not a temporary measure. It is a planned extension of the social welfare code, as this Government see that code.  It is designed towards the stated goal of this Government to achieve a fully comprehensive social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> When Deputy Lenihan made his contribution I was somewhat taken aback by his approach.  Frankly I had always regarded Senator Lenihan in the context of Fianna Fáil as a reasonably liberal young man, with reasonably liberal views, but after listening to his contribution I can only come to the conclusion that his political associates at the European level have not done anything to extend any liberal views he may have had.  Senator Lenihan's view was summed up when he spoke about the national cake.</P>
    <P>Under the administration of which Senator Lenihan was a very prominent Minister, their main preoccupation was not the size of the national cake but how that cake was divided.  Under that administration, the size of the slice of the cake for the people we are discussing here today&mdash;the recipients of unemployment or sick benefit&mdash;was very very small indeed.  We agree, of course, that it is in the interests of all citizens that the size of the cake should be as big as possible.  We are equally concerned as to how that cake is divided.  In my view the slices for the poorer sections of the community have been considerably larger since March, 1973, than they were in previous years.</P>
    <P>When speakers referred to this as an emergency measure, I do not think they have taken into consideration that this does not only apply to the unemployed; it applies to people in receipt of disability benefit and maternity benefit.  The percentage paid of pay-related benefit in respect of disability is 47 per cent.  There would not seem to be any objection&mdash;and I noticed this in the other House as well&mdash;to people being unemployed as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned as long as it brings immediate economic hardship and difficulties to the unemployed or sick worker.  Their philosophy seems to be that workers must have this incentive.  If they cannot obtain work or if they cannot work because they are ill, it is necessary that there must be this incentive <Col N="280" /> of hardship and want immediately visited upon the home of that worker.</P>

      <P>This Bill extends the period of eligibility for payment by 50 per cent.  We have heard that Fianna Fáil introduced the pay-related scheme, in 1972.  They introduced many schemes but they did not administer them.  They did not administer this scheme.  When they introduced it they cut off eligibility for pay-related benefit after 24½ weeks.  This Bill is continuing the period of eligibility for a further three months, a 50 per cent increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil speakers have suddenly become extremely liberal in the benefits they would give to workers who are either unemployed or sick.  The workers are as conscious as I am that Fianna Fáil had 30-odd years to put their liberal expressions of generosity into practice, but they did not do it. <Col N="281" /> This Bill, apart from extending the eligibility period for three months, gives to workers who are unemployed either through unavailability of work or through disability, an increase for that three-month period of up to £10.80 per week.  Despite attempts to distort that, that will be clearly seen by the people most interested and concerned &mdash;those who will receive the extended benefits provided in the Bill.</P>
    <P>When I try to find an answer to the neglect in the social welfare field over the years and reflect on the contributions made by Fianna Fáil speakers, both here and in the Dáil I get the answer that Fianna Fáil see this Bill as a matter of political expediency They cannot get away from that. That is the way they operated social welfare, not as a matter of right or as an approach towards social evils in our society, but as a matter of political expediency.  They think the only reason we introduced this Bill was because there are large numbers unemployed at the moment.</P>
    <P>We heard from Senator Lenihan his approach to social welfare and the extension of social welfare.  In fact, one could ask, from his contribution, if he was prepared even to maintain it at its present level until things became better.  We know things have been better, and they have been considerably better, for a certain section of our society.  How much better must they get in Senator Lenihan's view, and in the view of some of his colleagues, before we even make a start towards social justice for those people who have not enjoyed the fruits of the boom we hear about under Fianna Fáil.  The boom was there for very limited numbers of people, not for the general public&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When we look at the situation that exists right across Europe, and indeed beyond Europe, we see that there is an economic recession. Very strong economies have suffered.  Statistics are there to show that they have suffered even more severely than we have.  Their rate of unemployment has grown much higher and much more rapidly than ours.  Compare that with the situation from 1945, through the 1940s the 1950s and the 1960s.</P>
      <P>I know Senators do not like listening to the truth.  I have heard that over and over again.  Unfortunately when Senators raise issues they must listen to the replies.  There was a boom in all the European countries after the war, with one slight interruption in the middle 1950s.  In some countries they had practically full employment, especially all the Scandinavian countries. Other countries had very limited numbers of people unemployed.  During that period, under Fianna Fáil we accepted as normal and apparently acceptable to that administration the figure of 65,000 and 70,000 people unemployed, 6 per cent or 7 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Naturally, we are concerned about the large numbers unemployed.  The figure of 60,000 or 70,000 which was taken as a normal figure for unemployment by the previous administration is not acceptable to this administration.  If we have to have unemployment and if we cannot make the strides we would like, because of a number of factors including outside influence, we have an obligation to ensure that, to the best of our ability, unemployed persons and their families are cushioned against the worst economic evils of their situation.  This Bill makes a considerable contribution towards that end.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 9, to delete &ldquo;thirty&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;forty&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The two amendments in the names of Senator Yeats and me incorporate much the same principle.  If the fund is in credit to the extent of £7 million, as the Parliamentary Secretary said in the Dáil, and having regard to the inflationary position in which we now find ourselves, with decreasing value of currency and the rising cost of living, it seems anomalous that the Parliamentary Secretary, who talks in rather emotive terms about social welfare, should permit a situation in which it is written into the Bill that the benefit should be 30 per cent for the three month period following on the six month period in which 40 per cent is allowable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Yeats, will talk on the second amendment that is being taken with this.  There is no such provision in section 5, and we are suggesting that by way of order, having regard to the deteriorating rate of the Exchequer returns, the Minister may make a further extension period of three months on the nine months in respect of an infinitesimal rate of 10 <Col N="285" /> per cent or 20 per cent or something of that kind.  In case something of that nature is in the Minister's mind, Senator Yeats has tabled a further amendment proposing that if there is an extension beyond nine months, it would be not less than 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>What we are saying here is, in effect, in an inflationary situation if the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government are consistent in their devotion to the principle of social welfare, and consistent with the remarks from Senator Higgins&mdash;we heard it in the Dáil from Government spokesmen advocating this measure&mdash;it must be in the direction of maintaining the existing statutory figure of 40 per cent rather than writing into section 3 30 per cent.  If there is any progressive social attitude being adopted by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government it should be that any such extension should be of the order originally proposed in the Fianna Fáil Bill.</P>
    <P>We originally proposed that we would have a gradual improvement and extension of the pay-related scheme introduced by Deputy Brennan which passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas before the last election. It was quite clear at that time that the purpose of the pay-related scheme introduced in that measure was that there would be progressive improvements. We have a situation here where there is a disimprovement being proposed by a Labour Party Parliamentary Secretary, extending the period by three months but reducing the actual payment to be made from 40 per cent to 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the proposed extension in section 5, to be made by ministerial order, is in no way delimited to the basis of 40 per cent that was established in the original Bill.  Therefore, an extension beyond nine months, depending on the state of the Exchequer, could be of the order of 10 per cent, 15 per cent or 20 per cent.  We propose to fix the figure in regard to pay-related benefits at 40 per cent. That is what I would call practical socialism, and not the sort of mealymouthed socialism that proposes a <Col N="286" /> reduction in the percentage, first of all, under section 3, and under section 5 gives <i>carte blanche</i>, in any further extension to the Minister to order any percentage that the Minister at the time may think fit, in consultation with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>With the Exchequer returns now down by £82 million as compared to this time last year, perhaps there is some reason for section 5 being left open.  Apart from the Exchequer situation&mdash;that merely reflects the flat rate contribution situation that will arise in regard to the fund&mdash;the Minister says the fund is in credit to the extent of £7 million, and I wonder if by the end of the year, with this continuing charge on the fund, a minus situation will arise by the end of 1975.</P>
    <P>If the Exchequer return situation is reflected in the employee and employer contributions to the social welfare fund, which it inevitably will be having regard to the maintenance of the level of employment of 103,000, I can see some reason behind what the Parliamentary Secretary suggests.  It should be made quite clear that what the Parliamentary Secretary has in this Bill is a measure to hedge in and reduce pay-related benefits by 10 per cent for the extension period of three months and also to give authority to the Minister for Social Welfare, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, to allow any percentage he may wish having regard to the deteriorating economic situation.  These are basic facts and cannot be denied.</P>
    <P>As a speaker for a party that can claim to have more trade union support than any other party in the State, I accordingly move that, consistent with that support of ours and our approach towards the people who work and who, unfortunately in many cases, were made redundant by reason of Government economic policies, a 40 per cent floor be established.  Once it has been established in legislation, that 40 per cent floor should be maintained as far as pay-related benefits are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal first with amendment No. 2 in my own name.  In section 5 there are two <Col N="287" /> matters of principle that arise.  First of all, there is the question of the amount.  Senator Lenihan dealt with this in some detail.  I shall come back to it.  It is highly undesirable that the Minister should have the power by order to vary indefinitely the rate to be paid under social welfare legislation. He could fix it at 100 per cent or he could fix it at 10 per cent.  There is, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, an immense and complicated mass of social welfare legislation, all of which has been through both Houses of the Oireachtas and debated in detail over the past 20 or 30 years.  We have a situation here which is totally undesirable and quite contrary to good parliamentary practice.  We provide in this section that the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, can fix any rate he likes, whether it be higher or lower than the rates prevailing in the existing legislation.  It is quite wrong. As a House of Parliament I do not think we should approve of a provision of this kind.  It is an important matter to which we should have regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that point of principle, there is the general question of the actual amount that is fixed in section 3 which we feel, should also be fixed in section 5.  As things stand, in the first six months a worker is unemployed he is entitled to 40 per cent of all his wages over £14.  On the computation given to us by the Parliamentary Secretary, and allowing for the effective inflation in the six months during which the worker has been unemployed&mdash;in the current six months one can assume that the cost of living will have gone up by between 12 per cent and 15 per cent: I am taking into account the Parliamentary Secretary's computation&mdash;it would seem that a worker with a wife and two children, earning the prevailing average industrial wage of £43, is getting at the moment, up to the end of the six month period, around 60 per cent of his former wages.  That at least enables the family to live without experiencing starvation.  But clearly a 40 per cent <Col N="288" /> drop in income is a very serious matter for any family.</P>
    <P>It can be assumed when six months has elapsed that any assets the family have may have been dissipated, and at a time when it would seem likely that the family concerned will have gone into debt, we find the Parliamentary Secretary cutting the figure from 40 per cent to 30 per cent.  The reasoning for this is difficult to follow particularly since the Parliamentary Secretary has so far not given any reasoning for it. In his speech he states:</P>
    <P>It is expected that the existing contribution income will be sufficient to meet the cost of the improvement...</P>
    <P>In other words, in order to pay 30 per cent for a further three months&mdash;and whatever further sum he expects to fix for the three months after that&mdash;the existing contribution income will be sufficient.  Therefore, the £7 million surplus in the fund need not be touched.  I have some doubts on this and I will raise them when dealing with the section.  The Parliamentary Secretary has told us there is no need to interfere with the £7 million surplus.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances it is difficult to follow why there is a deliberate cut from 40 per cent to 30 per cent.  The Parliamentary Secretary is not answering this by going back to 1945 or 1955 or 1965 or by saying what Fianna Fáil did or previous Coalition Governments.</P>
    <P>The Coalition are now in office: they are no longer in Opposition. These kinds of catch-cries will not solve the problem.  The Parliamentary Secretary is now in charge of Social Welfare.  He is piloting this legislation through the House and it is not a sufficient answer to a query as to why he has fixed a figure of 30 per cent to refer to what happened in 1945 or 1955.  He is now in office and responsible for these matters.  We are entitled to be told, in view of the fact that there is a £7 million surplus&mdash;he tells us it will not be touched by the provisions in this Bill&mdash;why in these circumstances a worker who has already been unemployed for six months should be subjected to a further cut in his standard of living.</P>

It is very hard to reconcile Senator Lenihan's amendment with his contributions in this House earlier this month on the Finance Bill.  On that occasion he implied that one of the reasons why we had numbers of people unemployed was that the benefits they were receiving were too generous under this particular scheme and there was no incentive for them to be employed.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to reconcile that attitude with this amendment in Senator Lenihan's name.  It can only be reconciled when it is referred back to Senator Lenihan's contribution this morning on the Second Stage when he referred to political gimmicks.  In view of what he said in the current month in relation to pay-related benefits and the disincentives because of the generous payments to people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;this amendment undoubtedly comes into the category of political gimmicks to which the Senator referred this morning.  Senator Yeats reminded me that I am no longer in Opposition.  I did not really need reminding of that.  I have been very conscious of that in the last two years, particularly in the advances we have been able to make in several fields compared with the time when we were in Opposition.  It is relevant that we are in office, it is relevant to our approach to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a responsibility for the administration of the fund.  We have a responsibility to ensure that while extending the benefits from the fund to the fullest possible extent that it should be approached with a sense of responsibility. One of the consolations of <Col N="290" /> being in Opposition is that one does not have to be as responsible when putting down amendments and making political speeches, and during the course of the discussion on this Bill Fianna Fáil have taken full advantage of that.  It is difficult for me after spending so long in Opposition to begrudge them that form of consolation.</P>
    <P>The fund has been in operation only since April, 1974.  We have only 12 months experience of the operation of the fund.  Financially it is in a healthy state.  We have a responsibility to ensure that it stays in a healthy state. We have a responsibility to ensure that this fund will not meet the same fate as the Redundancy Fund under the Fianna Fáil administration.  I do not want to be unfair in saying that because Deputy Joe Brennan was then Minister for Social Welfare and Labour. As Minister for Labour he extended with all progressive intentions the benefits obtaining under that fund within a relatively short time following its establishment. The accounts appeared to have been in an extremely healthy condition, but following a short period of time after the increased benefits had been introduced the fund was on the brink of bankruptcy.  It was necessary for the then Minister for Labour, Deputy Brennan, to rush legislation through the House to save the fund from bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to take from the sincerity and good intentions of Deputy Brennan in his endeavours to provide better benefits from that fund but he lacked a degree of caution in making available to people what was their own money&mdash;after all, it is comprised of contributions from employers and employees&mdash;in his efforts to do things which at the time appeared popular. The Government's primary responsibility is to ensure that any extension of benefits be generous and provide as far as possible cushioning against the effects of unemployment or prolonged illness.  I accept the point made by Senator Yeats.  This is the difference between being in office and being in opposition&mdash;the Government have the responsibility to ensure that, in providing these extended benefits, it is <Col N="291" /> done in a manner which will not endanger the existence of the fund itself.  That is the approach the Government have taken which, in my opinion, is the proper and responsible one to be taken.</P>
    <P>As regards the other amendment on section 5, surely it is a highly irresponsible approach, even from the Opposition benches, to guarantee a minimum rate without knowing how the fund will operate and what will be the financial state of the fund before any further extension is granted?  Obviously, it would not be in the best interests of the workers to take that approach.  Whatever may be the view of Senator Yeats and his colleagues, our workers have ample reason for having sufficient confidence in the Minister for Social Welfare in the light of his activities over the last two years, that he will ensure that whatever rate might be struck in the future will be in their best interests.</P>
    <P>For those reasons, the amendments could not be accepted.  They should not be pursued because the matter under discussion is a serious one. Obvious political advantage should not be taken in putting down these types of amendments, in view of the speeches made in this and the other House by Fianna Fáil speakers, on the over-generosity of the present system of pay-related benefits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make this matter quite clear.  What we want in this Bill is a consistent application of principle.  As far as we are concerned, this Bill is an extension of the one introduced in both Houses of the Oireachtas and passed by the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Brennan.  We are very proud to be associated with the whole idea of pay-related benefit, which was designed to cope with an economy and society in which expansion and increasing employment was taking place.  It was designed to cope with the problem of workers in an interim period who move from one form of employment to another; that they be properly and adequately compensated in relation to the income they received from their <Col N="292" /> former employment.  It was in that context of an expanding economy that Fianna Fáil introduced this measure. The Government now propose this measure to increase the period from six to nine months.  We anticipated that as time progressed there would have to be improvements in regard to pay-related benefits.</P>
      <P>To put it mildly, it is anti-social for the Parliamentary Secretary to come into this House and suggest, in a period in which inflation and cost of living are rising at a rate of between 25 and 32 per cent, that in regard to pay-related payments there will be a reduction of 10 per cent from the sixth to the ninth month.  There is no point in a Labour Parliamentary Secretary coming into this House and trying to cloak himself in the guise of one who is responsible for the legislation. If the Government are to be consistent in their social attitude the 40 per cent floor should remain in regard to the extended three months or remain in regard to any Order extending the period further in the future.  This is the Fianna Fáil attitude.  It is completely in accordance with principle and we will adhere to it.  That the 40 per cent is fixed already in legislation.  What the Parliamentary Secretary now proposes is to reduce that figure by legislation for three months to 30 per cent and by way of order under section 5 if there is to be a further extension, which could be 10, 20 or 30 per cent, any percentage which fits in with the state of the fund at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My assessment of the situation at present is that following on the reduction in the Exchequer receipts&mdash;£82 million now compared to this time last year&mdash;a similar situation will arise before the end of the year in regard to the state of the social welfare fund. A situation will arise where in regard to the flat rate of contribution from employer/employee there will be a reduced contribution at both levels because of the continuing high rate of unemployment, now 103,000.  That is the reasoning behind what the Parliamentary Secretary is doing in the Bill. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to be honest and tell the House <Col N="293" /> that that is why he is doing it.  Otherwise, there is no other rationale for his action.  There was a surplus of £7 million in the fund as of 21st March. The accelerating inflation in April and May have already put that figure out of date.  The reality behind what the Parliamentary Secretary is doing is this.  Along with a diminishing Exchequer return situation, we are faced with a situation where the fund itself may run into bankruptcy.  For that reason the Parliamentary Secretary is now afraid to maintain the floor of 40 per cent, has reduced it to 30 per cent for the extra three months, quite clearly leaving himself open to a situation where, after nine months, by way of order he can award a 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent increase, or whatever minimal increase he can make in consultation with the Minister for Finance and that is in realistic accordance with the state of the fund at the appropriate time.  Those are the facts.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would come clean with the House and say those are the facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite frankly, I am somewhat shocked at that contribution from Senator Lenihan.  It puts in question the whole motivation behind this amendment.  What Senator Lenihan has said just now is that he is convinced that the contributions to maintain the fund are going to go steadily down; that the amount available to pay benefits in the fund is going to decrease very sharply over the next few months, and continue to do so, and, in the light of that&mdash;if he believes that to be true&mdash;he sponsors a resolution here to increase still further the benefits to be paid from the fund. The logic of that would appear to be that the purpose of this is to ensure that the fund goes bankrupt and there will be nothing to pay out, if one is to take the Senator according to his own contribution a moment ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it a very strange situation that Senator Lenihan puts down a motion looking for the benefits under this Bill to be further increased, although the provision we make under the Bill allows for an increase over a three-month <Col N="294" /> period of up to £10.80 per week.  The Senator wants that further increased although he is convinced that the amount which will be paid into the fund will decrease sharply and rapidly over the next few months and that the fund will get into financial difficulties. I find that very strange.  Irrespective of what side of the House one was on, one would expect and hope that, in these difficult times&mdash;and when I say difficult times I am referring not alone to the present economic circumstances but the difficult times in which workers have always found themselves as a contingency of being workers, whether through unemployment because of lack of employment or because of disability and prolonged illness&mdash;we all have a responsibility to ensure that whatever measures can be taken are taken to alleviate the economic difficulties experienced. In the light of what the Senator has said&mdash;and I hope I have misunderstood him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senator quoted what he thought was there on three occasions since 2.15 p.m.  For the reasons I have stated, this would not be a responsible thing to do.  Under the provisions of this Bill we are extending considerably&mdash;by 50 per cent indeed&mdash; the time limit for eligibility and the benefit increases for that extended period of three months are up to £10.80 per week.  But, in doing that, we must also ensure that the fund remains in a position to provide economic cushioning for workers against these contingencies.  I sincerely hope I will have the co-operation of all Senators in achieving that very desirable aim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly this part of the Bill relating to the 30 per cent is an embarrassment to the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is absolutely clear from the way in which he has been speaking, here and also in the other House, that it is an embarrassment to him and that he is extremely unwilling to answer. Instead of answering the points made, the Parliamentary Secretary stands up and reads all kinds of interpretations into what has just been said.</P>
      <P>I am not going to make any kind of speech that can be interpreted or misinterpreted. I am going to ask a few simple questions, then I shall sit down and I would be obliged if the Parliamentary Secretary would answer these basic questions of fact.  The Parliamentary Secretary himself has told us that the cost of this increase of 30 per cent will be £1.8 million in the year. Basic simple mathematics would suggest that if one changes that 30 per cent to 40 per cent one adds one-third to the cost, which is another £600,000 per year.  What I am putting to the Parliamentary Secretary is that, on his own arithmetic, the extra cost of accepting this amendment would be £600,000 annually.  The Minister has also said, not in this House but in the other House, that the fund at present is in surplus to the extent of £7 million. What I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;and I would be obliged if he would give a candid answer&mdash;is this. On his own figures accepting this amendment would cost £600,000, and if there is £7 million in surplus in the fund, is there any reason in the wide world why he should not accept the amendment and merely end up the year with £6,400,000 in surplus instead of £7 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to deal with that without going into the figures the Senator has given.  The fund has been in operation for a very limited period of time, 12 months in all.  I have quoted the experience of Deputy Brennan as Minister for Labour, in relation to a very similar fund and a very similar set of circumstances.  I do not believe it would be in the best interests of the people whom this Bill is intended to help merely to make <Col N="296" /> uneducated guesses as to the development of the fund.  I think the Senators have sufficient experience to know that 12 months operation of a fund is a very short time.  This is a completely new fund.</P>
      <P>It is a new approach to the payment of benefits and it would not be responsible not to proceed cautiously with the disbursement of this fund. The main reason the amendment is not acceptable is because it is not felt that it would be in the best interests of the people concerned.  Their best interest will be served by ensuring that the fund, which is in a financially healthy state, remains that way and not just linked to the present economic difficulties.  As I have said, workers in this country have faced these difficulties for prolonged periods down through the ages.  In fact 47 per cent of the expenditure from the pay-related benefit fund is not in respect of unemployment through unavailability of employment; it is in respect of disability benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course this last figure the Parliamentary Secretary has produced goes a considerable way to justifying this amendment.  He has pointed out that 47 per cent of expenditure under this scheme is not for unemployment at all, but for disability. The problem I can see he faces with regard to unemployment is that unemployment is very high. The Parliamentary Secretary suspects very strongly that it is going to go a great deal higher.  I suspect that that is perhaps the <i>rationale</i> behind this. The Parliamentary Secretary is afraid that the expenditure will increase still further.  That may or may not be. At any rate, with regard to disability, disability is a factor which remains relatively stable from year to year. Obviously it is not dependent on economic factors.  Clearly, in regard to the numbers of disabled this year, next year or the year after the differences will be relatively marginal. They are not dependent on what one hopes would be temporary economic problems.  On the other hand, the 53 per cent obviously relates directly to the present economic crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> On the face of the Parliamentary Secretary's own figures, the cost of this amendment&mdash;and he has not denied this; it is not a question of an educated guess or anything like that, it is based on the Parliamentary Secretary's own figures&mdash;would be £600,000 per year. I will raise this matter in more detail when we get to the section.  It seems to me, offhand, that the Parliamentary Secretary's estimate of £1.8 million is wildly optimistic and that the cost is likely to be a great deal more.  At the moment, and for the purposes of this amendment, we have to take the Parliamentary Secretary's statement at face value.  He tells us that the cost of this will be £1.8 million in the full year and that it will not involve any additional contributions&mdash;in other words, that the £7 million surplus will not be touched in any way.  Therefore, it is not a case of guessing or anything of that kind. On the Parliamentary Secretary's own figures, the cost of this amendment will be £600,000 to be taken out of a £7 million surplus.  It is on the Parliamentary Secretary's own figures and I suspect strongly that they are wrong. At any rate for the sake of discussion of this amendment we must take what he tells us which is that the total cost is £1.8 million and that the cost of accepting this amendment is £600,000.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand what is the problem.  Of course, in spite of all we hear about the social conscience and so on, essentially the position is that the Parliamentary Secretary and his Minister have behind them the hardy visage of the Minister for Finance. Apparently, the Parliamentary Secretary has been told that under no circumstances is he to do anything or accept anything which might, at some time in the future, even mean that 6p will come from the Exchequer for this scheme.  He talks about the bankruptcy of the scheme and so on as if it was a kind of national disaster.  All that would happen in the event of the scheme having solvency problems is that the Exchequer would have to come to its aid.  The Parliamentary Secretary's utter anxiety apparently is to ensure that at no time and under any possible circumstances will the Minister for Finance be asked for any <Col N="298" /> money.  With the budget in its present condition, of course, one can understand this.  But one cannot understand it in the light of the surplus that we know exists in the fund.</P>

      <P>Out of what is available in the fund.  If one has operated on a six-months basis and one has a certain surplus, one is not going to increase the contributions. At the same time if the period of eligibility is being extended by 50 per cent with increases in benefit over that period, naturally it must be paid for if it is not being got by contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not necessarily.  If we were to play fast and loose with the fund and it got into financial difficulties, again I refer back to the experience of Deputy Brennan as Minister for Labour&mdash;the Exchequer did not come to his aid.  As far as I know, the employer and the employees had to come very drastically to his aid to ensure that due to the lack of caution &mdash;and I shall leave it at that&mdash;on his part it was not the Exchequer was <Col N="299" /> asked to pay the piper for the irresponsible approach towards the fund; it was the employer and the employee. When I was here on the Social Welfare Bill earlier this year I heard about the savage increases being imposed on the employer and the employee.  Now we are being told by the same Senators who referred to savage increases: &ldquo;Go ahead, play fast and loose with the fund and, if it gets into difficulty, go back and levy an increase on the employer and employee.&rdquo;  It is not too much to expect a little consistency in relation to this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again the Parliamentary Secretary is on his good old hobby-horse of misinterpreting what one said.  I did not envisage the fund going broke; I suggested the Parliamentary Secretary was afraid that it might.  There is no difference in principle that I can see, in the event of any fund getting into difficulties, between the extra money needed being brought in from taxation or from weekly payments by workers and employers.  They are the people who pay the taxes anyway.  Ministers, whether they have a social conscience or not, do not drag money out of their pockets and hand it out; they call upon the taxpayer, the workers of this country, employers and so on to pay for these schemes.  Even if the fund were to go into deficit, those workers who are at present in difficult circumstances and still fortunately employed should contribute some relatively small amount to help those who are out of work over long periods.  In any event, on the figures of the Parliamentary Secretary, the cost of this amendment would be less than 10 per cent of the existing surplus.  Any deficit that may occur, I suspect, for other reasons than accepting this amendment.  He keeps on referring to the experience of a redundancy fund but the sums involved in respect of this amendment are so small relative to the total funds available to the scheme, that there is absolutely no comparison that can be made. It is a very marginal sum which makes a great deal of difference to the workers involved who are unemployed for long periods but could not on the <Col N="300" /> figures of the Parliamentary Secretary, make any serious difference to the viability of the fund.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the outcry from Fianna Fáil about the increases early this year in social welfare payments by workers.  He did not tell us that the sum involved at that time was £40 million per year. That is a very far cry from the £600,000 which is all that is involved in this case and the £600,000 which on his figures, can be taken out of a surplus more than ten times as much.  Not only did we have £40 million, but a number of millions of that were by way of a profit. In other words there was more than was needed by the increase in payments, it was to allow for a possible further increase in unemployment. It is a totally different situation.  It is a very heavy impact on workers, far higher than anything that could possibly result from this amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section I should like to go in more detail into some of the figures which the Parliamentary Secretary has produced for us and which I must confess that I do not at all understand.  He told me earlier in reply to a question that an estimated 22,000 people were to be affected by this.  The cost per year he tells us is £1.8 million.  If you give those 22,000 people even £1.50 a week &mdash;and one would certainly expect that they would get a great deal more than this as the Minister himself says the sums payable under this section come to £10.80 per week per worker, and I suppose a reasonable average would certainly be £5, £6, or £7 a week, per worker&mdash;spread over a year that comes to £1.8 million.  The Parliamentary Secretary will of course tell me that this is only for three months, but by the time the three months are up, unless there is a very considerable improvement in the unemployment figures given here, there will be further numbers who have gone on the list who will come under this.  If the figure now is 22,000, it seems very <Col N="301" /> likely, as more and more workers become unemployed for long periods, that it will increase rather than decrease.  Therefore I am totally unable to understand why, over a 12-month period, the figure should not be only £1.8 million.  It seems to me that, if you take an average of £7 per week, that is £154,000 per week, and if you spread that over a whole year, it comes to £7 million or £8 million. The figures simply do not add up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out, some 47 per cent of the payments are in respect of illness, disability. One can only give an estimate in relation to forecasting what the situation will be; it is done in the light of past experience and certain predictions. I am sure the Senator will realise that a number of people are out ill from work or are unemployed for relatively short periods.  It does not necessarily mean that all the people who will benefit from this Bill will benefit for the full period of eligibility.  Some people will be ill or unemployed for much shorter periods of time than others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Bill would appear to be a great deal less beneficial than it has been held out to be. The Parliamentary Secretary has been preening himself on bringing in a Bill which will pay people up to £10.80 per week over a period of three months and, under section 5, potentially over a period of six months, and whatever amount per week may be fixed by the Minister, presumably we can take it that six months will be the ultimate period under this Bill. The Parliamentary Secretary has been conveying a general assumption that figures of up to £10.80 per week will be paid to these 22,000 workers, or however many there may be at any particular part of the year.  It now seems that the average payment spread over a year for these workers will be only about £1.50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of the workers concerned, this Bill gives only a marginal benefit.  If the figures of £1.8 million are correct it will mean that only a relatively small number of people will get anything like the figures <Col N="302" /> of £7, £8, £9, £10 that the Parliamentary Secretary mentions.  Many others will either get nothing at all or very little.  However, if one takes the figure of 22,000, which is a much higher figure than I had expected, it is quite obvious that, if the Parliamentary Secretary is going to spend only £1.8 million, the sums per head will be very small indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we are back, on this particular point, to a little consistency, because Senator Yeats's argument now is consistent at least with the line that Fianna Fáil have taken in relation to the whole pay-related benefit scheme.  They seem to think that if workers are eligible for pay-related benefit they are going to stay out of work deliberately in order to qualify for the full period of eligibility.  What I have said bears out what I have been saying all along, that the vast majority of people here who are unemployed, for any reason, are unemployed either because they genuinely cannot get work or they are genuinely ill.  When that period of illness comes to an end the vast majority of them are only too anxious to get back to their employment.  They do not want, as some people would seem to think, to sit at home drawing pay-related benefit or any other kind of benefit.</P>

      <P>I accept the consistency of what is being said.  Senator Yeats dismisses the benefit under this Bill apparently because people do not qualify for it.  All people do not qualify for it for the full period of eligibility.  He seems to think less of the Bill because of that.  This Bill is designed to cater for a need and that need only arises, in my opinion, when people who are genuinely seeking employment and are anxious to be employed but for reasons outside their control, cannot be.</P>

      <P>One might not be unemployed for a full period of nine months.  That does not take away from the benefits under this Bill.  The fact that if one is ill and is fortunate enough not to be ill for a full period of nine months eligibility does not take away from those benefits.  One could envisage a man who was unemployed or ill for a period of eight weeks.  The normal worker, without this kind of financial cushioning and protection, can get into very heavy debt and great economic difficulties over what Senator Yeats apparently thinks is a very short time.</P>
      <P>Under the old system the situation of no wages or greatly reduced income over a period of eight to ten weeks created very severe financial difficulties for the ordinary working-class home.  They can survive relatively well under this system.  That is the purpose of the Bill.  That is the kind of circumstances that the Bill is meant to provide against.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to get back to some figures.  In passing legislation of this kind we have to consider the facts and figures involved.  I must assure the Parliamentary Secretary again that I am not expressing any views on philosophies, <Col N="304" /> principles or anything like that.  I am simply trying to get down to the basic financial implications of this Bill and, in particular, of this section. I should like him to listen to what I am saying and not what he would like me to say.</P>
    <P>He mentioned that there were approximately 22,000 people affected by this legislation.  As I understand it, if the average industrial wage is taken as £43.00 per week, each of those 22,000, assuming that he was on an average wage, would be getting approximately £7.00 per week under this section.  That would amount, in one single week, to £154,000.  A round figure of £150,000 is easier to remember. The Parliamentary Secretary is spending, under section 3, that amount per week.  After 12 weeks £1.8 million is gone.  I want to know, in the light of that, how can the Parliamentary Secretary claim that the total cost in a full year is going to be only £1.8 million? This is a simple question to which a simple answer ought to be available.  He need not worry about what my philosophy is.  I am just asking for a statement of the facts of the situation.  He says, on the one hand, that the effects of this Bill will be that it will cost £1.8 million in a full year. On the other hand, he is setting out to spend approximately £150,000 per week, or, in 12 weeks, £1.8 million. What is the explanation of this?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given the Senator the explanation.  Not everyone who goes out ill or who goes out unemployed remains out for the full period of eligibility.  Some people go out for three weeks sick, some for three months, some for nine months, and unfortunately some go out for well over the period of eligibility even under this Bill.  The same is true of unemployment.  Therefore the estimate is made in the light of experience of the normal duration of illness or unemployment.  It obviously cannot be a hard and fast figure.  I cannot elaborate any further on that for the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says that he cannot elaborate any further.  He has not elaborated <Col N="305" /> at all as far as I can see.  On section 2 of the Bill I asked how many were affected and he said approximately 22,000.  I think he means approximately 22,000 this week, and I presume that next week there will be 22,000.  They may not be the same 22,000.  Some may have gone out of benefit, some may have come into benefit.  When I asked that question he told me 22,000, and I would say he meant that at any particular time, this week, next week, next month it is expected that approximately 22,000 will be affected. I am not suggesting for a moment that they are necessarily the same 22,000 but the average number over a period that will be covered by this Bill is 22,000.  It does not matter whether they are the same people or not, they are still payments to be made under this Bill.  As I said an average of £7.00 per week which would seem to be a reasonable average, would mean £150,000 per week.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Whenever an order is proposed to be made under this section a draft of the proposed order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reason for the amendment is that it seems to us wrong in principle that a fundamental change in social welfare schemes should be made in this way.  Under the previous amendment we have a very wide and elaborate system of social welfare legislation which has been debated in both Houses over the past 30 years and an enormous mass of legislation which one hopes will be codified and consolidated.  Nonetheless, it has always been considered that social welfare schemes should be agreed to by each House.  Now under this section we have a situation where the Minister by order can extend the payments by three months and he can fix the weekly rate at any level that he and the Minister for Finance see fit. The Parliamentary Secretary can tell me that this section provides that an order may be annulled by either House, but I do not think&mdash;and the Parliamentary Secretary was long enough in opposition to be prepared to agree with me on this&mdash;that is much of a safeguard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hundreds of orders are made by Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries throughout the year.  The number that are debated in either House could be counted on one hand.  For practical purposes it means that the Minister has <Col N="307" /> complete control over this aspect of our social welfare legislation.  I think that is wrong in principle.  If we delete subsection (2) and substitute a subsection which retains to the Minister the power to extend by order the three months in the way he seeks, that requires that a draft of the order should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order should not come into force until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by both Houses.  In other words, it becomes a kind of subsidiary legislation.</P>
    <P>There are examples in other legislation, the most recent one being the Bill relating to youth employment, which is still before this House.  It has a very useful provision whereby certain orders made by the Minister shall be laid before the Houses in this way and shall not come into force until agreed to by both Houses.  It would not deprive the Minister in any way of the power he seeks under this section.  It would be just as flexible.  He would retain the parliamentary process, which is valuable.  I would suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary, with advantage, might accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the amendment in so far as there are a number of precedents for this type of provision in legislation.  It would allow the Minister to extend the period and the rate payable under pay-related benefits.  At the same time it would not take away from the right of the Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas the opportunity to discuss any extension or increase and indeed to annual it if they thought it desirable.  There are a number of Bills that have this provision. This one is to provide an increase for social welfare recipients. Another Bill which has this provision is the increases for Deputies and Senators which is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas for 21 sitting days, and it can be annulled.  It is reasonable that we should adopt the same approach towards increases for recipients under this Bill as we would for increases for ourselves.  If it is acceptable for ourselves surely it <Col N="308" /> is acceptable for recipients of social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that the example quoted by the Parliamentary Secretary is a very good one.  First of all, it relates to increases.  This section does not deal simply with increases.  It is a question of whether the sums under this Bill should be paid at all.  I doubt if Deputies or Senators would have agreed to the proposition that this should be done by order in future if some Minister were to be given the alternative of paying them or not.  This is more far-reaching in that way.  I would be more interested in any precedents the Minister might have in regard to social welfare legislation.  If there are such precedents I might regret them, but I suppose one has to have regard to them.  I would be glad to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary whether there are precedents in social welfare legislation for provisions of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are quite a large number of matters within the field of social welfare which can be amended or extended by way of Ministerial order or regulation.  I cannot recall the actual figure but it is a substantial number, running into the hundreds of items by order and regulation. One of the reasons I would offer to the Senator is that this provision would allow such increases or extensions of payment to take place during a period when the Dáil and Seanad were in recess.  That is another good reason why the provision in the Bill should be left the way it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the last one first, it is obviously a reason but I am not sure if it is good one, because if the Minister and the Government were doing their business they ought to be able to foresee that an extension of this kind would be necessary and ensure that it was brought into the Dáil and Seanad at a time when they were sitting. I can see that if the Government are doing their business in such a way that they never know until the week beforehand that they will need a provision of this kind, then they will ob viously need to have the maximun <Col N="309" /> flexibility to do it, if necessary in the middle of August.  A little bit of foresight would solve that problem.</P>
      <P>With regard to precedents in social welfare legislation, I am well aware that there are thousands of different provisions of social welfare legislation that can be changed by ministerial order.  It is one of the regrettable facts of life that one has to accept, that there are these innumerable provisions for subsidiary legislation, but I would like to know whether there is any single provision in the whole social welfare legislation where a Minister by order can decide that payments are to be made to certain social welfare classes and what those payments are to be.  It may be that there are many precedents.  I cannot think of any offhand, but I would be glad to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary whether there are any.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, there are hundreds of items that are dealt with under the social welfare code by Ministerial order and regulation.  One which comes to mind is this.  As the Senator is aware, among the provisions of this year's budget was a review of social welfare payments.  Not only were there increases last April but further increases this October.  Provision was made in the Social Welfare Bill, which came before this House earlier this year, to have the October increases paid by order.  It was assumed that both Houses of the Oireachtas would be in recess when the payments were due to be made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that qualifies as a relevant precedent.  This provision in the budget was required by the positively South American state of inflation in which we now are.  For the first time in our history it is impossible to fix social welfare payments on a once-a-year basis. Because costs are rising so rapidly it has to be done twice a year and <Col N="310" /> one hopes that next year it will not be three times a year.  Leaving aside the cause of this provision being inserted in the budget, this is not at all on all-fours with section 5 of the Bill.  These payments have already been made.  It is merely a matter of raising them by order in accordance with the increase in the cost of living between the budget and October 1st. Whatever the percentage increase it will be a known figure and therefore a known and easily assessable increase in social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>Section 5 is totally different.  Here we have the Minister in doubt as to whether to make these payments at all.  He may do nothing and the people concerned will get nothing from this Bill.  Or he may decide to pay them and he has absolute freedom as to the amount he will pay them, be it £20, £30 or 5p a week.  This section gives him complete authority.  I am convinced from what the Parliamentary Secretary says that there is no precedent over the past 50 years giving the Minister this type of power by order in social welfare legislation. In relation to this section where the Minister is given power to decide (a) whether he will pay anything and (b) complete power to decide how much he will pay, I do not believe there is any precedent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Senator let me finish?  I have given a well-established precedent in relation to increases for Members of the Oireachtas. The same conditions apply as the Senator has said.  The Minister for Finance decides if they get an increase or not.  He decides how much should be paid and when it should be paid. I have never heard any great objection to that procedure with regard to the Members of the Oireachtas.  Why must the precedent be confined to recipients of social welfare benefits? This allows the Minister to decide exactly <Col N="311" /> the same things and the same provision applies as regards both Houses of the Oireachtas annulling them as applies in relation to the other increases.  The same procedure applies in this Bill as applies in the case of other increases.  I am at a loss to know why the Senator is so insistent that the precedent must be confined to recipients of social welfare.  They are no different from us.  The precedent is there provided it is not isolated. There is also the advantage that if the Houses of the Oireachtas are not sitting there is no unnecessary delay in providing these extensions.  At the same time, the safeguards for Members of the Oireachtas are still enshrined in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says he is at a loss to understand the problem I have.  There is a basic and all-important distinction between the salaries of Members of the Oireachtas and what is set out in section 5 of the Bill.  There would be exact precedents if the power given to the Minister for Finance with respect to Members of the Oireachtas was that he could decide whether they were to be paid at all.  If there was a situation where the Government, by refraining from doing anything, would prevent us from being paid anything, or, on the contrary, by making an order could say whatever amount we were to be paid, then that would be an exact precedent.  That is not the situation.  The Members of the Oireachtas are paid their salaries.  By order, the Government or the Minister for Finance can decide in accordance with cost of living, national pay awards and so on, that they will get increases.  But they cannot decide not to pay them.  If they take no action Members will continue to be paid at the old level.  If the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare acting together do nothing, then nothing is paid at all under this section.  The workers concerned would not be paid anything under this Bill. On the other hand, by order, they can decide that workers will be paid. They can decide how much they will be paid.  It is a totally different situation <Col N="312" /> from the one quoted by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>This is the first time in social welfare legislation that a provision of this kind has been inserted.  Next year one assumes, with the cost of living increasing up to 30 per cent a year, that there will be a new Social Welfare Bill after the budget providing for increases to all social welfare recipients. The easiest way of dealing with this is for the Minister to introduce a Bill saying that the Minister may by order pay such increases as he sees fit to all the social welfare recipients. That is the end of it.  It can be railroaded through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>When we complain about this the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister, as the case may be, will say: &ldquo;There is a precedent, look back to 1975: you have a Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Bill, providing this very thing.&rdquo;  That is why I am objecting.  If it can be done in section 5 of this Bill then every other Social Welfare Bill to be passed in the future can be treated in this way.  It is a much more convenient way.  There is not this incredible complexity of getting through social welfare legislation, these amazing Bills which have long, involved sections which I certainly do not understand and I do not think anyone else does either except the parliamentary draftsman.  There is not the problem of having to wait until Dáil and Seanad are sitting and, if there is a good deal of business, trying to fit it in with other legislation.  All that is needed is a two-section Bill providing the Minister with the power to make these orders.  From then on the Minister is able to make orders providing for these payments to all other social welfare classes.  It seems to me to be totally wrong in principle and that is the sum of my objections to it in this context.  It is a relatively small matter but as a precedent it raises all kinds of possibilities for the parliamentary draftsman and Ministers in future.  For that reason we must object.</P>

I propose to delete it.  In the event of its deletion it means that the Bill becomes law on its signing by the President.  The Minister may be waiting with his pen to sign this order the moment the President signs the Bill; if so, it seems a pointless operation.

I mentioned in my Second Stage speech that it <Col N="315" /> appeared to be an obvious reform. The Parliamentary Secretary said in his remarks that one should have a contribution-related scheme introduced as quickly as possible, that there are possible injustices at present in having the flat-rate contribution system, particularly in relation to lower-paid workers. That is quite clear and palpable and there is no need to elaborate further. The flat-rate contribution system is a regressive system and hits the lower income levels hardest.</P>
    <P>I do not see the need for any further investigation in this area.  When the Fianna Fáil Government were discussing the pay-related area, at that time&mdash;three years ago&mdash;we felt a contribution-related scheme should be introduced as quickly as possible parallel with the pay-related scheme. It would appear to be a rational progression. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with me.  If that principle is adopted, there is no need for further investigation and the administration can get on with the job and devise the appropriate machinery.</P>

      <P>I do not want to cover the remarks already made but I hope the provisions of section 5 will not be treated as a precedent by the parliamentary draftsman in future and that we will continue to have our social welfare legislation passed through the Oireachtas in the ordinary way, that there will be no question of providing for payments to be made by order in future legislation because it would be a dangerous situation from the point of view of the parliamentary process.</P>

      <P>I do not envisage the development which Senator Yeats fears.  I would very much regret it if that happened because I would miss coming into the House to discuss social welfare on future occasions.  I am very encouraged by Senator Lenihan's commitment to the pay-related system.  It is very encouraging, having advocated this for two years in office and before that, to find comrades on that side of the House.  I welcome this very much and I find it very encouraging that they have come <Col N="316" /> around to this way of thinking.  It is a progressive approach to social welfare but Senator Lenihan has me a little puzzled in that a tremendous amount of work has gone and is still going into the preparation of a discussion document on pay-related pensions in the Department of Social Welfare.  I initiated that work under the direction of the Tánaiste.  Pay-related pensions, as I am sure Senators will accept, are an extremely complex and difficult area in view of the number of pension schemes of various sorts that are in operation at the moment. I find that it would not be possible, as Senator Lenihan seems to suggest, to just go ahead and do it.  It is necessary, before deciding on what we want, that the fullest possible opportunity should be given to the public and to interested parties to discuss the matter, to formulate their ideas on it and make their ideas known.</P>
      <P>As Senators may be aware we have issued invitations to various bodies who would be interested in this field to make submissions to us in helping to formulate this&mdash;I suppose we could call it&mdash;green paper which we hope to publish later in the current year. Some organisations and indeed individuals have availed of that invitation and I welcome this opportunity of thanking them for their contributions which will help greatly in formulating a useful discussion document on this whole subject.</P>

      <P>Surely if we accept in principle that the contribution-related-to-income scheme should be brought in, it is a very straightforward matter that could be investigated on its own, as a single issue without going to the bother of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think they have a very close relationship; they bear greatly on one another, and I do not believe that the approach should be <i>ad hoc</i>.  It should be a well-planned approach in the whole area.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a few words about the Bill on this Stage.  First, I think it is in order to do so and secondly people should be under no illusion as to what this Bill is about and what is contains.  It should be known as widely as possible that the Bill is effectively a very humane attempt to meet a situation which is at any time difficult and perhaps more especially difficult at the present time.  This should be made clear to the community at large and especially to that more fortunate section of the community which is not out of work through disability or through employment.  Especially in the middle income groups there is at the moment widespread apprehension about the extension of social welfare <Col N="318" /> legislation and benefits along lines like these among people who feel that they are being squeezed, as it were, in these inflationary times to pay the sort of benefits which are being made available under this and other legislation to a class with whom they feel very little sympathy.  I would argue very strongly and would point out to these people that, genuine as their feelings may be, they are labouring under a misapprehension; that at any time, and especially at a time when we are suffering from inflation, it is very much preferable to be in a job earning money no matter how much taxation you are carrying than to have to struggle along under a pay-related benefit scheme however generous in its concept or its implementation.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
