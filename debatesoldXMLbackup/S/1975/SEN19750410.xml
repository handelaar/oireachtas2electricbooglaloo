    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment to the Order of Business:</P>
      <P>To delete item No. 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do this appreciating that all Senators welcome, as a general rule, the introduction of Bills in the Seanad.  It is a useful practice and it should be done more often.  We had a Bill yesterday, which we dealt with to considerable effect, which could well have been introduced originally in the Seanad.  Anyone who looks at today's Order Paper for the Dáil will see a number of Bills which could <Col N="140" /> have been introduced in the Seanad or could, with advantage, be transferred to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>However, this particular Bill, the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1975, is of another order altogether. This is a Bill which is of fundamental constitutional and political importance. One could say with accuracy that never since the first Seanad Éireann met in 1922 has a Bill of such supreme importance and implications been introduced first in this House. The reason obviously is that while the Seanad is, or could be, an extremely effective legislative assembly from the point of view of debating and dealing with amending legislation, the primary responsibility under the Constitution is given, rightly, to Dáil Éireann since it is the properly directly elected House and it is to Dáil Éireann that the Government are responsible under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>At no time in the past half century has a Bill of this nature been introduced in the Seanad but one can also say that never in all that time has a Bill of this supreme importance been transferred in this manner from one House to the other.  This whole procedure, and particularly the manner in which it was conducted and railroaded through Dáil Éireann yesterday, is another example of this Government's apparent supreme contempt for the parliamentary process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the position is that we cannot normally discuss proceedings in the other House, but I do think, a Chathaoirleach, with the greatest respect, that it is impossible to consider this matter before us today without adverting to the fact that it has been transferred in this hole-and-corner way from Dáil Éireann to Seanad Éireann.  It is impossible to consider this matter at all without adverting&mdash; I have no intention of going into any great detail about it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, and I am sure the Senator appreciates the fact that the Bill was discharged <Col N="141" /> from the Dáil and is quite properly a subject that can be introduced here. But the manner in which the proceedings were conducted and the manner in which the other House dealt with the business before it on a previous occasion cannot be commented upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of continuing on that topic but I should like to refer very briefly to the legislative situation as it exists at the moment in Dáil Éireann, not in any sense of criticising or discussing the behaviour of Deputies.  The problem is that the Government by their ineptitude, by their inability to deal with the real matters of importance at the moment in the country, have reduced the whole business of the other House to a shambles.  As I understand it, this Bill is being introduced here today against all precedents going back over half a century.</P>
      <P>According to the Government and the Minister for Justice, it is impossible to get a Bill of this kind through the Dáil between now and next August. The reason is that there are four Finance Bills before the Dáil at the moment.  Three of them are of an exceptional nature, dealing with various forms of capital taxation, and have clogged up the business of the Dáil to such an extent that as a legislative assembly it appears Dáil Éireann has ceased to exist.  These Bills not only are irrelevant to the people at present because of the fact that we have over 100,000 unemployed, enormous balance of payments problems, budgetary problems, but they are actively increasing the problems.  They are making less likely the possibility of any economic recovery.  This is the reason the Dáil is apparently unable at present to deal with this Bill.  I must ask the Leader of the House if he can tell us what is the urgency that has made it necessary to remove this Bill from the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill arose originally out of the Sunningdale affair over a year ago. After the usual inordinate delay which one associates with this Government's legislative programme, it finally emerged and was introduced in the Dáil last November.  Some five months have elapsed since then during which <Col N="142" /> nothing was done, which is typical of the Government's legislative programme. Suddenly we find it necessary to deal with this problem.  Who wants the Bill?  It is ridiculous and irrelevant. It is unconstitutional and in some respects extremely dangerous.  Nobody in Ireland wants it, except perhaps the Minister for Justice and the Northern Unionists.</P>
    <P>Having apparently reduced the proceedings of the Dáil to a shambles, I cannot understand why the Government now propose to reduce Seanad Éireann to the same condition to deal with this ridiculous Bill that nobody wants, that has no relation to the real needs of the country, that is absolutely dangerous and unconstitutional.  Why can they not get down to dealing with the real problems of the nation?  We propose to vote against taking it today. When the Bill has gone through the Order of Business and when it is placed on our Agenda, we will oppose it in the manner a Bill of this stupidity and irrelevance deserves to be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the introduction of the Bill on the grounds that it is irrelevant at the moment. The Bill was agreed to by the Government as part of the Sunningdale package. Unfortunately the Sunningdale package has never materialised and we know the reasons.  The present state of affairs in Northern Ireland will not be helped by the introduction of this Bill or its implementation in the south at present.  It might do a lot of harm if we did that.  After 800 years of democracy in Britain the British Government are still not able to administer justice in Northern Ireland.  A case in point was the farmer's son who was taken out and executed by a British soldier.  There was a sham trial but the soldier was let off scot-free.  In other words, the British were right to be in Northern Ireland and were right to commit murder in the way they did.  If this is justice how can we go hand in hand with an administration such as that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is entitled an Act to extend the criminal law of the State to certain acts done in Northern Ireland and it refers to the law in Northern Ireland. <Col N="143" /> That is the operative phrase&mdash;there is no law in Northern Ireland if a British soldier can commit murder and get off free.  According to the justice and system of administration of law that exists there he was found to have done what was right.  Without being patriotic, without going back to 1916 and waving flags, how can we stand up and be sincere and talk about hopes and prospects of uniting our people and our country?  We cannot close our eyes to the situation as it is. If the Government fail in their duty to tell the British that they are concerned with the way justice is being administered in Northern Ireland, then the individual Members of the Oireachtas have a responsibility to tell Britain that we are not blind to the way they are administering justice in Northern Ireland.  There is no future and no confidence in any administration like that.  I will oppose any common law enforcement when we have no respect for the law as it is at present administered in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with the other speakers in opposing the Bill.  It is one of the most important Bills to have come before any of the Houses in the past 50 years and we will have to study it carefully.  I cannot see why it has to be introduced in such a rushed fashion.  Perhaps it is because the other House is bogged down with financial legislation.  They want to do the same as far as Seanad Éireann is concerned.</P>
      <P>I cannot see what the urgency is with this Bill in view of the fact that it was before the other House in November, 1974, was left lying in abeyance over the last six months and suddenly it reappeared in the Dáil. There must have been some collusion between the Government and the British Government in this matter.  We do not know if it was Harold Wilson who cracked the whip or a British agent but the majority of the people believe there has been underhand work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill would entitle people from Northern Ireland to give evidence in courts here and the same would <Col N="144" /> apply to people in the South giving evidence in the Six Counties.  We do not want that.  We consider our country a unit and if there was a supreme Parliament to govern the whole of the Thirty-two Counties we would be in favour of something like this.  As it is we would be put in the position of backing up the British Government in their efforts to keep certain people here under submission. We are not so naïve as not to realise that for the past 700 years the British have been trying to keep us in subjection and in that time we have experienced examples of British justice. The performance she is tolerating in the Six Counties is no credit to the British Government, the so-called mother of democracy.  Thousands of troops are harassing the population with the type of treatment that they have been meting out to the unfortunate people in Long Kesh and various other places in the Six Counties.  This treatment cannot be forgotten and anybody in the Twenty-six Counties, irrespective of their politics, who helps to perpetuate a situation such as that is doing a disservice to this country.</P>
    <P>We have been for too long trying to get rid of them.  That is the only solution.  We know and they know, and the Government should know, that Sunningdale is in a shambles.  It was known months ago.  It will not work and this is a last effort to try to revive it.  We on this side of the House will not in any way support this proposal.  It shows contempt for the Irish people and it is wrong to try and put it across the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice and the Government have the main responsibility in this and it is time that the people of Ireland saw them in their true colours.  It is no pleasure for me to say it.  Let us take a glance back at their history since this State was founded in 1922.  We know the secret agreements of 1925 that were signed behind the backs of the Irish people. We know the agreements in 1949 that declared a Republic for 26 counties here and cut off the other six.  These are things we must remember and they are things that elected representatives must speak out on at <Col N="145" /> a time of crisis like this.  We are not going to desert our people in the Six Counties.  We are not going to connive in any way whatever with the British Government or with the Government here to try to bring into effect legislation which would be detrimental to the best interests of our people on both sides of that unfortunate Border.</P>
    <P>I shall have some time later on to discuss this if it is introduced.  I want to make it quite clear that the media here, the elected representatives all over the country and everybody who has the national interest of this country at heart must consider this Bill very seriously.  In my opinion there is something very sinister and underhand in the way it has been handled.  Now there is urgency because there are some Convention elections coming up in the Six Counties, and because of some hint from the British Government it has now been shoved on to us.  I am totally against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to support the Fianna Fáil amendment to the Order of Business despite the fact that I have considerable sympathy for the views expressed by Senator Yeats.  I think that the real issue posed by the proposal to remove the Bill from the Dáil Order Paper and produce it here today in the Seanad is one of political wisdom. The Government have chosen to make progress on this Bill by introducing it here in the Seanad because of the impossibility of making much progress in the Dáil.  The question is whether this is politically wise, rather than whether it is open to the Government to take that step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil is the popular Chamber where Deputies are directly elected and, therefore, it is the Chamber which would reflect accurately the views of the population here on the political content of the Bill.  Although this Chamber will debate the Bill very seriously, and I hope very usefully, when it comes to Second Reading, it will not reflect accurately the political will involved.  This Chamber, as we <Col N="146" /> all know, has a very strong majority in support of the Government.  This is ensured by the fact that 11 Members are nominated by the Taoiseach.  It is a fact that the Opposition are less represented in this House at present than they have been for a considerable time, so that the Bill will not be debated initially by a Chamber which would reflect accurately the degree of popular support for the Bill.  However, it will be given a very serious scrutiny.  It will be examined probably in a more thoughtful and leisurely way, as is the tradition in this House. I have no doubt that there will be a substantial gain from such a debate.</P>
    <P>I also think that the problem here raises the issue of the manner in which the Oireachtas is responding to the complexity of Government and administration in Ireland today.  This is a very important and very crucial question.  The reason the Dáil is blocked and the reason it is not possible to make progress with Bills is because there is not sufficient co-operation in devising ways in which legislation can be dealt with in a serious and constructive way, in order to give people here the reforms in legislation, and in taxation which they should have.  I have little sympathy with the viewpoints expressed by the Fianna Fáil Senators who contributed this morning about the blockage in the Dáil.  It stems from their unwillingness as a party to participate in special committees on the major pieces of taxation which are being proposed.  I think that they will have to face up to their responsibilities as an Opposition in this matter.  They will have to show more co-operation if they are to uphold the democratic principles which they have been championing this morning.</P>
    <P>I regret the fact that as a country we have not paid sufficient attention to the importance of our Parliamentary institution being able to cope with the complexities of modern government and administration.  There is very little research, very little study of how Parliament is responding, very little examination of how more radical improvements than mere improvements in procedure can be made.</P>

      <P>I oppose the proposal that this Bill be included on the Order Paper today or indeed on any other day.  I can promise the Minister for Justice a long hot summer in this House in his efforts to have this legislation passed.  I will join with my Fianna Fáil colleagues in opposing this Bill, section by section, line by line.  I think Senator Yeats was wrong when he said that nobody wants this Bill.  Of course, there are people who want this Bill. Mr. Wilson wants it, the British Tories want it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael in particular in introducing this Bill return to the traditional role of the old Cumann na nGaelhael Party by once again becoming British collaborators.  I say that anyone in the House or in any other place who supports in any way the proposal before us this morning is nothing short of a British collaborator. I expect that at the end of this year the Minister for Justice, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be awarded the OBE and possibly the CBE for their services to the British Crown.  History is repeating itself in the House this morning.  We should tell Mr. Wilson and the British Government that, instead of legislation such as this, they have the solution to the Irish question completely in their hands.  It is a simple solution: get to hell out of this country and leave the future of Ireland to be decided by Irish men and Irish women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not surprised at the attitude of Fine Gael in playing their own traditional role.  I must confess that I am surprised that the oldest Republican party in this country, the Labour Party, should in any way associate <Col N="148" /> with this despicable measure before us this morning.  I wonder is this attempt at liberality to be all one-sided.  If the RUC man who meets a young man on the streets of County Armagh, pulls out a revolver and pumps four bullets into him could be arrested on this side of the Border, what good would this legislation be?  What I have said about the RUC man is a true incident.  It did not occur five years ago, five months ago or five weeks ago: it occurred five days ago, when a young man left a building site in my native Letterkenny to return to his wife and children in County Armagh for the weekend.  On Saturday morning he walked down the street to see his friends, and a member of Mr. Wilson's police force stopped him and said &ldquo;Is it you, you bastard?&rdquo; and poured four bullets into his stomach. Over the weekend, that young man's life was in grave danger and, indeed, when I left home on Tuesday he was not expected to live more than a few hours.  Is that the type of police force that the National Coalition Government are asking the Irish people to cooperate with?  Is that the kind of justice that the Minister for Justice believes in in this country?  A leopard never changes its spots.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say to Senator Fitzgerald that at no time have my views on the Irish question changed and as regards the immortal name that he mentioned, simply because I did not believe that he should be the Leader of Fianna Fáil does not mean to say that I have changed my views.  Senator Fitzgerald will be given an opportunity in the course of this <Col N="149" /> discussion and let him quote.  I challenge him to state in what way I have changed my views.  I believe today, as I did in 1969 and in 1970, there was only one solution to the Irish question. It is for the British to get to hell out of this country.  Until they do there will not be peace in this country.</P>
      <P>When I said that a leopard never changes its spots, 700 years of Irish history should have taught us that the British leopard will never change its spots.  I cannot understand how any Irish Minister should consider it necessary to fraternise in any way with the British Government in this country.  I believe that the Minister for Justice is only bringing trouble on himself by introducing legislation of this kind.  I shudder to think what the public reaction will be if a young man or woman is arrested in any corner of the Irish Republic and charged with the offence of escaping from a British jail in Belfast or Armagh.  I shudder to think what the reaction of the vast majority of the Irish people will be, irrespective of their political viewpoints, and irrespective of whether they are Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour.  I feel that they will not accept a decision of guilty in an Irish court. Any Government that attempts to punish these people in the Republic of Ireland is bringing on its own head the anger of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is a shame.  Anyone who supports it should bow his head in shame.  I have no doubt that Senator Fitzgerald and that great organisation of which he is a member, its members in Belfast and throughout the entire Six Counties, will treat this legislation with contempt.  If the members of the GAA had taken action when the British occupied Casement Park, or if Casement Park were occupied in the future and if, for example, some members of the GAA dealt with the British soldiers as British soldiers deserve to be dealt with in this country, and should they come across the Border, then Senator Fitzgerald will be very embarrassed if the Minister for Justice drags them into court and sends them to jail for daring to defend their democratic rights in the city of Belfast.  That is what could happen <Col N="150" /> under legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>While I deplore the death of anyone, irrespective of his religion or his nationality, I do say that the British Army are occupying part of this country against the wishes of the vast majority of the people of Ireland and if, in so doing, they should suffer in any way for it, it is not the responsibility of a court in the Republic of Ireland to comment in any way on any action that might be taken against the British Army or against the British Government.  For too long we have pussy-footed with our friends across the water, to such an extent that I believe that there are Ministers in the present Government who would like to apologise for being Irish, and who, when they enter the Court of Westminster seem to think that it is the &ldquo;in-thing&rdquo; to placate the British. That can be the only explanation for the introduction of a Bill that can in no way help the Irish or help the people in the Republic of Ireland.  If, for example, a member of the UVF or the UDA is caught on this side of the Border blowing up a public house, an electricity station or anything else, he or she can opt to cross the Border and be tried on the other side.  One has only to read the judgment of Justice McDermott to realise the type of justice that is dished out across the Border.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if someone sympathetic to either branch of the IRA &mdash;I want to say I hold no brief for the IRA nor did I ever&mdash;is caught on this side of the Border they may opt to remain here and to be tried.  They may feel that the sentence and the treatment that they would get here would be more congenial than that which they would receive on the other side of the Border.  We can take it that supporters of the UDA and the UVF, if arrested on this side of the Border would, under no circumstances stay here but under the provisions of this Bill would opt for trial in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>The only conclusion that I can come to is that this Bill is designed wholly against the interests of the people living in the Six Counties who oppose British oppression in that part <Col N="151" /> of Ulster.  I feel that it is wrong and should not be included in this Order Paper today and I believe that anyone in this House or in Dáil Éireann who in any way supports this measure can be described as a British collaborator. I realise that at this juncture we cannot go into the measures contained in the Bill but, as I said earlier, if the Minister for Justice and the Government think that by bringing this Bill into the Seanad they will ease in any way its passage, we on this side of the House want to assure them that we are opposed to this Bill and we will oppose it, as I said, section by section and line by line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I take the point made by Senator McGlinchey that a leopard never changes its spots and I could not therefore describe any member of the Fianna Fáil Party as being a leopard.  Certainly, I welcome their change of attitude towards legislation of this kind because it must not be forgotten that the Fianna Fáil Party introduced very severe legislation&mdash;the Offences Against the State Act, for example.  It is on the record also, that when Republican prisoners escaped from Crumlin Road jail and came down here to take refuge they were put in the Curragh Camp and interned by the then Fianna Fáil Government.  That is why I welcome the change of attitude.  Everybody is entitled to change his mind and should change his mind for the right to launch the gun in the right cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I object to the introduction of this Bill.  I am not concerned whether it is introduced in the Seanad or the Dáil.  I object to it for a number of reasons.  As a trade unionist, I object to its introduction.  I am mindful of the fact that the trade union movement, through the medium of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, is on record as being against this type of legislation.  My own union, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, is on record as being against this type of legislation.  I am also mindful of the fact that the Labour Party, of which I am a member, is on record as being against this type of legislation. <Col N="152" /> That being so, I am at a loss to understand why it is being introduced.</P>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that every single anti-unionist element in the Six Counties is against this Bill. Surely the Government are not going to appear to be going right over to what the Unionists want.  There is no doubt about what I have just said. You can take any of the extremes, they are all against the idea of this Bill.  We know that this was part of the Sunningdale pact, but Sunningdale flopped, mainly due to the actions of the Ulster Workers' Council, a gang of fascist thugs who brought down the Sunningdale Agreement and brought down the Assembly.  Are we going to play into their hands?  For what reason should we play into their hands?</P>
    <P>Mindful of what Mr. Gerry Fitt very often says when he is being interviewed, I would ask why at this point in time is this legislation being introduced? People have been speculating in this country as to whether or not this legislation would be put to one side.  Everyone had good reason to believe that it would, despite what the British were doing in their House of Lords and their House of Commons. I am at a loss to understand how British newspapers can state that this matter is going to be introduced in the Dáil without a mention of it in any of the Irish newspapers.  That is rather strange.  I advise anybody to look at some of last week's English newspapers. There is a positive report in them that this matter was being introduced in Dáil Éireann this week. Our own newspapers were saying that it was likely to be pushed to one side. That type of thing smells.  I agree with the speaker who asked who was prompting this, who is giving the instructions.  I should like to know at whose instigation this Bill is now being introduced.  It is certainly not provided for in the 14-point programme that this Government submitted to the people.</P>
    <P>We are already too tied up with Great Britain&mdash;whether it is &ldquo;great&rdquo; any more remains to be seen.  We certainly find that we are tied up financially. If this Bill is passed it will, in <Col N="153" /> my estimation, complete the tie-up. Perhaps it will satisfy the minds of some people who appear to be advocating, not publicly but slyly, that we should go back into the Empire.</P>

      <P>I would expect the present Government to take into consideration what would seem to have been the attitude of the majority when they were in Opposition.  The majority of them, Fine Gael and Labour, opposed any attempt to introduce any more restrictive legislation.  Remember the time the bombs went off outside Liberty Hall and other places and people were killed.  There was a right rí-rá going on in Leinster House that time.  The bombs were dropped, I submit, conveniently.  As a matter of fact, at a meeting a few months ago in one of the rooms of this House Mr. Stanley Orme informed the Labour group&mdash;I was present&mdash;that they have the people who did that in jail in Belfast but they could not bring them to trial because they would not be able to get them convicted.  This bears out some of the points that have been made by the previous speakers.</P>
      <P>I will address my remarks now to the Labour Ministers in the Coalition Government: they should read up their Connolly&mdash;I am referring to James Connolly.  If they take in what he has written, and he has written many things about our entire country, it will be driven home to them that this is not the type of legislation that should be foisted on the people. If we want to introduce legislation to deal with criminals there is great room for reform in that regard affecting adults and children.  The Minister and the Government would be better occupied in concentrating on that.</P>

      <P>I rise very briefly on this issue as an Independent Senator.  I hope to hold independent status in both periods of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In approaching this issue, the main essential is that the bi-partisan policy on Northern Ireland be preserved. To my mind, that is the most essential contribution.  It is the only cornerstone on which we can build <Col N="154" /> policy on Northern Ireland.  Therefore I will look then at the present scheme to introduce the Bill in this House in that context.  Like many others, I feel that this legislation could have been left where it was a week ago.  In other words, I cannot see the urgency for it, because it was part and parcel of the Sunningdale package and Sunningdale unfortunately is at present in complete disarray.  We see little hope of getting back to the dreams we had then. Everything depends on the Assembly elections coming up in the North and what can be fashioned as a result of that.  Any commitment on our part should not be rushed.  We must see what pattern is emerging in the North and what type of co-operation we can have with whatever form of Government or Assembly that emerges there. Obviously, we cannot judge that for a long time ahead.  Therefore this present legislation is very much premature. I hope that its passage will be delayed and that it will not be given a high priority on our list.  I hope we will move with the pattern that emerges and move in step with the development of that pattern.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is to be introduced it is better that it be introduced in Seanad Éireann.  I believe that we will have a more rational discussion here.  At least, there will be a hope that in Seanad Éireann we will insist on the bi-partisan approach in our dealings with the North.  If the debate here over the next few months succeeds in strengthening or indeed rescuing the bi-partisan policy, then Seanad Éireann will have helped immensely with the Northern problem.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the lack of bi-partisanship I find in both the present and previous Administrations.  It is very wrong for us to lecture the Northern people on power-sharing and everything else when none of our Administrations has shown any inclinations to share power.  That is very much evident at the moment.  We must make a start.  I hope that this Bill, if we are to discuss it here, will provide an opportunity for that examination of conscience to find out how are we faring in bi-partisanship and how the present Government are measuring up <Col N="155" /> to the standards of power sharing they are preaching to the Northern community. I regret as an Independent, to have to say that; but as long as I stay on the Independent benches I will speak my mind without fear or favour on this matter.  The call that should go out from Seanad Éireann is for a complete demonstration of practical power sharing here, practical power sharing between the parties and indeed practical power sharing between the Cabinet and the Houses of the Oireachtas, something which is almost nonexistent.</P>
    <P>I welcome Senator Mullen acting as a spur to the Government from the back benches.  I hope the Fine Gael backbenchers will get on their toes and express in equally strong terms their discontent with many of the things emerging from the Government today.  Only then can we rescue democracy in this part of the country, or claim that we are evolving a democratic pattern which may ultimately lead to a united Ireland, in which all shades will be represented and to which all parties and groups will contribute to the fashioning of national policy.</P>
    <P>In that context, without any reference to what is in the Bill, I intend to support the introduction of the Bill in the Seanad.  I will be looking for a low priority and, at an early stage, to commit it to a Committee of the Seanad to discuss in great detail and in great depth what is at issue, what are the alternatives and the dangers of what is proposed.  There is a very serious job to be done.  I hope we will approach it in a serious way as the Seanad has done in the past, and that the Seanad will be the medium of rescuing the bipartisan policy on Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I support the First Reading of this Bill.  We, as Members of Fine Gael, are accustomed to being called traitors, collaborators and all such low, mean terms as we have heard today from people like Senator McGlinchey.  People use these expressions when they have nothing else to offer.  It is very hard at times like this to be constitutional in your outlook <Col N="156" /> and to be for constitutional Government. It is so easy to throw mud and be insulting.  The Government and Minister for Justice are putting forward a Bill which they see as being correct and in the best interests of people North and South of the Border.  We will not be deviated by this slagging and insulting behaviour from what is proposed to be done.</P>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill has rejuvenated people who have been dormant for at least six years, since the present troubles in Northern Ireland started.  It has given them a new lease of life.  They now say they can now come back and pretend to be what they always were&mdash;sham republicans. Where have these people been for the past six years?  Why have they not spoken?  What have they got to offer?  Their Leader, Deputy Lynch, was honest.  He made fair statements and tried to reconciliate people of all sections in this country.  People in his own party tried to knife him from left, right and centre.  He still has not got over that treachery.</P>

      <P>We heard Senator McGlinchey saying today that it was time the British got out and left the Irish to themselves.  What a great old Fianna Fáil slogan that has been over the years.  For the sake of political gain&mdash;and that is what that type of slogan is invented for&mdash;they would let the majority in the North massacre the minority.  They are not concerned with the minority although they may pretend to be.  This is cheap political talk.  It does not deal with reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill would make it possible for people, such as the Dublin car bombers, as well as the people from the North who have committed murders and who have maimed people, to be brought to justice, something that cannot be done at present. If I can help by my vote to see that this Bill is brought to this House, I will gladly do so.  Of course there have been dreadful acts done in the North by the Judiciary, by the soldiers and by the police.  Our duplicity is not <Col N="157" /> helping the minority in the North.  We all deplore the decision that was given the McIlhone case in County Tyrone. We are going to get these type of decisions while we are seen to be partial.  Too many people in this part of the country are seen to be partial in their views on Northern Ireland and are seen to have given active support.  Senator McGlinchey said that he had no brief for the IRA.  One would find that hard to believe, listening to what he had to say.  One would get the very opposite impression. Words are cheap but that sort of a statement is cheap, too, and is very hard to swallow.  Overall I support the First Reading of this Bill and I am not ashamed to do so.  Words, threats and abuse will not deter me from doing so.</P>

      <P>I oppose the introduction of this Bill and intend, as we all do on this side of the House, to oppose the Bill <i>in toto</i> when it comes before this House, as it undoubtedly will because the Government have a majority here.  The Leader of the House has not given us the reason this Bill is being introduced in this House.  He has not told why it is so vital that this Bill should be introduced at this time or at any other time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mullen made a responsible contribution.  I was pleased to note that he reminded the Labour members of the Cabinet to examine the writings and the teachings of Connolly. He could also have added Larkin.  I would also remind the Labour Members of this House to ask themselves what would Connolly and what would Jim Larkin have done in the event of a Bill of this kind being introduced.  If they conscientiously examine what James Connolly and James Larkin would do, most certainly <Col N="158" /> all Labour Members would oppose this Bill.  The Labour Party are very quick indeed to boast about Connolly and Larkin, and they are entitled to do so because they were two great Irishmen of their time.  Let us see whether they will support the views and teachings of Connolly and Larkin or are now prepared to renege on them.</P>
    <P>It was said that Fianna Fáil introduced the Offences Against the State Act.  I would remind the Senator who said this that he was right when he said it was opposed by the Labour Party.  When a member of the present Cabinet, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, was asked &ldquo;What do you intend to do about the Offences Against the State Act now that you are in Government?&rdquo;  he said &ldquo;Nothing, absolutely nothing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am tempted to ignore the rather hysterical speech made by the last speaker.  I do not think it is part of that Senator's nature.  I know him very well.  I am rather surprised he was so carried away and that his speech was so full of venom against the Fianna Fáil Party.  Is it because they are so short of speakers on the other side of the House to support the introduction of this Bill that he was picked out of the hat and told &ldquo;For God's sake, go in and say something.&rdquo; I know it was contrary to the man's nature to make such a speech.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves why is this Bill being introduced at the present time?  Why is it that a Bill of such extreme importance is not being introduced in the Dáil?  We can only speculate on the reasons.  We do not know because we have not been told.  Is it because the members of the Labour Party in Dáil Éireann are having problems of conscience and the Government could not be assured of getting the Bill through although in this case, I am sure the Taoiseach will vote with the Government?  Is it that they are worried about the Labour members in Dáil Éireann?  As I say, we can only speculate on the reasons.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats pointed out a significant fact that not since 1922 has a Bill of such extreme importance been introduced in this House.  We shall have <Col N="159" /> a lot to say when this Bill is being debated.  At the moment we are merely opposing its introduction. Senator Robinson attacked the Fianna Fáil Party in Dáil Éireann and said that they were holding up legislation and should agree to a committee system.  I was rather surprised to hear that, because she is a responsible person and contributes much to debates in this House.  This is contrary to what she has been pressing for as long as I am a Member of this Seanad. That would destroy the system of open debate and deny the right of the backbencher to contribute.  Why has she changed her mind now?  Perhaps she is not fully acquainted with what it would mean if legislation was to be dealt with under a committee system, as she suggested.</P>
    <P>We are obliged to oppose, first of all, the introduction of this Bill and secondly, the Bill itself when it is brought before this House.  Is there anyone here&mdash;I address my remarks particularly to people in the legal profession on both sides of this House&mdash; who would depend on justice being dispensed from the benches in the North of Ireland?  Is there anyone here from the legal profession who can say he is perfectly satisfied at the way in which justice was dispensed in the past?  People with Nationalistic aspirations were victimised by the oppression of which we are all aware, but when they went before the courts, expecting justice, that was the one thing they did not receive.  In fact, they received the exact opposite.</P>
    <P>We must oppose the introduction of this Bill, not because of what Senator Deasy said, using the term &ldquo;sham Republicanism&rdquo; and &ldquo;traitors within the Fianna Fáil Party&rdquo; and all sorts of nonsense.  I could talk about mongrel foxes but I do not wish to bring this debate down to that level.</P>

      <P>It is very interesting to hear the remarks of the uninformed and to listen to points being made on the other side trying to justify the introduction of this Bill.  I ask the Labour Members of this House to remember that when they were accusing Fianna Fáil one of the remarks they used was: &ldquo;If you are not prepared to help the Nationalists in the North, please do not hinder them&rdquo;.  Such remarks were made in this House and in the Dáil.  Let the Labour Members stand up and be counted now and we will see if they can stand over the remarks they made.  I must question why this Bill is being introduced at the present time.  Has it something to do with the Convention elections?

      <P>In circumstances like this it is very difficult for any Senator to claim with absolute confidence that he is perfectly sure that what he is doing is right and consistent with policies over the past years and perhaps may be proved right in the future.  I do not propose to be so infallible or so far-seeing that I will be able to look back on this in 20 years, if I am alive, and say that what we did was the right thing.  On the other hand, neither do I believe that my friend and colleague, Senator Mullen, was wise to advise his colleagues or that Senator Hanafin was wise to advise the Labour Party members, <Col N="161" /> to consult Connolly before they made up their minds about what they should do here.  After all, Connolly has been dead for 50 years.  There have been two world wars and many minor wars since.  The map of Europe has changed; politics, attitudes and outlooks have changed.</P>
      <P>It is not fair to Connolly to bring him into a situation like this and expect him to have provided for every situation and every crisis which might have arisen and will arise in the next 50.  Perhaps Senator Mullen or Senator Hanafin would expect the writings of Connolly to solve the problems for hundreds of years to come.  I have not that sort of confidence to support the introduction of this Bill.  I believe that in the democratic interest I am right in saying that I support the introduction of this Bill.  We, as Senators, complained that sufficient use was not made of this House; that this House did not get the opportunities it deserved and was not making the contribution that it could make.  I feel this would be a very good atmosphere in which to debate legislation of this sort.  I regret that we had to commence with such an emotive contribution from Senator McGlinchey because it is not consistent with the kind of things he had been saying privately and, indeed, publicly over the past number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I proclaim myself as good a Republican as anybody on the other side of the House or anywhere in this country, but I do not use that phrase to secure me votes of a particular kind at a particular time.  I believe that this is what has been done.  I have seen over the past few months, particularly when the Government were blackmailed by hunger strikers in Portlaoise, people flying to this so-called Republican banner.  They had not got the guts to join the IRA. They have not got the loyalty to be true to the leadership of their own party and their own leader.  We have been treated to this at council level and I hope we will not be treated to this sort of double-thinking and double-talking in the Seanad.  I expect <Col N="162" /> more from Senators.</P>
    <P>We can deal with this Bill, line by line and section by section.  The majority of people in the Six Counties and in the Twenty-six Counties want peace and reconciliation. This must come before territorial unity.  We all believe and accept this.  I believe the majority of people in the Six Counties want no part of the type of justice being meted out in the courts or the sort of justice that is being meted out by the gunmen on street corners.  I honestly believe that the majority of people on both sides deplore this sort of situation.</P>
    <P>If somebody in County Fermanagh, five or six miles from where I live, can walk into a school, shoot a man in the presence of seven or eight children, get into a car, cross the Border, claim political immunity and get away with it, what sort of trial would we expect to get from the majority of people in the Six Counties?

We have no way of knowing when decisions are made in the dark of night and executions are carried out by private executioners. We will not help solve these problems if we allow the murderers to escape here and get away with it.  I would like the Minister for Justice to say: &ldquo;We are introducing this legislation. We had discussions with our counterparts in Britain and the Six Counties <Col N="163" /> and we have come to certain agreements. They intend to do this and we intend to do the other.&rdquo;  It is not always possible for Ministers to say exactly what discussions they have had recently.  It has been stated publicly that our Ministers are in constant contact with their Northern and British counterparts.  Nobody, not even Senator McGlinchey, believes that if our Ministers are in constant contact with their counterparts in Britain they are selling out the national interest. I cannot believe that that is accepted by the majority.</P>
      <P>The majority of people know well that if our Ministers are having such discussions that they are in the national interest and in the hope of improving the situation.  I believe such discussions are going on.  While I am a backbencher, and a newcomer to this parliamentary forum, I do not expect to be kept informed of all these matters.  Facts have come to light recently where weighty and important decisions were made by a father of their party, Mr. de Valera, when he was Taoiseach.  The vast majority of the people in the Fianna Fáil Party knew nothing about them. Decisions were made by him which could have radically altered the situation we have at present.  I am not saying if he was right or wrong but he did not inform his party of everything he said.  He did not tell them every deal he had made.  In democracy such things should never be.</P>

      <P>I know this and so do you.  Senator Mullen spoke as a trade unionist.  During the years I had great hopes that the trade union movement could have solved the problem we are facing at present.  The fact that the trade union movement, which was in a unique position, could not solve the problem we have in Northern Ireland, does not reflect on the movement.  It reflects the complexity and the difficulty of the situation that exists here. Senator Mullen is rash in his assertion&mdash;although I admire his courage and independence&mdash;that the solutions are so simple: ask the British Government <Col N="164" /> to withdraw from the Six Counties.  I do not want to see any British soldier here.  I do not want to hear any emotive talk about the British not changing their spots and being our enemy.  We are a member of a community of nations.  If we work together, we can help solve some of these problems.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that the present British policy is right.  If we are to win the goodwill of the majority of the people in the Six Counties we must let it appear that we are doing everything that can be done to ensure that innocent people cannot be murdered on one side of the ditch and the murderers can come across the Border and get away with it.  For this reason I want to see this Bill debated sanely and soberly.  I expect the Minister to listen carefully to what the Opposition have to say.  It is a wrong attitude to take if somebody says: &ldquo;We are going to debate this line by line, section by section, and oppose everything.&rdquo;  We should discuss it first.  I acknowledge the right of Members to vote whatever way they wish.</P>

      <P>What is the reason for this motion?  Why are we opposing the Order of Business today? I firmly believe, as a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, that this is nothing less than domiciling for the Convention elections due in a few weeks time.  As Senator Mullen stated, it is nothing less than lackeying to the British Government.  He emphasised that point by stating that British papers circulating here last week carried a statement saying that this Bill would be in the Seanad or Dáil this week when none of the Irish papers could do so.  That is evidence that there is something very low behind the motives of this Bill. For this reason I oppose the Order of Business today.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the nation should legislate for the Republic alone. Some legislative measures need to be brought in.  They would be of vital importance to the people living with inflation and need to be dealt with urgently.  This Bill is just to rubber-stamp a British Government desire. It is easy for Senator McCartin to say that a school teacher was shot in one instance and to forget what happened in another earlier instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us go back two or three years and see what the law of Northern <Col N="166" /> Ireland was and how it was upheld.  I remember an incident, which I will remember forever, where a man who was mentally retarded was shot dead at the back door of his house by the British soldiers.  We know when a person suffers a mental retraction such as that man had obviously could have no part in any matter in Northern Ireland.  Yet the British Government could use their artillery and their firing squads to shoot such a person.  Three years later they ask the Government and the people here to come through this House to condone such a Bill as this.</P>
    <P>I ask Senators and in particular the Labour Party, to have the confidence of their convictions, convictions that they themselves used for many hours during legislative measures that were taken in this House and the other House previously.  I ask them to come across the floor of the House, the same as the Leader of the Government did on another occasion, because this is not in their 15-point programme or their 16-point programme&mdash;to come across the floor of the House as Senator Mullen suggested.  It is not good enough to talk about it.  The Labour Party must use their votes and their votes will be counted when they vote for us, with us in this proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the First Reading of the Bill, ironically enough for many of the reasons that have been put forward against its First Reading, notably by Senators McGowan, Dolan and Mullen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is that the Bill be part of the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I meant to say.  In other words, I support the question that the Bill be part of the Order of Business for many of the reasons which have been given for its not being made part of the Order of Business.  Basically I find myself as uneasy about the provisions of the Bill in relation to this as many of the people who have so far opposed it.  One of the things that has emerged in this debate, an extraordinarily long debate on the Order of Business, is that there is a <Col N="167" /> great deal of thinking going on in the House, a good deal of frustrated contemplation of the present crisis in Northern Ireland and its bearing on the situation in the South.  This thinking and meditation and agonising is not finding a voice within the parliamentary forums.</P>
      <P>It seems that this Bill would give an opportunity, much as I dislike many of its provisions, and I would pledge myself to oppose most of the provisions in the Bill, for a discussion on the situation in Northern Ireland as it stands, but particularly as it has changed since the Sunningdale Agreement which, of course, was the occasion for this legislation.  It would give us another angle of vision, an opportunity to review the situation in the North of Ireland while debating the substantive content of the Bill itself. Since the Sunningdale situation a number of things of the most disturbing kind have happened, not just the fall of the Executive but the changed attitude of Britain towards the situation in the North.</P>
      <P>I would not see the UWC strike as the primary contributory element in the fall of the Northern Executive but the general election which was called by Mr. Heath back in February last year, which totally undermined the work of his colleague, Mr. Whitelaw, who had been working there for so many years to build up the Executive and Assembly.  That decision of Mr. Heath to take on the miners at that time could be seen merely as irresponsibility or that he did not know the repercussions of that in Northern Ireland.  I think it could be read in other ways, perhaps as an indication that England does not quite want to get out of Northern Ireland with the same alacrity as it did before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I seem to be straying from the point.  What I am talking about is the timing of this debate.  It is very relevant to the timing of the fall of the Executive in Northern Ireland because it was in the context of that Executive and the Sunningdale Agreement that this Bill came into being. It is an unusual piece of legislation.  I think the Minister for Justice would admit that himself.  It has all kinds of <Col N="168" /> strangely angular legal provisions in it to get around the problem of extradition. All these decisions and concessions were made against the background of the Sunningdale Agreement. Now that the Sunningdale Agreement has, in fact, disappeared, the grounds on which this Bill is to be discussed are radically different.</P>
    <P>Since then there has been among the distressing situations that have arisen in the North the continued harrassment of the Catholic ghettos, the extraordinary power that the UDA have achieved, the fact that the British Government have done nothing about the 100,000 licensed guns in the hands of Northern Protestants, whereas the Catholic ghettos are defenceless, the fact that the searches are still discriminatory and the fact that sectarian rhetoric has increased rather than decreased, particularly on the Unionist side in Northern Ireland. The situation has become extremely problematical.  We are not talking about the same situation as we had after Sunningdale, though God knows that was problematical enough.</P>
    <P>These would seem to be reasons for introducing the Bill, though from the other side they have been presented for not reading the Bill, for not putting the Bill on the Order of Business.  Having regard to the fact that so much passion, indeed so much eloquence and reasoned speech too, have been lavished on the issue so far on the mere Order of Business debate it seems to me that there is a crying need in the Seanad to have the whole question of Northern Ireland at this moment re-examined.  This Bill would provide a context, an angle of vision, a platform for review, so to speak, of what has happened in Northern Ireland since Sunningdale.  The Seanad is the best place to initiate such a debate.  A request for such a debate has been on the Order Paper for about nine months by Senator West and myself, Motion 23.  We have only once debated Northern Ireland since this Oireachtas came into being and that was last July.  It was a debate called the &ldquo;12 Hours Notice&rdquo;, where the Minister for Foreign Affairs came in, in many ways to block certain fissures that had arisen in the Dáil <Col N="169" /> because of the difficulty of the debate there.  It was not a satisfactory debate. We had not sufficient warning of it.  In despair of not having Motion 23 ever discussed and recognising the need to have the situation in Northern Ireland reviewed at the moment, I would with those reservations and for those reasons support the Bill being placed on the Order of Business today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamWhyte" hpid="Mr. Whyte Mr. Whyte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Whyte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the inclusion of the Bill on the Order of Business for the simple and sole reason that we have had opportunities enough in the past number of months and number of years to deplore the activities of people on both sides of the Border with regard to what has been going on.  All sections in Church and State and at all levels have deplored the tragedies that have occurred and that are still occurring. It is very easy for us to do this and live within ourselves and say, as one of the Senators has said already, that we ought to concern ourselves with legislation for the Twenty-six Counties and the Twenty-six Counties alone.  We have a far greater responsibility than just to think of ourselves alone.  This will give us an opportunity to debate something that has been spoken about all over the country and all over the world.  There have not been any opportunities in the last 12 months in either Houses of the Oireachtas to debate this question.  It is a question which I think ought to be debated responsibly and calmly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disappointed that already in the House it appears to be used as a platform, maybe with an eye to getting votes, maybe with an eye to getting back to old entrenched positions that we had in past years and that we still appear to be harping back to.  I think this is a mistake. All of us realise that there have been mistakes made in the last 50 or 60 years in this country.  Nobody could say now: &ldquo;What I said at that time was right and has been proved right.&rdquo; As Senator McCartin has said, if anyone is to look for inspiration at the writings of someone who is dead for over 50 years, they were not <Col N="170" /> Solomons, they were not inspired, they were not God Almighty and they could not, with the best will in the world, visualise at that time the changes that would come about in the world and in this country over that length of time.  We have to look at things as they are now and give ourselves an opportunity to debate things as they are.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves what can be done to help the situation we find in our country.  If by changing our laws here or helping to change them on the other side, there is something positive that can be done to help the situation, then we ought to discuss those changes that might come about.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief, as usual.  Most of the reasons why this Bill should not be on the Order of Business have been given. My reason is that I feel it is unconstitutional. We will leave that one to the lawyers to hammer out.  I believe it cannot be worked and I am convinced that anyone from the Twenty-six Counties who would be tried in any court in the North would not get a fair trial.  I believe that until we have an all-Ireland court for an all-Ireland Parliament, we should not have a common law enforcement area.</P>
      <P>Why is there this terrible rush at the moment?  The whole thing was moved six months ago.  Why come along today and change from the Dáil to the Seanad and rush it through as other legislation has been rushed through in this House?  Somebody referred to Fianna Fáil and the Offences Against the State Act.  It was very funny that a bomb could change the whole tone of the Opposition to vote with Fianna Fáil.  Now they are in office and why have they not got the guts to repeal it?  In this legislation, we have a recipe for civil war and I hope everyone in this House will take it very seriously because we do not want the Queen's writ to run through the country once more and have another Act of Union.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the introduction of this Bill into the Seanad or of its transfer from the Dáil, although its transfer from the <Col N="171" /> Dáil, as somebody said, is a measure of the general ineptitude of the Coalition Government in handling their business, which they have shown throughout their period of office.  I wish to oppose the Bill in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the introduction of the measure for discussion on the Order Paper today.  As a result of listening to the debate, it must be clear that this is a highly dangerous Bill. Listening to the intensity of the conflict, the angry exchanges between Senators&mdash;this is normally a very sedate and conservative and reserved part of the Oireachtas&mdash;the condemnations, the imputations, must give everybody some idea of the kind of feelings this Bill is going to generate in this House in the course of the debate and then, later on to a much greater extent, in the Dáil and thereafter, possibly, in the country. There is the possibility that the Government may have some idea that this could be turned into a good law and order issue at a general election in the absence of any other issue which they could safely go to the country on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of this has to be borne in mind in the consideration of the Bill.  Above everything, it seems to me to be a very dangerous Bill, not at the moment anything like as necessary as it might have been said to have been at some stages in recent years.  Therefore, the whole motivation of the Government in bringing the Bill in is a very devisive proposal at this stage and is particularly obscure.  There is a possibility that it is part and parcel of the general move towards the creation of the two States idea&mdash;effectively extradition between two independent States, the Northern State and the Southern State.  This, taken with the other measures, like the Broadcasting Bill which is before us, the provision for BBC being brought in here and, of course, the amendment of the Constitution Articles, a Constitution <Col N="172" /> determining the jurisdiction of the State, may be part of an overall plan of the Government.</P>
    <P>However, in opposing the introduction of this Bill one has to be particularly careful that one is not put in the position because he opposes the Bill, of being opposed to law and order.  It would be difficult to pin that particular label on me but I am sure, looking back at the number of labels that have been pinned on me from time to time, it would not deter anybody from trying to do so.</P>
    <P>My approach to the problem of unity has always been different from most other people except a few members of the Labour Party at one time.  There are many things that should be done down here first.  At all times I have said I do not want to be united to a group of people who could only be united with me at the point of a gun.  I would prefer to see a society in which there was unity by agreement.  I could understand very well the reasons why the Northern Unionist Protestant would be very frightened to become part of a united Ireland in the terms of the ethos of our society and in the context of the laws and Constitution of our State.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I believe the introduction of a Bill of this kind is a wrong decision on the part of the Government because of the many other Bills which should be introduced in the first instance if they were serious about their will to create the pre-conditions of a united Ireland. These are the obvious ones in relation to our marriage laws, in relation to divorce, contraception, a non-sectarian educational system and in the general upgrading of the standard of our people, the reduction in the number of unemployed and so on.  All of these are obvious social improvements and freedom of conscience which must be provided for in this Southern State before we could expect the Northern Unionist Protestant willingly to come into a united Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I must intervene and point out to the Senator that we are not debating the question of the unity of Ireland but <Col N="173" /> the question of the administration of law in the two parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your correction but I think the general pattern of this Bill was introduced in the wake of the Sunningdale Agreement which was directed towards the general policy of uniting Ireland in a particular way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for that reason that the Senator was allowed to develop his remarks about the context in which the Bill was introduced but it would not be proper for me to allow him to continue at length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to continue in any detailed way but I presume that we will be allowed to do so if the Bill is eventually taken.  This was obviously the way in which the Coalition Government should have proceeded, but instead of that of course they proceeded in exactly the reverse direction particularly in relation to the extraordinary behaviour of the Taoiseach in relation to the Contraception Bill.</P>
      <P>This increased rather than diminished the fears of the Northern Unionist.  The most important part of all is the extraordinary behaviour of the Labour leadership on this Bill, and especially of the Minister, Deputy Cooney, who in Dáil Éireann had created a remarkable all-party impression of being an extremely talented person and very liberal in his general attitude to legislation and to the use of the courts.  Most of us who read his speeches or listened to his speeches three or four years ago were very impressed by the general broad vision that he had of the whole question of law and justice and the exercise of justice in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He, together with the Labour leadership, now seem to be doing one of the most spectacular policy somersaults the National Coalition could have done in introducing this Bill. As Senator Mullen said, the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union Congress and the Labour Party are all opposed to this kind of repressive legislation.  We set <Col N="174" /> out to oppose this kind of legislation.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are in the difficulty, of course, that they have put on the Statute Book some of the most repressive laws&mdash;indeed the most repressive laws&mdash;that there are on the Statute Book.  They were opposed by the Labour Party and in particular by Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien who was the Labour Party spokesman on the North, and these laws were recognised as the most repressive laws in Europe or in North America.  This was the description given to them by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien at the time.</P>
    <P>It is absurd, in that context, to talk about democracy or to talk about maintaining, preserving or protecting democracy when the courts do not observe the simplest recognised rules of Common Law.  People are arrested, tried, convicted and sent to jail in the most summary fashion and this Bill proposes to continue and reinforce the existing grossly illiberal laws already on the Statute Book to which all of us in the Labour Party were completely opposed.</P>
    <P>I know I am not allowed to deal with the Bill in detail, but anybody who looks into section 19 will see the extraordinary provision where any person may arrest in certain circumstances. It seems to go much further than even the existing very repressive Offences Against the State laws.</P>

It is obviously very difficult to see how we can justify here the introduction of a Bill which would allow for giving power to the RUC or the various security services in the North of Ireland who on their record have shown themselves to have little concern for justice or the rights of individuals before the courts.  In <Col N="175" /> recent months we have been pursuing at Strasbourg the behaviour of these people in torturing persons whom they have taken into custody, alleging that they have tortured them.</P>

      <P>Can these people be permitted to give evidence in our courts in the light of our experience in relation to their treatment of people in their custody in the North of Ireland?  There is the further danger that the fact that this civil war which now exists in the North of Ireland, as a result of this interchange of the various police forces, the various special branches, the security forces and the giving of evidence, the fact that our Government will have to collaborate more obviously, more openly and more frequently with these forces of the North of Ireland&mdash;all of this must add to the likelihood that the civil war already existing in the North will spread to the south.  We will find ourselves in the same position as they are in the North, with continual sporadic appalling killings and murders between the various sects and groups which have built up there since this first started.  For these reasons I intend to vote against putting this item on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>While I share the viewpoint of my colleague, Senator Mullen, that some sections of the trade union movement have already expressed opposition to this Bill in whole or in part, nevertheless I am in favour of a First Reading.  I am in favour of it because I clearly believe <Col N="176" /> that no question or issue can be properly resolved without full, frank, open and democratic debate and discussion. If we fail or refuse to discuss any question coming before this House, then that moment is a dangerous one for the parliamentary and democratic process.</P>
      <P>However, I am opposed to the implication that in referring this Bill to this House it will have a much easier or more speedy passage here than in the other House.  That will not be so.  It is already clear and beyond all doubt that many Senators hold very strong views about this Bill, especially bearing in mind that the Bill postulates the application of fair and impartial justice not only in this part of the State but in Northern Ireland as well.  Those of us who have any experience of the judicial system in Northern Ireland will, of course, have very serious reservations about certain sections of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am tending to do what so many speakers before me have done, that is to discuss the Bill itself.  I shall refrain from doing that but I will give notice that in agreeing to a First Reading, or in voting for a First Reading for that matter I reserve my decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to that of speakers on this side of the House against the introduction of this legislation on the Order Paper today.  I was surprised when I heard Senator Robinson saying that she thought it political wisdom on the part of the Government to introduce this legislation in the Seanad.  Most Members have said that we would like more legislation to come before us but if we have legislation coming before us I would like to see it coming in the front door and not through the side door or the back door.  This legislation was laid before the Dáil and it came out the back door yesterday evening.  Indeed, when there is legislation of this type, legislation that can be so significant in the future if implemented and that can have serious consequences from a national point of view, I honestly think that the proper place to debate it is in the Dáil where we have the elected representatives of the people to <Col N="177" /> pass judgment on it.  That is not taking from the status of this House.  Legislation of this type should be debated fully in the people's Parliament and that is in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, this legislation was placed before the Dáil and taken out a side door.  If we, in this House are going to deal with any legislation before it goes to the Dáil I think it should come in the front door and not as it has happened in this case.</P>
      <P>There are many reasons why we object to this legislation.  We in the Fianna Fáil Party, in the first instance, think that it is unconstitutional and that I feel quite certain will be proved when it is properly debated.  I cannot say more than has been said already on this side of the House in regard to the reasons why we object to even giving this Bill a First Reading.  We will vote against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackGarrett" hpid="Mr. Garrett Mr. Garrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice in opposition to this Bill on the Order Paper today.  The Bill is unworkable and unconstitutional.  Some months ago after the Sunningdale Conference, of which this Bill is part and parcel, the Taoiseach made a statement in Dáil Éireann.  He was questioned on this particular aspect of that conference and he said the Sunningdale Conference and Agreement was a package deal and that no part of it could be dealt with in isolation. This is a package within that parcel and now, at the whim of a foreign Government in collusion with our Ministers of State, the package has been taken out of that parcel and has been foisted on the Irish people. There is no need for anybody to be in any doubt at all that this Bill is being foisted on the Irish people and being forced into Irish legislation at the whim of the British Government.  The British Government have already enacted a Bill through the House of Commons.  That Bill is unworkable and untenable unless a similar Bill is brought through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Then co-operation will be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt the wisdom of Senator McCartin when he tells us on this side of the House especially that we can <Col N="178" /> trust our Ministers in conference with their counterparts across the water.  I doubt very much if that statement would go down with some of the people throughout the length and breadth of this country because we know&mdash;and it is not very difficult to get proof&mdash;that secret agreements were made between a Cumann na nGaedhael Government in this country and the British Government.  We know that none of these secret agreements were discovered until after the election of February, 1932.  One of those secret agreements was the paying of the land annuities.  Our memories are not so short and I would like Senator McCartin to remember that. Our trust in some of these Ministers is very, very low.</P>
    <P>Neither I nor anybody else here believes that there is justice being dished out by the courts in Northern Ireland.  I think every speaker here today has expressed the opinion that there is no such thing as justice being meted out by the courts in Northern Ireland.  Why then are we asked to introduce a Bill in the southern part of the country to co-operate with the unjust system in the North of Ireland? I believe that if this Bill does eventually find its way on to the Statute Book it will be the cause of more bloodshed.  It will not ease the strife that exists in the North at present; it is my belief that it will even increase bloodshed and killings which I would be very, very sad to see happening.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is any necessity for the introduction of this Bill or taking up the time of this House.  The legislation I should like to see coming before both Houses of the Oireachtas is legislation that would reduce unemployment which now stands at the staggering figure of 103,000.  We need legislation now to reduce the cost of living and the number of redundancies.  I am sure that everybody in this country realises that this Bill is of no benefit or credit to the people of southern Ireland.  It has been introduced at the whim of the British Government. They cannot enforce their legislation until we bring in a Bill&mdash;a counterpart of the British Bill&mdash;so that both <Col N="179" /> Governments can get together and operate the legislation.</P>
    <P>Those are sufficient reasons for me to oppose the introduction of this Bill on the Order Paper today.</P>

      <P>This House has always prided itself in having within its four walls a less political atmosphere than that which exists in the Lower House.  I have been listening to some contributions this morning, and I hope that that standard will continue to apply.  I also hope that, after what I regard as the first emotional outbursts on a Bill such as this we will be able to maintain certain standards in the Second Reading debate.</P>
      <P>I can express only pious aspirations, an expression of hope that there will be a more intellectually honest attitude towards the provisions of this Bill, that there will be a less simplistic attitude towards what it is trying to do, less simplistic in regard to everything in a black and white light, with no grey area whatsoever. I hope that there will be much more awareness of the reality of the effects of both bomb and bullet on the human body, on the jobs and livelihoods of people, and the difference in having or not having a job.  I hope there will be on all sides much less talk about the Bill being unconstitutional&mdash;the place to prove its constitutionality or otherwise is in the courts, after it has gone through both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were two points running through the Opposition's words this morning, namely, the urgency of the Bill and its relevance.  The Bill is attempting to deal with, as an urgent matter, the effects on people and their livelihoods, and on the economic life of this country.  That is an urgent matter which has to be attended to and it certainly has relevance in anything that we attempt to do.  I hope that every paragraph will be digested here in this House, because I am confident that, through its being digested constructively and responsibly, the public will brush away a lot of the cobwebs that have been allowed to collect in this <Col N="180" /> country over 50 years.  Let us have no more talk about 700 years submission to British rule.  We had enough talk about that in the past and it has left the country in the state it is today.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is unconstitutional, let the courts so decide.  I do not think it is within the ambit of anybody in this House, or in the Lower House, to so decide.  Our job is to discuss the provisions of this Bill in a sensible cool manner as befits the standards of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to speak for long.  Coming from an area near this unnatural geographical Border, I have more interest in this than might appear at first sight.  In my view, it is idle to contend that this House is equipped as well as the Dáil in any way to deal first with this Bill.</P>
      <P>Senators know that the Seanad is far from being as democratically elected as the Lower House.  This prompts me to ask how we became so important, notwithstanding the fact that I would very much like to see us being asked to legislate and there is no reason why we should not.  At present, there are five vacancies in this House, some of them of 12 months' standing.  That is the importance that is attached to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Senator Markey spoke about bringing the Bill to the courts.  There are far too many courts in the country. In 1967 An Cathaoirleach served on the Committee on the Constitution. Page 29 of the report of that committee states that the possibility of improving the composition of the Seanad by ordinary legislation within the framework of the Constitution should be reviewed from time to time. Now is the time to do this, when there are five vacancies in the Seanad. I would not mind if this were an ordinary piece of legislation.  It would not make a bad situation such as exists in the North&mdash;and in fact in the Republic as well&mdash;worse.  I am still at a great loss to know the reason for the indecent haste for this legislation. As mentioned by a previous speaker, this Bill has come to the Seanad by the back door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be very sorry to make any uncomplimentary remarks about the <Col N="181" /> Minister for Justice in his handling of this or about any other Minister, but he is absolutely wrong in bringing in a Bill of this magnitude and of such a dangerous nature to this House.  His action is bordering on lunacy.</P>
    <P>However, I am giving my views on it.  I have lived with Northern people all my life and I hope to die with them, but I would strongly advise the Minister to withdraw the Bill from the House.  Many people who contributed here this morning, although they said they were going to oppose the Bill, said they would vote for its introduction here, which, to my mind, is a very peculiar frame of mind.  I have maintained almost a total vow of silence since I came into this House, but I could not let an occasion such as this pass without speaking, knowing as I do the implications and the seriousness of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The vast majority of the people of this country disapprove of violence.  They believe firmly that violence will not solve the problem of Partition.  They believe that violence tends to exacerbate conditions in the North and to perpetuate divisions.  Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and leaders of Church and State have condemned the outrageous acts that have been committed in the North by all sides.  Many different factions are implicated in the feuds that exist in Northern Ireland.  As long as these violent deeds are perpetrated, there is no hope of bringing all sides together and the hope of uniting northern and southern Ireland is diminishing every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Bill, which is being introduced today, does something to eliminate violence and to bring about the knowledge that violence is not the accepted way to achieve their objectives, and if it enables people to come together to talk over their problems, it will have done something worthwhile. For that reason I support the introduction of this Bill into the Seanad.  I do not see why its introduction is opposed by Members of the House.  As one of the two Houses of the Oireachtas, this is a suitable place to introduce it and I hope the Bill will be examined dispassionately and <Col N="182" /> objectively.  When Members on the other side say they will oppose the Bill, section by section, line by line, word by word, I would prefer if they took the attitude of examining the Bill section by section, line by line and word by word and make their contributions towards producing a good piece of legislation.  That would do something to remove violence from this country and to bring nearer the day when people, having accepted that violence is not the way to reach a peaceful solution&mdash;it perpetuates bitterness and strife&mdash;realise that the way of violence will not be tolerated. In this way people are more likely to come together in an effort to settle their differences and bring about a way of living together while still holding on to their different views.  This can be done only by peaceful means. You cannot get the best out of a man or a community by generating hatred and anger.</P>
    <P>The Opposition should fulfil their role in a democracy by contributing in so far as they can towards what they regard as possible improvements in the Bill rather than opposing the measure totally.  They say they condemn acts of violence so some measure must be introduced to combat violence.  This Bill is an honest attempt to do this and, for that reason, I support the motion that it be included on the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>We have wandered away from the motion.  I welcomed the change of attitude on the part of the Government when they decided to introduce Bills in the Seanad.  I felt this was a very good thing because it gave us an opportunity of discussing Bills at greater length than in the past. <Col N="183" /> Up to now we have had to rush Bills through this House at Christmas and Easter and in the summer at very short notice, with, perhaps, only three or four hours' discussion.  But this Bill is of a different type and this is not the House in which it should be introduced. Some other speaker mentioned that the passing of this Bill through the Seanad would not be a true reflection of the thoughts of the people.</P>
      <P>At present, in the Seanad the Opposition are outnumbered two to one.  We had the misfortune to lose some of our Members through deaths and resignation when a Member took office in the other House.  When the vote is taken on this Bill it will be two to one in favour because of the lineup on the Government side.  The Labour Members must vote with the Government; perhaps one or two may not.  This will be published in newspaper headlines and on the radio and television and it will be made known to the British Government that this Bill has passed through the Upper House in Ireland by a very large majority.  It should be the other way about.</P>
      <P>We saw what happened in the other House last night when the motion to transfer the Bill to this House was carried by only two votes.  If this Bill had been fully discussed, if the Second Stage had been taken in the Dáil, it might not have come here.  There might not have been any need for it to come here as it might not have got through the Dáil.  It is not proper that the Government should decide yesterday to bring in a motion in the Dáil asking that a Bill be transferred to the Seanad. When the motion was passed, the Bill was put before us within 24 hours.  This House should get longer notice of the Business we have before us.  We never know what business is to be transacted when we come in.  It is often changed at the last minute because Ministers cannot attend.  As far as this Bill is concerned we should have got at least one week's notice that the First Stage was coming here.  The same should apply to other Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much has been said about the Bill that I do not think there is any need <Col N="184" /> for me to say anything except, as the other speakers on this side of the House have said, that I am opposed to the Bill.  It is a Bill that is not necessary now as it was part of the Sunningdale package.  It is the only part of the Sunningdale package left and it should go the way Sunningdale did.</P>
    <P>Senator McCartin mentioned Connolly and he said Connolly was dead 50 years and why should we bring back his name now.  The attitude of the Fine Gael Party now is to forget the past. We already had experience of that when they suggested that Easter week commemoration ceremonies should not be held, that we should have one commemoration ceremony on St. Patrick's Day.</P>
    <P>We should not forget Connolly or the past.  The Labour Party of Connolly's time is not the Labour Party of today.  I hope the Labour Party in this House, when we come to vote on the Bill, will do what they did some years ago in the other House when the Offences Against the State Bill was presented by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of what has been said in this debate on the Order of Business will, I feel, be regretted later when passions have cooled and when people read in cold print what they said this morning.  Those who spoke from the Opposition benches, not least the Senator who introduced the motion to have the Order of Business amended, will realise that, perhaps, had the confines of the debate been restricted to the premises which he set the damage which has been done might not have been done. One can never estimate what exactly is going to happen when one lets loose the dogs of war and they were let loose with a vengeance this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two important principles, as distinct from the Bill, are involved.  In the first place there is the right to print a Bill; in the second place there is the question of whether or not the Seanad should be used as a mechanism for introducing legislation in the Oireachtas.  I abhor the attitude which has been taken by the Opposition on this matter.  Very often in the past they have lectured us on the duty of running this House properly <Col N="185" /> and on the principles by which a parliamentary democracy should be conducted. I have said previously, even on an occasion when I disagreed with the Leader of the House, that it seems to be a fundamental principle of the proper running of this House and the Oireachtas in general that Bills should be printed irrespective of how one felt about the contents, that there was no other way in which issues could be debated openly in a democratic fashion other than by having them printed in legislative form and brought before the House and a debate conducted under the rules as laid down in the Standing Orders.</P>
    <P>When we were in Opposition, we consistently opposed attempts to muzzle us in the use of Private Members' Time and consistently sought changes in the Standing Orders of the various Houses so that it would be automatic that any Member or group of Members could have Bills printed and laid before the House.  Those measures were decided on as a result of a proper debate.</P>
    <P>Many members of the Opposition shared my belief in that principle and I believed that Senator Yeats, for example, shared it.  I find this morning that there is an attempt being made to frustrate the printing of a Bill.  I do not think the Opposition can run away from whatever they are trying to do in respect of the principles on which this House must be run.  They will be reminded of it continually in the future when again they attempt to set standards of behaviour which, apparently, we alone are supposed to abide by but from which they can, with impunity, depart whenever party political advantage dictates that we should do so.</P>
    <P>The second point about the use of the Seanad itself I found quite extraordinary. Senator Yeats opened up this avenue when he used the phrase that the Bill should be in Dáil Éireann &ldquo;where it rightly belongs&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Where it rightly belongs&rdquo; was the phrase the Senator used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>But I started by saying that I was entirely in favour of introducing legislation in the Seanad.  I <Col N="186" /> said there were a number of Bills on the Dáil Order Paper which should be introduced here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that one can distinguish between Bills of one type and another.  If we begin to introduce a distinction between the right of this House to decide on legislation <i>vis-a-vis</i> Dáil Éireann we will only be placing this House more firmly and more deeply in a subordinate role to which it has too long been relegated.  I had hoped that the growing use of the Seanad as a means of initiating all types of legislation would have the whole-hearted support of the Opposition who have complained through Senator Yeats as spokesman in past times of the fact that there was too little legislation before the Seanad.  Now, when legislation comes before the Seanad there is objection to the fact that it is coming.</P>
      <P>Some people are voicing objections to it on the ground that this is a less accurate reflection of the popular will than the other House.  On reflection, they will see this to be a very dangerous analysis of the Seanad and of its character.  This would lend support to those who wish to see this House abolished because that is one of the grounds upon which people normally have objection to the existence of a Second Chamber at all.</P>
      <P>Senator Yeats was correct when he said earlier in his speech that yesterday's business in the House lent weight and support for the very existence of a Second Chamber.  By their opposition and attitude here this morning they have damaged the case for the existence of a Second Chamber and for its proper use in the whole legislative process.  Apart from this departure on grounds of party political advantage from two principles which I know many Senators really adhere to, we have had a debate which in many ways has been unfortunately and regrettably a regression to civil war attitudes.  We have had a reemergence of a species of a political animal which in my naivety I thought was extinct.  It has been shown this morning that it is very much alive, and extremely vocal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="187" /> I do not believe that the cause of national unity or, in fact, the cause of reconciliation or peace in this island has in any way been advanced by the type of sentiments which we have heard here this morning.  I firmly believe that the only beneficiaries of much of the content of this debate will be those who go into the Convention election on the same platform, of having absolutely nothing to do with the other part of the island, which they regard as a foreign country. I believe that they will refer to many of the sentiments and opinions and views expressed here this morning as evidence of the justice and correctness of their policy position.</P>
    <P>As regards the Bill itself which is an extension of the criminal law I want to say just two other things. Murder is murder no matter where it is committed, no matter by whom it is committed and no matter for what purpose it is committed.  However people may object to labels being put on them I think that those who oppose the very principle behind this Bill cannot object to the fact that they are going to be, on occasion, put into the situation where they will be seen to be, whether they like it or not, condoning those who perpetrate murder in a part of this country for whatever reason they may do so.  People die by bullets and by bombs.  They are no less human because they belong to a different political culture than us, or even because they belong to a different island and are the servants or the agents of another State.</P>
    <P>We have a situation here at the moment where those who it is alleged are associated with and may be, in fact, responsible for the violence leading to loss of life or grievious bodily harm, can use the confines of this State as a haven to avoid arrest. If we wish to have that situation continue I think we should have the honesty to say so.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading and the subsequent debate on this Bill we will have the opportunity of doing so if that is how we feel.  But it would have been more appropriate that those sentiments would have been expressed <Col N="188" /> on the Second Reading and on subsequent stages of the Bill rather than on the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>The names of Connolly and Larkin have been quoted here this morning. There is nothing that I have ever read on Connolly or Larkin that condoned murder.  There is nothing that I have ever read of James Larkin in particular that leads me to believe that he was an advocate of violence.</P>
    <P>In fact my own party from its inception has taken a particular attitude towards the democratic will of the people and has played its own unique role and made its own distinct contribution towards the establishment of this State but in particular towards the organs of democracy within this State, a contribution which I think it is now widely admitted was responsible for the stability of the State in its initial period and, in fact, might have been the <i>sine qua non</i> for their very existence and continued operation.</P>
    <P>We do not really need to be reminded by the Opposition benches whatever about our own, about the writings, the attitude, the philosophy of Connolly because it has seldom if ever been the case that the Fianna Fáil Party had much time or regard or respect for the socialist critique of society which is Connolly's major contribution to the history of this country and to the history of the world of thought and especially to the history of international socialism.  None of us is going to sit here on the Labour benches and take unctuous lectures and hypocrisy from the Fianna Fáil Party as regards Connolly or Larkin. We know what it is that they attempted to do through the formation of our party.  We know who it is in this society who has consistently opposed the principles upon which that party was founded and who have been its political entities and adversaries over the last four-and-a-half to five decades.  The policy of the Labour Party both in Opposition and in Government has been that when Bills are tabled, whether by the Government, by individual Members of the House or by groups of Members they should be given the right to be printed.  They should also be given <Col N="189" /> the right of debate and the opportunity for a decision to be made on their content.  We had this matter debated in a certain way on another Bill recently in the House.  I made those points then.  I make them now: irrespective of what is contained in the Bill, it is the duty of this House from a democratic point of view to permit the Bill to be printed.  Objections in principle can be voiced on the Second Stage.</P>
    <P>That really is the issue here this morning, not whether one is for or against this Bill but whether one is for or against the right of not only the Government but of Members of the Oireachtas to have Bills printed. That principle, regrettably and unfortunately, is being opposed here this morning by people that privately believe in it but who are compelled for party reasons to vote against it.  I regret that very much indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Senator Yeats is satisfied with the debate he has initiated by means of his amendment to the Order of Business. For my part, I believe that some of the remarks made here today are a grave disservice to this nation.  I believe they are demeaning of this House and have led to what many of us hoped we would not see in this House, such a lowering of standards that one finds it difficult to withhold contempt from some of the remarks which have been made.</P>
      <P>I do not blame Senator Yeats for that.  No more than anyone else, he cannot see into the future and obviously he did not realise what he was triggering off by the amendment to the Order of Business to delete Item No. 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to divide what I have to say into two main parts.  I want to deal first with the general question which has been raised here of Government business in the Seanad and the desirability of having more Government business before us.  This was referred to by a number of speakers on the Fianna Fáil benches who began by pinning their colours to the belief that more Government business <Col N="190" /> should be introduced here and then connected it up with the next part of their speech by a large &ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash;but they did not believe that it should have been done in connection with this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is not very long ago since those of us on this side of the House had to sit here with what patience we could muster to hear condemnations and fulminations coming across the floor of this House from those benches because the Government had not introduced enough Government business in this House.  I want to refer briefly to the Seanad debate which took place on 12th February. We had the Leader of the Fianna Fáil group telling us that it was a matter of concern to Fianna Fáil:</P>
    <P>that sufficient business is not coming forward to the Seanad for discussion, particularly in the form of legislation from the Government.</P>
    <P>He told us that it was a</P>
    <P>primary duty of the Government to bring forward legislative business to this House.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;to the Seanad.  He went on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>To put it bluntly, they are not fulfilling that duty and we want to register our protest in this manner. We wish to state that the responsibility lies with the Government to bring in legislation and have it expedited so that we get a volume of legislative business.</P>
    <P>That was a couple of months ago. Senator Dolan who contributed&mdash;let me be charitable&mdash;one of his least worthwhile speeches today said then:</P>
    <P>If the legislation is not coming through from the Government side, then the Seanad does not meet.</P>
    <P>He went on to say at column 501 of the 12th February:</P>
    <P>I have a vivid recollection of a Parliamentary Secretary appearing on television and blaming the Seanad for meeting only two days inside the last term.  He neglected to point out to the public and to the media at large the reason for this. The Senators are anxious to meet <Col N="191" /> and do their business if the business is given to them.</P>
    <P>He is getting the business today and we all heard the kind of speech he made.</P>

      <P>Senator Hanafin who contributed here today spoke also on 12th February and as reported at column 503, said:</P>
      <P>We are fully aware that it is a matter for the Government to give us business to do.  Because there has been lack of legislation in the last year we have met only on a few occasions to deal with it.</P>
      <P>I do not know if Senator Keegan contributed today so I will omit the quotation I was going to give from him.  We all heard Senator McGlinchey today.  This was Senator McGlinchey a couple of months ago:</P>
      <P>I should like the Seanad to transact more business and I should like to think that the present Cabinet could be made capable of introducing legislation and so giving us more business.</P>
      <P>That was Fianna Fáil a couple of months ago.  We all heard them here today.  I hope they can reconcile in some consistent manner the views which they were expressing today with that attack which was mounted on the Government a few months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, I should like to say a few words with regard to the Order of Business and the amendment proposed to it.  I think possibly part of the explanation, and perhaps only part of it, for the type of speech made today by some Fianna Fáil Senators was crass ignorance of what is being proposed. It was a failure on their part to read the Long Title of the Bill which appears on the Order Paper.  We heard speaker after speaker talking about the administration of justice in the North.  We heard Senator McGlinchey in particular categorising those who supported this measure as <Col N="192" /> being collaborators with the British. That was the type of language that was used.</P>
      <P>We were told Fine Gael were playing their old traditional role.  We had this referred to as a &ldquo;despicable measure&rdquo;.  He spoke of &ldquo;pussyfooting&rdquo; with the British.  I think&mdash;again, I do not want to be too hard on him&mdash; that kind of speech was made because Fianna Fáil do not understand what is being proposed.  They do not understand that this Bill proposes to enable the Irish administration of justice here to deal with offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not ask me to answer for the understanding of anyone on that side of the House. That is what is being proposed here and that is what is apparent from the Long Title of this Bill.  What is being proposed is that the jurisdiction of the Irish criminal law should be extended so as to enable certain serious offences, even if committed in the North of Ireland, to be triable and punishable under our law presided over by one of our judges in our courts and if witnesses to that act or offence in the North are afraid to travel down here to give their evidence, to enable a commission to be set up to go up there and get that evidence and to enable the accused to be present at that commission and to enable Irish judges to be present at that commission.</P>
      <P>That is what is proposed and yet we hear all this talk about the lack of confidence in the administration of justice in the North, &ldquo;pussyfooting with the British&rdquo;, &ldquo;collaborating with the British&rdquo;.  What we are trying to do is to ensure that Irish judges in Irish courts will adjudicate on these matters.  What are these matters? They are serious offences, such as murder, maiming, kidnapping, burning churches, burning dwelling houses with people inside them.  If that is done in the North of Ireland and a fugitive offender comes down here, we are not going to&mdash;to use a famous phrase&mdash;stand idly by and let him get off scot free.</P>

      <P>We are not going to hand him over to be dealt with as others may choose to deal with him.  We are going to arrest, try and punish him here if he is convicted.  That is what Fianna Fáil are opposing.  Let me be quite blunt about this.  I do not think anyone in Fianna Fáil condones murder or kneecapping or burning churches or burning buildings with people inside them, but look at the position they are putting themselves in. Anyone who does condone murder should oppose this Bill.  Anyone who does condone kidnapping should oppose this Bill.  Anyone who does condone kneecapping should oppose this Bill.  Anyone who wants to see churches burnt in the North of Ireland should oppose this Bill.

This is the company Fianna Fáil voluntarily are stepping into by their attitude here today and in the Dáil yesterday.</P>
      <P>I do not want to say anything more because I might say too much but I find it hard to forget that a young man who sat behind me on these benches after the last Seanad election, was one of the victims of the murder and terrorism that is rampant in part of this country.

    <Title>Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1975: First Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to extend the criminal law of the State to certain acts done in Northern Ireland, to provide for the admission of evidence obtained by the examination of witnesses in Northern Ireland at trials for offences in respect of those acts, to enable evidence to be obtained by the examination of witnesses in the State for trials in Northern Ireland for corresponding offences under the law of Northern Ireland in respect of acts done in the State, to reform the criminal law in other respects and to provide for related matters.</P>
      <P>This Bill is intended to deal with the fugitive offender.  The terms of the Bill will be the same as the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1974, which was discharged from the Dáil yesterday.  As the objects of the Bill are set out clearly in the Long Title which appears on the Order Paper, a lengthy explanation of the purposes of the Bill would seem to be unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Briefly, the purpose is to extend the criminal law of the State as regards certain serious offences to things done in Northern Ireland.  These include murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, false imprisonment, offences against the person under the provisions of sections 18 and 20 of the Offences Against the Person's Act, 1961, that is, wounding with intent to cause grevious bodily harm and actually causing grevious bodily harm.  There are also other serious matters, such as aggravated robbery and unlawful seizure of an aircraft.  If the act done in Northern Ireland is one which, if done here, would constitute one of the serious offences in question, then the provisions <Col N="196" /> of the Bill would make it an offence against our law, which would be triable and punishable here as if committed in this State.</P>
    <P>The Bill would close a loophole which exists for the fugitive offender under the Extradition Act, 1965, section 11 (1) of which prohibits extradition for a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Extradition Act are in accordance with The Hague Convention to which we are parties.  It appears that there might be constitutional difficulties about trying to tackle the fugitive offender problem by trying to amend the extradition Act.  We accepted The Hague Convention and constitutionally under Article 29, we accept generally recognised principles of international law as our rule of conduct in our relations with other states. This Bill would establish the principle of extra-territorial jurisdiction, that is, triable where arrested, and the act being deemed to be an offence against our law, even if committed in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the Bill there is provision, subject to safeguards for taking evidence on commission if witnesses do not attend here, and reciprocal arrangements for the taking of evidence on commission here.  The Government consider the measure to be one of extreme importance and want to get it under way.  As the Minister for Justice explained in the Dáil yesterday, the possibility of getting it under way in the Dáil at present is virtually ruled out by reason of the financial business now occupying the Dáil.  This is likely to continue until the end of the present month, if not for a longer period.  It was, therefore, decided to proceed with this Bill in the Seanad. There is nothing in any way sinister or evasive about this procedure.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is passed here, it will in any event have to go back to the Dáil and the Dáil will be free to give it the fullest consideration and debate.  This proposal is a practical, common sense step, having regard to the volume of business in the Dáil and the desirability of proceeding with this measure.  It also recognises, in a way <Col N="197" /> which should be appreciated and I hope will be appreciated, by Senators, the role of the Seanad as one of the legislative bodies in the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing the First Reading of this Bill, and I do so with some reluctance.  I have expressed the view in the past that the First Reading should, in almost all cases, be allowed to go through, so that the House can see exactly what they are dealing with; so they can see the contents of the Bill and know exactly what is being put before the House.</P>
      <P>In this case it is quite clear what is coming before the House, because we have seen the Bill, as printed in the Dáil, and I assume the Bill to be printed for the Seanad will be the same.  The situation here is, therefore, somewhat different.  We know what is coming before us and we disapprove of it.  Consequently, we think it should be opposed from the very beginning.</P>
      <P>We have expressed some surprise and suspicion at the extraordinary haste with which this Bill has been discharged in the other House, and almost immediately introduced in the Seanad.  One would have thought that the Government would have given an interval of at least a week, so that the Seanad could consider the views expressed in the Dáil, and have time to look at the Bill which was discharged there, and be in a better position to decide if it should be allowed a First Reading in this House. One of the many things of which we disapprove is the extraordinary haste with which it was discharged in the Dáil, with no notice, and introduced here today with little or no notice or time for the Seanad to consider the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real question to which we on this side of the House would like to have the answer is whether the Government have any serious intention of pushing this Bill through the House.  Is this merely a manoeuvre or device to get it off the Order Paper in the Dáil?  Sweep it under the carpet, send it to the Seanad and let it take its place with the many motions which have been on the Order Paper for many months past.  If that is the case, if it is merely something to try to <Col N="198" /> avoid embarrassment on the part of the Government, then we can treat that device with contempt and leave it at that.</P>
    <P>Do the Government really intend to put this Bill through?  It seems to me unbelievable that they are serious about putting this Bill through at the present time, before the Convention elections are held in the North, or before we have any idea of what kind of administration there will be in the North.  It is quite clear that this Bill was introduced as part of the Sunningdale packet.  In that context, when we expected to have a power-sharing Executive in operation in the North, when we expected to have a Council of Ireland, when we expected to have the position where the Executive in the North, and the Nationalist members of the Executive, would have some influence over the police and the legal structure there, then at least a case could have been made for this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not think that it would have been acceptable or workable, and I doubt very much if it would be constitutional. At least, I concede that it would be possible to make a case for it.  In the present context, when the Executive has collapsed, where we have no idea of what kind of administration there will be in the North, and no satisfactory guarantee that the legal structure there will be acceptable to us in any way, then it is quite inconceivable that the Government should be serious in bringing this Bill in and putting it through, if that is their intention.  I cannot believe that they are serious about it.</P>
    <P>It must be realised that this Bill cannot be looked at in isolation. There is a similar Bill being put through the British Parliament so this means that if these two Bills go through, not only will our law officers and so on have to work in conjunction with the RUC, have to ask for facilities and help from the British Army in the North, facilities and help from the legal structure in the North, but, in turn, we will be asked to give the same facilities, the same help, the same co-operation to <Col N="199" /> the RUC, and to the legal apparatus in the North of Ireland.  We will have to give facilities and ask for facilities and there will have to be very close co-operation and collaboration between the two legal structures.</P>
    <P>In the present context, where there is no acceptable government in the North, it is unbelievable that the Government would be serious about this Bill.  A situation can be envisaged where we would be asked to help to produce evidence for a trial in the North of Ireland, a trial over which we will have no control.  Certainly some of the trials that have taken place in the North in recent months and particularly one that took place there within the last week or two, give no confidence whatever that a person being tried for a kind of crime that is envisaged in this Bill would get anything like a fair trial. But we are being asked to introduce a Bill which, together with the Bill in the British Parliament, would be producing evidence and help to put people on trial before that kind of court.</P>
    <P>As I say, I do not think the Government can be serious in suggesting that this Bill should go through at the present time.  It may be&mdash;and I am not going to commit myself in advance&mdash; that in time we will have some kind of a power-sharing executive in the North where a Bill of this kind might be acceptable.  I doubt very much whether it would be constitutional to do it, but it is just barely possible that something of this kind might be considered in the future.  However, it is inconceivable that it should be done at present.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this Bill which is very important to the Government and also to the Opposition.  The Government have on many occasions expressed their concern for and their interest in what they describe as a bi partisan approach on the question of Northern Ireland.  It is quite plain that if the debate here and in the other House has done nothing else it makes it quite clear that this Bill is extremely divisive, that it will mean, if it goes through and even if it is debated, there <Col N="200" /> will be an end to co-operation between the Government and the Opposition on their approach to the Northern Ireland situation.  It is quite clear that it will be divisive not merely between Fianna Fáil and the Government but, having regard to the vote that was held here today, it is quite clear that some of the Government supporters, that some members of at least one of the parties forming the Government, disagree very definitely with this Bill and will vote against it.</P>
    <P>So there is going to be division, not merely between the Government and the Opposition but division within the ranks of the Government parties themselves. The Government have stressed in the past the importance of co-operation between the parties, of a united front between the parties towards the problems of the North.  Apart from the other evils this Bill is going to perpetrate, it is going to put an end to that kind of co-operation and that in itself should be enough to persuade the Government to withdraw the Bill until possibly it might be appropriate at some time in the future.</P>
    <P>If we really knew the answers to some of the questions that have been asked here today, we would be in a better position to vote and to know exactly where we stood in regard to this First Reading.  If we knew what the intentions of the Government were it would be extremely helpful.  If we knew the reason why the Government suddenly discharged it from the Dáil and hurried it into the Seanad it would be very helpful in deciding our position on this Bill.  Not knowing the reason why that was done, not knowing the intention of the Government in the future and not knowing why this Bill is now before us, we have no alternative but to oppose a measure which from every point of view is going to be a bad one, is going to create trouble not only within the Parliament between the Government and the Opposition but even within the Government parties themselves.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I have no alternative but to say that we are against the introduction of this Bill and we will be against it if the Government attempt to put it through this House.</P>

      <P>Before going on to the Bill, could I take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation to the Seanad at its recent decision in relation to the amendment of Standing Orders to enable my participation in the deliberations of the Seanad?  I hope that both myself and my successors in the office I now hold will frequently be able to avail of the opportunity which you have given to the Attorney General for the time being.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Most informed members of the public are quite satisfied of the need to improve, modernise and reform many of the laws of this country.  Most lawyers would agree with them.  So do the Government. And so to set about the task of reforming, simplifying, modernising, codifying and consolidating our laws in a planned and systematic way it seeks the enactment of the Bill which the Seanad is now considering.</P>
      <P>This Bill, when enacted, will establish an institutional framework by means of which law reform can be undertaken more effectively and more expeditiously than heretofore.  Briefly I would like to outline how the Law Reform Commission which will be established under this legislation will function and what its responsibilities will be.  It will be a permanent independent body.  It will prepare from time to time programmes of law reform and will either itself carry out the necessary research and prepare proposals for reform or suggest how best research could, otherwise, be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the work set out in the programmes it will, by means of the mechanisms outlined in the Bill, have power to undertake examination of and conduct research into particular matters of law which may be specifically referred to it from time to time. It will have freedom to regulate its own procedures and business but it is to be anticipated that, in the light of past experience in this country and recent experience elsewhere, it will find it desirable to establish working parties to assist in the preparation of its reports, that it will produce consultative <Col N="203" /> documents circulated for consideration by interested parties prior to the formulation of its final reform proposals and that it will include draft Bills annexed to its reports.</P>
    <P>Being a permanent independent body, it will be able to assess priorities, bearing in mind both the needs for reform in particular areas and the resources available to undertake the necessary research.  The consultation procedures which it is likely to adopt will help to ensure wide and rapid acceptance of its proposals, and the inclusion of draft Bills in its reports should help to obviate unnecessary delays in the implementation of its recommendations which could otherwise arise.  Law reform necessitates research; research and consultation take time.  But the methods which I have just outlined will help to combine thoroughness with expedition.  It is to be anticipated that the proposals contained in this Bill will ensure that law reform will be undertaken speedily, efficiently, and in a manner beneficial to the entire community.</P>
    <P>I would hope that when the provisions of this Bill are understood and contemplated procedures appreciated, a misunderstanding which may have arisen about this Bill may be dispelled. The criticism is often voiced that Governments establish commissions for the purpose of delaying action or postponing difficult decisions.  The unprepossessing list of commissions whose reports have long awaited implementation is not infrequently urged as an argument against the principle of the establishment of commissions as an aid in the legislative process.  Such opinions have led some commentators to the view that the establishment of the commission proposed in this Bill will delay the implementation of the desired reforms in the law.  The very opposite is, in fact, the case.  It is because the Government are concerned to ensure that the maximum amount of law reform is enacted in the shortest possible time that they recommend the establishment of a permanent statutory independent commission with the functions proposed in this Bill.  Experience elsewhere supports the Government's view.  Far from hindering <Col N="204" /> law reform a commission established on the lines contemplated in this legislation will considerably speed the whole process of law reform.  It is for this reason that its establishment is sought by the Government.</P>
    <P>I should like to expand slightly on a point touched on earlier.  Law reform is not a concept of interest only, or indeed primarily for, lawyers.  It is true that the complexity of modern society produces complex laws and the knowledge and skills which lawyers have acquired are frequently necessary for the purpose of modernising, consolidating, simplifying, or codifying much of our law.  While a programme of law reform will therefore necessitate the assistance of specialists with legal training and knowledge such a programme need not, and indeed should not, be a matter of interest only to members of the legal profession or to small exclusive groups in our society.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to anticipate in any way the areas in respect of which priorities will be given in the early programmes of law reform to be proposed by the commission.  It is however quite clear that many aspects of our laws relating to the family, to landlord and tenant matters, to rights and duties arising from the relationship of employer and employee, rights arising from torts, the criminal code, as well as laws which touch on important aspects of basic human rights, require as a matter of urgency immediate careful examination with a view to their reform.</P>
    <P>It will be clear therefore that a comprehensive programme of law reform will produce proposals which will vitally effect the lives of many people in their most important relationships. This being so, it should be appreciated that programmes of law reform can play an important role in the task of reforming Irish Society.</P>
    <P>The Bill is proposing new methods to effect reforms in our laws.  They are not however untried ones.  In framing these proposals consideration has been given to the provisions of the Law Commission Act, 1965, which established law commissions in England and Scotland; the Canadian Law Reform Commission Act, 1971, and the Australian Law Reform Commission <Col N="205" /> Act, 1973, which established similar commissions.  The experience of these countries has been drawn upon and the Government's proposals follow the general principles which these countries have found to be effective.</P>
    <P>In introducing this new institutional framework it would be wrong to think that this implies any criticism of those who have participated in methods which may now be superseded.  On the contrary the unselfish service of those who have served in the past on special committees or commissions is widely recognised.  It is to be anticipated that there will be many opportunities for persons to serve on working parties to be established by the commission and it is to be hoped that the co-operation with those with special knowledge and experience will be forthcoming.  It must however be said that the old methods employed in the past did not produce the action which was so clearly needed in many areas of our laws and that the progress of law reform in the past has been at an unacceptably slow pace.</P>
    <P>In turning to deal with the principle features of the Bill, there are two aspects of section 1 to which particular attention should be drawn.  The commission will be charged with the responsibility of keeping &ldquo;the law&rdquo; under review.  It is proposed that &ldquo;the law&rdquo; in this context will include all the law of the State and will embrace matters of private and public international law as well as matters of legal practice and procedure.  This means that in fulfilling its tasks the Commission will have the widest possible terms of reference and in preparing its programmes it can review the whole law of the State with a view to considering which areas should be given priority and how best to utilise the resources available to the commission or elsewhere for the fulfilment of its purposes.</P>
    <P>Secondly, Senators will observe that the term &ldquo;reform&rdquo; in section 1 is so defined as to permit the commission to formulate proposals not just for updating or amending laws but also for their codification and consolidation. There can be no doubt that the simplification of the law is a desirable end.  Ease of access to law is important not just to help the work of practising <Col N="206" /> lawyers but also in the interests of the public.  It is to be anticipated that law reform programmes will include proposals for codification and consolidation in appropriate areas.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that the Taoiseach may by order appoint a day to be the Establishment Day for the purposes of the Act.  When the members of the commission have been appointed by the Government then the commission can be established by virtue of an order under this section.  It is hoped that the members of the commission will be appointed at the earliest possible opportunity so that the Commission can undertake its important responsibilities as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission is to comprise five persons.  The Government are only to appoint persons who are suitably qualified by the holding of judicial office, by experience as a barrister or solicitor or as a teacher of law or by reason of such other special experience, qualification or training as in the opinion of the Government is appropriate.  This subsection (7) of section 3 is so drafted as to permit the appointment of persons to membership of the commission who are non-lawyers but whose expert knowledge, qualification or training could be of assistance to the commission.  For example, an expert social scientist might well be available whose particular experience would be of considerable value to the commission.  I am aware that the view prevails in England at the present time that only persons with legal qualifications should act as members of a law commission.  I am also aware that the view is held that law reform is too important a matter to be left to the lawyers.  I do not think it is necessary to take up an intransigent position on either of these points of view.  It has however been thought desirable to make provision in the Bill which would allow the Government to appoint a person from a discipline other than a legal one if his qualifications are suitable and a suitable vacancy exists.</P>
    <P>In connection with subsection (7), I would draw the attention of the House to section 14.  This latter section provides that if a judge of the <Col N="207" /> High Court or the Supreme Court is appointed to membership of the commission, an additional judge may be appointed in such circumstances.  A judge who is appointed a commissioner does not cease to hold judicial office but he will not be required to perform his duties as the holder of a judicial office.  It is however recognised that the appointment of a High Court or Supreme Court judge to membership of the commission may make it desirable or necessary for an additional judicial appointment to be made.  Section 14 will permit such an appointment.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) of section 3 provides that the term of office for which a commission is to be appointed is not to exceed five years.  Apart from this restriction the length of appointment and the terms and conditions of appointment are not spelled out in the section.  The reason for this is that it is important that the Government should have considerable discretion in fixing the terms and conditions and length of office of the persons to be appointed. Some commissioners may be whole-time, some part-time.  It may be possible to obtain a suitable person only for a limited period.  So the terms of appointment and the length of office of appointees should not therefore be laid down in advance.</P>
    <P>It is specifically provided, by virtue of subsections (14) of section 3, that the commission is to regulate its procedures and business.  It is clearly desirable that the commission should be independent in the discharge of its functions and so it is right that the Commission should itself decide how best to regulate its procedures and business.  This subsection is however to be read in conjunction with subsection (3) of section 4 which lays down certain guidelines which the commission may, if it considers it appropriate so to do, follow.  I will deal with this subsection in greater detail in a moment or two.</P>
    <P>The general functions of the commission are set out in subsection (1) of section 4.  By charging the commission with the general responsibility of keeping the law under review, a <Col N="208" /> systematic approach to the problem of law reform can be ensured.  Procedures which have been adopted in the past have tended to result in an unplanned approach to law reform, an approach which has meant that many desirable reforms have not been undertaken.  By keeping the law as a whole under review, the commission will be able not only to ascertain the areas where reform is needed but also to assess the areas where priority should be given.  It will from time to time prepare law reform programmes.  In submitting such programmes the commission may recommend the agency by which the necessary examination and research should be undertaken.</P>
    <P>It will be recognised that the resources available to the commission will not be unlimited.  Furthermore, there may well be elsewhere&mdash;for example, in Government Departments &mdash;suitable resources which are not directly available to the commission. Accordingly, whilst the commission will in all probability itself carry out much of the research necessitated by its programmes and formulate proposals arising from this research, nontheless it may be necessary to permit the commission to indicate how research can best be undertaken elsewhere. Subsection (2) (a) of section 4 provides for the programmes to be drawn up in consultation with the Attorney General.  Obviously the Attorney General is especially qualified to discuss with the commission the needs of all Government Departments in matters relating to law reform.  When, after this consultation, its programme has been prepared it will then be submitted by the Taoiseach to the Government.  After approval by the Government, which may be given with or without modification, a copy of the programme is then laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The procedures which I have outlined will ensure that law reform will be undertaken in a planned and systematic way.  It must however be recognised, that it is desirable that power be given to the commission to carry out research and make proposals <Col N="209" /> in areas not referred to in a programme. Accordingly, the necessary statutory authority to do so is given in subparagraph (c) of subsection (2) of section 4.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of section 4 is an important subsection.  For reasons already outlined, it is not desirable that the Oireachtas should lay down rigid procedural rules which the commission must follow.  This subsection does not purport to do so.  However it makes certain suggestions which the commission may decide to adopt. First, it is suggested that the commission might receive proposals from members of the public on matters to be included in law reform proposals. This procedure has been adopted with success elsewhere, and important assistance has been obtained from the views expressed by interested members of the public to the commission. Secondly, in subparagraph (b) it is suggested that the commission should, when it considers it appropriate, examine the legal systems of other countries.  I know that many members of this House will share the view that although our system of law is derived from the Common Law the commission could with advantage consider the laws in civil law jurisdictions when suggesting reforms and improvements in the laws of this country.  Thirdly, a reference is made in subparagraph (c) to the inclusion of draft Bills in the commission's reports.  Such a procedure can obviously materially reduce the length of time between the publication of a commission's proposals and their implementation into law and it is hoped that it will be possible for the commission to adopt this procedure when formulating its Law reform proposals.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (d) of this subsection refers to consultation, subparagraph (e) to the establishment of working parties or advisory committees, and subparagraph (f) to the publication of preliminary working papers.  These subparagraphs contain provisions relating to the process of consultation to which I have already referred.  Adequate consultation prior to the formulation of final recommendations can be of very considerable assistance both in helping <Col N="210" /> to formulate workable and just proposals and also in ensuring their speedy acceptance and enactment.  It is hoped that lawyers, both practising and academic, will take part in working parties or advisory committees and that interested members of the public will avail of the opportunity to comment on preliminary working papers which may be published prior to the final formulation of law reform proposals.</P>
    <P>The last subparagraph, subparagraph (g) of this subsection, suggests that the commission may in its programmes or reports indicate priorities as well as the desirability, scope and extent of any proposals for law reform which may be made.  I know that this House will appreciate that in this field, as in many others, the scarcity of resources &mdash;both financial and otherwise&mdash;must be recognised.  This limitation exists, and of course the commission will be well aware of it.  Accordingly, the commission may well consider it appropriate to point out the particular areas in which priority should be given.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that section 6 of the Bill will require the commission to furnish an annual report of its activities during the year.  The report will also contain references to other matters referred to in the section.  After submission to the Government, copies of the report will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This section together with the preceding section, which provides that a copy of the commission's approved programme is to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, will facilitate discussion in the Oireachtas on law reform matters in general and the work of the commission in particular.  I feel sure that Members of this House will welcome the opportunity which will thus be afforded to contribute to the ongoing work of the commission.</P>
    <P>Sections 7, 8 and 9 of the Bill make provision relating to the financial aspects of the establishment and operation of the commission.  In estimating its financial requirements, the commission will have to bear in mind the amount of remunerated professional assistance which it will require to discharge its obligations under a programme. As the Attorney General will <Col N="211" /> have special knowledge and experience to assist in evaluating the commission's requirements, it has been considered desirable to provide in section 8 that the grants to be paid in each financial year to the commission will be such amount or amounts as the Minister for Finance, on the recommendation of the Attorney General, may consider necessary.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Government's desire to maintain the independence of the commission, it is proposed in section 10 of the Bill that the commission will appoint its own officers and servants.  The size of its staff and their terms and conditions will of course have to be approved by the Minister for the Public Service, but the commission's freedom of choice as to the persons to be appointed will not in any way be interfered with.  In this connection, I should refer to a misunderstanding which arose concerning the purpose of subsections (4) and (5) of section 10.  These subsections do not interfere in any way with the commission's freedom of choice.  Their purpose is to provide machinery for the laying down of methods of selecting applicants for offices under the commission.  These subsections could be used, if it was thought necessary, to shield the commission from any possible criticisms of unfairness in selection processes.</P>
    <P>This section again reflects the view of the Government that it is desirable to provide for a flexible approach to the manner in which the commission will carry out their functions.  By virtue of subsection (2) of section 10 the commission will be able to engage persons in a part-time capacity who may be remunerated by the payment of fees.  Whilst undoubtedly it will be highly desirable that the members of the commission will have available the services of a whole-time professional staff, it will be appreciated that in addition to full-time professional staff the commission should have power to engage, on a fee basis, outside experts to assist in the task of research and preparation of their reports. In this connection I feel sure <Col N="212" /> that the commission will appreciate the desirability of having available to them, either by engagements made under this subsection or by membership of working parties which they might establish, the advice of non-legal experts from disciplines connected with the subject which the commission are studying.  A distinction is drawn in this section between the clerical staff to whom the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956 and the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956 will apply and other officers and servants of the commission.  The reason for this distinction stems from the aim to permit the maximum amount of flexibility in the appointment of the professional staff of the commission.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 will permit the making of superannuation schemes for the commissioners and the whole-time officers of the commission.  The provisions of these sections are in the form usual in enactments of the sort now being considered.</P>
    <P>By virtue of section 13 it will not be possible for a person to be an employee of the commission and a Member of either House of the Oireachtas at the same time.  Senators will have noted that because of subsection (13) of section 3, a person cannot be a Member of the Oireachtas and a commissioner at the same time.  These provisions have been inserted because it is believed that employment with the commission or membership of the commission would not be compatible with the duties of membership of the Dáil or Seanad.</P>
    <P>References has already been made to one aspect of the consequential provisions contained in section 14.  Subsection (2) of this section was inserted so as not to place any barrister or solicitor who may have become a whole-time commissioner or a whole-time officer of the commission at a disadvantage in relation to qualification for appointment to a judicial office.  It is proposed, therefore, that service as a commissioner or as an officer of the commission will be deemed to be practice at the Bar or practice as a solicitor for the purpose of the relevant provisions <Col N="213" /> of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961 and the Courts of Justice Act, 1936.</P>
    <P>In asking the approval of this House for the proposals contained in the Bill, I would like to conclude with a final comment.  The problems of Irish society are many.  Some are of long standing and are particularly intractable; some are susceptible to solution. A Government wishing to improve conditions in this country must act on many fronts&mdash;the economic, the financial, and the social.  I believe, that in the past, not enough attention has been given to the important beneficial effects which can be brought about by a comprehensive, planned programme of law reform.  The failure to realise this has meant that cases of individual injustice have multiplied and the whole of Irish society has been adversely affected.  Many and dramatic changes cannot immediately be brought about as a result of the enactment of the legislation this House is now considering, but its enactment will establish a framework which will enable the difficult task of reviewing, reforming and up-dating our laws to commence on a systematic and planned basis.  The cumulative effect of the work which the commission will undertake will, it is confidently believed, be far reaching, for lasting value, and will result in many improvements for many people living in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have much pleasure in welcoming this Bill which is a very worthwhile one and which I believe will produce very useful reforms in the future.  There is a great deal of useful work to be done in this respect and I believe that the commissioners who will initially be appointed for five years will, no matter how hard they work, do not much more than scratch the surface of the work that needs to be done.  It is a very good thing that they are about to be appointed and that they will be able to catch up on a backlog of work that needs to be done. I welcome the assurances of the Attorney General that the maximum of consultation will take place with those interested in law reform.  The <Col N="214" /> legal profession do not presume to dictate legislation of this kind but they are more than anxious to help to consult and to give their views on the kind of Bills that should be introduced and on the form of those Bills.</P>
      <P>It is necessary that consultation with the legal profession should take place because very often they can point out, from their experience from the practical point of view, proposals that in practice would prove unworkable or would create great difficulties.  From that point of view I think it is important that the legal profession should be consulted and in that way we would avoid having Bills which would be too academic and too theoretical.</P>
      <P>In stressing the necessity for and the desirability of consulting the legal profession, the practitioners, I am not of course for one moment suggesting the academics, the university faculties of law and so on should be ignored.  On the contrary, they in their turn have a very useful and important contribution to make to law reform.  What I am saying merely is that there should be consultation with all sections who can help in the framing of these Bills including, as the Attorney General has said, the non-legal people, so that the Bills will, in fact, be the result of a balanced approach and will have the benefit of views from all interested sections of the community.</P>
      <P>The success of legal Bills in the past, if we can describe them as that, has very often been measured by the amount of consultation that took place.  In some of the Bills that we have had of this kind where there was the maximum consultation the Bills turned out to be very good ones indeed. In a few cases where there was a minimum of consultation, where the draftsmen of the Department concerned felt that they knew all the answers themselves and did not have consultation with practitioners and others, the Bills turned out in practice to be not as good as they might have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In approaching the question of reform consolidation of the law is essential. I am very glad that the Attorney General has mentioned that this will be within the terms of reference of the commissioners because it seemed <Col N="215" /> to me from reading the Bill that there was some doubt whether consolidation would be within their terms of reference. In many branches of the law there were numerous Acts over the years which together make up the law on the subject and it is imperative to have consolidation so that one can get a picture of what the law is on that particular subject.  It is not until one can get a fairly comprehensive picture of the total law on the subject that one can get around to deciding what amendment and reforms are necessary.  I am glad that consolidation will be something that the commission will be dealing with.</P>
    <P>As things stand consolidation and amendment of consolidation and reform are to some extent mutually exclusive. As I understand it, when the law on a particular subject is to be consolidated in one Act it is not permissible to amend the law in any respect, the consolidated Bill must be exactly what was existing up to then, no more and no less.  In order to combine consolidation and reform it would be necessary in such a case first to introduce an amending Bill and then consolidate all the existing law, including the more recent Bill, into one consolidated Act.  This is a rather complicated and slow way of dealing with the situation.  Perhaps the commissioners will be able to look at this precedent which exists as far as I am aware and perhaps this rather restrictive way of dealing with it can in some way be amended so as to make it more speedy and efficient.</P>
    <P>In this connection I understand that in some European countries, in Germany for example, most Bills which go through are in a sense consolidation Bills to the extent that where there is an existing code of law and where it is proposed to amend it in any way the Bill which is introduced is a Bill incorporating all the existing law plus the amendment.  Consequently, the Bill which is eventually passed is the existing law as amended and there is one Bill dealing with all the law on the subject.  If this kind of approach to our legal Bills in the future could be introduced here I think it would be a very useful way <Col N="216" /> and it would avoid the situation which keeps occurring where one has to go back through several Acts to know the law on a particular subject.  It seems to me there should be no reason why amendments in the future should not be done by way of a Bill which would incorporate all the existing law. I certainly hope the commission will consider whether this procedure should be adopted in the future.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the commission should get under way as quickly as possible and produce some Bills as quickly as possible.  In the past there has been very often a long delay between the time when it was apparent that reform was necessary in regard to a particular branch of law and the time when the Bill was actually introduced.  It is essential that the commission should act speedily in the future in regard to branches of the law which obviously need reform and act quickly where, for instance, Supreme Court decisions are given which necessitate an amendment of the law, or in the present context where EEC legislation is introduced which makes it necessary for us to amend the law.  I hope the commission will act quickly.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in the past we have been very slow in introducing law reform.  This was understandable when we consider the amount of work the Attorney General had in the past up to the introduction of the recent Bill appointing the Director of Public Prosecutions, and having regard also to the fact that his staff for law reform was a very limited one.  The commission, under this Bill will, I understand, be given a fairly big staff; there will be five commissioners dealing with law reform and there should be no reason why law reform should not be speeded up very much indeed as compared with the past.  I hope this will be done.  They should take a cue from the Revenue Commissioners who are the only Department who act very very quickly indeed if anything happens which makes it appear to them that they are going to lose taxes or duties of any kind.  This is a precedent which the commissioners should consider.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> One of the things which occurs to me about the Bill and about the Attorney General's speech is the reference to the drawing up of programmes, submitting them to the Government, getting their approval and so on.  This sounds as if it could bog down procedure to some extent.  It sounds as though the commission might fall into the trap of getting too involved in programmes, what particular branch of the law they should take first and how they should approach it.  They might spend too much time drawing up such programmes and submitting them to the Government and waiting for their approval.  I hope that kind of situation will not arise; I hope the commission will show that they realise the urgency of the position by producing a few Bills as quickly as possible as an earnest of their good intention to get their work under way quickly.</P>
    <P>As well as introducing major reforms which, of course, is what the commission are being set up to do, I hope they will also introduce some precedent or rule in regard to the way in which drafting of Bills should be approached.  As far as draftsmen are concerned styles have varied very much in the past.  It is important that some rules should be laid down.  I am thinking in terms of things such as the position of definitions in Bills and the listing of repeals in Bills.  It very often happens that there is a list of definitions at the beginning of the Bill but in addition to that list throughout the Bill there are further definitions. This certainly makes life very difficult for anybody reading the Bill or referring to it for help in deciding what is the law.</P>
    <P>There is also the position of repeals. In a Bill which is, in fact, repealing several earlier Acts, the ideal is that there should be a schedule at the end of the Bill setting out the repeals and, if possible, a schedule setting out what Acts have been amended as well as repealed.  This would enable the practitioner or anybody who wants to refer to the Act to see at a glance in what way the law has been amended by that Act and in what way previous Acts have been <Col N="218" /> affected by it.  This would be very useful indeed and would save a lot of time and prevent mistakes which can be made if this is not done.  I would ask the commission not to make it their major objective but to bear in mind to try to introduce codes of drafting to which draftsmen will conform in future and which will give a certain amount of conformity in regard to points such as the ones I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I would like to say that the kind of Bill which the Law Reform Commission are likely to introduce would in many cases be the kind of Bill which would be appropriate to be introduced in the Seanad.  I can assure the Attorney General that if such Bills are introduced here they will almost certainly get a better welcome than another Bill got here today.  In conclusion, I would like to welcome the Attorney General on his first appearance in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill and, at the same time, welcome the first Attorney General to be permitted under the Rules of this House to address us and to introduce the measure.  I welcome the man with the measure, which one does not always find oneself being able to do easily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to delay the House on this Bill.  It might be correct to say more expressly than the Attorney General has said in his address, though he has implied it, that really our record with regard to law reform is nothing short of lamentable.  It has been extraordinarily bad.  The failure to make progress in this area was most evident when a good deal of light was being shone in the paths of the people whose duty it was to walk there.  For example, the Bankruptcy Law Committee was set up in August, 1962.  It took almost ten years to report its extraordinarily good document, which it did at the beginning of March, 1972.  I am not competent to pronounce on the decisions they reached and the recommendations made on the various aspects of the whole creditor-debtor relationship but I can say this about it: nobody charged in the future even with the <Col N="219" /> new law of bankruptcy will be able properly to advise on it without the assistance of this report. They did not merely make a report or an analysis of the problem with which we were faced: they actually drafted a Bill, which has been there for two years.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure have been there for 13 years, since about 1962 or 1963, and have made 19 reports.  During that period, six people have been working voluntarily&mdash;and I think their names should go on the records of this House&mdash;two judges: Judge Walsh, Judge O'Flynn; a solicitor, Brendan McCormack; Dr. Andrews, Juan Greene and Kenneth O'Reilly Hyland. They have been working for nothing in relation to this matter for that long period, and have prepared 19 reports. Of these, three have been adopted.  I think I am correct in my analysis, but Senator Lenihan may&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to have been the Minister for Justice who&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the political distribution of blame in this, if we want to go into it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall not go into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I could follow Senator Lenihan, but it would not be wise or helpful to this debate. But many of them have been totally ignored.  One of them did not make a recommendation.  Those that have been ignored include matters of such importance as the service of court documents by post, which is a reform intended to save expense and cost; a recommendation for a sweeping reorganisation of the Circuit Court and the District Court; a recommendation, again to save expense, an extension of on-the-spot fines where no moral blame attaches; improvements in the machinery for the enforcement of monetary judgments, and desertion and maintenance.  I must admit that recommendation was not made sufficiently long ago for anything to be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> In addition to that, there was the consumer protection law paper, the National Prices Commission: we had the National Consumer Advisory Council report; and the Kennedy report.  I accept that there were certain contentious matters involved which may finally involve a decision for or against by the Minister in charge.  However, these decisions do not appear to be made or if made were not published.  I am saying all that with a view to asking ourselves why it is so.  Why has our record been so poor?  How can we be hopeful that that may be changed, as I hope it will be, and suggest reasons for it?</P>
    <P>Incidentally, if one is a member of a commission that sits for ten years and really works on it, it is very distressing and most chilling for one's energies and hope for doing any good if you see no action on your recommendations. If you are in Bleak House operating the bankruptcy law, knowing the whole thing is antiquated, archaic and absurd, and inappropriate to achieving justice, the very administrators of justice themselves must feel: &ldquo;What are we doing this for?&rdquo; They must lose heart in the process.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest to the Seanad that there are some good reasons for this being the situation. This Bill may&mdash;hopefully&mdash;solve the problem.  It should be said that we have had good Ministers for Justice during this period.  They were not all good Ministers for Justice, but some were good and we have a good one now.  During a large period of the time of this State, the Minister for Justice has been performing the duties of another Minister primarily, that is, he has been a Minister for the Interior.  He has been wholly engrossed with the security problems of this State.  He has been involved in day-to-day contests with the people who have questioned the legitimacy of the State, who feel entitled to take up arms to overthrow it.  That is one reason there has been such slow progress. The Minister's and the Department's orientation in the direction of the maintenance of order has distracted attention from the law reform aspect of the Department's duties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> Another reason is a weakness which is general in the administration of our affairs.  It is this: the bad is certainly the enemy of the good, but not nearly as effective an enemy as the best.  For example, the report on bankruptcy could presumably have been laid before the House shortly after it was read.  This was not done because, as everyone is aware, there is a harmonisation of this law going on in the EEC and we want to end up with a code which is exactly right.  Meanwhile we continue to tolerate wrongs that could be cured, while we wait for the best to happen.  That is a mistake. Part of the blame should be taken by lawyers as such, who are prepared to tolerate, without expressing sufficient concern, defects that they are perfectly well aware exist, and there has been insufficient lobbying on their part to change the law.  Not merely do I wish to see the law being reformed, but lawyers also.</P>
    <P>I like particularly the reference of the Attorney General to the idea that this commission will not merely be looking to the disciplines of law but to other disciplines&mdash;sociologists, psychologists and economists.  Of course, the law and economics and sociology were once very close together.  Their separation is bad, not merely for the lawyers, but for the solution of social problems.</P>
    <P>In my own profession we are affected by the fact that traditionally we are the rich man's man of business. He is too damn bored to look after all that stuff, so he hires a character such as myself to take it all over from him.  Our concern about the minutiae of the wealth tax is real. Our ability to detect flaws and injustices in it is considerable, and our desire to change it is very real.</P>
    <P>Our interest in that is more immediate. Whatever might be our concern for a woman who got cut in her pension because she had a few hens in her backyard, we do not naturally give the same attention to social welfare legislation as we give to capital taxation.  That has tended to reduce our social concern as a profession. We have insufficiently made the public aware of the injustice done through <Col N="222" /> bad laws not having been changed. We take part of the blame.</P>
    <P>I was glad to note the tone in which the Attorney General ended his submission or his address.  People can learn from lawyers who concern themselves about these things.  The general idea is that the only welfare that is worth agitating for is welfare obtained from the central Government through a distributive system of taxation, whether of income or capital; but law reform is of course part of social reform and injustices between people are very real.  If injury is done, if the innocent suffer and the guilty go unrebuked, somebody ends up with something in pocket that he ought not to have.  If through our national concern about improving court procedure and practice, court costs became too high, who pays for that?  Is it the people who can afford to go and get it or the people who do not try to obtain it because they cannot afford it because of the enormous cost and are deprived of proper free legal aid?</P>
    <P>Many people could relate their experiences in this field.  People may promise to do something and, when they fail to do it, say &ldquo;I did not put it in writing, I cannot be sued&rdquo;.  In general, that is not true but there are cases where it is, unfortunately, true because of a statute enacted in the seventeenth century, in 1689, in Ireland, the Irish Statute of Fraud which someone has said is an instrument responsible for more fraud than any other like statute.  Similar legislation has been abolished in Britain since 1954&mdash;21 years ago.  Why have we waited 21 years to do something similar?  Why was there not provision regarding contracts that take more than a year to perform.  That is one you cannot escape by merely saying you did not put it in writing.  People should not be able to avoid their responsibilities by saying there was nothing in writing.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, the question of recovering interest on late payment of debts.  That derives from a law that was enacted in 1833 and it means that there are people who owe others money who delay improperly in paying their <Col N="223" /> debts, and for whom it is cheaper, having regard to interest rates at present, to pay law costs of defending the proceedings than to pay interest on the money owed.  The person who is being deprived of his money may be the weak one.  It is very often the position that the plaintiff who is looking for recovery of his money can ill-afford its loss.  It must not be assumed that the boot is on the other foot.  Even in the Middle East, where usury is regarded as being religiously wrong, you can get a proper interest return if you have a commercial contract.  If you sue a man in Teheran you find they have a more up-to-date code than we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>In regard to limitation of actions, there is the case where a person does not know he is injured until the period has expired.  There should be provision for relief in such cases.  On one occasion my daughter had just left a room when the ceiling fell in on the place where she had just been sitting. On investigation we found that the builder, about 12 years previously, had erected the ceiling with one inch lath instead of two inch lath.  There was no legal right of recovery against him. There is no doubt about that because I did consider it.</P>
    <P>Again, take the case of the sale of consumer durables, where there are guarantees.  It should be an offence to use the word &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; in respect of what one gets because the manufacturers are giving them so as to exclude the liability they would be under if no guarantee were given.  Why do we tolerate this?  This ought to be a matter for social concern and social injustice results from our failure to do anything to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>In relation to proceedings, is the adversary procedure right in all cases? Is it appropriate for family cases?  Do we need a special procedure for small claims which would reduce expense? Do we need a system where assessors could be brought in to help a judge to understand matters of which he has very little knowledge?  Do we need changes in our labour law in regard to dismissals?  In due course all these different fields should be covered by <Col N="224" /> changes in the law.  This would bring about great benefits in the relief of social tension and would let people know that our law courts were busy about securing justice for them, in protecting their rights.</P>
    <P>The law would be more clearly enforceable if it were more obviously acceptable and if people felt more clearly that they were getting justice through its provisions.  If the lawyers who work on this commission consult with their colleagues in other fields I have mentioned, there could be enrichment for all.  It is a great mistake for disciples to stand apart.  The legal training is a good one and social workers would be greatly strengthened in assisting clients to establish their rights and cope with their problems if they also had legal training.  In so far as they make lawyers more aware of social problems, these provisions will be good for them.</P>
    <P>This Bill is worthwhile because it shows a frank recognition that under the existing system we have been unable to get law reform despite all the good work done by people in giving advice, because of the engrossment of the officers of the Department of Justice and the Minister with all his problems.  Now we have got an effective transference of function with regard to law reform to an office which has been relieved of their burden to enable them to take on this additional duty.  That is an encouraging thing and affords reasonable hope for the future. There is also a structure in the Bill itself with regard to programming and reports to the Houses of the Oireachtas which will enable us to have full discussion on several matters.  Among those interested in social welfare and social reform, I hope to see an increase in awareness of the importance of law reform.  For that reason I certainly welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which undoubtedly one must welcome in that it expedites in practical terms the administration of law reform.  If that is achieved, certainly it is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had reports over a number of years, some of which I was associated with as Minister for Justice. <Col N="225" /> I refer in particular to the Criminal Procedure Bill based on one of the earlier reports of the committee appointed to recommend reform of the law, which abolished the old-fashioned deposition system in criminal proceeding.  There is a number of such reports in the archives of the Department of Justice and I take it they will be transferred to the new institution to be established under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there is a specific institution now being established to do this because what has been happening heretofore is that what one might charitably call an administrative blockage has been occurring between the Department of Justice and the Attorney General's office so that excellent reports on which people have given excellent service over many years were rarely implemented.  I would like to see expedition under this Bill when it becomes law because we do not want a new commission going back over the old course again.  There is a number of excellent recommendations under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Brian Walsh, chairman of the committee, that can be implemented almost forthwith provided the administrative procedure is established to do the job.</P>
    <P>I could talk for three hours, as could Senator Alexis FitzGerald, and some of my colleagues on the various areas of reform.  We have positive reports on the desk that need to be implemented and can be incorporated into legislation.  All we want is to set up the machinery now.  I would appeal to the Attorney General now that he has taken responsibility for this particular area, and if this commission are going to be established to ensure that this legislation will not be just another delaying bureaucratic exercise.</P>
    <P>The merit I see in the Bill is that an institution will be established that will get work done.  We do not want an institution to be established to investigate the law reforms that are necessary.  The law reforms that are necessary are adumbrated already in a number of reports which the Attorney General has to hand. Further law reforms are obviously <Col N="226" /> necessary but they are immeasurable because we have been so slack in this respect both in Britain and Ireland. Without going into any outline of the details of the reforms that are necessary in the law reform area my only strong appeal to the Attorney General is that in the establishment of this commission it will not be manned or staffed by people who bring it on themselves to go into a further reinvestigation of law reform that has been taking place over the past 15 years.  The reforms are so obvious and patent that any commission worth its salt can bring in recommendations to the Attorney General very quickly.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Bill which meets the point I am making is the provision in subparagraph (c), subsection (3) of section 4 for draft Bills to be submitted by the commission.  It states:</P>
    <P>prepare, or cause to be prepared, and include in its proposals for law reform, draft Bills.</P>
    <P>I welcome this very much because it puts the matter on the Attorney General's table.  They can, if they wish, include in their proposals actual, specific Bills.  That cuts through many bureaucratic processes and it means that the commission, if properly composed, can say to the Attorney General: &ldquo;We believe this is how it should be done but in addition to that, we have considered the matter in detail and here is our proposed Bill in draft form.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I welcome that from the point of view of expedition because everybody knows so well what needs to be done in so many areas that this commission does not have to embark on any great area of research initially.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to make is that the committee recommendations are there gathered over the whole area from bankruptcy law to criminal law. The areas have been defined; the recommendations are there and any group of competent lawyers can discuss the matter over an hour and recommend what should be done.  It is simply a matter of doing it and this is where the real crunch comes and this is why I <Col N="227" /> welcome the Bill.  It is an attempt to establish or institutionalise an office which would be properly staffed with a full secretariat to get on with the job. There is no reason why law reform proposals should not emerge from this commission implementing all the reports that are already on hand over the next 12 months.  Everything is there except the simple matter of execution.</P>
    <P>That is the pragmatic side of it.  I welcome the Bill generally as an ongoing Bill that will be there to deal with further social and legal reforms as they arise in the years ahead.  I hope &mdash;and I would like to hear the Attorney General's view on this&mdash;that the Bill will not enable the commission when established to go into yet another delaying investigation process but that they will proceed in a practical manner to adopt reforms that are so obvious, have been recommended and are there for all to see.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to extend a very warm welcome to the Bill.  Indeed, I cannot think of any Bill to which I would extend a warmer welcome than one which would, at this point in time, establish a serious commission on law reform.  We must fault ourselves as a nation for not having appreciated the very significant social function which law has and the necessity for a constant monitoring of our laws in the broad sense of both statute and judge-made law, substantive and procedural law.  I am glad that Senator FitzGerald broadened the scope of his contribution by analysing in some detail our attitude towards law and legal research.  He was right to place some of the blame on lawyers and I would go even further than he went and put much of the blame on the universities and law schools for not having had sufficient consciousness of the importance of law reform and not having initiated and sponsored research in the absence of a Government-established commission of this kind.  The sad thing is that, although we inherited a Common Law system subject to our Constitution, we did not inherit the noticeable zeal for law reform of the British jurisdiction.  We did not inherit their capacity to establish various types <Col N="228" /> of committees at a high level, such as the law reform commissions, the criminal law reform committee and the private international law committee which have monitored the law in that jurisdiction and which have brought in a considerable number of reports.</P>
      <P>It might be useful to refer in passing to the existence of a comprehensive analysis of law reform in general in Britain including the work of the law commissions which were established under the 1965 Act.  This work, which came out last year is <i>Law Reform and the Law Commission</i> by J.H. Farrar. It contains a series of appendices at the end which show just how many reports were brought out by the various law reform committees including the law commissions and the degree of implementation of their reports.</P>
      <P>I should like to reinforce very strongly what Senator Fitzgerald said about the very bad record of implementation of the recommendations of our own Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  Perhaps we should ask ourselves why the reports of this Irish committee, including the many important recommendations for reform contained in them have not been implemented.  If one looks at this record one must contrast it with the record of the Law Reform Commission in England which has a remarkable record of success in having its reports implemented into specific legislation. I think the reasons behind this contrast provide the justification for establishing a Law Reform Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The complexity of modern life and the complexity of legislation, together with the necessity to monitor judge-made law in order to ensure that defects or anomalies do not go undetected, require the establishment of a permanent commission with sufficient staff, with a central role, and with a very direct relationship with the Attorney General and with the Government if they are to bring in a series of recommendations for reform, which will gain political acceptance in such a way as to be implemented into legislation very quickly.  Therefore I would also like to support the provision in the Bill requiring the <Col N="229" /> Law Reform Commission to draw up programmes of law reform in particular areas, because I think this will be a very useful framework in which to consider the reform of the law and it will allow outsiders not involved with the Law Reform Commission to express views and make recommendations. I am thinking of universities, not just the law schools but also the other disciplines; interested individuals or groups; the professional bodies; the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council who should be encouraged to address themselves to a programme of law reform and to have detailed comments and observations on that programme.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong not to place very strong emphasis on the social function of law.  The Attorney General in introducing the Bill to the House left this aspect to the end of his speech.  I would have liked a speech of similar length developing what he was saying in the final paragraphs about the importance of law and its significant social function, in reinforcing attitudes and in preventing opinion changing especially in areas of family law.</P>
    <P>I think we saw a good example of this in the Seanad earlier this year when debating our present law in Ireland in relation to the illegitimate child.  The concept of illegitimacy is reinforced by the law which we have allowed to remain on our statute books without any regard or concern for its reform. This could be significant in preventing the evolution of a genuine reform of attitudes in the community in Ireland. There are many other examples illustrating that because we have allowed Victorian statutes to govern the particular area the law does not reflect modern developments and thinking and is alien and static in its response to the needs and the values of the people.  The law is in danger therefore of being regarded as irrelevant or obstructive rather than something which can have an enormously creative element which can lead and stimulate changes which respond to the changing attitudes of a particular society.</P>
    <P>This point is made very well indeed by Lord Scarman in his Hamlyn <Col N="230" /> lectures which have been published as <i>English Law, The New Dimension,</i> where he analyses the way in which the whole social welfare code has developed, and that it has evolved away from the field of operation of lawyers. As a result most lawyers now know nothing whatsoever about social welfare and are not interested.  It has become a technical area of administration which is not of concern to them.  I would agree with Lord Scarman's plea for a re-analysis of the position and for an attempt by lawyers to evolve their own discipline and to be interested in broader areas than just what is now construed as lawyers' law, the criminal law or the law of property in a narrow sense.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the practitioners&mdash;the barristers and solicitors&mdash;and the academic lawyers have allowed the field of law itself and the scope of what they consider to be lawyers' law to become very narrow, rather rigid and unresponsive to modern developments. For example, this is evident in the approach to legal education, which I think is a very key part of this.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the extent to which the law of property is still primarily concerned with the personal occupier of property and the trespasser upon his property and so on and is not in fact related to urban legal studies or even planning and the social implication of law.  It is a very narrow focus.  This reflects a tradition that we have inherited from another jurisdiction, which we have done very little to assess and to examine as to whether we have cast the whole discipline of law much too narrowly and whether it would be possible for law to play a much more creative and stimulating role in achieving social reform.</P>
    <P>I should like before looking in more detail at the proposals in this Bill to ask what is almost a rhetorical question, how far one can seriously consider law reform here without having inevitably the problem of the barrier &mdash;I use the word deliberately&mdash;of certain provisions of the Constitution.  I would now like to ask the real question of the Attorney General if he would indicate in his reply whether the reform of the Constitution, or certain aspects of it are within the terms of <Col N="231" /> reference of the Law Commission? They could deal with many areas&mdash; trade union law, collective bargaining and be unable to introduce reform because of the problem posed by the wording of the Constitution itself.  The Law Reform Commission will only go a very small distance indeed in these areas if it cannot recommend amendments of the Constitution.  Another field would be the area of education. It would be very welcome if the Law Commission were not debarred from considering reform of either the Constitution itself or certain specific Articles of the Constitution.  I would place a high priority, particularly in the area of family law, on the necessity to reform the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It might be useful to look at the way in which the English Law Commission, established under the 1965 Act, approached their task because in many ways their terms of reference were similar to the terms of reference proposed in this Bill.  If I might just quote briefly from the book I mentioned; <i>Law Reform and the Law Commission,</i> by J.H. Farrar.  He says on page 72:</P>
    <P>The statement of the basic general values of the English Law Commission is contained in the First Programme.</P>
    <P>They felt that the law should be simpler, more widely accessible, more easily understandable and more certain than it was.  Statistics should be interpreted with common sense.  A proper balance should be struck between the rule of law and the administrative technique of a highly developed industrial society. The legal system should be brought into harmony with the social and economic requirements of a modern state.  In particular, the operation of the legal system should be adjusted to changes in prices, wages and relevant factors affecting the cost of living.  Lastly, the legal system should be capable of making a rapid remedial response to defects exposed by judicial comment and other informed criticism.</P>
    <P>Then Mr. Farrar points out that these values and the approach of the Law <Col N="232" /> Commission to its task were, in fact, very consumer orientated&mdash;orientated to the consumers of law in a sense and also to the practitioners in the field.  He would have welcomed a more radical and fundamental approach and analysis.  We face a different situation in a sense in this country, because we have not had the updating, recasting and codification of as many of the old British statutes which have long since been repealed or amended in Britain.</P>
    <P>I agree with the point made by Senator Lenihan that the Law Commission could even approach its task at two levels.  One level could be the level for the homework that was either being done or does not need to be done because the point is so obvious.  For example, it must be obvious beyond belief that the criminal age of responsibility of a child of seven is not acceptable. Perhaps that is rather a bad example because it is in a complex area of family law which may require further study.  But, in my view, we could find several examples in the criminal law.  There is the anomalous distinction here between felonies and misdemeanours.  The Larceny Act 1916 has been very well analysed and proved to be quite defective and there is even a problem in extraditing between the two jurisdictions because of the lack of equivalence of the offences involving fraud and dishonesty.  These are areas in which the Law Commission could act quickly and could bring in miscellaneous Law Reform Bills or Bills relating to particular subject matters.</P>
    <P>Another area that is badly in need of reform is the jury system&mdash;the establishment of the jury system under the 1927 Act.  There are many examples of this sort.  I am glad to see, both explicitly and implicitly, in the thinking of the Attorney General introducing this Bill that he is envisaging that the Law Commission will look at social areas, such as family law.  Here I should like to ask him if the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure will continue to have, as part of its terms of reference, the study of family law?  The terms of reference of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure were broadened not so long ago <Col N="233" /> to include the study of and recommendations on family law.  Although I share Senator FitzGerald's respect for that body&mdash;and it has been a very hard-working, very unselfish and unpaid committee&mdash;I do not think its composition, its original terms of reference or its structure make it a suitable body for the study of family law.</P>
    <P>It would be much better to remove family law from the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure and to place family law, including the procedural aspects about a concept of a family tribunal, securely in the lap of the Commissioners on Law Reform. Those who have been agitating for so long about reform of family law&mdash;I am thinking of voluntary organisations such as CARE, AIM, ALLY and all the other organisations who are impatient with the lack of progress in the field of family law&mdash; may feel that to hand it over now to the Law Reform Commission, when established, will mean a delay of another six months, a year or two years.  For this reason the question of priorities will be very important and to what extent the Attorney General will influence this choice of priorities. If family law is to come squarely within its terms of reference the Law Reform Commission must of necessity make it the top priority, because this is the area in a real sense in which we most need law reform.</P>
    <P>Another aspect receiving scrutiny at the moment, but which is singularly unsatisfactory, is the area of legal aid.  I am aware that the Pringle Committee is sitting and is to bring in recommendations on civil legal aid. But, as I know, and other Senators will agree, since we discussed this on the adjournment of the House a very short time ago, the situation relating to criminal legal aid is deplorable. One branch of the legal profession, the solicitors, have opted out of the scheme since last December.  The other branch, the barristers, are to consider doing likewise tomorrow.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the emphasis is not, as it has been over the past few years, primarily on remuneration for the job.  It stems from a complete frustration with the terms of the 1962 <Col N="234" /> Act and a desire for a radical overhaul of the system of criminal legal aid.  Once again, is this something which could be a priority of the Law Reform Commission?  If they were to undertake it, would that in itself necessitate the sort of delay which would not be tolerable in the circumstances? This is a very key point&mdash;how quickly the Law Commission will be able to get into a working pattern and how quickly it will be able to approach the very general areas, the fairly systematic codification and improvement in the lawyer's law in the narrow sense, where either anomalies have arisen or the law is quite obviously and demonstrably out of date.</P>
    <P>We have the very useful reference point of reforms in another jurisdiction, or perhaps several other jurisdictions, with the advantage of having seen how the changes in legislation work out.  It is of enormous assistance to be able to look at precedents in other countries and see how the reforms worked in practice.</P>
    <P>There is also very urgent need for reform in areas where agreement on the nature of the reform is not quite so automatic and about which there needs to be considerable thought.  In a sense we need two law reform commissions&mdash;one in this second area where the changes in the law will have very considerable social implications.</P>
    <P>I should like to express support for the view that membership of the Law Reform Commission should not be confined exclusively to lawyers or people with legal training.  The Attorney General in his introductory speech made it clear that he appeared to have an open mind and certainly to be aware of the two schools of thought and of the fact that the Law Commission in Britain is confined to people with legal training.</P>
    <P>The present development, thinking and analysis is attempting to broaden our concept of the role and function of law, to get away from a narrow approach to it and be aware of the essential contribution of other disciplines and the essential comment and contribution which they have to make on law reform.  I welcome the fact <Col N="235" /> that the Law Reform Commission might have from the beginning a non-lawyer, somebody from another appropriate discipline such as social science, as a member of the Law Commission.</P>
    <P>It would be a great mistake to talk about the membership of the Law Commission in a half-hearted or mean way.  One of the mysteries of this Bill is what will be the end-product.  If it is a part-time Law Reform Commission with a small staff and with people who have other serious commitments, it will not take much of an impact and will become like the Committee on Court Practice Procedure, whether it likes it or not.  It is therefore essential to emphasise that the members of this Law Reform Commission, at least for the first five years, when it can make an impact, should be fulltime people and have sufficient backup services, staff and moneys to go outside for part-time expertise in particular areas.</P>
    <P>For once do not let us be mean or petty in setting up this commission. Let us give it a full mandate and put all the resources of what is, I admit, a small country which has to be careful how it deploys its resources at its disposal.  Let us be generous in this matter if we really want to get full benefit from the impact of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>I would welcome some clarification on the precise relationship which the Law Commissioners will have with the Attorney General's Office and also with the Department of Justice. The Bill quite rightly places emphasis on the independence of the Law Commission.  Yet I can see in some sense that the commission must respond and shape its priorities in the light of what is considered to be the areas which most crucially and imperatively need law reform.  I would welcome details in his reply by the Attorney General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <P>There is nothing like introducing a thorny nettle, rather than looking specifically at <Col N="236" /> various provisions of the Bill that are more appropriately examined on Committee Stage.  It would be interesting at that stage to examine in more detail the precise functions of the commission and the way in which it is enabled to set about its task.</P>
      <P>That is all I want to say on this Bill.  I welcome the Attorney General on his first visit to this House, and, as far as I am concerned, he could not have brought in a more desired package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Senator Robinson in welcoming the Attorney General to the Seanad. I also welcome the introduction of the Bill.  There are a few points I should like to make.  I am very glad he has decided that, in the process of examining the priorities for law reform and the pattern which that law reform should take, he has decided there is a need to broaden the approach to a new and more up-to-date understanding of the whole question of criminality in particular and of the origins of criminal acts in society&mdash; the psycho-dynamics of criminality in human beings.  This would entail a commission which would have, as he mentions, five people, one of whom would probably be a social scientist. I welcome that.  I wonder to what extent the social scientist, no matter how talented or knowledgable he may be, will be able to survive the four-to-one loading against him in any such commission when he attempts to bring in reforms in the laws in Ireland.  It is again one's sad duty to have to comment that since the new State was set up even in relation to law reform very little original contribution has been made by successive Governments of all parties to initiate laws of which one might feel proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may not be possible for the Attorney General to tell us but it would be of interest to know what he would consider to be his priorities were he to tell this commission his priorities for examination in relation to the law and criminality generally.  One of the problems which have puzled me over the years, when discussing the Department of Justice Estimate, was how it <Col N="237" /> happened that successive generations of legislators, most of whom spent some time in prisons and jails, appear to have learned so little about what should happen to somebody who is put in prison or confined to jail under our laws.  There does not appear to have been any attempt made by any of those who happened to have the power, or eventually were given the power in any party, to use their experience of the horrible life of the prisoner or the person isolated from society&mdash;to give the public some idea of the humiliation, the degradation, the suffering, the sense of isolation and the whole undermining of self-respect implicit in our penal system, including our prisons. How is it that none of them has made any attempt to humanise the prison system, the court system, the legal system generally or the penalties extracted for what are called crimes in our society?</P>
    <P>The general overall determinant in the way in which we deal with people considered to be criminals is nearly universally a punitive one.  It is based on the assumption that the person is a bad person and that he must be isolated from society and that this in some way will make him better.  Of course the general experience is that it does not make persons better.  It makes them worse&mdash;it simply reinforces any character defects they have and makes sure that recidivism is nearly an inevitable consequence of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether it will be possible for the commission so to slant their recommendations in relation to law reform that they will try to introduce an element of understanding of the origins of abberant behaviour by human beings in society&mdash;that this does not stem from the fact that they are the bad people and that we are the good people.  It nearly inevitably stems from the fact that because of social pressures, environmental pressures, family stress of one kind or another&mdash;broken homes, drunken homes, institutional life, lack of love and the various pressures which go to create the product&mdash;the disturbed personality becomes the criminal.</P>
    <P>The main point is, of course, that <Col N="238" /> he is the innocent end product of the kind of society in which he grew up&mdash; the too large family, the family where there was not enough wealth, where the father was out of work, where there was drunkenness, overcrowding of the home and so on, where frequently the parents had little or no responsibility. It was not their fault, the lower income group, but because of that they suffered and because of that their children suffered.  Least of all, the most innocent persons of all, is this end product who end up in our courts, humiliated and degraded and sent off to our prisons with lectures from members of the Judiciary as to how they should behave themselves, treated in such a way as to end up being demoralised.  They feel that the easiest thing for them to do is to continue to be angry with this society that had the lack of concern to make them like this in the first instance and then treat them with such a lack of compassion and understanding in the second.</P>
    <P>That is a particularly important general principle which I hope the commission will try to import into the recommendations which they give to the Attorney General and to the Government of the day, which will try to change altogether the general pattern of the indictment in court and then the general pathway towards inevitable punishment, the contempt and the anger that we have for the psychopath who of course has become like that because of the way in which he was treated.  Instead of understanding his problem we punish him for it and make him worse.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the implementation of the law or the use of the courts or the activities of the courts has now become very diversified with the introduction of social workers, psychologists, probation officers, psychiatrists and so on. Therefore it would appear to me that the commission could usefully be rather more diversified than is proposed by the Attorney General.  The commission seem to be greatly overloaded on the side of the law.  Whatever about any of the other professions in our society&mdash;none of them has <Col N="239" /> a particularly brilliant social enlightenment&mdash;I would be inclined to put the legal profession pretty low in the list of those with advanced or radical or even forward looking views on these matters.  Have they begun at all serously to understand the idea that the person before them is a victim of society and should be treated like that rather than somebody who must be sent away and punished?</P>
    <P>I would be interested to know whether the Attorney General thinks there is anything that can be done or whether he thinks it will be one of their problems, that is, the question of the assessment of the present position in relation to the McNaughton rules, the question of criminal responsibility. I know that it is a very old question, it is one that is being debated in every country in the world &mdash;the implications of it, anyway. Criminal responsibility is being debated in all the law courts in the civilised world.  So far there does not seem to be any satisfactory outcome of it.  There have been advances made from the original McNaughton rule about the responsibility of the individual once the crime has been proved to have been committed by him.</P>
    <P>Certain advances have been made from that time, but now we know that human motivation is a very complicated thing indeed between the psychological pressures, social pressures and the pressures of unconscious drives of one kind or another, and the uncontrollable impulse.  I fully appreciate that it is a very dangerous quicksand for anybody to get involved in, to try to come up with a solution to the problem of the culpability of the individual or the responsibility of the individual in any particular crime.  At the same time, I feel it is about time that many of the extremely talented people whom the Attorney General will have at his disposal came to some kind of decision on this particular issue to try to get it away from the very uneven kinds of judgment which are given under the McNaughton rules.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points that I should like to suggest that the <Col N="240" /> Attorney General might care to put to the Law Reform Commission.  One of them is&mdash;I am sure it will be dealt with under the Mental Treatment Acts&mdash;the fact that the criminality of the attempted suicide is obviously absurd, but it is an interesting reflection on the kind of thinking that went on at one time in our society and that is in my time.  In my experience I have had reason to get people away from the courts by certification rather than permitting them to go through the outrageous performance of being arraigned for having attempted suicide. That does not happen any more, I know, but it is an interesting reflection of the extraordinarily inhuman kind of thinking that was associated with our laws in relatively recent times.  That now appears to be clear to most people and I would imagine accepted by most people.</P>
    <P>I would then go on to try to suggest that there are other attitudes, affecting minorities admittedly, in relation to a number of our laws which I am quite certain in ten, 15 or 20 years will be looked back on as archaic and unthinkable and inhuman. That was our attitude, and still is according to statute, in relation to the unfortunate suicides.  What happens now is that everybody does what he can to help them and to deal with the problem that makes them get to that stage of depression which makes them wish to end their lives.</P>
    <P>There are other attitudes in our laws which are just as intransigent and inhuman, and just as unthinking. One of them is in relation to the homosexuality question.  I wonder if the Attorney General will ask that consideration be given to this.  Homosexuality is simply a kind of sexuality completely normal for the homosexual. There is nothing abnormal in being homosexual if you happen to be born that way or become a homosexual. It is no more credit to me to be a heterosexual or no more wrong for me to be a heterosexual than it is for the homosexual to be a homosexual. Unfortunately it is not looked on in that way and it is still a crime in our society.</P>
    <P>The odd thing is that no attempt <Col N="241" /> has been made to deal with this matter in a very long time.  As far as I know our statute goes back to 1885.  I know that attitudes can be taken up in regard to this question and I do not object to that at all&mdash;both for and against the idea of homosexuality&mdash; but it is absurd, like suicide or illegitimacy or any of these problems which we choose to pretend do not exist here, to pretend that there is no such thing as a homosexual problem in Ireland.  Of course there is.  There is no sense whatever in ignoring the fact that it is the cause of an enormous amount of great distress for many people.</P>
    <P>In psychiatric practice I find it to be a very common presenting problem by people, presenting in different ways in the form of depression and alcoholism, people who are simply misfits in life and drop out in all sorts of ways.  But they all conceal this kind of homosexuality of one kind or another&mdash;the appalling sense that they are outcasts and not wanted in society, which they are not, and the whole Irish society is very unkind to them and very unchristian if I might use that much abused word.  Because of that, suicide is another very common sequel to the unfortunate homo-sexual's attempt to live with this disability, which should not be a disability. It is not a disability.  It is perfectly normal, but in our society it is a very crippling disability.</P>
    <P>Therefore I would ask the Attorney General that we do something about at least having a debate on this subject and let people decide for and against as they did in relation to contraception. We can keep on working to change, but the law as it is at the moment is in psychological and psychiatric terms outrageous&mdash;the fact that a person can go to gaol simply for being a homosexual.  This leads to various pathetic devices being adopted by these people in order to avoid the consequences in our society of being discovered to be homosexual.  The only reference I can find is in the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935 where there is a reference to public indecency, offending modesty and so on. I think that is the circumstance in which they can be charged.  What happens <Col N="242" /> mostly is that they are encouraged to get out of the country, like pregnancy in the old days&mdash;the young ladies who were pregnant, had their babies in England, or as they are now being encouraged to get out of the country in relation to therepeutic legal abortion.  The 1935 Act dealt with rape, brothels, indecent assault, prostitution and contraception but it did not deal with the problem of homosexuality.</P>
    <P>I know that the Attorney General happens to be a very enlightened person.  In all his expressions in the past he has shown himself to be an enlightened person and not afraid of taking an independent stand if he is really convinced on a particular issue, and I would ask him that he do what he can to try to see that this matter is dealt with as it should be dealt with by a Government rather than being introduced by an individual like myself or some other Senator.  This is the responsibility of a society and a great hardship is being imposed on a minority.  I know it is a minority, but they all have rights in our society, rights to be cared for and cherished equally.  At present the law is very much slanted against them.  The time will come when we will look back on our laws in relation to homosexuality in the same amazement as we are now looking back on our attitude to censorship or suicide.</P>
    <P>The other question I know is premature and over the years I have been involved in introducing subjects which after a time become more acceptable and for that reason I felt it was wise to at least start things going.  That is the law relating to therapeutic legal abortion.  There is no doubt that again this is a minority problem but it is a real problem.  The figure is an increasing one, 2,000 I think was the last one.  I read of young Irish girls going to England for therapeutic legal abortion. I have spoken about this subject before and I do not intend to deal with it at any length.  My motivation is primarily the undesirability of the unwanted child being born into society.  Because of my association with young people, psychopaths in particular, most of the people that I <Col N="243" /> have dealt with in pursuit of my practice&mdash;the unwanted individual, the unwanted child&mdash;are people with a very bad prospect of happiness in society.</P>
    <P>The other side concerns the right of the woman if she decides she does not wish to have the child, the right to exercise that wish.  One is dealing with a process which has the phrase &ldquo;therapeutic legal abortion&rdquo;.  This is where the law of the land, in this case Britain, has agreed that in certain cases it is a therapeutic act to carry out an abortion on a particular individual. There is involved in that the decision of the law officers of the State, of the elected representatives of the State, backed up by the opinion of reputable medical, psychiatric, gynaecological opinions, who having assessed the rights and wrongs of the particular question at any time have decided that in those circumstances this procedure should be permitted.</P>
    <P>Important yardsticks that will have to be invoked by the Law Reform Commission will be in the areas of homosexuality, therapeutic abortion and, of course, divorce.  I shall be interested to note what the belief of the Attorney General is if something is considered to be unconstitutional as it is in relation to divorce in our society.  Can the commission deal with that kind of question because it is considered to be forbidden under the Constitution?  Equally, in relation to our marriage laws, there is the question of the rights of the majority religion in mixed marriages.  Can these things be dealt with by the commission? Can they examine our marriage laws and can they establish the civil right in relation to all these questions &mdash;homosexuality, therapeutic legal abortion, contraception, divorce?</P>
    <P>One of the greatest impediments against the unity of our people is the idea that the civil law is the moral law.  We must decide as parliamentarians what we consider to be desirable civil laws for the ordering of our society.  The attitudes of the majority religions must be considered in assessing the desirability of introducing any new measure to amend the law. <Col N="244" /> In the final analysis, we must do what we believe to be correct in the interests of all our people.</P>
    <P>I should like the new Law Reform Commission to try to understand more the motivation in the whole question of criminality.  Certainly, people who are seriously disturbed must be isolated from society.  Those who do terrible things such as trying to kill or maim people or indulge in other anti-social acts must be dealt with and, in some cases, isolated from society, but they must be dealt with in a compassionate, understanding way, not in a punitive way.  At present our whole approach to the prison service is exorcising our own guilt feelings because all those who go to jail, whom we call criminals, are the products of our society.  They are products of our families and homes; they are products of our schools and colleges; they are products of our culture.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable how proud we can be of the achievements of many of our people in the professions or in trades or crafts or sports and so on but we get so angry with the non-conformists, those who let us down.  Remember they are still products of our society.  We like to boast of what a wonderful thing Irish family life is, what a wonderful thing our Constitution is, what our State laws are.  We become quite euphoric about our virtues and advantages but we should not at the same time, forget those whom we have failed.  We may have given them a bad start in life whether in education, in the family and in the home or in some other way.  They simply react by getting extremely angry with our society and protest in the only way they can, by refusing to conform.  We should examine ourselves and ask what did we do wrong which affected these people in this way, rather than punishing them.  The blame lies with us.</P>
    <P>Young people who may be involved under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1975, which we discussed this morning, are the products of our culture and of our society.  Yet, instead of understanding that all we do is to repress and to suppress.  As far as I know this is true of all our criminal law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="245" /> Reform is long overdue and I welcome the decision of the Attorney General to introduce this measure.  I wish him well in his efforts.  In the Library of Leinster House there is a beautiful bookcase full of commission reports about which very little has been done, so he must forgive us our scepticism on this occasion.  But, at the same time, we wish him well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="The Attorney General (Mr. Costello) Declan Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney General (Mr. Costello)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for the welcome they have given this legislation. There is considerable agreement in the House as to its desirability and there is also a considerable area of agreement as to how the commission will operate.  Therefore, in replying to the debate, I shall pick up points which have been made and comment briefly on them.  The general principles were widely accepted and it is on matters of detail that the debate has generally turned.</P>
      <P>I agree with the views expressed by Senator E. Ryan as to the desirability of consultation.  The point which he made is a valid one.  It is important that consultation takes place with practising lawyers as well as academic lawyers.  Both Senator Ryan and myself come from the practising side of the law and it is often said that a division of thought may exist between the practising and the academic lawyers. It would be a mistake to overestimate this.  Both sides of the profession have considerable expertise and knowledge from their own particular disciplines to give to the work that is to be undertaken by the commission. But I should like to stress&mdash; and it is something I may refer to in a moment when I have referred to what Senator Browne has said&mdash;I hope that consultation will take place not merely with lawyers, and that this is not a Bill which will involve the expertise merely of lawyers.  For example, in the case of the criminal code the views of psychiatrists and psychologists will be obtained and in the social field we will need the views of experts other than lawyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the criminal law the views of psychologists and psychiatrists would be obtained and in <Col N="246" /> the social field that the views of experts, other than lawyers&mdash;for example, social scientists and social workers&mdash;would also be obtained.</P>
    <P>The question of consolidation of statutes is an important aspect of the work which I hope the Commission will undertake and give advice on. As I indicated at the outset in my remarks on moving the Second Reading of this legislation, it is not a question of assisting lawyers and easing their burdens.  It is a question of making the law more easily accessible to the concerned and interested lay person. I would hope that the Commission would indicate the areas of law in which consolidation could take place. The points raised by Senator Ryan are interesting ones in relation to the procedures that have been adopted in Germany.  We have a great deal to learn from other jurisdictions, not merely our neighbouring jurisdiction. I would hope that the work of research and consultation that will go on will include research into such concepts as he has raised.</P>
    <P>There is one point in Senator Ryan's speech which I wish to clarify. He referred to the delays which have occurred in the past in relation to this area and to the fact that the Attorney General has had many responsibilities in the past and his staff have been taken up with them.  I would like to make the point clear that the Attorney General's role in law reform has been negligible.  The Attorney Generals in the past have had no role to play in determining what laws are to be reformed.  The role of the Attorney General's Office in the past has been merely in respect of legal advice on any matter that may arise in relation to any proposed legislation, and of course, also on the drafting side in relation to the Parliamentary Draftsman's Office.  The Attorney General's Office in the past has not had any responsibility in the area of law reform other than the technical ones to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I feel sure the commission will share Senator Ryan's view that it would be very inappropriate if they started off their work by getting bogged <Col N="247" /> down in details as to what work they were to undertake.  Experience elsewhere would indicate that this need not happen.  We are all agreed that the work the commission have to undertake is of immense dimensions and it will be a daunting task to decide priorities, but I would anticipate that the commission would undertake this task immediately and adopt a programme within a very short space of time, bearing in mind that they could start work immediately and then bring in subsequent programmes in the light of the experience they have gained.</P>
    <P>The delays which have occurred in the implementation of reports of past commissions have been referred to by Senator FitzGerald.  He drew attention to the fact that the excellent committee which have been sitting for a number of years have drawn up reports which have not been implemented. I think his analysis of the reason for the delays is an accurate one.  I would add a further reason for the delays and that is the lack of legal expertise available in the Department of Justice particularly and in other Departments and also in the Attorney General's Office.  In fact the public service has been understaffed in legal expertise and the result has been that the proposals which are made by commissions and which are then sent to the Government, or to Government Ministers in the first instance, do not have the expert advice available in Government Departments for their speedy consideration and subsequent implementation.</P>
    <P>The legal profession must carry a share of responsibility, as Senator FitzGerald has said.  However, while saying that and while saying that lawyers can be complacent in admitting this fact, lawyers can also be very frustrated from the undoubted injustices which they see and in respect of which they can do nothing.  It is true that submissions have been made from time to time by members of the legal profession for changes in the law and little has been done about them.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald drew up a very <Col N="248" /> short list of obvious areas in which reforms are urgently needed.  I think anybody in this House or on the street could do the same.  The task this commission will have is to try and see where to begin, the very onerous job of deciding where first to tackle the injustices in our laws and where first to give priorities, bearing in mind the limitations of personnel which, unfortunately, will exist.  He also drew attention&mdash;correctly, I believe&mdash;to the cross-fertilisation that can occur when people from different disciplines meet.  It is a valid criticism that in the past in relation to law reform there have not been enough experts from outside involved, but it is equally true to say that experts from other disciplines can benefit from the assistance, experience and knowledge which lawyers have gained particularly in the field of social sciences.</P>
    <P>For the reason which I outlined in my opening remarks the procedures adopted in the past have not, I believe, worked, and the new procedures will produce speedier results.  The role of the Attorney General in relation to this matter is one of consultation with the Law Reform Commission.  I know Senators will understand that the Attorney General will be in a position to assess from his knowledge of Government Departments what their needs are and pass on the benefit of his knowledge to the Law Reform Commission who will themselves be undertaking an examination of the areas requiring reform.  This will be a new procedure.  Instead of setting up <i>ad hoc</i> bodies from time to time whose reports, as Senators FitzGerald and Browne have said and as every Senator here knows, are in the Library downstairs gathering dust and are not being implemented, it is hoped that a standing committee with a professional research team available to it and with the collaboration of outside experts will be able to draw up reports more speedily with Bills annexed to them.  It will then be a matter for decision by the Government of the day to decide as a matter of policy whether the matters are to be introduced or not.  The experience in England has been that this procedure results in much speedier effect <Col N="249" /> being given to the Law Reform Commission's reports than our experience here has been with regard to <i>ad hoc</i> commissions.</P>
    <P>The point made by Senator Lenihan in relation to the delays was that an administrative blockage had occurred between the Attorney General's Office and the Department of Justice. I should like to clarify the position as far as I have been able to find out, because there has not been any blockage between the Attorney General's Office and the Department of Justice in matters of law reform.  Policy decisions have to be taken on, for example, the report of the Walsh Committee.  The reports are there.  It is a question of taking a policy decision whether they should be implemented or not.  That having been done, it is a question of going to the Government with the policy decision and when the policy decision is taken by the Government then the question is sent to the Parliamentary Draftsman's office.  The Attorney General is consulted on any legal problem that may arise.  It should be clarified that the role of the Attorney General in the past has not been one of any significance in the law reform processes. It is proposed that it will be different in the future.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Lenihan and Senator Robinson said that where the homework was already done the matters should be implemented.  The problem has been in the past that it is not a question merely of doing the homework, it is a question of getting decisions after the homework has been done.  These reports to which reference has been made are there, the homework has been done, and it is a question of having the staff and the resources for the Minister to arrive at a decision whether the recommendations should be implemented and then for the Government to approve or otherwise the advice given in relation to them.  It is true that the procedures in the past have not been conducive to speeding up the proceeds of law reform.</P>
    <P>I should like to have taken up more of the time of the Seanad on the point which I touched on briefly, and to <Col N="250" /> which Senator Robinson made reference, namely, the social aspect of law reform.  I did not do so because I did not wish to delay the Seanad at any great lengths and I felt it was a point that would be readily understood.  This is one of the reasons I would so strongly urge the implementation of this piece of legislation.  Law reform is not merely concerned with lawyers' law. Law reform is not a matter of concern to a small clitest group of professional people or of concern to a small group in society.  We are not talking about amendments of the law, for example, for increasing old age pensions or for improving grants under the Housing Acts.  These are areas in which the law can be reformed.  Law reform is a different concept.  It is a concept which is concerned with areas of the law which requires legal expertise to effect. The point that is not sufficiently understood&mdash;it is understood here but not outside&mdash;is that this concept of law reform is one which concerns social reform.</P>
    <P>As Senator Robinson has said, such things as family law, such very important human relationships as the relationship between husband and wife, the relationship of children to their parents, such very important social and economic relationships as the employeremployee relationship, because of the complexities of the laws all these require legal expertise for their improvement and amendment.  It is because this Law Reform Commission will be involved in areas like this that I am especially interested in seeing its early establishment.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson asked whether the Law Reform Commission would have jurisdiction in constitutional law matters.  Clearly they will have such jurisdiction.  The definition of reform and law in section 1 is wide enough to cover these matters.  The Government's responsibility in this area is the final one.  Whether or not the Constitution is amended is a matter first of all for Government decision and, secondly, for the Oireachtas to decide.  The Government cannot abdicate their responsibility.</P>
    <P>If the Government of the day were to decide that the Constitution should <Col N="251" /> be amended as a matter of policy, I could see the Law Reform Commission playing an important role in certain instances in advising how best this could be undertaken.  The point raised by Senator Robinson is, of course, an important one, namely, the relationship between the law reform programme that will be undertaken by the Commission and Government policy.  Ultimately, responsibility for introducing legislation and passing it in the Houses of the Oireachtas rests on the Government of the day and the Deputies and Senators who support the Government. Finally, whether or not the law is to be amended will be matters of policy for the Government.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, there are still undoubtedly many areas in which the policy content may be high but where, nonetheless, a report from the Law Commission would be of assistance.  I can give in this connection an example of what happened in one particular area of the law of torts in England where there was a suggestion that the Law Reform Commission should consider it.  The Government of the day decided that it was a matter of policy and they set up a special committee and did not use the Law Reform Commission for this purpose.  In another area, in an area of divorce procedure, the Law Reform Commission were given responsibility for it, and in fact produced two separate proposals as to how the law could be amended depending on a policy decision.  Our approach to this must be a flexible one, but I would hope to see the Law Reform Commission involved in the social area to a considerable extent.</P>
    <P>I do not think we need two Law Reform Commissions and I do not think Senator Robinson was literally suggesting that.  Senator Robinson's point is a valid one, that the work to be undertaken is very considerable and it can be undertaken on different levels&mdash;one level where it can be done quickly and the other level where more time is necessary.  In this connection I am sure the commission will draw on the experience in England where the English Law Commission <Col N="252" /> set out to codify a branch of the law and after some years found that it was physically impossible to do so.</P>
    <P>If the English Law Reform Commission with all their very great resources could not do it, our Law Reform Commission, which will obviously have less resources, will be alive to this.  They will, I am sure, try to strike a balance between what can be done speedily and what will require fairly lengthy research and make sure that their resources will not be taken up in an unbalanced way with research that is going to take a very considerable length of time.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specific point that Senator Robinson raised in relation to the present work of the Walsh Committee, this is going to be a matter for the Law Reform Commission in the first instance.  The Law Reform Commission will be able to examine the areas of law which are at present being studied.  Senators know that the Conroy Commission exists in relation to landlord and tenant matters. It may well be that the Law Reform Commission would indicate that the Conroy Commission should consider an aspect of landlord and tenant law rather than the Law Reform Commission. Similarly, the Law Reform Commission might well decide that their resources would be better employed in family law matters and might recommend that they rather than the Walsh Commission would undertake a particular aspect of that branch of the law.  In this connection I should say that there is a Statute Law Revision and Consolidation Office attached to the Attorney General's Office and the Law Reform Commission may well say that that office should undertake a particular aspect of consolidation rather than undertake it themselves.  This is as I would hope it would work.</P>
    <P>I do not think I would describe the relationship between the Attorney General's Office, the Department of Justice and the Commission as a nettle to be grasped.  I hope that common sense will prevail and that good relations will exist.  It will be a statutory duty on the Law Reform Commission <Col N="253" /> to review the law.  There will be a statutory duty on them to consult with the Attorney General.  The Department of Justice obviously will be concerned and will have views on areas of law with which they are primarily concerned to administer and so their views will be conveyed to the Law Reform Commission.  No doubt their views will be considered by the Government when the programme of the Law Reform Commission comes before the Government.</P>
    <P>I fully share the view that this process should not take a long time. I am hopeful it will not and that the Law Reform Commission will be able to set out their priorities fairly quickly, the views of Government Departments obtained on them and the Government decision taken quickly.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne is perfectly correct when he urges the necessity for the greater understanding that modern psychiatry and psychology can give to persons who are called criminals in our society.  I sincerely hope that in improving the criminal code the Law Reform Commission will obtain the benefit of the advice of psychologists and psychiatrists in this connection. The limitations in this legislation we are considering must be understood, because of course the whole area of penology and the whole area of the treatment of offenders is a vast one. I certainly hope that the emphasis on rehabilitation will be maintained all the time.  It must also be recognised that the law can play an important part in having a compassionate and, at the same time, a just approach to the law-breaker and in particular the question of the review of the McNaughton Rules is one which obviously is of very great importance. There is at the moment a committee sitting under the chairmanship of Judge Henchy who are reviewing the technical problem of the unfitness to plead rule, the guilty but insane concept and also the concept of reduced criminal responsibility.  It would be a matter for discussion, depending on how far Judge Henchy's Committee have considered the matter, whether the Law Reform Commission would <Col N="254" /> be seized of such matters.  I understand, however, that Judge Henchy's Committee have practically completed their work and their proposals would obviously be of very considerable interest to Senators as well as to the proposed Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>I know that Senators have ideas of priorities.  Some of them have been given today by Senator FitzGerald, Senator Robinson, Senator Browne and other Senators.  I am afraid I cannot accept the invitation to express my own views for the reason that I will have a statutory function to perform in this area and I will have to give advice both to the commission and the Government. Therefore I do not think I can make known in advance what my views are in this field.  Bearing in mind that limitation, I think I can express with propriety the view that I hope the commission will not be concerned merely with the minutiae of the law or with technical aspects of law but that they will be concerned with much wider issues and will work with the expedition for which we all wish.</P>
    <P>May I thank the Seanad for the welcome they have given to this piece of legislation.  It would be wrong for us to have too much faith that our society is going to be changed dramatically by this legislation overnight.  It is not merely a question of greater redistribution of wealth by means of the tax code.  It is not a question merely of increasing the social content of the capital budget.  It is not a question of allocating resources in some way or of economic planning.  All these things are involved in reforming Irish society, but also involved in it is the prospect and concept of law reform, and for this reason this could be an important piece of legislation on our Statute Book.</P>

I am not asking the Attorney General to leak any names, but I wonder whether he might be in a position to indicate to the House when the establishment day might be; for example, is it a matter of weeks or will there be much delay?

      <P>Very briefly on section 3, which deals with the establishment of the Law Reform Commission, I return to what I said earlier in relation to the practicalities of this issue. In my view the commission should be equipped with the proper secretariat and given a clear mandate.  There are already so many reports to hand over the whole range of civil and criminal law that I would ask the Attorney General to ask the commission as an immediate task to consider them. The Attorney General has referred to the immense dimensions of the job on hand, the very wide complications and the various social implications that are involved.  We are all aware of this and I share the views of Senators Browne and Robinson in this area but there are very practical remedial measures that are there on the table for practical recommendation.  All that has to be done is to get this commission going, get the secretariat established and in particular use the powers in section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would again make the point in regard to the commission that it be not just another commission as such, that it be a working body with <Col N="256" /> priorities that are already there in the form of practical recommendations. The commission should be got under way, as Senator Robinson suggested, within a matter of months and the Attorney General has agreed.  The Commission have enough on their plate already to produce sufficient legislation by way of practical improvements in civil and criminal law for the Attorney General to introduce in this House over the next 12 months.  We would welcome the introduction of such legislation in the Seanad.  These measures will be introduced here in the Seanad, where, I can assure the Attorney General as far as this side of the House is concerned, they will get total, sensible and rational consideration on their merits.  The reports and recommendations are there and the commission can get on with them straight away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point I share the Senator's view that this commission will have to be a working commission. I am sure they will be and that they will produce results.  I think that I should clarify what the position is in relation to reports that exist at present.  There is the Bankruptcy Report which Senator FitzGerald referred to and that has legislation annexed to it.  It took ten years to produce.  It reported in 1972.  What is the delay about that?  This cannot be sent to the Law Reform Commission. It is purely a question of a policy decision to be taken whether this is good legislation or not.  One could multiply the delays if the Bankruptcy Report had to be sent to the Law Reform Commission.  It is a question of a decision to be taken on whether or not proposals which have already been made are desirable or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Walsh Committee Report, what is important to note and for Senators to understand, is that these reports are in very minute areas of the law.  These are important reports and, as Senator FitzGerald pointed out, some of them involve the identification of considerable injustices and methods for remedying them.  It seems that delays here are not delays due to drafting but delays in taking decisions on the recommendations. <Col N="257" /> While I am sure the commission will consider any of these matters it could usefully be seized of it would be wrong to think that by setting up the commission we would get all the Walsh Committees reports to it and then we would have legislation. Decisions will have to be taken on principle in these matters.  I would anticipate that one of the results of setting up the commission might be to have decisions on these matters taken because it will mean that officials who have been working on other matters will be freed and will be able to give attention to these.</P>

      <P>Before referring to the specific queries that I have on this section I would like to say that it is very pleasant to hear a sharp analysis and criticism of lack of Government decision-making coming from the person in that chair during this debate. I do not want to be misunderstood but it appears that decision-making in this instance must be undertaken by the Government and is their responsibility. On section 3, I have a number of specific queries.  On subsection (4) it is provided that where a vacancy occurs among the members of the commission, the Government shall appoint a person to fill the vacancy as soon as may be after they are informed by the Attorney General that the vacancy exists.  Presumably the persons who are appointed would be a Law Reform Commission for the duration of the term.</P>

      <P>Thank you for that clarification and it brings me on to the next query which relates to the terms and conditions under subsection (8).  In the speech of the Attorney General introducing this Bill there was, I think, a desire to remain very flexible on this point and not to be too specific.  At the same time it is important that we emphasise in the House that the work <Col N="258" /> of the Law Reform Commission is going to be of very considerable importance and complexity and that the commissioners therefore must be drawn from very senior members either of the legal profession or the legal-academic sphere or other outside specialist interests.  I would presume that the terms and conditions would reflect this importance and I would welcome some clarification as to whether it is anticipated that either all initially, or at least the majority of the five, will be appointed for the full period of five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>I am afraid I cannot answer Senator Robinson on that because it all depends on the availability of the persons and, obviously, I am not in a position to inform the Senator who will be appointed as commissioners. The length of time which a person serves will depend on a great many matters.  A person may be at retiring age; he may be available for five years.  A person may be in a university and may not be free to serve for five years.  A person may be of junior rank in a profession and may not wish to commit himself for the full length of time.  So the position is a flexible one and I would agree with what I understand is the general view of Senator Robinson, that continuity will be of some importance.  That will, obviously, be borne in mind.  The idea of limiting the term to five years was to make it clear that we did not want life-time appointments.  This has been learned from experience elsewhere. There is this flexibility but continuity will be important, certainly at the beginning.</P>

      <P>I should like the Attorney General's view on subsection (3) (c) in regard to the functions of the commission which it is envisaged under that subsection are to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and include in their proposals for law reform, draft Bills.  I would regard this as very important in regard to expedition of the work that is envisaged <Col N="259" /> by this Bill.  Traditionally, not alone here but in Britain and throughout the world, one has commissions of different kinds established, reports drawn up and memoranda submitted, but nothing done.  The administration of the draftsmen's office should be linked in with this work so that along with the actual memorandum or proposal the commission or the Attorney General may recommend a specific drafting proposal in the form of legislation. From the administrative point of view this would break an administrative bottleneck to a tremendous degree and would be a great help. Would the Attorney General like to elaborate on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree very much with Senator Lenihan.  Senators who have looked at the reports of the Law Reform Commission in England and the Scottish Law Reform Commission will see that invariably they have appended a draft Bill.  Work which Senator Robinson referred to and other reports on the work of the Law Reform Commission and, indeed, personal information given to me by the Law Commission would indicate that one of the secrets of the success of the English Law Reform Commission have been the fact that a Bill has been annexed to its report.  Parliamentary draftsmen are scarce and this is a field which requires considerable expertise.  I would hope that the expert assistance in the Parliamentary Draftsman's Office attached to the Attorney General's Office and in the Office of Statute Law Reform and Consolidation will be available to the Law Reform Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I just ask a question on this section?  Is the Attorney General satisfied, having regard to the definition in subsection (2) which is subject to the generality of subsection (1) setting out the functions of the commission, and, again having regard to the provision in subsection (3) that the Government will be free to appoint people with qualifications other than that in law?  It would seem from subsection (7) of the section which has just been passed that the ability to appoint people other <Col N="260" /> than barristers, solicitors or teachers of law is limited to the ability of the Government to form an opinion that the person to be appointed is appropriate from the experience, qualification and training he has for appointment to a commission having the functions set forth in section 4.</P>
      <P>If we look at subsection (3) of section 4 we see that it is possible to consult persons qualified to give opinions on different matters.  Whether that kind of provision and the establishment of working parties for advisory committees could be held to indicate that it is only in that way people not qualified in law could be listened to in this matter, I do not know.  If one looks at the actual special declaration of the functions in subsection (2) these seem to me, reading them at (a), (b) and (c), to be all matters which could be performed by lawyers only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point that Senator FitzGerald is making.  However, I would be of the view that subsection (7) of section 3 is wide enough to permit the appointment of a non-lawyer, notwithstanding the wording of section 4.  It is true that the functions of the commission are functions in relation to examination of the law and research into the law.  But I think subsection (7) of section 3 will permit the Government to examine the qualifications of a non-lawyer and quite properly come to the conclusion that this particular non-lawyer has sufficient qualification to undertake research into some aspect of the law and make recommendations and formulate proposals upon it.  For example, in the field of family law it seems to me that a social scientist would be very well qualified indeed to examine the law and make recommendations concerning it.  I would think, therefore, that subsection (7) of section 3 is wide enough to permit what we all want to do being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>May I comment on the point raised by Senator FitzGerald before raising a specific query on the section myself?  I would agree with the Attorney General that the wording of section 7 appears to be broad enough <Col N="261" /> to allow a non-lawyer to be a member of the Law Reform Commission and still carry out functions under section 4. There are different arguments that one could put forward in support of having one non-lawyer&mdash;I think it would be sufficient to have one non-lawyer, taking into account that the functions of the Law Reform Commission do require legal expertise&mdash;and one is that, although the Law Reform Commission can of course consult experts or set up expert working parties which can have experts from particular disciplines or with practical experience of them, it is the impact on the Law Reform Commission itself which one would be considering in deciding its composition. I would certainly think that it would be an important richness within the Law Reform Commission that it was not just five lawyers, whether some of them were practising or members of the Judiciary or academic lawyers.</P>
      <P>I think that this is particularly necessary because of the very narrow approach to legal education which would have formed the background to these lawyers.  In the last couple of years the approach to legal education has broadened.  We now have family law on the courses.  But this was not so in the past and if one is thinking of fairly senior members of the profession, of the Judiciary, their background is narrow.  Their experience is an expert experience from a legal aspect, but they would benefit, I think, from a colleague and the continuity of the observations of a colleague, somebody who in the estimation of the Attorney General and the Government would be able to fulfil the functions as set out in the section. I, certainly, would express a very strong view in favour of having a non-lawyer on the Law Reform Commission. If the commission are to have a serious impact and a proper perspective on family law reform, this proposal commends itself very strongly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to subparagraph (f) of subsection (3), which gives the Law Reform Commission power to publish preliminary working papers prior to formulating any proposals for law reform, and to welcome this provision <Col N="262" /> very much.  If I understand it correctly, this gives the Law Reform Commission power to publish, and presumably therefore it will have the resources to do this.  This is very important.  I think one of the reasons the Committee on Court Practices and Procedure has been so handicapped was that it could not get many of its reports published.  It may be one of the very constructive tools in the hands of the Law Reform Commission if it can publish position papers, preliminary reports on particular subcategories of the area it is studying in depth in order to get a feedback, in order to get a response.  Therefore, I think that this section has given the Law Reform Commission the necessary powers to execute the functions of the section.  I welcome this power to publish the preliminary working papers prior to formulating any proposal for law reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Senators will appreciate that I cannot express an opinion in relation to the personnel of the Law Reform Commission but the point that Senator Robinson has made&mdash;and I know that it has been very very carefully considered by the Government&mdash;seems valid.  In relation to the second point made by Senator Robinson, the experience in England and Scotland has been that the preparation of preliminary working papers is a very important part of the whole process in the preparation of these proposals.  This does give power to publish, and it is an important power.  If one reads the reports of the Law Reform Commission in England one will see that they had arrived at a preliminary view, they published it in their working paper and then having got further views they changed their view.  This is a desirable approach to the whole problem of law reform and I would hope that it is a power that will be utilised by the commission.</P>

      <P>This is relevant also to what we have been discussing in regard to section 4.  Under subsection (1) every programme prepared by the commission will be submitted by the Taoiseach to the Government, which can approve, modify or reject the programme. I strongly approve of that. Subsection (2) says that where a programme submitted pursuant to the section is approved by the Government a copy of the programme so approved shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  What about the programme that is not approved? Does this come in under what we have been previously talking about on section 4?  Senator Robinson suggested that there is the power under subparagraph (f) of subsection (3) of section 4 to publish preliminary working papers prior to formulating any proposals for law reform.  If there is a specific law reform proposal prepared by the commission, submitted to the Government and rejected by the Government or modified, what is the situation under section 5 or section 4&mdash;which we have been just discussing&mdash;in regard to the publication of such original proposals by the commission?</P>

If the annual report of the Law Reform Commission says: &ldquo;We proposed such-an-such a programme and when the programme was published the Government did not include it,&rdquo; this matter will be subject to questions in both Houses as to what happened and if the Government decide not to include it, they will have to give reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, on section 6, I welcome the way in which it is set out because it appears to place a statutory duty on the Law Reform Commission to bring in a substantial report.  As somebody who has tabled endless motions in this House to consider various reports&mdash;which have not always been debated&mdash;it is frustrating to see how reports can be reduced to such a minimum that they do not convey any real sense of the activity of the particular body.  I think the wording of section 6 will necessitate that the Law Reform Commission give a full and clear account of what has happened.  I agree with the Attorney General that this would obviously have to include a programme for law reform which was not acceptable to the Government and of which the Government did not approve.  This, in itself is a very important aspect of the work of the Law Reform Commission and over a period of years should allow the building up of a certain expertise and continuity in the sense of being a monitoring of the law through the annual reports of the Law Reform Commission which will be very helpful.</P>

I emphasise this as someone who feels, as other Senators here present who were also appointed to the Joint Committee of the Oireachtas on European Community Secondary Legislation may also feel, that this committee did not get into full operation because of a certain reluctance at the beginning to give them the resources that were needed.

      <P>I am not suggesting there is any other way this could be put but I do not like the look of subsection (1) of this section.  Inevitably one sees this kind of thing:</P>
      <P>The Commission shall, in consultation with the Attorney General&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I am not worried in the least about that end of it.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;appoint such and so many persons to be officers and servants of the Commission as the Commission, subject to the approval of the Minister for the Public Service as to the number, from time to time thinks proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, we are back to the good old days, and it is I admit, inevitable, that the amount of staff that this body will be allowed to have will be dependent on the Minister for Public Service who, of course, for practical purposes is the Minister for Finance.  It is very important that the staff of the commission should not be <Col N="266" /> too small.  I do not know how to secure it but one hopes that the Department of Finance or of the Public Service do not adopt the sort of penny-scraping process that they do so often in relation, for example, to this House.  I would like to think the staff would be adequate but I am by no means confident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I did make it clear that one of the principal concepts behind this subsection was to protect the commission from criticism that they are not carrying out their appointment procedures fairly.  The commission can appoint their own staff.  They can appoint anyone they want subject, of course, to getting permission from the Minister of the Public Service as to their number. If the commission went ahead and appointed people who were say, from one academic institution rather than from another, this could mean they would be subject to criticism.  The idea of this subsection, taken in connection with subsection (5), is that the Attorney General of the day may <Col N="267" /> say to the commission: &ldquo;Before you fill these posts of research officers, it is desirable that you should advertise these posts.  You, of course, will decide who is to get them.&rdquo;  Or he might well say: &ldquo;You should set up an outside commission to decide who the appropriate people are.&rdquo;  It is really to protect the commissioners that this has been provided.</P>

      <P>I want to make the point that there is a reference to the president.  What function has the president as such?  Is he simply called the president of the commission?  I am sure it is appropriate that if we were discussing his superannuation we should ask what his duties should be.  Also, do they come in early on Monday morning and work until late on Sunday night? Do they decide all these matters themselves?  Is there necessity for any power to be given to them to regulate their own procedures?  If their superannuation was imperilled, through it being found that they had not the power to do any of these things, how would they stand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is a question of preference.  In section 3 (1) it is provided that there is to be a commission consisting of a president and four other members appointed by the commission.  We could have put chairman instead of president but it was considered that the title should be &ldquo;president&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;. Subsection (11) gives power to allow for the superannuation of the president and members of the commission. Whether they clock in at nine or ten and leave at five or 5.30 will be a matter for them to determine themselves. The Government will determine the terms and conditions under which they are appointed but if a person is appointed full-time I imagine it would be a matter for him to realise <Col N="268" /> that he must fulfil those statutory obligations.</P>

      <P>I regard this Bill as a very constructive Bill introduced very ably by the Attorney General.  This is the way a Government should behave.  This Bill has been discussed in a constructive way by the Seanad as a whole.  We are in a minority position in the Seanad. We have taken a constructive and positive attitude to all constructive and positive measures which have come here in the form of legislation.  We have done so in regard to this Bill.  We will not do so in regard to any legislation that is jack-booted through the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill is concerned, on its <Col N="270" /> Second Stage, I am again laying it on the line, as far as the Government are concerned it will not be a matter of having a debate of the kind we have had today.  We will be totally opposed to it.  We will fight it every section and subsection and make our views known in a very positive manner, because we regard it as nothing short of a disgraceful draconian procedure to seek to use the artificial majority which the Government have in the Seanad to jack-boot this legislation through, following on the shambles of Sunningdale.</P>

      <P>I do not want to wander into areas where I may be out of order but may I say that I note from the Senator's view that he thought the behaviour of the Government on this legislation was proper. I would reply that I note that the behaviour of the Opposition on this Bill was proper.  I do not wish to express my views on their earlier behaviour today.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 6.40 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 16th April, 1975.</P>
