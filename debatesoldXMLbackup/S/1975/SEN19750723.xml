      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 34 and 35, to add to section 2 the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(9)  In this Act, a reference to a gain shall be construed as meaning the relevant gain appropriately reduced in accordance with the calculations of the Central Statistics Office relating to any changes in prices and values during a period commencing on the date of acquisition of the asset in respect of which the gain accrued and ending on the date of disposal of the asset.</P>
      <P>(10)  In this Act, a reference to a loss shall be construed as meaning the relevant loss appropriately reduced in accordance with the calculations of the Central Statistics Office relating to any changes in prices and values during a period commencing on the date of acquisition of the asset in respect of which the loss accrued and ending on the date of disposal of the asset.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This recommendation is another effort to persuade the Minister to make some allowance for the effect of inflation in <Col N="696" /> relation to the application of this Bill. It is slightly varied from the recommendation which was made on the Committee Stage because the Minister indicated that he was not satisfied that the method suggested was a valid one, that it would work.  This is another way of approaching the same problem. I said on the Committee Stage that I had no rigid views as to how this matter should be approached.  I would welcome an amendment by the Minister on the lines I suggested, or any lines which would meet this problem. The Minister has not suggested any recommendation.</P>
    <P>I want to stress again how important I think this matter is and how dangerous and inequitable this Bill will be in practice if no allowance is made for the effect of inflation.  The Minister, of course, has said that he will have regard to inflation and will make some allowances for it.  In the course of the discussion here during the Committee Stage the Minister admitted that it would not be possible to make adequate allowance for inflation.  Consequently, in the future we will have the situation where capital gains tax will be charged on nominal gains, on gains created by the effect of inflation, on gains which are not in fact real gains at all.  That means that a person will be taxed on something artificial.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not in operation yet, and yet within the period that we have been discussing it we have had inflation of something in the region of 25 per cent.  Consequently already before the Bill is through this House, we have a situation where a person who bought something a year ago for £4,000, sells it for £5,000&mdash;in fact there is no real increase in the value of the goods&mdash;with a gain of £1,000, finds that £260 will be paid on that capital gain.  In fact there will be no increase in value at all.</P>
    <P>That is an indication of the inequity of this Bill as it stands and as it will operate because no procedure will be written into it to deal with inflation. I and many other speakers have stressed the necessity of having something in the Bill, in the Act when it goes into operation, which will be a guideline, something that the Minister <Col N="697" /> will not only take account of, but must take account of.  I stressed that I thought it would be in the interests of the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners that they should be able to say that the Bill obliged them to make certain allowances for inflation so that it would not be a matter which they would be able to do or not to do each year.  They would not be in the position of being subject to political pressures, subject to the temptation to do nothing about inflation, when they realise that in fact something should be done.  It would be much better not only from the taxpayers' point of view, the citizens' point of view, but the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners to have a guideline built into the Bill so that they are obliged to take certain measures and to have regard, in a specified way, for the effect of inflation.</P>
    <P>The position is that already before this Bill is in operation we have a situation where there has been inflation, and in the kind of example which I have given, a person has to pay £260 on the apparent capital gain, but in fact there is no gain at all.  It is purely an illusory gain.  Nevertheless, the £260 that he will have to pay is not illusory.  It is money he will have to pay.  This recommendation was put down in the hope that the Minister would have put down an alternative way of meeting this very serious situation, this very real problem and something that will adversely affect the taxpayer in the future and affect him in a very inequitable way. I ask the Minister to accept this recommendation.</P>

      <P>Senator Yeats will have all the advantages.  When people press for detailed amendments to this Capital Gains Tax Bill I think they overlook the logic of what they are recommending.  It is that if all the refinements they seek are to be built into the code then, logically, capital gains would have to be treated as income. If treated as income they would have to be subject to the full whack of income tax rates.  I wonder if people would prefer detailed income taxation, such as the Opposition press for, with rates running up to 77 per cent, or the code, as proposed, which proposes a flat rate of 26 per cent no matter what is the wealth of the individual or the income of the individual concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to give some examples of the effective rate of capital gains tax and compare those rates with income tax rates if the sums in question were to be subject to income tax.  Remember in the figures that I quote, the income tax rate that I will quote assumes that the taxpayer would have no other income other than capital gains, which is an improbable situation in most cases. Gains up to £500 in a year will be free of any capital gains tax but it could be liable to income tax at 26 per cent.  A £750 gain would be liable to an effective capital gains tax charge of 8.7 per cent and income tax would be 26 per cent.  A £1,000 gain would be liable to 13 per cent capital gains tax and 26 per cent income tax.  A £2,000 capital gain would be liable to 19.5 per cent capital gains tax and 28.8 per cent if it were charged to income tax.  A £3,000 capital gain would carry a 21.7 per cent capital gains tax rate and 32 per cent effective income tax rate.  A gain up to £4,000 would be charged at an effective capital gains tax rate of 22.7 per cent and if it were treated as income it would be at 33.6 per cent. <Col N="699" /> On a capital gain of £5,000 the effective rate of charge would be 23.4 per cent but if it were income it would be at 36 per cent.</P>
    <P>I should explain, of course, that when I spoke about a taxpayer not having any other income I was omitting taxpayers with small incomes who will, of course, enjoy exemption in any event; but the figures clearly indicate that the rates being charged for capital gains tax are comparatively low when compared with income tax.</P>
    <P>I accept that the aim of the recommendation is to provide an adjustment for inflation, but the Bill already does that by the very generous thresholds and exemptions already provided and the very low rate which is provided in the Bill.  The question of making provision in tax law for inflation is a very big one.  It goes far beyond capital gains tax, and it would be inequitable to introduce it in one tax without introducing it in the others. As I emphasised at the Committee Stage it is a nice exercise for the theorist to engage in.</P>
    <P>Government and Opposition, Senators and Deputies, have an obligation to ensure that the State has sufficient revenue to operate on. If thresholds are to be adjusted, as so many people recommended today, then people will also have to accept that rates will have to be increased or else there will have to be a popular will to forego many State expenditures which confer economic and social benefits.  That will to forego expenditures does not exist.  Except in the rather reckless calls made from time to time for a cut in Government expenditure.  A cut in Government expenditure at a time when the private sector is not spending sufficiently would only make our present economic malaise more severe.</P>
    <P>We have recognised many of the problems in drafting the capital gains legislation.  We have provided for them in considerable detail in the Bill. The fact that they are done in detail and in different ways may conceal from a casual observer the fact that <Col N="700" /> the benefits are nonetheless there.  In addition to exempting the first £500 of gains there is also exemption for all chattels with a value of up to £2,000. Then there are roll-over provisions for businesses assets, and there are exemptions also in relation to family farms and businesses disposed of within the family and outside the family if people have spent a number of years in the business.  These exemptions, certainly in the short run, and it is the short run that we are now dealing with, provide adequate safeguards against any real erosion of people's holdings by a capital gains tax imposed on increases in value which result from inflation.</P>
    <P>These thresholds and exemptions will be looked at from time to time. The Government have committed themselves to doing this.  I have no doubt that there will be ample critics around if the Government fail to honour their undertaking.  To insert the suggested recommendation would not, in fact, improve upon the undertaking which the Government have already given.  I am not speaking impartially when I say that to impose an obligation to make an appropriate adjustment leaves it open to as many uncertainties and as much argument as the Government's assurance that they will appropriately review the thresholds and the exemptions from time to time.  I do not think that it would be any stronger if it were in the Bill because in a democracy the ultimate will of the people is stronger than anything which is written into a Bill.  If the Government fail to honour their undertakings I have no doubt the full whip-lash of public indignation will operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second the recommendation.  It goes more fundamentally to the real economic, financial, monetary and taxation issues of today.  I feel that the reply that the Minister has just given, if I may say so, was full of <i>non sequiturs</i> and red herrings not related to the fundamental principle that is enshrined in the recommendation.  It is no analogy to draw comparison between capital gains tax and income tax rates. We are talking about the principle of relating any form of increased taxation <Col N="701" /> to a criterion, either a series of calculations from the Central Statistics Office relating to changes in prices, or whatever criterion concerning inflation that the Minister for Finance, in all his wisdom, can devise.  I agree that there are certain flaws in the present system of computing the consumer price index.  However, surely it is not beyond the wit of the Department of Finance to devise what should be an acceptable method or criterion, for calculating inflation rates.  On any criterion our inflation, since the 6th April, 1974, from which date this Bill will operate, has been in the region of 25, 26, 30 per cent.  Certainly it is now running at a rate of 25 to 26 per cent increase.  Since the 6th April last year it must be in that order.  When it becomes law capital gain, that notionally is of that order between 25 per cent and 30 per cent, is now brought within the ambit of this measure.  In fact the net financial gain in real terms, as far as the taxpayer is concerned, has been zero.  That is putting it in simplistic terms.</P>
      <P>That is the principle which we oppose with I think a very real degree of logic.  The Minister may say that indexation, as he calls it, which is a name for what we are proposing to do here, must be introduced right across the board.  Surely the experience of inflation which we now have is one very good reason why this elementary principle of social justice, in regard to the tax paying public is one that should be introduced now in regard to the various taxation Bills before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no excuse for the Minister to say that he has not devised the appropriate measuring rods, for this I feel that it could be devised.  He has the Central Statistics Office available.  He may not agree with the way the consumer price index number is gauged. Surely it is not beyond the wit of his Department to devise some other measuring rod, involved, on which we could write into permanent finance legislation a clause catering for inflation as far as the taxpayer is concerned. It is no answer for the Minister to say that there are exemptions and threshold arrangements made in <Col N="702" /> this legislation and in other legislation before us that will guarantee some equity as far as the taxpayer is concerned. That is no answer because there is no guarantee <i>in futuro,</i> as far as the taxpayer is concerned, in that type of arrangement.  Thresholds and exemptions can be changed from year to year in finance legislation. The Minister is well aware of that.</P>
    <P>I am talking about writing in as a permanent principle what is enshrined here in Senator Ryan's recommendation. I feel that he has a very great opportunity to do that in the two new measures before us.  I can appreciate, to some degree, the enormity of the task that would be involved in having a system of indexation in the whole income tax code.  I do not think it is impossible by any means and some Minister for Finance some day will have to face up to it.</P>
    <P>Here we have two new measures, the Capital Gains Tax Bill and the Wealth Tax Bill.  In each of these two, instead of tinkering around with exemptions and thresholds, the Minister has a real chance to write into both of these two new measures setting up two new schemes of legislation an indexation clause that will relate any capital gain, as is proposed in this instance, to the criterion of however gauged inflation has arisen since the acquisition of the particular piece of capital and its disposal.</P>
    <P>That is the purpose of the recommendation, and it is a very basic one. The Minister does not seem disposed to agree with it.  I would have liked if he had treated with the matter on its merits.  It is not enough to talk about the income tax code.  It is not enough to talk about thresholds and exemptions. It is not enough to talk about cutting back on capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>These are all unrelated matters to the fundamental equity that is involved here of incorporating for the first time what will have to be done by some Minister for Finance fairly soon, an across the board scheme of indexation as far as all tax payment is concerned.  It is only by giving the lead in finance legislation that one can get down to an acceptance of that <Col N="703" /> principle in regard to pay demands, prices, the whole economic activity of the community.</P>
    <P>The acceptance of a system of indexation and of tying pay increases and reducing tax payments all in accordance with the across the board scheme of indexation is what we should be aiming for.  If not immediately, not next year, certainly we should be aiming towards it.  It would be appropriate for the Minister for Finance, particularly as the guide and mentor of our whole economic process, to take the lead in this respect and particularly take the lead in new and fundamental tax legislation, such as he is introducing here in the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  It is what we should be targeting towards, that system of indexation across the board in every area.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate it will be difficult to get voluntary acceptance in some areas, particularly in the pay area, surely in new and innovative legislation of this kind it is the job of the Minister for Finance to set a lead and indicate to the public generally that he is in favour of this principle. I gather that he has indicated on one or two occasions that, in principle, he sees the logic of it and is in favour of it.  While appreciating his difficulty in getting it enforced across the board, in regard to State expenditure, social welfare payments, and prices, it would surely be an indication that he is dropping the old <i>ad hoc</i> methods in regard to finance legislation, jiggering around with thresholds and exemptions year in year out, that he was adopting a more fundamental approach to the problem by adopting here Senator Ryan's recommendation, which seeks in this new piece of legislation to have the gain construed in the context of being measured in accordance with basic calculations of Central Statistics Office figures that the Minister may decide give a true indication of inflation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>This recommendation is, of course, one of the most important that one could put down to this Bill, because the greatest problem <Col N="704" /> presented by this whole Capital Gains Tax Bill is this question of inflation. The Minister has maintained&mdash;with this principle we are on this side of the House in entire agreement&mdash;that he wishes to catch the real gains made by people in selling capital items.  We are in agreement with this but we are not in agreement with the certainty that, as the years go by, by far the greatest part of the so-called capital gains that will be caught by this Bill and on which tax will be payable will not be gains in any real sense of the word.  They will be merely notional increases in the money value of property, which will be caught by the Minister's tax but which will not in any sense of the word be a gain.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the tax does not go back beyond last year but an obvious instance shows the kind of thing that can happen.  Since 1950 there has been a 350 per cent increase in the cost of living, a fall in the value of money.  Over a period such as that it is perfectly obvious that so-called capital gains that people make are largely perhaps 90 per cent inflation and only perhaps 10 or 20 per cent actual real gains.  This is the kind of situation that we will be faced with in the future to an even more drastic extent, because the likelihood is, even though one may hope that there will be a considerable improvement on the present rate of inflation, that in the next 25 years or so the average rate of inflation will be considerably greater than in the last 25 years.  Those certainly are all the indications.  One can argue about it but all one can say is that it is, to say the least of it, likely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has expressed the hope, and we must all hope with him, that the present 20 to 25 per cent rate of inflation will not continue.  I would remind the Minister that even if it were cut to 10 per cent in seven years, the value of money has halved. The certainty is that as the years go by more and more of these so-called capital gains will not be gains at all.  The Minister constantly harps on these completely fallacious comparisons of income tax.  In certain instances these comparisons are <Col N="705" /> valid, say in the case of professional speculators, people who buy and sell land, because they are dealing in property with a view to making a profit. We asked the Minister on Committee Stage to tax such people at a higher rate.  We asked him to have a higher rate of tax for short-term gains, which are undoubtedly in the nature of income, and a much smaller rate for long-term gains.  He would not agree to this.  This type of gain made by speculators is the only one that can be legitimately described as being in any way related to income tax.</P>
    <P>The people we are protecting against the ravages of inflation are, for example, the widow who on her husband's death wishes to sell a field for building purposes and once it is sold it is gone; or perhaps the family who, to meet a temporary financial problem, may sell some of the jewellery that has been collected over the years or a valuable painting, to meet such difficulties. These transactions are not in the nature of income or the kind of transaction one imposes income tax on.  Once the field is gone and the painting is gone and the jewellery is gone there is no more of it, whilst income is recurring year after year.  It is a totally different matter.  It is not relevant for the Minister to make these constant comparisons between capital gains tax and income tax.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out by the Minister and by Senators opposite that in the past 20 years or so, because of the fall in the value of money, a very much larger number of people are liable to income tax.  If one takes that particular comparison that is precisely what will happen with the capital gains tax.  More and more people will be affected.  A higher proportion of supposed capital gains will be treated as gains for the purpose of this Bill.  In 20 or 30 years almost any transaction is likely to be met with capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests that what he describes as the generous thresholds have been inserted in the Bill with a view to dealing with inflation.  They have not been inserted for that purpose at all.  The generous thresholds in the Bill, particularly the £500 capital <Col N="706" /> gains and the £2,000 for the size of an item which need not be considered by the Minister, were in the original White Paper in February, 1974.  Since then there has been a 30 per cent rise in the cost of living.  They were not inserted to deal with inflation, and they have not been changed.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald made the point on Committee Stage in respect of a similar recommendation to this Bill.  He said that the Minister had changed the original 35 per cent in the White Paper to 26 per cent.  This was, after all, dealing with inflation.  I do not think it was.  It was dealing with the many representations received by the Minister from people all over the country who thought that 35 per cent was far too high, because of the rise in living costs which has already taken place since 6th April, 1974.  The real rate of capital gains tax is already back to between 32 and 35 per cent, for practical purposes on real gains as opposed to the gains, including the 25 or 30 per cent inflation, that have taken place since last year.  We are already back to the original 35 per cent.  By this time next year, it will be over 40 per cent, the real capital gains tax on real gains, as opposed to notional money gains, and by 1978 when the Minister says the Government will reconsider all these matters, it is likely that the effective rate of capital gains tax will be 70 or 80 per cent.  The Minister is quite wrong when he says that the undertaking given by the Government will be better than this recommendation.</P>
    <P>It is vital that this question of inflation should be dealt with in the Bill.  Governments are not always able to change thresholds in an equitable manner.  They may not have the money or public opinion may not be in favour of it.  The Minister is as well aware as I am, that if the public were asked, for example, if they approved of the reduction of surtax rates in income tax, the vast majority of the population who do not pay surtax would be likely to say: &ldquo;No, why should these people have their surtax reduced?&rdquo;  Does the Minister really think that the vast bulk of the population, who probably never made capital gains, would express their <Col N="707" /> opinion in favour of improving the thresholds?  The Minister will have to decide for himself in accordance with equity what is the best thing to do.  By the time 1978 comes the erosion in money values will have continued to such an extent that any really effective changes in the capital gains tax to allow for inflation will be very drastic indeed.  It is all right to do them year by year as suggested in this recommendation. To do them at one blow, as it were, in 1978 would mean very considerable changes which, politically speaking, might be difficult for the Minister.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister produced as one of his main reasons for not agreeing to a similar recommendation we put down that the price index was not a satisfactory vehicle for operating adjustments in capital gains tax.  Senator Ryan has changed this recommendation to delete the reference to the price index, and it says merely that the relevant gains should be appropriately reduced in accordance with the calculations of the Central Statistics Office relating to any changes in prices and values in the period.</P>
    <P>It is open, therefore, to the Central Statistics Office in accordance with the information available to them, to allow for changes in prices and values during the period in relation to any type of property.  That is more flexible than a mere reference to the price index, and I suggest the Minister ought accept the recommendation in this form, which completely omits the main objection he had to it before, namely, that the price index was not suitable.  The Minister has been assuring us, both here and in the other House, that this is what he is going to do.  He said that he will, as the years go by, keep abreast of inflation. We are, for practical purposes, endeavouring to insert in the Bill the thing he says himself he is going to do.  In his own interest he would be very wise to accept this recommendation, because once it is in the Bill it is done automatically year by year and therefore the possible political difficulties that the Minister <Col N="708" /> for Finance might face in doing it himself in his annual budget would be considerably relieved.  I urge the Minister to accept the recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that this recommendation, if accepted, would not really add to the position because the Minister and the Government have already given an assurance that some allowance will be made for inflation.  This is not quite true because if this recommendation were accepted it would oblige the Minister every year that inflation occurred to make at least some allowance in accordance with the rate of inflation.  It might not be a full allowance but nevertheless if this section was in the Bill, then the Minister would be obliged to do something about inflation each year.  As it is, he is merely giving a general assurance that he will have regard to inflation, which might mean that he will look at the position every third year or something of that nature.</P>
      <P>The importance of the recommendation is that it would oblige the Minister every year to look at the position, to assess it, and have regard to inflation, the accurate figure for which he would have very little trouble in finding out, and then allow for that in the operation of the Bill.  It is not true to say that this would not improve the position.  It would, to the extent at any rate that the Minister would have to do something each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has, in replying on this recommendation, avoided the issue.  He has talked about the low rate of tax; he talked about the thresholds.  It is true that the low rate of taxation and the thresholds and the various exemptions and so on have gone a considerable way to make this Bill acceptable.  Without these thresholds, without the rate of taxation that is proposed, the Bill probably would be entirely unacceptable. From that point of view, the Bill is acceptable, but this is not really dealing with the point I am making, which is, if there is no real gain, then there should not be any tax.  It is not <Col N="709" /> whether the rate is 26 per cent or 10 per cent or 50 per cent.  It is inappropriate and inequitable that somebody should have to pay a tax on something that is not a real gain at all.  It is a different matter if there is a real gain.  Then there is room for argument as to what the rate should be.</P>
    <P>The point has been made by many speakers in the course of the debate on this Bill that if there is a real gain then it is acceptable that there should be a capital gains tax.  If there is no real gain there should be no tax.  It may be difficult; it may be impossible to implement that recommendation or to implement that point of view to the full extent, but certainly something should be done to implement it as far as possible.  That is why it is important that something on the lines of this recommendation should be in the Bill, on the one hand, to ensure that the Minister will do something about inflation and, on the other hand, to help him in doing something about inflation by having it to say that he is obliged to do so under the Act.</P>
    <P>The postion, on the basis of the attitude which seems to be taken by the Minister, is that in the future, I am afraid to an increasing extent, people are going to be taxed on gains which are not gains at all.  They are going to sell something for a price which will show an apparent gain but, in fact, having regard to inflation, there will be no gain at all.  He is merely getting the same adjusted price for the article or the property that he paid for it.  Nevertheless, he is going to have to pay a sum, large or small, in capital gains tax on something that is not a real gain at all.  On the other hand, which I suppose would be more often the case, he will have to pay on a gain that is perhaps half represented by inflation and half by real gain.  In that situation, it must be recognised, if the gain is half real and half inflation, that what is happening is that the rate of capital gains tax is going up from 26 per cent to 52 per cent.</P>
    <P>In almost all cases it will be very unusual in the future if some, at least, of the gain on the sale of property or on the disposition of property, is not <Col N="710" /> due to inflation.  Before this Bill is passed at all, one can say that there will be virtually no case in the future&mdash; if one might go so far as to make that sweeping statement&mdash;of a person disposing of property and being assessed on capital gains on which he will, in fact, be charged 26 per cent tax.  It will always be higher than 26 per cent.  If the gain is half inflation, it will immediately be 52 per cent, and so on</P>
    <P>One of the bases on which the Minister rejected this recommendation or appears to be rejecting it is that the rate of taxation is only 26 per cent but, in fact, there is going to be no situation, no example in the future where inflation will not affect the sale price to some extent and if there is going to be no situation in which there is going to be a real capital gain.  The rate will always be higher than that 26 per cent.  Sometimes it will be twice that.  There is not much use talking about 26 per cent being a low rate of tax and that this consequently takes the harm out of the situation when it is always going to be higher than that and sometimes very much higher.</P>
    <P>Sometimes the gain will be entirely due to inflation.  In that case, of course, the rate of tax is 100 per cent.  I accept that, as the Minister said it is a very difficult situation, that one cannot make full allowance for inflation and while that is an arguable point, not to put something into the Bill which will, at least, ensure that something is done each year about inflation is indefensible.</P>
    <P>We started this discussion on the Bill with the feeling that there were very firm assurances from the Minister and the Government about inflation, and on the basis that, perhaps, we could persuade the Minister to accept a recommendation of this kind.  We are not tied to the recommendations we put down.  We would more than welcome any suggestion from the Minister as to how it should be done.  Something should be put in the Bill.  We are now in the position that no recommendation is being accepted.  The Minister is stressing the difficulties, the comparisons with income tax, mentioning all kinds of what I would regard as side issues, to some extent matters which <Col N="711" /> are not really relevant to the point I am making.  We are getting less firm assurances as to how this is going to be dealt with in the future.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that our worst fears about the effect of inflation on this Bill are being realised.  I think I am not exaggerating in saying that because inflation will always affect every sale in the future, there is never going to be a case of 26 per cent tax. It is always going to be 26 per cent <Col N="712" /> plus the effect of inflation which will bring it up to 50 per cent or 75 per cent and so on.  The situation is going to deteriorate very rapidly.  It is going to be a very serious matter for anyone who comes within the ambit of this Bill in the future and has to pay capital gains tax, which will certainly be more than 26 per cent and may be 50 per cent or 100 per cent.  The low rate of tax in the Bill is really no help at all, because it will never apply.</P>

    <P>Recommendation declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 12, after line 3, to add the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and provided also that whenever a disposal <i>inter vivos</i> results in a liability both to Capital Gains Tax and to Gift Tax, only such one of those taxes as imposes the higher amount of tax shall be chargeable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this recommendation is to urge the Minister to implement the promise of the policy statement in the white paper that tax would not be charged twice on the same transaction. This has been debated but no satisfactory reason has been given why the two taxes should apply in certain cases on the same transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite apart from the undertaking given in the white paper, it seems equitable that two taxes should not apply to the one transaction, the one disposal, and what is proposed here is very much in favour of the Revenue Commissioners, that whichever is the higher shall be operative but that if one is operative the other would then not be operated.  This is not only something which appeared in the white paper and which to that extent made the proposed capital gains tax more acceptable than it would otherwise be, but the arguments for it and the equity for it are very strong indeed, and I would ask the Minister to reconsider his position on this <Col N="713" /> point and to accept this recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this at some length at Committee Stage here and in the other House.  I can add little to what I have already said.  The recommendation seeks to provide exemption for the few exceptionally wealthy people&mdash;it is only exceptionally wealth people who would be involved in gifts where there could be liability to capital gains tax on the donor and liability to capital acquisitions tax, when it is enacted, on the donee.</P>
      <P>I should like to give an example. Suppose you have a farmer of 55 years of age or over transferring a farm to his son.  No capital gains tax would arise in the following circumstances: a farm with a value of £150,000; a house and contents worth £20,000; money on deposit, say, £10,000; Land Bonds and Government securities worth, say, £20,000; a motor car, £1,000; other articles and chattels of different kinds each worth up to £2,000, total, say, £12,000.  Thus there could be total assets of £213,000 and no liability to capital gains tax would arise in those circumstances, nor would any capital acquisitions tax liability arise because the farm would be taken at half its value, £75,000 and the remainder of the assets would be valued at £63,000.  The value for capital acquisitions tax purposes would be £138,000 and that would be below the threshold of £150,000.  So, blessed and lucky is he who may be involved in a transaction where there is an occasion for a charge to capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the person is outside the immediate family, he is very lucky to be getting a gift from a stranger.  These occasions can arise, but such donees are surely more fortunate than the person who receives no gift at all.  The person who receives a gift is surely in a better position to pay than a person who receives nothing at all.  The donor is liable for the capital gains tax, not the donee. The donee is liable for the capital acquisitions tax if he is fortunate enough to be above the thresholds of <Col N="714" /> exemption.  I deliberately say fortunate because when you are above the thresholds you are receiving quite a substantial gift.</P>
    <P>If the donee assumes responsibility for payment of the capital gains tax of the donor, the value of the gift will be diminished accordingly.  The whole code ensures that the vast majority of cases will give rise to no more than one tax, and if there is occasion for payment of both taxes then only exceptionally wealthy people will be involved.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan has suggested that there is something sacrosanct about the white paper.  If what was written in the white paper is sacrosanct why did he not table a recommendation asking for a 35 per cent rate of capital gains tax for a start?  There has been too much readiness on the part of the representatives of the extremely wealthy to take without one word of thanks all the concessions that were made in the white paper, and a kind of moral stance has been taken that everything that was in the white paper should now be fully implemented by the Government without any variation.</P>
    <P>I have told this House, and I have told the other House and I have told the country, the reason why we cannot accept the suggestion that the due liability to tax should not exist, that there would be a massive avoidance by the exceptionally wealthy who could easily arrange their affairs in such a way as to avoid any liability to tax whatsoever.  I was frank enough to tell the House the last day how it could be done.  Instead of selling a property a person could simply make a gift of it to a relation and the relation could sell it the following day and have no capital gains tax liability.  That could be repeated to the nth degree so as to make a mockery of the whole system.</P>
    <P>We have provided massive relief from capital taxation by the abolition of death duties.  We are not going to tolerate the introduction of a system of death duties which could be avoided by the exceptionally wealthy.  That would be making a mockery of everything that we are striving to do and it would be contrary to social justice or good fiscal discipline.  On that count I am unable to accept the recommendation.</P>
    <Col N="715" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that I am sorry the Minister is not going to accept this.  We are not treating his white paper as a sort of taxation bible and that we would expect him to stick to every word in it, but one is entitled to suggest that the violations of principle that he now raises as to why he could not possibly accept this recommendation hardly seem to have occurred to him when he drafted the white paper.  What clearly has happened is not that he has changed his mind: I would suggest that he still thinks that in equity his recommendation ought to be accepted but he is afraid, as he has been afraid in so many cases throughout this Bill, that to accept what would otherwise be an equitable recommendation could lead to evasion.</P>
      <P>I am not at all clear as to how it could lead to the evasion that he has suggested.  It would hardly be beyond the wits of the Revenue Commissioners to solve this problem.  I suggested at an earlier stage that there should be a period of years during which the property concerned could not be resold, or that the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners could adopt the practice which I gather exists in the United States in the capital gains tax code where if a gift is made to anyone it is valued for the purpose of that gift at the same value as on its original acquisition and only then when it is sold by the person who has acquired the gift or by some successor in title that the capital gain arises.  It would be perfectly practicable to do this here.  It would mean that if someone gives some property, a farm or whatever it happened to be, to another person there would be no capital gain on that transaction because if it is not sold there is no consideration and the capital gain could arise only when ultimately it was sold for valuable consideration. It would be perfectly practicable. These things can be solved. The Minister is not convincing anyone when he raises this status of a principle&mdash;that you cannot allow gifts to be taken without tax because it is what is totally different to the principle he himself established in his white paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As he has on many occasions already in these discussion, he raises <Col N="716" /> the question of the man over 55 who leaves his farm or business or whatever it is to his children and so on.  He says that they would have to be enormously rich before they had to pay both taxes.  He could take a very much simpler case.  Nobody is suggesting that in the case he has referred to any great harm will be done, because certainly by the time both taxes came to be paid the amount involved in the property would be very large indeed. One does not feel that these people really need to be protected.</P>
    <P>Take the case where a farm, for example, is handed on to a brother. There may well be no children or spouse, only a brother, who is going to take the family farm.  In that case there is no £150,000 or figure of that kind.  The tax becomes payable after £10,000.  Everything over £10,000 is taxable.  In these circumstances, say you had a farm of £100,000 or so&mdash; that is not such a very big farm these days&mdash;then the capital acquisitions tax would be about 25 per cent.  You would in addition have 26 per cent on the capital gain which as the years go by would be the greater part of the value, so that the total tax payable begins to get very near the old death duty rate of around 50 per cent.  Indeed there are not enormous sums involved: this is a relatively moderate sized family farm.</P>
    <P>So it is no use the Minister talking in terms of people who have enormous amounts of money.  The people who will be affected in many cases by both these taxes are not people of great means but people of relatively moderate means.  Transactions inside the family dealing with family businesses, family farms, other than those the Minister has mentioned where on the one hand the owner has to be over 55 and on the other hand he has to hand it on to his wife or his children, are the cases which constantly arise. You would certainly have both taxes paid at far lower levels.  It is very difficult to see why the Minister should not accept this.  If the cases were to be as rate as he suggested, obviously the revenue loss would be negligible, but in fact they would not be at all so rare and the revenue loss would be somewhat <Col N="717" /> less negligible but would still be very very small.  I do not know whether it would amount to more than £50,000 a year or so.  There is almost nothing involved in money terms.  Yet it would mean in certain cases that very great hardship could result by the payment of both these taxes.  If the Minister were to go back to his first, and I think much better, thoughts in his white paper he would be able to save these people this unexpected and unfair impost.</P>
    <P>Recommendation declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No.3:</P>
      <P>In page 14, to delete lines 48 to 50 and substitute:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)  Where the beneficiary is the spouse of the deceased, for a consideration equal to their market value at the date of death;</P>
      <P>(ii)  in all other cases as if the deceased person's acquisition of the assets had been the acquisition of those assets by the personal representatives of such other person; but&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This recommendation arises out of one that I put down on the Committee Stage.  It covers the case where a farmer, for example, buys a farm or perhaps a small family business, he keeps it for 30 or 40 years and then hands it over to his children, or nephew or spouse or whoever it happens to be.  In these circumstances the capital gains tax may be postponed, but on the sale by the nephew or the child, perhaps 30 years later when he has been in occupation all this time, the notional capital gain on which he will be charged tax is not the 30 years going back to the transfer, which must be on the death of the owner.  It does not go back to the market value on the death of the owner: it goes back the full 70 years or whenever the property was originally acquired.  That would mean that as the years went by people will be faced with sudden enormous capital gains charges, these notional gains going back perhaps generations.  They would be quite unexpected and those concerned may well be unable to pay them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="718" /> I would stress that essentially what the Bill provides is that you can have a chain of transactions inside the family, a chain of transfers by will, from one generation to another. It is only after perhaps a very long period has elapsed and ultimately a sale is made that the capital gains tax becomes payable.  It goes way back to the original value at the acquisition of the property which may have been generations earlier.</P>
    <P>We on the Committee Stage proposed that in such a case the increase in capital gain on sale should only go back to the acquisition on the death of the previous owner.  The Minister rejected this, so we have come back now with this recommendation which for the vast majority of cases leaves the Bill as it stands, and as apparently-the Minister wishes to have it, but makes the exception that where the benificiary is a spouse of the deceased the market value will be assessed as of today, the date of death.  This covers the point where a widow, for example, who is left a farm or a small business, that for whatever reason, she is quite unable&mdash;and these things happen&mdash;to run herself.  She wishes to sell it.  She has to sell it in order to acquire enough money on which she can get an income and live.  Under the Bill she would have to pay capital gains tax on the notional increase in value way back 30 or 40 years to when her husband originally acquired it.  Under the terms of this recommendation in the case of the widow or widower, and only in that case, he or she can sell the property, if unable to administer it after the death, without having to pay capital gains tax.  In this relatively limited case it would be an injustice to the people concerned.  It is relatively limited in scope and I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The change proposed by this recommendation is that in the case of a surviving spouse any assets passing are to be treated as taken at market value at the date of death.  In all other cases, because of the effect of the second paragraph what I might call the &ldquo;look-through&rdquo; provision of <Col N="719" /> section 14 will continue to apply.  It would be relatively easy for a surviving spouse to transfer assets acquired on the death to other persons immediately she receives them with no charge at all to capital gains tax.</P>
      <P>Thus, the acquisition at market value would not be confined, as the Senator is recommending, to the surviving spouse but could be extended by her to whomsoever she desires.  She, by receiving from the testator, could carry out the testator's wishes.  A testator could use his surviving spouse as a vehicle to give a tax-free gift to a total stranger.  That is not the intention of the legislation.  It is providing very generous exemptions so as to encourage property-holding for productive purposes within a family, easing also the passing on of family businesses from one generation to another, because these items are exempt.  It would be totally contrary to the intention in the Bill to allow the passing of substantial properties to people free of capital gains tax.  As regards voluntary disposals, a gift is as much a disposal as a sale because the person who makes the gift elects not to take cash in return.  It is a voluntary decision and is very properly, a taxable occasion.</P>
      <P>There is another consequence of the recommendation which I am sure was not intended and in the light of this consequence I respectfully suggest that Senator Yeats might withdraw it.  The treatment at death would differ from the treatment of gifts between spouses. In the case of gifts the &ldquo;look-through&rdquo; principle applies and the husband or wife takes at the other's cost: for a subsequent disposal, therefore, the tax would be greater where a gift was given during life than where it was conferred on death.  This would be an anomalous position and would be antisocial. It would discourage of gifts during life.  It would be contrary to the intention of the whole package of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The philosophy behind the death provisions in the Bill is to encourage the maintenance of assets within the family, particularly farms and family businesses.  This is a significant difference from the approach under the <Col N="720" /> estate duty code where in many cases the family property unit was put in peril in order to provide means to pay tax charged on death.  As long as the person who inherits the farm or the business keeps this within the family and passes it on, there will be no charge to capital gains tax.  There is a degree of discouragement to the disposal of family farms or business assets and we consider this to be the right thing to do. It would operate in the case of a widow and children for the protection of the children.  It is something we should not lightly interfere with.  For these reasons I respectfully suggest that the recommendation, though well-intended, is not one we could accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is looking at this entirely from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners, from the point of view that it could lead to tax evasion and could represent a loophole.  He looks at it entirely from that point of view.  He seems to pay insufficient attention to the possible hardships which exist under the Bill as it is at the present. Perhaps there are possibilities of evasion.  If that is the case the Minister could have accepted this recommendation in another form so as to eliminate the possibility of the evasion he mentions.</P>
      <P>There are situations in which this could represent a definite hardship. There is the case of a spouse whose husband has died or a widower whose wife has died leaving a business or a farm which the surviving spouse is completely incapable of running.  In the case of a widow, she cannot run it herself; she has no children capable of running it and consequently she has no alternative but to sell in order to provide an income for herself.  The Minister said this was a voluntary disposition and consequently a person had the choice of selling or not selling.  In that case it would not be voluntary. There would be no alternative for the widow but to sell the business.  She would be forced to sell and to pay capital gains tax on the property in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The limited abolition of estate duty was introduced by the Minister to avoid hardship within the family.  That was <Col N="721" /> a laudable change in the law, but the Minister is refusing to face the situation that in this kind of case the widow is brought back into the situation that existed when estate duty applied.  Her husband has died and she has to take certain action to provide herself with an income.  The action she has to take, which is not a voluntary one, entails the payment of capital gains tax. Instead of having to pay estate duty as she would have before, she is now having to pay capital gains tax.  Even though the capital gains tax may not be quite as high, certainly she is in the position because of the death of her husband, because of the circumstances, that she is obliged to pay tax which brings her back into much the same position as existed before the abolition of estate duty within the family.</P>
    <P>This recommendation is merely an effort to complete the action which was taken by the Minister in abolishing estate duty within the family.  It is to close one loophole that is left, not a loophole in the sense of evasion of tax but a loophole from the point of view of the taxpayer or the citizen who through force of circumstances resulting from the death of her husband is going to have to pay tax as a result of his death.  If the Minister wanted to complete the good work that he did in abolishing estate duty he should have accepted this recommendation and dealt with this anomaly as to liability to tax arising from the death of a spouse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this recommendation we must remind ourselves that this is one of the taxes which were introduced to replace a capital tax contained in the death duty code.  It would be accepted by everyone in this House that the Government must get revenue from taxation of capital or income to provide the services for this community.  But there is never a justification for an unjust tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very right that we should remember that under the late existing death duty code there was an exemption from all duty where the capital did not exceed £10,000, even if the entire of that £10,000 or £9,900 of it represented <Col N="722" /> a capital gain from a lucky speculation or investment, added to which there was an exemption in the case of a widow of £4,000 for herself, an exemption not of £4,000 worth of assets but a credit of £4,000 against the death duty leviable on the estate if the estate did not exceed £100,000.</P>
    <P>I am thinking of the estates which do not exceed £100,000.  I am thinking of the small estates where the very small size of them forces a realisation. I do not think that the tax will be a just one if it fails to take account of the circumstances of somebody dying leaving a small estate and leaving a widow and dependent children because under the late estate duty code there was not merely a credit against the assessed estate duty of £4,000 for the widow, there was a credit of £2,000 for each of the dependent children, which meant that in the case of somebody dying worth £50,000 there was no estate duty payable if that person left a widow and six children.</P>
    <P>There were three different ways, at least, of treating the occasion of death. You could have treated it, as the United Kingdom did treat it initially under the 1965 Act, as a disposal.  If you so treated it you would then only apply the capital gains tax where the gain exceeded a specified figure or the realisation&mdash;I have forgotten whether it was the realisation exceeded a specified figure or the gain&mdash;but there was an exemption limit which meant that you could have gains which did not give rise to taxation in the case of death where you had small estates being realised.  Or, you could have treated it as the United Kingdom at present treats it, as an acquisition by the personal representatives at the market value ruling at the date of death giving rise to no charge to tax but determining the base on which future taxation was to be levied.  In that case if you had realisations, which generally take place pretty quickly after the death, on the whole this meant that there would not be very much capital gains tax.  All the problems that have been referred to in the debate on the earlier recommendation with regard to indexation and inflation were wrapped up in the acceptance of a market value figure. Or, you could have done as we are <Col N="723" /> proposing to do, treat it not as a disposal but as an acquisition of the cost of the deceased who in his lifetime had acquired it.</P>
    <P>That particular treatment in my judgment is the worst of the three. It is bad for two reasons.  It is going to introduce a great deal of difficulty into the matter of the administration of the estate.  It will burden the personal representative with discovering what the deceased paid for everything that he has to sell, where he has to sell them and where he cannot take advantage of the arrangement provision of subsection (6) as proposed to be amended by the Minister.  In addition to which, there will be a tax levied within effective thresholds which will amount to a selective and unavoidable wealth tax, unavoidable by people in difficult illiquid circumstances&mdash;an unjust burden in these circumstances, a harsh treatment of people who were properly provided for under amendments to the code which was later repealed, improved by the Minister himself.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the people who in general regard this as a tax on the rich speculator are aware that in many cases it will not be a tax on the rich speculator, who will be able to avoid that tax by retaining his accumulation because he is not forced to realise it.  When I first became interested in politics the great cry of wage-earners, people with modest incomes, on the occasion of every budget was &ldquo;why do you not raise the income tax?&rdquo;  We do not hear that cry any longer.  That cry does not arise now because of the very large number of people who are within the income tax code.  If this country, recovering from its present difficulties&mdash;I certainly believe it will&mdash;continues to make the progress which it has all the ability to make in its circumstances, I see the day coming when there will be as anxious a scrutiny of the capital gains tax code as there now is of the income tax code by people who at the moment think this is only a rich man's problem.</P>
    <P>Somebody remarked to me, arising out of observations I made on the <Col N="724" /> Committee Stage: &ldquo;You do not mind about capital gains tax provided capital gains tax does not have to be paid.&rdquo;  Untrue, unjust, wrong.  I must accept, not merely because of my political position, the Minister's decision with regard to his treatment of this recommendation at this juncture, but I must record that I accept this decision with the greatest of unhappiness and considerable unease and only in the belief that a case for a proper provision of thresholds and exemptions will be borne in on the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners by the cases they will have to consider in the coming years.</P>
    <P>It may be that it will take time before the injustice of this is felt, because of the base date given here, April, 1974.  There is a reason for my not getting as excited about it as I might otherwise be.  It is the acceptance of that base date, April 1974, and my realisation that although the cost of living has increased by whatever is the percentage since that date, the value of assets has not increased in general.  Therefore in general over that time period it is unlikely that there have been many cases of hardship thrown up, if any.  Yet I know of one security quoted on the Dublin Stock Exchange which has multiplied its value three or four times since that date which might have been one of the very few assets of a surprised deceased person, surprised by his own death and one of the very few assets which his widow might be forced to realise and pay 26 per cent of the accretion to value over the date of his acquisition, when she may need every penny she can lay her hands on for her own comfort and for the education and proper upbringing of her children.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned because of the structure of the Bill in relation to this because while there are considerable possibilities now opening up to us to save these cases from harsh treatment by virtue of the proposed amendment of subsection (6) through making arrangements, the structure of the Bill must be looked at.  There will be cases where arrangements will be difficult to make without giving rise to dispositions, <Col N="725" /> where realisations will be vital to provide cash to clear debt and where among the things that may have to be realised by the personal representative may be the principal residence and in the case of such a sale the threshold in respect of that principal residence disappears.  The threshold is only enjoyed by an individual.  That exemption from tax could only have been enjoyed by the individual if he could have sold it during his lifetime, or if the circumstances are such that it can go to the legatee, being his surviving spouse, or whatever.  But there are circumstances where this is not and cannot be the situation.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why it is necessary to follow so very closely the income tax code in regard to the treatment of personal representatives as a body.  It is an explanation but not a justification.  It tells us why they are treated as a body, but there are special reasons why the allowances available prior to death disappear under the income tax code during the course of administration.  There are justifications for that may be.  There are certainly historical explanations for it.  These justifications do not, in my judgment, innure to justify the treatment of the personal representatives on the same basis for capital gains taxation.  If it is deemed proper that the realisation by an individual of his principal residence should not be subject to tax, if the situation is worse than it may be for the individual, because it is a forced realisation in the course of administration, that treatment should innure to the personal representative also.  This has a bearing on this matter because if market value is taken, then the realisable gain after death, if made, will be modest and the impact of taxation more justifiable.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be the difficulties about indexation, there are difficulties of communication, difficulties of explaining to people the distinction between capital gains tax and the economic disadvantages of identifying the two in terms of saving and the disposition of saving in risk-bearing situation&mdash;whatever the difficulties there may be about that, I would strongly urge the Minister that between <Col N="726" /> now and next year's Finance Bill, in the light of the information to be garnered between now and then in respect of all cases of deaths which have occurred since 5th April, 1974, to reconsider the decisions embodied in the form of this section.  I would prefer a graduated capital gains tax with a just provision for the modest situation, a graduation which should relate to the capital possessed, to a flat rate which, because of its modest impact on the very well-off cannot be adjusted to deal with the situation of those who are not well-off.</P>
    <P>The distinction between income tax and capital gains tax economically is recognised in most countries and should be recognised here.  I would invite the Minister to give me the encouragement of saying that he will look at the actual cases which occur. I know the Revenue Commissioners have this practice, the nature of which I never fully and completely understood, of making extra-statutory concessions. Perhaps I should address the Revenue Commissioners rather than the Minister in relation to that matter. In the care and management of this tax, while this section, unamended, stands, they should make extra-statutory concessions in all cases where benefits would have flowed to the survivors in the cases of widows and dependent children under the late estate duty code, even if they are up to £50,000.  The sum of £50,000 is not all that much if you are the surviving spouse, and you are committed by the circumstances of the children to being in the house&mdash;this is your judgment as to what is best for them; you make this judgment and you do it&mdash;to manage, bring up in accordance with expectations, which is a point that ought not to be overlooked.</P>
    <P>&ldquo; A sorrow's crown of sorrows</P>
    <P>Is remembering happier things.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is something that a surviving spouse has very much to be conscious of.  The children will have expectations based on the kind of experiences they had when their father was alive and well.  The sum of £50,000, however well invested, will not produce in these inflationary days much of a surplus. Indeed, the general run of these cases <Col N="727" /> discloses a situation of erosion of capital.</P>
    <P>I would like to repeat the two points I hope the Minister will give encouragement to me by saying that he will look at the harsh cases that come to notice and will identify as harsh any case in particular of widow and children dependency; and that the Revenue Commissioners may make extra-statutory concessions prior to a revision of the decision embodied in the terms of this section.</P>

      <P>The Minister has suggested that practical difficulties would arise if he were to accept this recommendation. The only comment that I could make on that is that the practical difficulties arise essentially out of his decision to tax gifts.  Once that has been done then you have the whole chain of circumstances arising which we are trying to deal with by this recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I might suggest one type of situation which can arise, where a widow has inherited, say, a family business from her husband, he had acquired it and had built it up over a period of, let us say, 25 years, and let us say that the cost of living has gone up by 350 per cent in that period.  If he acquired the business for £20,000, in the hands of the widow it is worth £100,000.  On that there would be capital gains tax of some £20,000 to be paid.  The notional gain on which this tax is levied is £80,000.  Owing to the erosion of the value of money the real gain&mdash;and of course, the greater part of that is a gain which her late husband acquired through his own hard work in the <Col N="728" /> family business&mdash;is £30,000.  The tax, in fact, on that real gain that the widow has to pay is around 70 per cent, two-thirds anyway.  This is a heavy impost in the circumstances that faces a widow, perhaps on the sudden death of her husband.</P>
    <P>The whole problem arises, not in this particular case but, all over, due to the Minister's insistence that gifts must be taxed.  I cannot understand why he could not have preserved his original decision in the white paper, treated gifts as essentially the Minister does treat them between spouses <i>inter vivos,</i> that the tax is not immedately payable but is postponed so that on gifts by anyone to anyone there would be no tax payable because the gift would be taken at the original value and the gain would arise and the tax would only become payable on the ultimate sale by someone of the property concerned.  I would have thought that that was a relatively easy situation to administer.  It is what exists in the United States.</P>
    <P>By the Minister's insistance on taxing all gifts except for limited cases, such as between spouses during their lifetimes, the Minister has raised all these problems which will undoubtedly cause injustices in certain cases.  However, I accept that the recommendation as it stands does not adequately deal with the matter.  I would have much preferred the Minister to accept the all-embracing recommendation that we put down on Committee Stage.  The Minister did not.  I can see that this particular recommendation while it would cover the spouse could cause possibilities for evasion.  I can only urge the Minister, as indeed Senator FitzGerald has done, to have another. look at the whole question of gifts.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No.6:</P>
      <P>In page 27, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;27.&mdash;Where a widow disposes of a farm or business which she acquired on the death of her husband, such disposal shall be free of capital gains tax in respect of so much of the consideration as does not exceed £100,000.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This recommendation speaks for itself. It seeks, in page 27 of the Bill, to insert a new section between lines four and five of that page, in effect a new section 27 before the section 27 as envisaged in the Bill.  The purpose of the recommendation is one that is consistent with the sort of view expressed here before lunch by Senator Alexis FitzGerald and expressed on previous recommendations by Senators Eoin Ryan and Michael Yeats.  It is designed to ensure equity as far as the widow is concerned.  Indeed, if there is a flaw in the recommendation, it is that I do <Col N="730" /> not include the widower, because there are cases in which a widower would also be similarly prejudiced by reason of the terms of the Bill and section 27 as it is now operated.</P>
    <P>The recommendation relates to the position of a widow who, because of the death of her husband, is forced in practical terms to dispose of the farm or business.  We are seeking here that such disposal should be free of capital gains tax where the threshold, to use a new &ldquo;in&rdquo; word, is at £100,000.  In other words, the event of such a disposal, if that is the consideration, whatever capital gain is involved in disposing of the property at £100,000 or under should be free of capital gains tax.  The justice of that is elementary. If one looks at section 27, as it stands in the Bill as a whole, there is a threshold there in regard to consideration in respect of disposal within the family of a business or farm. Subject to the provisions of the section if an individual has attained 55 years of age and he disposes of the whole of his qualifying assets to one or more of his children, then it goes on to bring in, in accordance with amendments moved in the Dáil, nephews and nieces as well, where the value of the disposal does not exceed £150,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledges there that there is an equity in regard to this sort of family disposal.  He recognises that in the Bill which will be before us after the vacation, the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill, when, in the case of a donee or successor, who is the spouse, child or minor child of the deceased child of the disponer, in other words again a family disposition, he fixes the threshold or limit in respect of such a disposition of £150,000.  In the Wealth Tax Bill there is a figure of £100,000 fixed as the threshold.  Here we have a situation where in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill, in regard to a family disposal, £150,000 is fixed as the threshold and under section 27 of this Bill £150,000 is fixed as the minimum or threshold in regard to disposal within the family of a business or a farm and in the Wealth Tax Bill itself&mdash;I know that is a different area of tax being an annual tax on the value of the asset or property&mdash;<Col N="731" /> again there is a minimum figure or threshold of £100,000 fixed.</P>
    <P>In my view the recommendation which I have put down here carries that logic to the very same degree as the logic involved in the three pieces of legislation, the section of the present Bill, the Wealth Tax Bill and the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill.  It carries the same logic through to a logical fulfilment in that equally there is a strong case in merit and in equity where a widow on the death of her husband is put into a situation where she has to sell the family farm or business. Indeed in most cases when that is done, where she is selling it, it is done in the interest of children.  Quite obviously a widow in this type of case is selling the farm or business in order to ensure that she has sufficient finance available to deal with the problems of her children.</P>
    <P>Although I realise that it is an extension of the principle set out in the three pieces of legislation which the Minister is carrying at the present time it is essentially in the same area.  It is within the family area where it is important to ensure that incentive and enterprise is protected and enhanced. It is in accordance with the principle which we have advocated here in regard to various sections of the present Bill, in seeking to ensure that there should be a graded system of capital gains in respect of the period for which a person has the particular capital asset that is being taxed.  It is quite obvious in the case of the family farm or business that the asset will have been held for a period of time.  However no distinction has been made by the Minister between that case and the case of the quick speculative overnight kill. That is another section and I will not dwell on it.  It is in accordance with the same principle of ensuring that we do not in any way build into this legislation any inequity of disincentive as far as the family farm and business is concerned.</P>
    <P>As I am talking on this area again I am taking the Revenue point of view going away from the point of view of equity and justice <i>vis-á-vis</i> the family. From the Revenue point of view I <Col N="732" /> doubt if much would be lost by the Minister in revenue terms by introducing a recommendation of this kind.  It would surely, therefore, be logical to have incorporated a recommendation of this kind which is not alone just from the point of view of the widow concerned, who is forced into the situation that I mentioned of disposing of the farm or business for family purposes, but it is good, socially, in the sense that family enterprise is something that should be encouraged and developed.  It is also from the Revenue point of view no serious disadvantage. I would like to hear on the latter aspect from the Minister because he has been concerned about quoting Revenue exigencies.  That is understandable from a Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>On each of these three grounds there would appear to be no reason why this recommendation should not be looked at in a favourable light.  That is putting it on the negative basis.  On the positive basis it would appear to be in line with the various pieces of legislation already proposed by the Minister, who has recognised in them that there is a distinction between the husband/wife disposition and other forms of disposition.  We are saying here in this recommendation that where a widow disposes of her farm or business after her husband's death, where she has to in 99 per cent of the cases I envisaged, by reason of the exigencies of the situation in which she finds herself after her husband's death and that primarily means the obligation to look after her family because she may not be a business woman or a farmer or equipped in any management sense to run the business or farm she feels that in her new situation caused by her husband's death the sensible thing for her to do would be dispose of the farm or business, get some capital together, buy a modest house and look after her children and educate them properly.</P>
    <P>This is the situation that we envisage. It is quite likely that there will be a capital gain in that situation, under £100,000.  I am talking about the consideration being £100,000, the capital gain, of course, being much less depending on the gain involved.  The <Col N="733" /> capital gain in that situation would (a) be very small, (b), would not arise in a large number of cases and, (c), under £100,000 would amount to very little money.  So, on each of these three criteria I suggest that the Minister might look favourably on this recommendation. I would be very glad to hear his views upon it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated, in reply to the remarks of Senator Alexis FitzGerald, that the Revenue Commissioners will be very carefully monitoring the operation of the capital gains tax legislation for some time to come and if any cases of genuine hardship arise we can then consider taking remedial action and, if necessary, making relief retrospective.  I am sure there would be no objection to that.  The exemptions granted in the Bill are so extensive in the Irish environment and are so unique in the international environment, because of their wide scope, that it is unlikely that there will be cases of hardship arising. Certainly there will be no hardship compared with what occurred under the estate duty code.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald referred this morning to the concessions given under the estate duty code whereby a widow was allowed a certain deduction from the amount of estate duty payable and he suggested widows could be taxed in the future, who would not have been taxed in the past.  With respect, he overlooked the fact that under the estate duty code the house and all its contents, the bank accounts, Government stock, chattels under £2,000, motor cars, the lot, all were brought in and assessed for estate duty.  None of those items are assessable under the capital gains tax code.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan has suggested that the purpose of the recommendation is to protect the family situation.  I would respectfully disagree with him.  He wants to give the exemption where a family asset, which is essential to earning the livelihood of a family, is disposed of outside the family to strangers.  The legislation is built in such a way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it could happen that circumstances could arise where a widow might desire, and in the family interest be required, to move to a different location, say, off a farm into a town nearer to schools or other relatives and so on.  Such situations can arise.  The exemptions that are granted, and the likely family circumstances that would exist were such a necessity to arise are I believe such as to ensure that there will be no heavy burden of tax.  The situation that Senator Lenihan has in mind is more likely to arise if there are young children but if there are young children then the amount of capital gains will be correspondingly less because the assets will have been held for a shorter time than in the case of, say, an older widow.  In the case of an older widow, say 55 years of age or upwards, if she has children there is a possibility and, indeed in Irish circumstances a probability that she will wish to pass on the assets to the family, and then sections 26 and 27 will operate.  If the widow is getting out of a particular line of business because it is inconvenient or because she has not got skills and she decides to turn over the assets into some other kind of business there will also be relief under the Bill, so most probable situations are dealt with.  I would not, at this stage, consider that the Government would be justified in receiving this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, we will watch the situation carefully.  I would not wish hardship to be caused.  We have abolished the estate duty code because it caused hardship and was inequitable.  We have no wish to be parties to any legislation which would repeat the mistakes which arose under the estate duty code primarily due to failure to adapt it.  If it had been modified, if the rates had been modified, if the thresholds had been modified over the years and if the avoidance aspect of it had also been remedied, then it might not have led to the great sense of public annoyance which it certainly provoked.  We must deal with the situation as we find it today, and that is why we are getting rid of the system and producing a <Col N="735" /> system which we consider is immeasurably better and will contain fewer cases of injustice.  Having regard to these facts, I must reluctantly inform the House that I am unable to accept the recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the great problems with this whole Bill is that the Minister's attitude to it is a kind of upside down one.  He keeps on saying that while the question of hardship may indeed arise&mdash;both from this side of the House and the other side of the House a large number of cases have been pointed out under which hardship could well arise&mdash;his answer is always; &ldquo;well we cannot allow for these cases which, admittedly, could arise because of the possibility of avoidance&rdquo;.  I should have thought that really what he ought to have done from the start was, while allowing for absolutely obvious patent cases of avoidance, in general have tried to draft this legislation in such a way that avoidable hardship would not take place and then see from experience if the Bill as drafted led to excessive avoidance.  He is saying; &ldquo;We cannot allow for cases of hardship because of the possibility of avoidance&rdquo;.  I should have thought that he should allow for such cases and see if excess avoidance could take place.  He is trying to allow in some cases rather esoteric possibilites of avoidance while, in doing so, disposing of efforts, which have been made from both sides here and in the other House, to try and avoid the kind of difficulty arising that Senator Lenihan has been talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are clearly many cases where a widow who has inherited a farm or a business would not be in a position to carry on the farm or business. The Minister cheerfully says: &ldquo;If she sells the business she can always put the money into another business and run it&rdquo;.  There are people who are not trained for this kind of activity.  It could be that a family solicitor would give strong advice to a widow that she would be very foolish to try to put the money she got for these assets into a business that she might lose her money and end up worse off than when she <Col N="736" /> started, that the only thing she could do with her background was to invest it so as to derive an income from it. There are both widows and widowers who are not, by training and inclination in a position to carry on businesses or farms.</P>
    <P>There are many such cases, In such cases the provisions of this Bill could be a hardship particularly in view of the Minister's provision that the date for the assessment of the value for gains purposes may go back even generations.  It is quite clear that in the early years of this Bill the amount of gains that can arise will be very limited.  I do not know what income the Minister expects to get this year. It will probably be none or £100,000 or so.  It will be negligible but I should have thought this might be a good time to start off with a relatively equitable and generous Bill, at a time when quite clearly very large gains will not arise.  In most cases it will tend to be losses rather than gains, even allowing for the effect of inflation.</P>
    <P>He could start on this basis under present circumstances with a relatively generous Bill and not lose money.  He has an excellent opportunity in the next year or two to assess how the thing is working.  This is something new.  He could keep an eye on the avoidance aspect and make such provision as is required, but he is doing it entirely the other way around.  He is trying to stitch in to every section of the Bill all kinds of obscure and complicated provisions to deal with possible avoidance.  In doing so he will undoubtedly cause considerable hardship to a variety of people.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that they will keep an eye on the hardship aspect.  What will the definition of hardship be?  I am not suggesting that a person would be thrown into the bankruptcy court by this kind of provision.  Widows will suffer.  The money they could usefully spend for their own living purposes or for the education of their children will go to the State.  Whether that in a particular case is hardship or not I do not know.  I have a feeling that the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners in assessing hardship might have a higher standard than the ordinary man in the street.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> A widow will suffer loss under this that she ought not to suffer.  She may not suffer hardship in some cases in the Minister's or the Revenue Commissioners' sense of the term, but nonetheless she suffers a loss in that assets which she might well have felt would be inherited by her free of capital gains tax will become liable to, in some cases, considerable sums of tax.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to accept this recommendations and, in particular, that he ought to look upon this legislation from the point of view of the taxpayer rather than the tax gatherer on the basis that all these problems of possible avoidance could easily be assessed and considered in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In conclusion, there is very little more I can say.  I accept that the Minister is making his argument in good faith.  In this area involving a widow, involving what we suggest should be done for her in this recommendation before section 27 and also as she is involved in inheritance under section 14 of the Bill, the Minister says that he and the Revenue Commissioners will look at it in a pragmatic way over the next few years and come in with amendments if any inequities or series of inequities reveal themselves.</P>
      <P>I do not think that is good enough. Surely, as Senator Yeats has just said, in a Bill of this kind the better way to approach it would be to incorporate in the initial legislation what is seen to be fair and just both from the Revenue Commissioners' point of view and the taxpayers', and then if there are any loopholes manifesting themselves then it would be the Minister's duty to remedy the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That applies particularly in the area with which this recommendation is concerned.  This is an area where, in my view, there will be no great revenue loss.  The money involved in my recommendation is infinitesimal as far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned.  We are talking about a widow, it could be a widower, who has inherited an estate which involves a farm or a family business of a small <Col N="738" /> kind, to which her husband has given his time and skill over a long period of years.  The widow in 90 per cent of cases has not devoted any time to the running of that farm or business.  She now finds herself in a situation where she has inherited a farm or a business about which she knows nothing.  We are suggesting in that case that the threshold in regard to capital gains tax should be at £100,000 in the event of her disposing of the property with a view to securing some money whereby she can go elsewhere, restart her life with her children and educate them to the best of her ability.  It is that kind of human situation which is so obviously designed to be met by this recommendation that I feel could be met by the Minister at this stage. There is no point in waiting for three, four, five or six years to remedy that kind of situation.  It is a practical day to day occurrence.  All I am saying is that if the widow disposes of the property for a consideration of under £100,000 there will be no capital gains tax element in it as far as she is concerned.</P>
    <P>As I said in introducing the recommendation, it is totally in line with the thresholds the Minister himself has brought in in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill and in the Wealth Tax Bill, although that is rather a separate area, but I will concentrate on the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill where the threshold for that sort of internal transfer between husband, wife and children is set at £150,000.  In that type of situation and as that thinking is there already with the Minister and is enshrined in his own Bill which we will have after the vacation, it occurred to us that we were just being logical in proposing that we should push the principle a degree further to cover all cases where the wife, after the death of the husband, decides to dispose of the property for the reasons I have mentioned.  That is the most valid threshold of all, because she is obviously again, in 90 per cent of such cases, disposing of the property for the benefit primarily of her children.  It is the type of case where a woman unable to cope with business or farm decides to dispose of either <Col N="739" /> one or both in the interests of her children for education purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again this is a matter for the Minister to incorporate in an amendment of the recommendation we suggest, because obviously when an amendment of this kind is put down what we are talking about is a matter of principle.  I would have thought there would have been a response from the Minister along the lines he mentioned where there would be obvious exclusions written into it, but fundamentally what I am talking about is a widow who has to dispose of farm or business and who does so for her own reasons but more particularly in the interests of her children. That is not just a hypothetical case. It is a case that arises month in, month out.  It is the Minister's job, I would say respectfully, and that of his officials to devise exemptions from that principle such as the one he has just mentioned, which is an obvious one, if there is a remarriage.  Of course there is basis for an exemption in that case, although again that would be an arguable matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic principle is the hardship involved.  It is not good enough to wait four, five or six years for this to manifest itself.  It is the practical case that I just mentioned which will constitute 90 per cent of the cases where a widow will be disposing of farm or business in the circumstances I have just mentioned.  It would surely be logical to exclude any transaction where the consideration was under £100,000 from capital gains tax. With inflation running as it is, it is not an extraordinary figure.  It is the figure that is being taken as the norm under wealth tax.  A figure ahead of that again, £150,000, is accepted as the norm in the inheritance tax Bill, the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill.  We are talking about a very reasonable proposition.  I would certainly suggest to the Minister, if he is not willing to <Col N="740" /> take it on now, which he has stated, that he should not wait for experience over the years to manifest itself.  We all know how that sort of experience percolates through the bureaucratic machine and will eventually arrive on the Minister's desk for incorporation in a Finance Bill about five years after the hardship has manifested itself.  That is the way the machine operates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I would suggest to the Minister is that, having heard what has been advocated here in the Seanad, he might grasp the nettle himself before the actual injustice manifests itself.  We will probably have a Finance Bill in October and another one in December or January, but, at any rate, there will be plenty of Finance Bills in which the Minister will be enabled to incorporate an amendment in accordance with the recommendation here. I appreciate that the Minister has set his mind against adopting this recommendation but he will have ample scope in Finance Bills in the immediate future to incorporate a recommendation in amendment form along these lines and not just wait on the inequity to manifest itself.</P>
      <P>The inequity, as I have just mentioned, is going to manfest itself over a period of five or six years, and eventually it will be incorporated in either a Finance Bill or a Capital Gains Bill in six or eight years' time.  That is the sort of thing we do not want to happen. We suggest in all friendship and fairness that the Minister might have a hard look at it himself between now and his next finance measure and introduce an amendment or incorporate it in a section of a Bill something along the lines of this recommendation, which I feel has arguments in its favour.</P>

    <P>In page 74, paragraph 11 (1) (d), after &ldquo;clause (a), (b) or (c), to insert &ldquo;other than shares quoted on a stock exchange&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will recall that a number of Senators, including Senators FitzGerald and Russell, raised the question on paragraph 11 of Schedule 4 as to why there is a difference between that and a paragraph of subsection (8) of section 4 of the Bill.  I explained, as I will explain again, that we were anxious in Schedule 4 to relieve the purchaser from the obligation of having to make inquiries regarding whether or not shares were quoted.  The shares with which we were concerned here were shares in mining interests.  The reality is of course that people who have interests in those shares are well-up or their advisers are or, as some prudent person said to me, if they are not well-up they should not be dabbling in such shares.  I think this is a case where the burden can be shared between the vendor and the purchaser.  On that account in response to the representations which were made here I have tabled this recommendation which I trust will be acceptable to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Recommendation agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I will say briefly on this matter may involve a certain amount of repetition of what I have said already on the various Report and Committee Stage amendments and what has been said by Senators Ryan and Yeats.  In principle, we agree with the capital gains tax.  There is no question of that.  It is a form of taxation&mdash;and we have said this&mdash;that exists in every European country.  Apart from that, some form of capital gains tax is obviously necessary in our community.  However, where our strong criticism arises in regard to a measure of this kind involving a new form of tax is that <Col N="742" /> sufficient imagination was not displayed in regard to various matters. A proper balance should have been struck, in our view, between the Revenue necessities and justice being done to the taxpayer.  It is important to ensure that in the fundamental document, enshrining a new form of taxation, which is a document that will subsist and will be amended from time to time, but will be the basic taxation document, there should also be enshrined the basic principles that should exist in any good piece of legislation, the balance between the exigencies of the Revenue Commissioners and the equity as far as the taxpayer is concerned.</P>
      <P>The Minister has refused on a number of occasions in the Dáil and in this House to accept amendments which might have proved difficult for his officials to work out, but fundamentally they were amendments which no reasonable person could controvert as being amendments of principle and amendments that were in accordance with striking this balance.</P>
      <P>First of all we had the various amendments in which we sought to enshrine in the Bill some principle of indexation that would guarantee that the real capital gain would be the gain on which the tax would be paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill as reported from Committee does not incorporate the principle of indexation, and it is perfectly valid to discuss a fundamental matter of justice between taxpayer and tax gatherer that should be incorporated in this Bill, and it is on that basis that I presented it, not on the basis of its incorporation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might clarify my ruling by saying that the Senator is perfectly entitled to discuss the implications of the Bill without indexation, which is, in fact, what is now before us.  On the other hand, he is not entitled to discuss how this situation might be met, what other <Col N="743" /> sort of Bill might have emerged under other conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the nuance, a Chathaoirleach, but this is a Bill without indexation, which pays no respect to a fundamental fact of our time and one which will be a continuing fact of our time, that is, the existence of inflation.  Inflation has reached enormous proportions in the period to which this Bill now relates, the period between 6th April and now.  Hopefully, it will diminish, but it will always be with us.  I suggest to the Minister that the whole experience of monetary systems and economic situations of the whole world in our time lead one to believe the fundamental fact that inflation of one kind or another will always be with us.  It may not be of the mammoth proportions of the present time but it will always be there as a fact of life.</P>
      <P>In recognition of that, surely it would be appropriate that in this measure a provision to ensure that elementary justice would be done to the taxpayer should be included, recognising that the tax that he or she or the firm would pay should be on a real gain rather than an illusory gain.  It is not incorporated in this measure.  It would have been most appropriate at this particular time and would have been a recognition of the realities of our present situation and a recognition of the injustice involved in taxing people on a capital gain that in some cases could be non-existent, and in other cases would be only a portion of what the gain was alleged to be.  All of this adds up to a situation which is totally inequitable and out of tune with the circumstances of today and of future circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong to bring in here a measure that provides for a flat 26 per cent tax without recognition of the situation I am talking about when it could reach a figure of 100 per cent in real terms in the event of inflation. The gain could be non-existent but the 26 per cent rate of tax would have to be paid.  This is wrong; it is inequitable and indefensible.  I am being realistic about this; we are going to <Col N="744" /> be in that situation for a number of years to come.  It may not be so bad from the percentage point of view, but it could be from 6 to 8 per cent and upwards.  There will always be inflation in any economy that is expanding.</P>
    <P>We have entered a period of economic disadvantage because of our high inflation rate.  Some inflation rate will always be an endemic part of economic expansion.  Now is the time to do something about it.  The Minister has not done so in this Bill and in that sense it is a negative, backward-looking measure.  All we have here is a flat capital gains tax percentage increase.  There is no attempt to accommodate the Bill to the real requirements and fair play in regard to capital tax needs that will arise in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Similarly, there has been no attempt to deal with another problem which, again, in justice, should have been attempted, that is, the whole question of drawing a distinction between the quick capital gain by a speculator from a quick transaction and the capital gain that arises out of years of input by a man or a woman or a firm. The quick once-on, once-off type of investment, involving a substantial capital gain, should be taxed to the hilt.  There has been no attempt to provide some graduated, equitable system of tax on a gain resulting over a long period of years and coming down to one single year.  There should be some form of scaled tax that would place the highest tax on the capital gain over the shortest period, diminishing to a lower tax on an asset held over a long period of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is now tending to speak of alternative Bills.  He should keep to what this Bill says and does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill basically proposes a flat rate of capital gains taxation.  I am critical of the Bill because it is faulty in imposing a flat rate of capital gains tax, and ignoring the various manifold variations that exist in regard to tax-paying capacity and the equity in regard to tax paying within the whole area of capital gains. <Col N="745" /> It imposes a single, across-the-board, rate of tax on every capital gain transaction, irrespective of its merits and irrespective, in particular, of the period of years for which the asset was held.  It should be an easy matter to improve this. I can appreciate the Minister's difficulty in separating the wheat from the chaff, as it were, for separating the reasonable capital gain from the unreasonable capital gain.  The criterion of the number of years in possession was suggested.  That again was ignored by the Minister and he has stuck with this crude criterion of one percentage exemption of tax across the board irrespective of the particular section involved.</P>
      <P>The third main point on which I will be very critical of the Bill&mdash;and this is one that has already been referred to in the course of the recommendations here on Report Stage so I will not elaborate on it&mdash;is the lack of concern for the family situation.  There has been a lack of concern for family dealings, for the question of the inheritance under section 14 by the widow, for the question of the widow disposing of property for the needs of her family after death.  There has been a lack of concern for these two areas.  Senator FitzGerald, on the Minister's side, and my colleagues, on this side, have spoken on the lack of concern there is for this area, particularly in view of the fact, as Senator FitzGerald rightly pointed out this morning, that in certain cases the widow was better off under the old estate duty provisions now abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here again there should be&mdash;the Minister has guaranteed that he will look at the matter carefully, and I appreciate that&mdash;a very close monitor put on this area.  The amount of revenue involved in this area is infinitesimal.  We are dealing here with a widow within a limit of £100,000 acquiring assets and disposing of them for the benefit of her children, particularly for educational purposes. There is no concern in the Bill for that type of widow, or for the widow taking on inheritance under section 14 of the Bill.  This is an important area. Can the Minister advance to me substantial <Col N="746" /> revenue reasons why he should have insisted on the Bill as against the recommendation in this respect?  In my view, the revenue return in this area is infinitesimal.  I cannot see why the Minister has to wait for X number of years before the various injustices show themselves.</P>
    <P>On the general economic situation this Bill must be viewed in the pattern of the other Bill and the Finance Bill, Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill and the Wealth Tax Bill, and future Finance Bills that we are going to get in the autumn and in the winter.  The whole economic situation is bedevilled by pressure of Finance Bills and finance legislation.  This Bill, while a Capital Gains Tax Bill, if modified by equitable provisions, proper safeguards, in the areas I have mentioned, would be a welcome Bill in the ordinary course of events.  This Bill is not welcome (a) because it does not accord with the very criteria I have mentioned that would make the Bill human, fair or equitable and conform to the principles I have suggested in that respect and (b) because it does not accord with the whole financial climate in which we find ourselves when in fact the managers of our economy and in particular the managing director&mdash;the Minister for Finance &mdash;should be concerned about bringing in tax relief measures to stimulate and encourage economic activity, to draw and stimulate investment.</P>
    <P>The problem of 1975 is not the problem of getting greater redistribution of income.  That is an admirable principle if the cake is large enough, to effect a reasonable distribution of income, but in a year when the overall national cake is shrinking, when the gross national products will be down, what we should be doing is adopting measures in both Houses to make the cake bigger, to stimulate the economy rather than put it further into retreat.  Without taking from the fact that some capital taxation and financial measures are required properly hedged in by equitable provisions, I believe the timing of this package of Bills is wrong.  This Government's timing on so many matters has been so politically economically and socially crazy that it <Col N="747" /> defies description when one tots up the mistakes that have been made.  In a year when there should be expansion, when the economy should be stimulated, when incentives should be adopted to generate further economic activity, when all hands should be aboard to get the ship moving again, all they propose is this Bill as part of a number of taxation measures that are going to drive this economy into further depression.  The Government are creating a situation where investment will be deterred, where money coming in will be stopped, moneys already here will be encouraged to depart, where nobody is going to take industrial decisions that are required to provide the expansion to give the employment which is needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Lenihan has said, indeed as we have been saying all through the discussions on this Bill, we are in agreement with the principle behind this Bill.  We agree that it is wrong that very wealthy people, speculators, should be in a position to make a large capital gain without paying tax.  At that point which the Minister, when he introduced the Bill, made for it, we are in agreement.</P>
      <P>Where we case to be in agreement is in the numerous instances under this Bill where people who are neither very wealthy nor speculators find themselves liable to capital gains tax. Leaving these details aside for the moment, one has to say about this Bill that it is to a considerable extent irrelevant to the needs of the present day, and has been, to a large extent, a waste of time.  At a time when all the attention of the Minister and his Department and of members of the Oireachtas also should be directed to the very serious problems facing the economy, this Bill does nothing to help that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its present form, in so far as it has any effect on the economy, it is a negative effect in that it is likely in certain respects to hinder the development of business activities.  One could understand to some extent the amount of time that has been devoted to this Bill, the amount of time and <Col N="748" /> effort that the Minister and his Department have had to put into it, if at least one felt that at the end of it some practical result would accrue in helping to relieve the enormous budgetary deficit the Minister has loaded upon the country.  However it is quite clear that the revenue from this Bill this year will be negligible, perhaps non-existent, and that for a considerable time to come it will do little or nothing to assist the budgetary problems, so it does not need to have that to commend it.</P>
    <P>Leaving these general comments aside and coming to the details of the Bill, the greatest single deficiency in this Bill without any doubt is that it makes no provision for dealing with problems of continuing inflation.  We have had various undertakings from the Minister&mdash;and I think Senator Lenihan was quite right a short time ago when he pointed out that these undertakings have grown gradually less enthusiastic as the months wear on&mdash;to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister started off in the other House full of enthusiasm.  He was certain that it would be dealt with: he could assure members of the House that it would be dealt with; no one need have any worries at all.  But, as time has worn on, undertakings have been more and more watered down.  We have had rather sinister comparisons with income tax and suggestions that, after all, since you do not have indexing with income tax why should you have it with capital gains tax?  I do not think, on the Minister's present attitude, we need expect that whatever changes are made in the future by him they will do more than cover a small proportion of the mounting inflation which undoubtedly will continue, at whatever rate it may be.</P>
    <P>The second grave defect in this Bill is that in spite of efforts by our party to remedy the matter there is no difference at all between the rate of tax imposed on speculators, those wealthy speculators about whom the Minister was so eloquent when introducing the Bill, and on people who are selling their hard-won family possessions in order to meet <Col N="749" /> some temporary financial problem. There is no distinction at all between a person who has to sell his family business and the speculator, leaving out of account the proposals made for retiring at the age of 55 and so on.  These are special occasions: as a general rule there is no difference made at all between the taxation on a person who has acquired a business that has been built up by the family, himself and his father, perhaps his grandfather, over a period of 50 years or more, where the first sale takes place, maybe generations after the original acquisition on which the capital gain is assessed, and the wealthy speculator, about whom the Minister was so eloquent, who makes a very rapid capital gain because he happens to buy the right kind of shares on the Dublin Stock Exchange and three months later was able to sell at perhaps three times their value.</P>
    <P>We think this is wrong and inequitable because it means that people are being taxed who ought not to be taxed, or at least ought not to be taxed at the full level provided for in this Bill.  We feel that the wealthy speculators will continue to get away with murder, that they should be taxed more heavily than the Minister has provided, whereas on the other hand these people who in no possible definition of the term could be described as speculators are being taxed at the same rate.</P>
    <P>We also think that this Bill is wrong and inequitable because of the abandonment by the Minister of his original and perfectly correct decision in the white paper that gifts would not be taxable.  The explanation of capital gains to the ordinary man in the street is a simple one.  In years to come it will come as a great shock to many people all over the country who have been thinking of a capital gain as a sort of a profit that you make on selling an item, to find that a simple straightforward gift, where no money passes in most cases, will be liable to capital gains tax.  This is not what is known as a capital gain to the ordinary man in the street.  It is wrong that gifts of this kind, normally <Col N="750" /> within the family, should be taxed and it will come as a great shock to many people when they find out the full implications of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Lastly, we feel that this Bill is wrong because of the element of double taxation.  I know that in many spheres, import duties, VAT and so on, there is double taxation but there is no double taxation of quite this nature, where in many cases, on the making of a gift, for example, the donor will have to pay capital gains tax and the donee will have to pay capital acquisitions tax.  The two combined will in many instances come very near or even in certain cases surpass the death duties which were formerly levied and to which there was rightly objection taken by many people.</P>
    <P>These are very serious defects in the Bill.  While we agree to this Bill in principle, we feel the principle has been badly handled by the Minister. It has been considerably mauled, and what in its initiation contained a principle with which we could all agree, as it turns out from the Minister, with this extraordinary dedication he has shown to the closing of every conceivable loophole that might possibly arise, even though the closing of these loopholes has meant that many innocent people will suffer, is a bad Bill and one that will undoubtedly need to be very heavily amended in future.</P>
    <P>It is often said in legal circles&mdash;the exact phrase the Minister would know better than I&mdash;that it is better that ten guilty men should be wrongly found to be innocent rather than one innocent man should be found guilty.  The Minister adverts to this when he comes to tax gathering&mdash;he would rather have ten innocent people taxed wrongly than that one guilty person should escape the tax who ought to be paying.  That is a wrong attitude.  The Minister should take it the other way round.  If there is any chance at all that people will suffer, that people would be taxed in an inequitable fashion, he should take the risk, at least in the early stages, that the occasional avoidance may take place. So while we agree with the principles <Col N="751" /> of this Bill we cannot agree with many of the details in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like sincerely to thank Senators from all sides for their contribution towards the improvement of this Bill.  It is now well over two years since work began on the preparation of a new package of capital taxation.  It commenced immediately after the National Coalition Government issued their first budget in May, 1973, and, once the budget was out of the way, only nine weeks after assuming office work commenced on the preparation of a new capital gains code.</P>
      <P>Since then we had a hard-working two years in producing a Bill which objective and unbiased observers regard as a good Bill.  Even with a very good beginning, with all humility, we accept that in the light of experience it may be necessary to adjust it, to refine it.  But remember every time you proceed to refine any tax measure to deal with a particular situation you necessarily make the code more complex. There has been some criticism about the complexity of the Bill but this is necessarily so because the concept of capital gains is a difficult one and even more difficult to legislate for.</P>
      <P>Necessarily, a great deal of work in relation to these Bills is unrecorded publicly but I should like to take this occasion to express my appreciation &mdash;and in expressing my own appreciation, the appreciation of my fellow legislators&mdash;of the officials of the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the parliamentary draftsmen for the preparation of a piece of legislation which is uniquely difficult.  Every country has had this experience when initiating capital gains tax: of all forms of taxations it is probably one of the most complex because you are not dealing with a static, historically measurable element.  It is forever fluctuating at either end.  The different ways in which property can be held and the different human problems with which we have to try to deal means that the code has to be extremely complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" /> In these circumstances we have been very fortunate indeed to produce a good Bill in such a comparatively short period.  Of course we had the advantage of being able to study capital gains legislation and practice in many other countries, because as I have pointed out, all our fellow members of the European Community and literally every other progressive country in the world have had capital gains taxation for many years, some indeed since the beginning of the century, so that we had all that useful experience and we studied this very carefully.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the patient and painstaking contribution which the Seanad has made to the debate.  It might well be thought that at the end of more than two years' hard work in the preparation of the legislation it could not have been capable of improvement when it went to the Seanad.  Nevertheless, without doing violence to any of the principles of the Bill or the Government's approach to it, I am happy that we have been able to improve it and to send it back to the Dáil before the Dáil goes into recess so that the Bill can be passed as amended by Seanad Éireann.  I only wish that that would be possible in respect of other Bills which are to follow: perhaps it will, but that will depend on getting co-operation in another place.  I will not make any odius comparisons, but may I say that I thought the debate in the Seanad was excellent in all respects, and I did not pay that compliment elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I have been accused of having a pet aversion about avoidance.  Of course I have not, but in Government we have been concerned to eliminate the more scandalous forms of tax avoidance and evasion.  It is significant that today when this great debate is about to conclude we have the benefit of a report on the economy which has been commissioned by the European Economic Community.  This report recalls the facts that Ireland had many inequities in the taxation code, the most glaring of which was the absence of a proper code of capital taxation. The report recognises that the taxation <Col N="753" /> of capital gains as proposed by the Government will contribute to the equity of the code, and it also says that the other taxes which we will be discussing on another occasion, wealth tax and capital acquisitions tax, will make significant contributions.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, and I am sure all Senators are satisfied that the ingenuity of man will always exceed the speed of the legislator.  As in the past, so in the future: avoidance practices will probably be well ahead of the capacity of the legislator to prevent them.  So that must be some consolation to those who think that I am unduly unfair on the avoiders and evaders of taxation.  My great human desire is naturally to abolish taxation of all kinds.  Perhaps if we have oil flowing in a quantity similar to some fortunate nations in the Arabian Gulf we may some day be able to do that, to remove tax on incomes and on capital, but that situation does not exist and we must deal with realities. In any event, in a society which attempts to be just, there must be some distribution of the burdens of contributing to the national revenue.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that speculators are not affected by this Bill or that they are not sufficiently dealt with.  I would remind the House that speculators, people who engage in buying and selling of property for the purposes of their trade, are in fact taxable under the income tax code. They always have been.  Perhaps some have engaged in avoidance practices in the past and have not been paying their due share of income tax on profits from speculation, and perhaps their criticism of the Government's taxation measures is related naturally to their disappointment that the paradise they enjoyed in the past will not exist in the future, but the truth is that they will be caught under either the income tax code or the capital taxes code&mdash;in the future.</P>
    <P>The debate has been well worth while over the last two years, if only because it converted the Fianna Fáil Party.  It will be recalled that at the commencement of this debate, at their Ard Fheis they overwhelmingly supported a resolution which deplored <Col N="754" /> the introduction of a capital gains tax.  They have since then tried to overcome the mistake which they made on that occasion.  I would think that they were less than thoroughly convinced at times that they were right to change their minds, because some of their amendments would in fact have negatived the whole concept of taxing capital gains.  It is a good thing to see democracy at work and to see those who were originally unconvinced at long last becoming convinced that capital taxation is fair and necessary if the taxation code is to be at all equitable and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was trying to emphasise that we on this side of the House welcome this Bill for what it was worth, for the reasons that the Minister said, but on the other hand I was trying to emphasise the unwritten points that are attached to this Bill and the reason for such a Bill&mdash;the hardships that applied to the farming community last year, the degradation of the farming industry since this Government came to power, the humiliating state the farmers have found themselves in over the last two years and the vain efforts, indeed no effort at all that one <Col N="755" /> can see, by the Government to try to alleviate the problems in the agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>Agriculture is the primary industry, the number one industry in this land, or at least it used to be.  While it was viable and while there was confidence in that industry this nation's wheels turned very smoothly.  Since the agricultural sector got into trouble, and they are in trouble now, the wheels of the economy do not seem to turn as freely as they used to.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister in what way through this Bill does he or the Government make a positive effort to help those in the store cattle trade next autumn.  This day last year there were forecasts that the store cattle trade would be back to normal.  The difference this year is that the store cattle trade is far from back.  There is a very gloomy outlook.  Farmers who have borrowed money and who were enticed to borrow money to invest in the cattle industry have not been able to meet repayment commitments. I can see no effort at all being made by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to try to alleviate this terrible problem.</P>
      <P>I note in the Bill that the Minister specifically points out that a lot of money is being given to meat factories, £16 million divided between the merchants, the meat factories and the creameries.  I should think that after all the profits that were announced by the meat factories last year there is hardly any need now for the Agricultural Credit Corporation to be used to facilitate this section of the industry.  More than that, I would say the Minister for Finance and the Government should keep their eyes open and be alert to the people in the meat factories to ensure that the distribution of the EEC's money in intervention will be distributed directly to the producers in the meat industry this autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister any proposals to help those farmers who find themselves unable to pay back money borrowed in 1971, 1972 and 1973, particularly in the heifer scheme?  The Agricultural Credit Corporation made <Col N="756" /> a specific offer, which was accepted, over a five-year period to increase the stock numbers.  Previous Governments and this Government allowed and asked both the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the banks to help productivity in the store trade.  The end result was that people made investment in that trade then and even though the Government paid a certain amount of the interest on those loans, the loans have yet to be repaid in many instances because the profit margin expected from that investment did not come forth in the cattle trade.</P>
    <P>To go to beet and cereals, I would ask the Minister to ensure that for people who are investing in the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and indeed the banks, there is a guaranteed margin of profit at the end of the day after they repay their loans and investments. It is always being said, particularly in regard to the beet industry, that the guaranteed market and price is there.  Everything is guaranteed except one thing&mdash;the profit margin at the end was never guaranteed.  We have seen the beetgrowers taking a beating year after year, consistently, during the last few years and occasionally prior to that, yet nothing had been done to improve their position.  On the one hand you had growers and farmers who invested heavy money, labour and time in the beet industry. They sowed their crop and when they went to pay their bills found that not alone had the bank interest rate risen but their fertilisers and the other things that go into the growing of those crops had risen astronomically in price.  This was very evident last year and this year in the fertiliser section where I have seen merchants and producers of the fertiliser being allowed <i>ad lib</i> to make any margin of profit they wished without any check by the Government.</P>
    <P>Coming to potatoes, the situation we find ourselves in makes us bow our heads in shame that Ireland in 1975&mdash;with all the talk about agriculture and the Common Market, of guarantees by the Government to this little nation famous for its potato production&mdash;is in the situation of having to import potatoes.  Could the Minister <Col N="757" /> for Agriculture and Fisheries not have foreseen this?  He cannot say that he was not asked to do something. He was asked on numerous occasions.  I for one asked the Government, and indeed asked the Government prior to this Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Again, I must ask the Senator to confine his remarks to the question of agricultural credit.  He is now tending to go into details in regard to the question of one particular sector of the agricultural industry.  As long as he talks about agricultural credit he is quite entitled to talk about the fact that the condition of the industry calls for credit or affects credit already given, but detailed discussion of the situation, which would be more appropriate on a motion or in another place on an Estimate, is not relevant to the Bill before the Seanad.</P>

      <P>As is normal with me, I will abide by your ruling, but I would point out that in this Bill there is specific mention, and I will quote from the Minister's speech.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>A high demand for credit is likely to continue as farmers and food processing firms wish to increase their capital investment.</P>
      <P>It is on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not arguing the point.  I am just saying that the reference was made and the intention is in this Bill that we will now invest more money in food processing.  In so doing, we are giving away money that could be invested in this country to import goods, such as potatoes. This affects County Galway, where there is a potato processing factory. Before the Agricultural Credit Corporation invest money in the potato industry and food processing plants a positive policy regarding the growing of crops and profit margins should <Col N="758" /> be adopted.  Farmers should be guaranteed a profit margin on those crops in the same way as the repayment of loans is guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  Now is the time to have a critical appraisal of the potato industry.  It is time the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Government defined policy.  The approach, under the last regime and under the present regime has been incorrect.</P>

      <P>The Senator should listen to what the Chair has to say.  The Senator is entitled to place this Bill within the context of the situation in the agricultural industry. He is, therefore, entitled to make passing reference to agricultural policy, to conditions in different sectors of the agricultural industry but any attempt to discuss in detail conditions in agriculture or any attempt to discuss policy measures which are not policy measures within the control of the Minister for Finance are not appropriate on this occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I was never one to take up the time of the House nor do I propose to do so now.  I submit that if the Minister for Finance and this Government do not produce a policy, the time of this House will be taken up next winter, in the next eight or ten months, with a motion by me and other Senators on this side of the House asking the Government to come to the aid of the people who invest with the Agricultural Credit Corporation in the food processing industry as indicated in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would absorb a lot of money from the Agricultural Credit Corporation. The end result will be that we will not have the raw material or if we do have it it will be at an abnormal price which will not be profitable to the producer.  I, therefore, <Col N="759" /> will have motions before this House and will be delaying the business of the House.  That situation will be brought about by the situation being created today, that we are not allowed to give our opinion on this subject.  The potato growers are in a desperate state.  Consistently, over a number of years they have not been able to meet the demands of the public because they have not had a margin of profit on potato-growing. It is shameful that we should have to import potatoes from EEC countries. It is time the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries brought out a realistic policy to help the potato growers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a valid point. I submit to your ruling.  I do not want to delay the House.  It might be suggested in the national Press that I tried to delay the House on a matter of such grave importance.  The time of neither this House nor of the Dáil has been taken up discussing agricultural matters in the last two years. Can we say we had a positive debate on agriculture, on an industry vital to the national economy?  The Government have dodged the issues. Take, for example, today's Order Paper.  There are various motions on it from this side of the House in an effort to stop this decline that is being created by mismanagement on the part of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope the Agricultural Credit Corporation in their wisdom will learn by the petty mistakes of the past, that when they are making investments in the food processing industry they will ensure that the man who produces the raw material will be looked after first, that he will be guaranteed a margin of profit.  If there is not a margin of profit for him he will return to the dole office.  The small farmer feels a sense of shame in having to join the queue at the labour exchange.  Alternative arrangements should be made so that he <Col N="760" /> can be where he wants to be, out working his land for an acceptable margin of profit that will provide a living for him and his family.</P>
    <P>If the producer has not a profit margin he cannot repay loans.  You cannot get blood out of a turnip.  If the Government have not a positive policy which will enable farmers who borrow from the ACC to earn a profit how can they expect them to repay the loans?</P>
    <P>I have mentioned what happened to the store cattle, what happened to the lamb trade.  Sheep farmers will be giving ewes away if action is not taken. They will be sold out of County Galway for 2p and 3p a lb and 50p. Is that a situation we should tolerate? Is that something that this House and this Minister should tolerate in the case of farmers who are the finest and most noble people in this land?</P>
    <P>May I make a suggestion?  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries should give to the potato producer a production bonus of £1.50 or £2 per ton.  Consider what it would mean to the country.  Instead of spending money on imports we would be giving it to the people who are most in need of it.</P>
    <P>In welcoming the Bill with those few reservations, I would like to point to something else in the Minister's statement.  The repayment periods vary.  The loans to grain millers for grain purchase may be repaid within six months.  That is a very good point. Other short-term loans such as budgeted loans for seasonal farm operations are payable within 12 to 15 months.  Here I would ask the Minister to specify clearly what are classified as budgeted loans.  Loans for livestock run for five years, for land drainage for 15 years, for land purchase and buildings for 20 years. Loans for livestock, as I have said, run for five years.  Those who invested in 1972 are yet awaiting the day when they will be able to repay the money, even taking into account that this and the previous Government assured them that the interest on those loans or at least a portion of the interest on those loans, would be repayable by the Government.  Yet <Col N="761" /> they still find it impossible to repay those loans.  I ask that until such time as the store trade in cattle improves, this be carried by the Minister for Finance and that the time for repayment be extended in cases where farmers still find it impossible to repay. There are many farmers in that position, particularly in County Galway and counties on the west coast. They thought this was a good investment at a time when the cattle trade was very good.  I suggest that this aspect be considered by the Minister in consultation with the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>I would again ask the Minister to ask the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to delight this House with a new Bill that will guarantee a living on a small farm, so that farmers will not be driven to the dole offices.  If this Government of geniuses, as they are called, would spend a short time talking about agriculture they could come up with ideas which would be beneficial to the farming community and remove the shame that is coming on them.  We find ourselves importing potatoes while the farmers are in dole queues, unwillingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>The sort of speech we have just heard on the subject of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, if it were made at a local chapel gate or at a local IFA meeting I would not feel obliged to make the slightest reference to it.  Because he led for the Fianna Fáil Party I suppose we ought, according to Parliamentary procedure, make some comment on the things Senator Killilea said.  First of all, the Senator went through the various activities in the agricultural world, beef, dairying, beet growing, potatoes, grass and tillage.  It is remarkable that somebody who I am convinced knows something about agriculture, coming from a rural background and an agricultural area should have succeeded in convincing the House that he had not a single fact or a single figure or the slightest encouragement or optimism.  Anybody who at this time makes the sort of speech that has been made by Senator Killilea is a disgrace to the agricultural world.  It is the very sort <Col N="762" /> of talk that creates the wrong impression, discourages the people who need encouragement and misleads people who do not know the facts.</P>
      <P>I would like to say in connection with agricultural credit that there is nobody in this country that has done more to further the objectives of our national economy and for farmers individually, for co-ops and processing firms than has the ACC.  Time and again I have said that were it not for the facilities provided by the ACC there would be no opportunity for a developing farmer, a farmer with ambition and initiative, to make progress. The ACC have given a first-class service.  It is an organisation in which there are a dedicated group of people.  It is accessible to the ordinary farmer who knows and understands his business, who has a plan, who knows where he is going and what he wants to do.  Advice is available to him from experienced people from every part of Ireland in ACC House, people who know their business and who understand the particular sphere of activity in which a farmer engages, can give him advice and have a fair idea whether he is credit worthy or not.</P>
      <P>The organisation has become very big.  The service they give is growing daily.  There should be further decentralisation of the activities of the ACC.  Moves are being made somewhat slowly in this direction.  I would like to see in all major towns ACC offices in which most or many decisions could be made.  Through such offices the ACC could get in a large amount of much needed finance. A farmer who is in trouble and who needs money has to go to the ACC.  The ACC are the only group who can provide him with an answer and who understands his problems.  Yet if a farmer has money to deposit, even for a short period, I do not think that money ever finds its way into the ACC.  Decentralisation of live offices, not offices with just one person to give out information, offices with the power to make decisions could also serve the other purpose of getting finance from the people whom the ACC serves so well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> I should like to comment on some of the things that Senator Killilea said in regard to the beef industry. The store cattle producer in the West of Ireland and the relationship of this subject to agricultural credit.  Unfortunately there is no relationship there to agricultural credit.  The term &ldquo;small store cattle producers&rdquo; is contradictory because there should not be such a thing as a small farmer producing store cattle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Last winter people sold cattle because they were short of cash.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Finance provided facilities whereby those people could get loans at an interest rate of 9 per cent.  Farmers said that the rate was too high, that the loan should be interest free.  They forgot that they could make a guaranteed profit of 100 per cent and in many cases 200 per cent by keeping their cattle.  They did not avail of the 9 per cent interest loans.</P>
      <P>The point I am making is that agricultural credit does not enter into the life of these people because they are not prepared to think seriously on the subject.  These are the sort of people that Senator Killilea insists on representing here.  He would do well to speak for the farmers who use agricultural credit, who think about agriculture as a business and are in that business to succeed.  They are the kind of people we must consider if there is to be any future for agriculture and, indeed, for the whole economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Killilea blamed the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries for the plight of the pig producers.  There has been a very severe decrease in their production.  This happened in Northern Ireland and in Britain also. While we had a reduction in the region of 33? per cent, there was a much bigger reduction in pig breeding herds in the Six Counties.  This matter does not relate to the subject under discussion.  Are those who try so to relate it telling pig producers not to borrow, not to avail of capital because there is no certainly for the future?  That is the message the Opposition are putting forward.  That is not the message I would give.  The difficulty in the pig industry over the past three or four years is related to what the Americans call the &ldquo;hog-corn&rdquo; ratio, that is, the ratio of the price of meal to the price of pork. That is what decides whether we have a reduction or an increase in pig herds.  I can understand Senator Killilea laughing at certain agricultural <Col N="765" /> terms, because he knows nothing about the subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the previous speaker was making the point that farmers should not borrow and invest in the industry because the industry is unsound.  Having made my point about the pig industry, I should also like to point out that the people in the cattle industry who are borrowing at the moment for the production of beef are doing exceptionally well.  If a section of cattle producers have been hard hit it is the small store cattle producers in the west.  They do not have a problem of credit at the present time but I recommend to them that they should seriously consider credit.  To any farmer in the west who is producing store cattle at the moment the condition of the pig industry is an indication of what will happen to cattle.  It happened first in poultry; it is happening now in pigs and it certainly will happen in beef, that only the efficient producers will survive.  It is the people who are determined to survive when everybody else has gone, that we should recommend to avail of credit. They are the only kind of people who have a future in any industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small store cattle producers in the west should be borrowing money. The day of the three-, four- and five-year old bullock has gone.  He should take his cattle to the end where he can sell them to the factory and get whatever profit is available.  Otherwise he will always be subject to fluctuations in price.  There can be a good price for beef and stores being given away.  There can be a good price for pork and bonhams being given away.  This will always be the situation where one section, without any commitment from the other, puts itself in the hands of another section. This is what has happened in regard <Col N="766" /> to pigs and what is happening now in regard to cattle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that everything in the garden is rosy with regard to agriculture.  There is a lot of concern at the present time.  It is all related to the question of finance and planning.</P>
      <P>It is significant to recall that in the 'sixties there was an annual increase of 1.2 per cent in our agricultural output.  This was the second lowest figure for any country in the EEC. The Netherlands and Britain had something like an increase of 3 per cent and 4 per cent respectively. Deputy Mark Clinton was not Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries during that period.  Another party was in power.  Only half-way through the 'seventies the situation, in spite of all our difficulties, is no worse than it was during the 'sixties.  I am confident that given the same team in control, the same Minister for Finance and the same Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, there will be a completely different story at the end of the decade than existed in the agricultural world at the end of the 'sixties.</P>
      <P>I know that certain things give rise to concern.  The 5 per cent reduction in the national breeding herd over the past 12 months gives rise to concern. Here is a drastic reduction in the application of fertilisers.  This also causes concern.  As Professor Séamus Sheedy said in an article written last week&mdash;nobody knows more about the subject&mdash;the causes are very difficult to pinpoint.  I agree.  The subject certainly requires much more careful consideration and a much more responsible approach than that which is being proposed by the Opposition here today.  The people who give credit, the people who give advice, should prepare a realistic policy for agriculture, not only at national level but at the level of the individual farmer.  There has been a serious lack of planning in agriculture and a lack of effort to restructure holdings. There has been a lack of long-term planning by individual farmers with the advisory service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has gone a long way towards remedying the situation by his new proposals in the white paper and the Minister for Finance is going a long way to remedy some of our problems in his attitude towards the whole business of agricultural credit.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation are doing a magnificent job.  I want to see them doing an even bigger job in the future.  I want to see them facilitated in every way and I do not want to hear the same pessimistic lampoon that we hear from the Opposition every time the subject of agriculture is mentioned.  I do not want people scared away from availing of agricultural credit.  I want to see responsible farmers availing of credit.  If they do this, there will be a future for agriculture.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I start off by congratulating the Minister on bringing this measure before us.  All of us should have a deep interest in agriculture and in agricultural producers, those people who work so hard, in particular the small farmers.  We all admit that it is one of the most difficult occupations for any person to engage in.  Since we have not got five-day cows and defined working hours, there are enormous difficulties involved that do not pertain to any other type of industry or profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture accounts for a significant percentage of our economy. Everything we can do to further the agricultural interest will in the long run pay handsome dividends.  Therefore, we should all be deeply concerned with this measure.  It is only fair to say that down the years the Agricultural Credit Corporation have done a great job.  They have agents in most counties.  They give out money <Col N="769" /> when a plan is submitted to them, when it is approved and examined by experts.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I feel that in the past&mdash;I do not know what the position is at present&mdash;they gave very large sums of money to well-off farmers, but it was very difficult for the small farmer with five or six cows to get a loan.  I agree with Senator Killilea that if we continue with a policy such as that, it would mean in the end that the transitional farmer would be wiped out.  That would be a very sad day for agriculture.  We have the development farmer and the commercial farmer, but at the bottom we have this small man, who has been the backbone of national production over the years.  Indeed, comparing his acreage and so forth with the bigger and better-off farmers, he, in the past, produced much more tillage and more cattle.  Consequently, we should be very concerned about the amount of money the Minister for Finance will make available here, particularly having regard to inflation in the last 12 months which was in the region of 26 per cent.  The sum sought might look a big figure now, but when you compare it with previous increases and with the purchasing power involved, it might not be half as significant as people might be led to believe at a casual glance.</P>
    <P>I notice somewhere in the Minister's speech that roughly £16 million of this went to merchants, meat factories and granaries.  I suppose these are more or less directly concerned with farming. They would probably not be in existence at all but for the farming community. Some of them are owned by farmers.  Not all farmers or producers are in co-ops.  Neither are all the farmers in the IFA.  There are certain farmers who have remained on their own, who work as family farms.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how any Minister in 1975 could include meat factories in the amount.  We had the sad experience last year of the IMP and even the co-operative owned meat factories who fleeced the farmers, their suppliers. Let there be no doubt about it. The private meat factories did it.  The factory owned meat processing plants made up to £60 per animal.  Very <Col N="770" /> recently I heard the Chairman of Clover Meats adverting to the amount of profit they made last year.  They did not even blush when asked how they made so much money, nor did they seem to have any conscience regarding the poor producer, the man down on the farm in the backward part of Ireland who was forced last winter to take out his cattle and sell them at a loss of £60 and indeed give them away.</P>
    <P>In one sense I do not blame business people for trying to make as much money as possible.  That is what they are in it for.  I am sincere when I say that, while the co-operative meat factories have to exist, they took over some of the plants to show the private individuals how to run them. Some of them came along to the fairs and markets of Ireland and bought cattle at £10 a cwt, brought them to the meat processing factories and got intervention prices of up to £19 per cwt.  They are crying and whinging today in many places about the decline in store cattle, saying the small farmer in the west of Ireland, in Donegal, Monaghan, Cavan, Galway and Mayo, should still keep producing store cattle, so that these people can come and buy them for nothing, or take them away, bring them up on the rich lands and make a profit again.</P>
    <P>The sum of £16 million has tremendous significance.  Does the Minister feel that it is a fair allocation to these people in view of the millions they took off the producers last year?  I see no justification whatever for it.  It would be better if that £16 million was readjusted and given out to those small producers, which is their just due, even given out in loans, to encourage them to increase their livelihood and to expand.  We are now in the EEC and while the commercial farmer and development farmer may get all the big grants, these traditional producers at the bottom will be left out in the cold. The day that happens will not be good for agriculture, for the economy, and for the nation as a whole.  These people will have to move out of these areas and houses will have to be provided <Col N="771" /> for them in other areas.  This will cause congestion and problems so far as schools and houses of worship are concerned.  I ask the Minister and the ACC to consider that very carefully. Creameries get grants out of this, too.  Many of them help in administering this scheme.</P>
    <P>The time has now come for us to have another look at some of the stuff we are producing.  It seems that in the EEC countries, in particular, there is a mountain of milk powder.  There is no use saying in 12 months or two years that we were not warned of this. After all, the signs are there, and an efficient Minister of Agriculture should be advising the Minister for Finance and the ACC the best way to allot the funds available here to ensure that we will not find ourselves with a glut at the end of two or three years and unable to dispose of the finished product. If we cannot sell the finished product, there is no use in our producing the article.</P>
    <P>Loans can be given for buying livestock. It is a very good thing to do.  I do not want to say anything here that would injure the confidence that people engaged in agriculture should have in the industry.  However I have no hesitation in saying that there will be no confidence whatever in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and in the present Minister for Agriculture because of the way agricultural fortunes have fared in the last 12 months.  In 1973, when this Government came into office, a dropped calf was selling at £70 and now you can buy them for 70p.</P>
    <P>These are the facts to face any farmer, in particular the small producer. How in the world can anybody ask those people to go back into livestock and produce calves at that ridiculous price?  It would not pay for the AI fee. In fact, the AI fee is about three or four times that at present.  As can be seen from the returns last year, there is a downward trend all the way.  The cattle population is falling.  The pig population is falling.  The sheep population is falling.  This is happening in a country such as ours and at a time when every one of these should be <Col N="772" /> expanding.  That is what the ACC money should be used for.  But we will not get the people to borrow this money if they find out that, having done so, they find themselves in the sorry position that they are not able to repay the loans on that, when they have done that, they will have no profit whatever at the end of it.</P>
    <P>It seems, too, that money could be borrowed here for expanding pig production. My county was a traditional county for producing pigs as well as, Longford and Leitrim.  Pig production has finished completely in Monaghan and Cavan, except for a few big units. The ordinary people, who had five, six and ten sows are gone out of existence, because of the price charged for feeding stuffs, because the right markets were not available abroad and the right drive was not behind it. I blame completely our Minister for Agriculture for that, because, having obtained through the EEC the right to sell, we cannot fulfil even our quota in the British market.  That is a scandalous situation, especially for counties that were traditionally pig producers, producing the best pork and bacon, not alone in Ireland but I am sure in Europe.  Our factory in Cavan then and even yet produces the best sausages, beef and pork in Ireland.  Farmers in those counties, who have the piggeries built with the aid of grants, have no pigs housed in them.  They know of the disastrous situation in the past.  It is very hard to get these people back into pig production.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture should be able to infuse confidence into any community.  He and his officials should see that the markets are available. It is hard to have confidence in the Minister when we see the position in the sheep industry at present, with pickets outside the French Embassy in this city protesting about the French attitude towards Irish lamb.  They did not tell us that the Minister for Agriculture went across to the EEC and was a party to allowing Australian lamb into the British market and that it is being reshipped over here.  If they want to put on a picket the right place to put it is outside the British <Col N="773" /> Embassy or some of these other places but certainly not outside the French Embassy.  The French were buying our sheep and were paying for them. This is the type of bungled thinking that is going on in regard to agricultural outlets.  It will confuse the people who really should benefit from these loans.</P>
    <P>So far as the pig producers are concerned, except for a few units, their livelihood has been snatched away inside of the last three years.  The bottom has fallen out of the cattle industry and there is no use anybody saying otherwise.  We are well into the month of July now, when farmers will be selling off their cattle.  What are the prospects?  Will there be an intervention price this year?  How will the consumer be protected?  Will those meat factories take the traditional £60 profit on every animal?  What is the Minister doing about it?  Has he appointed any inspectors to go in and see that these people, who borrowed money under the EEC or otherwise, will be protected inside the closed confines of these meat factories where all this fleecing is done?</P>
    <P>It is high time the Minister for Finance, who is handing out this money, had a chat with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  He should ask him where this money is going and what benefit it is conferring on those people.  It is not mismanagement on the part of the farmers.  The whole rot is at the top, let there be no doubt whatever about it.</P>
    <P>Money can also be borrowed for farm equipment and for seeds, grain and fertilisers.  This racket of fertilisers is tremendously important.  It has bedevilled the whole situation, particularly last year.  We had a dry season this year and most of the farmers were unable to buy fertilisers. They could not buy them because they had gone through a disastrous winter and losing all they had in the flop of the cattle sales.  But it has been stacked up in many of the co-operatives and trading houses around the country.  The price was chaotic.  It would not pay any farmer to buy fertiliser at that price unless he was <Col N="774" /> a millionaire and could survive for two or three years without making any money whatever.  So far as the small farmer was concerned, he could not avail of it.  It is very important to provide money to buy fertilisers or subsidise them in one way or another. At present they are left lying with the merchants.  Whoever is concerned will have to rethink because they will not be sold.</P>
    <P>There are some loans available for farm equipment.  There are parts of the country where farm machinery is needed for spreading farm manure. It is very costly.  The ACC should concern themselves with that, or some of these designers might be able to design some type of smaller machine with which the farmer would be able to spread any farm manure around the place rather than having to go to the co-operatives and other merchants to buy expensive fertilisers.</P>

They, I <Col N="775" /> am quite sure, as a very intelligent people, having experienced over the last two years the chaos that has existed in the whole agricultural sector, must now be firmly convinced that there is a great difference in having Fianna Fáil in office when they could get £70 for their calf and having Fine Gael when they will sell a calf for 70p.  It is not nice for anybody to have to say things like that on an agricultural instrument.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Brien will get his chance when I am finished, if he wishes.  I will try to listen with interest to what he will have to say. Perhaps he might tell me why the Minister of Agriculture allowed New Zealand lamb into the British market, why they put on a picket on the French Embassy and these various things instead of paying attention to the things that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has wide experience of travelling around capitals in search of money.  I hope that he will get this £9 million extra that is to be got here to borrow to make up the £55 million because, apart from any other sector, I would like to see him coming home with the £9 million in his satchel, let him get it from the Arabs, from a leprechaun or whereever he gets it, as long as he brings it home here and as long as it is used for the benefit of the farming community. So far as his colleague, who will be using this money, is concerned it is a great mistake when he is out in Europe, that he has to pal along with the British Minister for Agriculture. In doing that he is hobnobbing along with probably a very decent man, but a man whose aim is completely and diametrically opposed to what our Minister should be looking for.  He is looking for cheap food for the British people.  We should be looking for a decent price for our food.  That is the difference.  Therefore, in providing this money it would be no harm if he had a little word in his ear sometime and tell him to keep away from the British Minister for Agriculture and when he is abroad to speak for the Irish <Col N="776" /> farmers, for the small farmers in particular and for these people who are working hard in these backward places under very difficult conditions, and see to it that any money that comes back from the EEC for the benefit of the farmers will not go into the rich, deep, long pockets of these meat factory owners and these other people who are benefiting from agriculture at the expense of the producers.</P>
    <P>I mentioned something regarding the sheep industry because it is of vital importance in many areas.  There are many areas here where there is a fair concentration of people, where the terrain, soil and climate are suitable for sheep rearing.  Here is an area where a great deal of expansion could take place if it was handled in the right way.  There are many areas in this country where the forestry people are keenly interested in acquiring land.  The Minister for Finance should also have a chat with them and tell them that in many instances much of that land could be used for sheep farming.  I know that in Norway and other countries they have planted long thin strips up the side of the mountains and left hundreds of acres in between.  These shelter belts help to improve the quality of the grass and indeed raise the sheep population that can be maintained on mountainy land in those places.  These are out own people.  They work hard and produce nice lambs for these people who like two dinners during the day and often the producer maybe has none.  They like to get paid a reasonable price for doing this.  They like to see that their sheep population are treated well, that there are proper facilities for having them dipped.  All these things could be provided.  They are things that the small farmers are keenly interested in in this area.  How many small farmers in some of these sheep producing countries would be interested to know how a man would be treated if he came into the Agricultural Credit Corporation and said he wanted to buy a hundred or two hundred ewes? Perhaps if he was not speaking in thousands he might not get any grant at all.  If that is the situation it would be very wrong.  Sheep farming is important to our economy and, of <Col N="777" /> course, we have the wool and the byproducts that flow from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  On the whole this is a very interesting Bill because, as I said, what is in mind is very creditable and certainly very necessary.  I sincerely hope that it will have the desired result of improving the standard of living of the farmers in general, and that the ACC will ensure that people will avail of these loans. Many people here were not inclined to take up loans.  The small farmer, in particular, had a kind of built-in idea in his head that loans were bad things.  Indeed, many people still believe that.  I cannot say that the Government have that belief, because since they went into office they have borrowed more than any Government since the State was founded.  Perhaps their thinking might percolate a little bit down through this.  There are certain types of farmers who if they could be induced to accept these loans, and if the interest could be made attractive, it would benefit the nation in the long run.  If we have not these people there then we will not have any agricultural industry and there will not be any need for the ACC.</P>
      <P>I listened to Senator McCartin. While I have the height of respect for what he says he made some references to some statements that were made by my colleague, Senator Killilea.  I expected that he would contradict him but he did not.  Perhaps he may have forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government can point out a lot of these anomalies and can tell us what should be done but they end up by doing nothing.  Let me say, in conclusion, that I am glad that this Bill has come before us.  I sincerely hope that it will do something for the farmers in general.  We have a motion down here on the Order Paper regarding the plight of the farmers.  Many motions pertaining to agriculture during the year have been deliberately by-passed because the climate was not favourable to the Government.  They <Col N="778" /> did not like us to mention anything so far as agriculture is concerned.</P>
    <P>Many of them have gone a little haywire today because this appeared on the Order Paper and some of us made reference to the chaos, uncertainty and lack of confidence that pertains in the agricultural industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is not easy or nice for any of us to have to say these things.  We would like to be able to ensure that people would have confidence, and I believe myself that there is a great future for the whole agricultural industry and the whole agricultural outlook if it was handled in the right way.  We have the personnel there.  We have a good Department of Agriculture. We have excellent agricultural officers and COs down through the country and we have agricultural instructors who visit the farmers and instruct them as best they can and so on, but the important thing as far as the whole exercise is concerned&mdash;and this Bill illustrates it&mdash;is that we would have somebody at the top who would have confidence in himself and a little ability not alone at home but abroad.</P>
    <P>I know that the present Minister for Agriculture had been in charge of his own farm, but that is a different thing.  I do not say that he does not know something about agriculture, but from experience and from the experience of the Irish farming community in general we can say he has been the greatest disaster that hit this country for the past 50 years.  There is not a farmer in this country but will remember his name, I am sure, as long as they remember the name of Cromwell.  They have been wiped off the face of the earth in many places because of his bungling and his mishandling of what should have been a reasonably easy job.  We had excellent Ministers for Agriculture in this country in the past both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.  But I am not saying that in a personal way so far as he is concerned, but criticising him as a Minister.  If he were moved to some other Department he might be a success, and I believe that if he did move to some other Department, <Col N="779" /> whatever welcome might be afforded him in the other Department, I do not think there would be any tears shed for him in leaving the agricultural sector so far as his ability is concerned.</P>

      <P>I will confine myself now to the Bill itself.  I as a person involved deeply in agriculture want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Agricultural Credit Corporation for the wonderful work they have been doing all down the years, and the <Col N="780" /> members of that corporation for the efforts that they have put into the agricultural industry, and I would also like to congratulate and to thank those area officers that they have placed throughout the country.  They are a credit to the corporation, and any time I made representations to them I was received courteously.  If the case I had put to them was a good case then they helped me in every way they could, and if there was no credit to be given they pointed out the reasons why help could not be given and I was satisfied.</P>
      <P>I would like to say something about the investment in the Agricultural Credit Corporation which I do not think was mentioned.  To give credit we must also have money invested, and my information is that the investment in the corporation by other than the banks has been very poor. I do not know what the reason is for that.  Is it that it is not properly advertised or is it that we have not enough centres, as was stated, throughout the country.  I just could not tell you, but we as an organisation of creamery managers do our very best to try and get across to the people, to the farmers especially, that by investing in the corporation they would have many little benefits out of that corporation.  I believe in this and we must get it across to the people concerned that they must invest in the Agricultural Credit Corporation. More investment is needed, and by having more investment more money will be spread throughout the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know, if at all possible, what percentage of the investment has been supplied by farmers themselves and what percentage of that investment has been made by the industry.  I am talking about the dairy industry, the meat industry and the provender industry. All of them have gained by low-interest loans on terms agreed by the ACC and the industry itself.  There are times when the section of the industry I have been talking about could themselves invest in the ACC, and when they see their final annual accounts it should be put to them that <Col N="781" /> there should be an investment by the industry itself in the corporation.</P>
    <P>As a member of the dairying industry I want to say thanks again to the ACC for the help they have given the industry I am involved in, because the dairy industry is one of our most important industries.  It is an industry that by development in cattle, in cows and the production of milk and the development in the industry itself can gain substantial finance for this country. Most of the extra produce that will be produced and processed will be exported, and if we can gain that type of extra produce, have more to export and get more money back into the country by those exports, then the country will benefit and all concerned will be gaining, whether it is the worker in that industry, the producer or the farmer himself.</P>
    <P>We would like to know what more we could do to help the ACC.  In the dairy industry here in Ireland we reach a production peak in June and we are very slack four or five months in the year.  Farmers need to obtain fertilisers and feedingstuffs, and thanks are due to the co-operative movement, who all down the years supplied interest free credit to the farmers.  They supplied credit from October, when there was very little milk, up to April when the milk began to flow into the creameries again.  The dairy industry have that type of system because the farmer demands every penny he can get for his milk.  Some farmers try to get the last fraction of a penny out of the industry.  This is bad.  We must allow for some investment by the farmers in their own industry.  We must allow for the interest we pay back on loans obtained from the ACC or from other bodies.</P>
    <P>Some system should be arranged whereby both the ACC and the co-operative movement would work together so that the farmer would obtain credit from the ACC from October until April to purchase fertilisers and winter feeds, which could be paid back to the ACC from deductions in the monthly farmer's cheques.  If a low-interest rate could <Col N="782" /> be given, such a system would be beneficial to the dairy industry and to the farmers.</P>
    <P>Although there is legislation to prevent them from doing so, I think the ACC should be allowed to purchase from abroad.  Money is available from other countries at much lower interest rates than would be available here.  If the ACC were allowed to purchase this money at this low rate they would be able to give credit to the farming industry at a cheaper rate.  Everybody concerned would benefit.  This Government should examine this and see if anything could be done in this regard.</P>
    <P>There should be some person at management level in the dairying industry on the board of the ACC. It would be difficult to put a total value on the industry, but the turnover is in the region of £600 million. With that kind of turnover it has a large stake in the agricultural industry. By having a member from that section of agriculture on the ACC board, a lot of information which is not available to the board could be made available to them.  If that were not possible, perhaps the president of the IAOS, who is very familiar with the industry and with terms of credit and so on, should represent the industry on the board.  It would be a good day for the industry if that occurred.</P>
    <P>The dairy industry has developed over the past five or six years very rapidly.  The investment by that industry has been substantial.  We should not stop there.  We should develop it further.  It is the one industry where the farmer knows what he will get in return for his produce.  He will get a monthly payment.  It may be necessary for that industry to approach the ACC for further loans for its development. The ACC, I am sure, would look at it in the light in which I have described it, as an industry which needs further development.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has urged the farmers in the west of Ireland to get involved more deeply in the dairy industry and produce more milk.  If it is necessary to obtain <Col N="783" /> credit to purchase the stock that produces that milk I am sure that ACC will not turn a blind eye.  The ACC know that the agricultural industry can be developed further.  If an application is made to them they will examine it in the proper context.  There should be more communication between the industry and the officers of the ACC.</P>
    <P>There has been no reference to the obtaining of loans for the purchase of land.  All that is allowed is 10 per cent of a maximum of £10,000 for the purchase of land.  There are cases where a farmer might need to consolidate his holding by buying a small farm which adjoined his farm.  I have approached the ACC on behalf of this type of farmer and I did not get a very favourable hearing.  The ACC are bound by a certain clause which does not allow this to happen.  If we wish to increase agricultural production we must have the proper type of holding. We must have a holding capable of producing milch cows and also the fodder to feed them.  This cannot be done with a small holding.  If the ACC would change their rules and allow this type of farm to be purchased to consolidate the small farmer, they would be doing a good job.</P>
    <P>It may be difficult because the danger is that if the ACC give money in large amounts to farmers to purchase land, then the price of land will escalate.  When the ACC are looking at the purchase of land they should be advised by the local agricultural officers in the light that it would be of benefit to the farmer who would purchase this land with the help of the ACC.  It should not create a national situation where the price of land would escalate.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the farmers themselves to have confidence in the future.  I see the future as very bright. My advice is to ask farmers now to purchase the store cattle that are available.  We will be very sorry in the early months of next year if our population of cattle is reduced substantially. If we allow this to develop then it is a bad case.  What is making this develop, I think, is the scare-mongers <Col N="784" /> that are there, and we have them here in the Seanad.  We must bring back confidence and the only way we can bring that back is for people who are involved in industry to convey the message that the future is good.  I can hear people standing up here in six months' time and saying the farmer cannot purchase stock because they were too dear.  They were too dear a few years ago, and that had an effect afterwards.  If the scarcity I see coming comes then the stock, especially small stock, will be very dear.  Again it is the small farmer that will lose out, because the small farmer will not be able to buy them.</P>
    <P>The small farmer should now be looking at the future and purchasing whatever he can.  With loans from the ACC and the help of the co-ops, they might be able to draw up some agreement that would allow the small farmer hold over his stock until the spring or before the spring comes, because cattle and all other animal stock will be very costly.  I pity those people who cannot afford and will be trying to buy them.</P>
    <P>Again on the dairying industry, I would ask those people in different areas of Ireland not to get worked up because the price paid by one creamery is not the same as that paid by the others.  One of the reasons for that is that the development of this industry did not take place all at once. Some areas developed very quickly and other areas, because of amalgamation and so on, developed much slower and then developed all of a sudden.  Finance was needed and credit was given by the ACC and by the banks, but the interest on that credit had to be paid back.  If those farmers who are crying out for the last pound of flesh or the last fraction of a penny insist on getting that, it will be the downfall of their industry.  Even though in the society where I work, the top price in the country is being obtained there is still demand on the management for another penny or another halfpenny.  Why, I do not know, but that is the way it goes.  A farmer likes to take it all and probably does not understand the financial investment, but these are farmers <Col N="785" /> who, you would imagine, should know about it and often speak on television about the industry and ask why they do not get this, that and the other.</P>
    <P>I would congratulate the Minister for introducing this Bill increasing the borrowing power of the ACC from £120 million to £220 million.  It will give everybody that extra confidence in the ACC.  I would imagine it will also allow the ACC, if a proper case is made, to be freer with the loans, and maybe an arrangement could be made with the dairying industry to introduce the system I have spoken of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackGarrett" hpid="Mr. Garrett Mr. Garrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill also, as I believe that the ACC at present are in need of an adequate amount of money to make available to the farming community.  At present the farming community are going through a very hard time.  The small farmers in the west are practically up to their necks in debt, both to the banks and the ACC, owing to the advice they got some time ago to borrow money from the ACC and increase their stocks.  It is right for us to look at this in two ways.</P>
      <P>If the ACC have plenty of money to give out in loans to farmers, will the farmers have to borrow in order to exist and keep their heads above water?  They cannot see at present, unless some miracle happens in the agricultural industry, how they are going to pay back those loans.  Are they going to be afraid to borrow? Any more money the farmers in the west borrow is going to be an extra milestone around their necks.  As the agricultural industry is, they have no hope at all in the foreseeable future of repaying the loans they have already got either from the banks or the ACC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We see that in 1972-73 £28 million was provided and in 1974-75 it had risen to £56 million.  That is an obvious thing to happen after the golden years of 1971, 1972 and 1973 when you could sell one calf at £75 or £80 a head and go out and buy 4½ tons of fertiliser.  At present or up to a few weeks ago we had heard of calves being given away for £1 at the calf market.  A neighbour of mine <Col N="786" />&mdash;this might seem funny to some people but is a true story&mdash;went into the Ballina mart with a calf.  He sold the calf for £1 and he went to the Royal Café for his dinner and paid £1.25 for the leg of a chicken and two potatoes.  It is very easy to laugh at those things but that is a reality. He went home and his wife met him in the farmyard and she said: &ldquo;Well, what did you get for the calf?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;It was a good job you gave me the pound going to the market because it cost me an extra 25p to buy my dinner as well as the price of the calf.&rdquo;  The result of that was that he could not even have a drink with the man who bought the calf from him because he was afraid he would not have the money.  About a week after that he had reason to send for the AI service and the man came into his yard and asked him what type of calf he wanted.  He said he wanted a Friesian calf but he also wanted to know how much the service was going to cost him.  The man told him it would cost £3.  &ldquo;But my advice to you, my good man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Is not to bother.  You will pay £3 for the service and you will have to give the calf away for £1.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the sort of thing that happened in the west as a result of the collapse in the price of cattle and the debts which the farmers incurred. Not only had they a loss on cattle but when they tried to manure their lands last year they found it was impossible because the price of 10.10.20 and other fertilisers had risen to about £100 a ton.  There will be no significant increase in our cattle stocks in the future because the farmers engaged in the store cattle trade are unable to pay that fabulous price for fertilisers, and expect to make a profit on a few store cattle.  There will be few store cattle produced because the farmer will not have enough grass to feed them.  The possible will be impossible for him unless he borrows money from the ACC thus putting a noose around his neck.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out in the Minister's brief that the deposit scheme has been very successful and is highly recommended to investors: <Col N="787" /> deposits at present attract a 10 per cent interest and carry the guarantee of the Minister for Finance.  I do not care if they carry the guarantees of two Ministers for Finance, there is no farmer in the west of Ireland today in a position to go into the office of the ACC and to lodge money because they have not got it.  Some years ago when my office was beside the ACC office there was a stream of people going into that office to invest money. Now the only people going in there are those seeking to borrow a few pounds, and if they fail to get it they get in touch with me to see if I can help them.  The ACC will give loans for advance purchasers and for the improvement of buildings and equipment. These account for 45 per cent of the ACC advances in 1974-75.  They also give loans for family settlements.</P>
    <P>I had a case a fortnight ago where a young man who owned a farm married a young lady with a much larger farm and went to live in her place.  He wanted to hand over or to sell his own land to his brother, who was living in the house.  He was willing to sell that land and the house, with all amenities, to his brother for half its market value.  He wanted to borrow only £5,000 as a family settlement on his brother and the ACC refused to lend him that money.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his speech, said that the ACC provide loans for family settlements.  That man I am speaking about would have about 20 or 15 years to repay that £5,000 and as he is a young able-bodied man, willing to work hard and improve his holding, he would have no difficulty in repaying the sum in the time.  The Minister should not include statements of this kind in his speech when I can prove that such transactions do not take place.  I refer him specifically to the case I have mentioned.  If the Minister wants any further details of it, I will be glad to supply them.  He should use all his influence to ensure that this man will get the money he requires for the settlement of the land and property.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that money had been provided for the purchase <Col N="788" /> of breeding stock at a low interest rate from June, 1972 to June, 1973.  That was the time all the agricultural advisers were telling farmers to borrow money to increase their stocks.  The farmers did this in all good faith because they trusted the Government in office.  But by the end of 1974 they were not able to sell their cattle&mdash;they were not able even to give them away.  Far too many store cattle had to be retained on the land.  Cattle were being brought to the market day after day but were being brought back again because there were no buyers for them.</P>
    <P>It is no use to say that they were allowed to buy feed on vouchers. There were only some select farmers who were allowed to buy feed that way.  Unless a man was totally dependent on his agricultural output he did not get vouchers for animal feed. Everybody knows that the majority of the small farmers in the west of Ireland are unable to exist solely on the output from their farms.  They must obtain part-time work from the ESB, the county council, or Bord na Móna in order to eke out an existence. These men did not qualify for vouchers in order to feed their cattle because they are not full-time farmers. Many of their cattle died.  I know of one man who lost 23 cattle during the winter.  He was unable to feed them, and a member of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals came and took 23 cattle off his land. He was fined £25 in the courts for allowing cattle to wander out on the road.  But he had no grass to feed them and he had to do this.</P>
    <P>Some of the members of the Mayo County Committee of Agriculture were reprimanded by the Press because they suggested that the Garda should turn a blind eye towards cattle grazing on the long acre, alongside the roads.  These farmers were unable to repay their debts to the ACC and they were in a bad way.  Those debts are still outstanding.  I ask that there should be an easing of the terms of repayment for the small farmers.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a compliment to the ACC for the way they are dealing with these people.  The small <Col N="789" /> farmers in the west of Ireland are badly in need of help.  They are unable to meet their commitments to the ACC, but the ACC, as far as I know, do not contemplate taking any legal action against them.  They have given the farmers opportunities of repaying their debts to help them to keep going until such time as they are able to clear their debts.  But at the rate things are going, it will be a long time before they are able to do this.</P>
    <P>If the Government had some long-term plan put forward by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries such as has been done by other governments, and if the farmers could be given a guaranteed price for their produce, regardless of the state of the market, it would be of considerable help. Farmers should have guaranteed prices for their products for three or four or five years ahead.  They should be in a position to know what it will cost them to produce their foodstuffs and cattle.  They should be guaranteed a certain percentage of profit.  The farmers would then know where they stood.  They would know what they could borrow from the ACC, they would know what they could pay back and what period these repayments would cover.</P>
    <P>We are just waiting for some miracle to happen that will save this country from disastrous bankruptcy.  Unless that miracle happens in the near future, we will become known abroad to be in a very bad financial state and we will find it extremely difficult to borrow any foreign capital.  I do not expect a miracle to happen in the next few months, and it is going to be God help the farmers during the coming winter.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt the hay that has been got this year is of fine quality, but there is very little of it. There has not been enough hay, silage or other feeding stuffs produced this year to carry the stock of cattle that are on the land, even through stock did drop by something from 5 per cent to 6 per cent in the last ten months. The farmers will be forced to kill. They will not have the banks nor the EEC to try to borrow money from to buy feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>As I said before, it will be another <Col N="790" /> millstone around their necks unless the Government in the very near future, preferably before the recess, put a long-term agricultural policy before the farmers&mdash;the ranchers in the midlands and the small farmers who produce the store cattle in the west.  If that plan is put forward, it would give confidence to the farmers to make some effort to carry on the No. 1 industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope that the farmers will be able to make more use of it than they did last year.  I do not see any reason why the ACC should give money to the meat processing plants.  That is absolutely ridiculous.  Something like £16 million is to be given to merchants and meat factories and creameries.  I do not know what percentage of that £16 million is to go to meat factories, but at the rate people got paid for intervention beef, they made no money &mdash;it was the meat factories that made it.  It was very lax of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the so-called Government of geniuses not to have made some effort, with all the Bills, to produce one scheme that would give the EEC money for intervention beef back to the small farmers or those who produced it, rather than given it to the meat combines and the co-ops.  The result is the small farmers have lost confidence in the Government or in the Department for Agriculture and Fisheries who should give them a decent life and help to educate them for the future.  In present circumstances farmers in the west are more interested in finding out where the next job is to come from.  After they do 26 weeks in that job, they then can go on the stamp money, and from that to the dole.</P>
    <P>This is a Government for handouts, and unemployment.  They are afraid to face up to their responsibility. They should govern for employment, for agriculture, for the welfare of the State rather than for handouts in social welfare services. To try to find votes in such a way is despicable.</P>

      <P>The one word that seems to be running through the debate from all sides of the House <Col N="791" /> is &ldquo;confidence&rdquo;.  It is either a lack of it, as initiated by the Fianna Fáil side, or an ample supply of it from this side of the House.  Senator Garrett referred to the policy on agriculture, and I will later, in my short contribution, quote from the Common Agricultural Policy of the EEC passages which are relevant to the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is a confidence by a section of the community which through the agencies set up by this Government availed of credit facilities which are financed by investors, who themselves have confidence in the industry: otherwise they would not invest in it.  They also have confidence in the ACC which have under section 3 of the Bill, ministerial guarantees for repayments by borrowers. Investors, who this year invested more than £25 million in the ACC, also show this confidence in this industry, unlike the gloomy picture that has been painted by the other side of the House, particularly by Senator Killilea, who led for Fianna Fáil.  All speakers from the other side usually like to use Deputy Mark Clinton as a whipping boy.  The Minister is well able to defend himself in relevant debates on his Department in this House as he did quite recently, as Senator Butler said, on a debate on a motion of confidence in the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Killilea, like everyone else involved in agriculture, knows that the EEC has not been a bed of roses.  Any benefit which the farming community <Col N="792" /> have had as a result of Ireland's entry into the EEC has had to be fought for inch by inch by the Minister, and often with very little support from his colleagues in Europe, who have aligned themselves with the Gaullists, who have been referred to as French stoppers of our exports of lamb.  The Minister has had a lack of support from other members and other countries who have been particularly quick to break the rules to suit themselves.  The French, as I mentioned, have closed their doors on several occasions to imports of Irish lamb.  Considering that Irish exports of lamb make up only 4 per cent of the total imports of lamb in France, which imports a total of 75 per cent, it is not extraordinary that a small agricultural exporting country has the tremendous problem of trying to compete with very big industrialised nations in what is known as a Common Market but perhaps does not function as one.</P>
    <P>This is the reason why at times Irish meat exporters depend largely on intervention systems as a market, and not as a market saver as intended by the Community.  Other factors, such as the monetary compensation allowance, the difficulties of adopting farm modernisation schemes to farmers in Ireland, and the insufficiency of capital from Brussels to initiate an effective disadvantaged areas scheme &mdash;all these have brought about new challenges to Irish farming, side by side with the disadvantages which our farmers did not foresee when they voted so overwhelmingly for EEC entry.  I am not saying there would not be greater disadvantages had we remained out of Europe.</P>
    <P>However, our farmers have to face challenges in the changing of techniques and of skills, changes in farmers' planning as initiated in the farm modernisation scheme.  Long term planning is now necessary.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, Irish agriculture in the past had not been tuned to long-term planning, and because of this all these new demands and challenges have brought a tremendous need for an adequate supply of funds.  That is why I welcome this Bill.  It ensures that adequate funds will be available <Col N="793" /> to farmers with confidence.  If the Opposition were responsible in their contributions to the Bill, which they welcome, they would endeavour to instil confidence, not just quote complete balderdash.  If you say something often enough, no matter how untrue it is, some of it sticks.  If farmers are not given confidence by their legislators from any side of the House, the ACC in their efforts to put up this money will have had a wasted effort. Confidence must be instilled if the farming community are to avail of the additional money available for livestock, fertilisation of land, improving farm buildings and equipment, for the purchase of seeds and fertilisers and all that.</P>
    <P>This Bill ensures the giving of permission to the ACC to increase their borrowing powers by £100 million over the 1973 figure.  I have no doubt they will be able to acquire this extra money from their investors and that any pessimism generated by the Opposition will be proved to be unfounded when further improvements can be gained in Brussels by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, who, as has been proved on several votes, commends the utmost confidence.</P>
    <P>There is possibly some sense in what Senator Killilea said about giving some form of stimulation or assistance to the producers of vegetables particularly in our coastal areas, not alone potatoes which are traditionally grown in those areas.  As I mentioned in a previous debate in this House, the possibility of assisting people by way of incentives in those areas would ensure that ample supplies of vegetables, including potatoes, would be made available by people who have the facilities and the land available to grow them, thereby ensuring an adequate supply of vegetables, not alone for home consumption but also to assist our food processing plants and bringing down to a more sensible level the price of these foods to urban dwellers who cannot produce them.</P>
    <P>The only reason potatoes were allowed to be imported into this country was to assist the processing factories, the fish-and-chip industry which provides a very substantial <Col N="794" /> amount of employment, and to bring down prices to a realistic level to urban dwellers.</P>
    <P>It is relevant at that point to refer to the Common Agricultural Policy. It is relevant to what has gone on the record here today in connection with out attitude towards that particular product.  Although 96 per cent of the Community farm production is covered by regulations under the Common Agricultural Policy, there are important sections which are not yet included.  These include potatoes, mutton, lamb and wool.  As regards agricultural products outside the farm policy, national Governments may apply their own policies for managing the market.  Wool and lamb have been dealt with, as I have said, by the attitude of the French.</P>
    <P>Senator Dolan talked about imports of lamb from New Zealand, and I would refer him to 1st February, 1973 &mdash;make note of the date please, Fianna Fáil&mdash;when Britain, Denmark and Ireland introduced the Common Agricultural Policy subject to transitional arrangements until the end of 1977.  Special terms for New Zealand dairy products and Commonwealth sugar imports were incorporated in that accession.</P>
    <P>The production of potatoes in this country in 1972, which was the last year in which Senator Killilea and his colleagues had control, was for Ireland 1,250,000 tons, in the UK, 6,544,000 tons and in Germany 15,038,000 tons.  The reason I mention these production figures is that the home consumption per head of the population in these countries are, for Ireland 123.1 kilograms per head, in the UK 101.6 and in Germany 101.8.  So Germany, with a production 15 times as much potatoes as Ireland, uses less of them.  We are the highest consumers of potatoes in the Common Market.  We are one of the lowest producers and we are second only to Russia in the consumption of potatoes.</P>
    <P>So for the economics of this country, the growing of vegetables is very important, and the stimulation of growing them by facilities to growers I hope will be available through the ACC in this Bill.  An incentive of this <Col N="795" /> kind from the ACC for the purchase of seeds by lower rate loans would have the desired effect and would help to balance the lack of potatoes at this time of the year.  This lack of potatoes just now is because of the drought, and I do not think it is entirely fair to blame the Minister for the drought. If we were facetious we could claim credit for the fact that it rained this afternoon and that it rained a month ago when it was almost too late.</P>
    <P>I also heard the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries last year being blamed for the shortage of animal feedstuffs owing to the bad weather, but this is the first time I have heard him being blamed for lack of potatoes because of fine weather. However, I commend the Minister who is in the House now for the policies he has initiated.  I was surprised when reference was made to these financial changes, which were more than overdue for some 16 years.  I heard somebody who usually speaks for the small farmers suddenly weeping for the large farmer, the £100 valuation boys.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for initiating this enabling Bill and I am sure it will get the approval it deserves in this House.  I have great pleasure in giving it my approval.  I hope the community which it is intended for will be treated, as in the past, with fairness and sympathy by the ACC in their applications to them for credit and finance in what is agreed by every one of us as a most important section of our economy.</P>

I have been to ACC House on many occasions and I was treated with the height of civility and respect and, in fact, was successful.  I have not met a defaulter in my area.  I had one application that was not successful but if it was left to myself I would have had to turn down the applicant.</P>
    <P>I do not know why there was so much heat generated here between the different sides of the House.  It was amusing to watch it.  When you are voting a substantial amount of money, as we are doing today, whether one is on the Government side of the House or the Opposition side it is not only a privilege to criticise but it is one's duty.  I would not be doing my duty if I did not say how I felt about the agricultural industry in my part of the country. There are a few in this House who would remember the flax industry. About 80 to 100 years ago in the town of Monaghan alone there was £5,000 per week and half that amount in Castleblayney town paid out in gold and silver for flax.  It was a substantial amount of money in those days.  That industry went and it had to be replaced by the pig-and-poultry industry.  The pig industry is just not existing at the moment.  About one-third of the poultry production of the State is carried out in County Monaghan which is the reason the producers there call themselves chicken growers.</P>
    <P>Potatoes were a very good cash crop.  On the farm where I was born we could always sell these potatoes at the proper time of the year, from Christmas on.  That industry is gone. There was another cash crop, ryegrass, as Senator Dolan would know. The small farmers could look forward to getting the £5 per cwt for it.  It was sold back to them after it had been processed.  The farmer thought he had a contract but he had nothing of the kind; he had only an understanding which went by the board very quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I only wish I shared your view.  I do not think I will go back to my humble habitation and ask the people there to accept what you have just said.  If all our problems were as easily solved they would be solved long ago and there would be no trouble.  One thing I do like is that you can invest money now with the Agricultural Credit Corporation tax free at 10 per cent.  That is to be welcomed.  I have grave doubts that people invest sufficiently in this fund. There are offices in various areas and I would hope to influence my friends to invest, as I did personally, in the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  The agricultural community should do so. It would be much better invested in the ACC than elsewhere where the small investor is paid about 2 and 2½ per cent less than the large investor. The bank interest rate is so much on deposits up to £5,000, so much interest on deposits over £5,000, so much on deposits over £20,000.  The ACC and the Minister and the Department are very fair in that they give a reasonable return on money invested.</P>
      <P>Every Senator knows from the news media that the intervention money did not reach the farmer.  Did it?  I have yet to meet one whom it reached.  It went to the factories all right but it did not reach the people for whom it was intended, that is, the producer. There are a terrible lot of liars in the country if it did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest offender, I regret to say, were the co-ops that were supposed to be the saviours of the race. Somebody may deny this.  I hope they will be able to do so.  They would be better orators than I am.  I do not claim to be an orator.  I am just a mob orator.  That charge was made and it has never been denied.  I cannot expect the Minister to be responsible for all these things but I do claim the right to make it known, at least, to <Col N="798" /> bring it to the notice of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the general public who are entitled to know these things.  I cannot understand why, when money is made available from the EEC a system cannot be found by which it would be distributed.  The income tax collectors go out with horse, foot and artillery.  They bring home the money.  They would drive you to an early grave.  But when it comes to distributing money a way cannot be found.  A child in third standard would be able to do it. I welcome the Bill.  It is a pity that the money involved is not substantial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamWhyte" hpid="Mr. Whyte Mr. Whyte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Whyte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to record my support for the Bill.  I am glad to note that the Bill has the support of both sides of the House.  This is only right and just because the ACC has been doing a good job both during the term of office of this Government and indeed for many years before, during the previous Government's terms of office. It has been doing a very useful job and it has been the main source of credit for farmers.</P>
      <P>Some of the criticism that has been offered from the other side of the House has been fair criticism.  It is the job of the Opposition to offer criticism&mdash;constructive criticism, if possible&mdash;and most of the criticism made has been constructive.  I doubt if Senator Killilea was serious when he seemed to suggest that the ACC ought to have invested some money in rainmaking machinery.  Unfortunately that is not possible.  It is not fair to criticise the Government for the weather we have been having which had such a serious effect on the production of potatoes and vegetables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very encouraging that the limits have been raised from £120 million which was appropriate in the past to £220 million.  This shows that the Government and the ACC have the necessary confidence in agriculture and are aware of the need for large-scale investment in agriculture.  Never in our history have there been such big changes in agriculture as there have been over the last 15 or 20 years.  Ten <Col N="799" /> or 15 years ago the same farm equipment was being used as was in use 100 years ago.  Nowadays farming equipment is replaced very often.  If we are to keep abreast of modern developments we must have the finance to ensure that agriculture will be as progressive as it is in any other country. This costs money.  Farmers who were not in a position to go to banks had to depend on the ACC.  The ACC have done a good job.  My experience has been that the farmers who availed of credit from the ACC, if they were not good farmers, became good farmers as a result.</P>
    <P>The ACC's policy has been to ensure that money lent in this way was used productively and sensibly on proper projects.  It was not necessary in many cases to suggest a particular type of farming but there are cases where, if money is readily available people will take it and perhaps not make the best use of it.  It was the ACC's job to ensure that the money they lent was properly used.  The only way they could do that was to take the advice of the advisory service and to ensure that a proper plan was drawn up for the farmer.</P>
    <P>Farmers often used the wrong type of credit.  Many farmers used credit from the merchants from the time they sowed their grain until the harvest.  While it was a useful type of credit and was availed of in a big way it was not the cheapest type of credit. Very often those farmers could just as readily, if they had a proper plan drawn, have had the facilities of the ACC to carry them over lean periods. From now on credit facilities will be more and more necessary.  The farmers who have availed of the ACC, to equip their farms properly, to instal proper machinery, provide buildings and the right type of livestock, are reaping the benefits of properly laid plans.  It will be necessary in the future to continue to do that. It may even be necessary to increase the size of herds.  It is not always the man with the large acreage who is best off.  Very often the man with small acreage who manages properly is better off.  The monetary content <Col N="800" /> on farms is very high and many farmers have to seek credit from the ACC.</P>
    <P>It is a two-way picture.  It is useful to have the ACC to lend money to farmers, but it is also necessary to farmers to realise that the ACC have to get money to make it available to agriculture.  There are many farmers who could readily invest some of their money, even on short-term, with the ACC.  Not alone would they get a good return but they would be helping the industry and helping their neighbour.  The ACC lend a kindlier ear to the farmer who has an investment with the ACC.  While he may have a small amount invested just now he can be in a position to get a larger loan.  This is the type of two-way policy I would like to see carried on.</P>
    <P>While there is a welcome advance from £120 million to £220 million it will have to be increased very much more.  If farmers in general examine the use made of moneys borrowed from the ACC in the past they will realise that it was the more farsighted farmers who borrowed and that those are the farmers who are progressing.  The ACC have done a good job and I am sure they will continue to do so with the support and co-operation of the farmers.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Seanad for the manner in which they have discussed this very important measure.  If some Senators were tempted to drift away from the specific measure which is dealing only with the provision of agricultural credit, at least it was an instructive debate if only to instruct me on the depth of&mdash;I do not use the word offensively&mdash;ignorance which some Senators appeared to display on matters agricultural and upon the causes of particular difficulties. Weather, climate have a very important effect upon agricultural budgets. Perhaps that is something that Senator Killilea would like to learn something about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Killilea thinks they will be all laughing.  One of the matters perturbing the Opposition is that they somehow feel that there is an election in the air.  They have all been rehearsing their campaign speeches.  I want to assure Senators that they are wasting their breath at this stage.  They would want to start contemplating what they might be saying in 1977 or 1978 and refrain from talking about the golden sunshine which Ireland enjoyed in 1975 which caused a temporary difficulty in the potato market.  I look forward to hearing Senator Killilea's speech in Tuam in 1977 when I am sure even he will be lost for words of criticism of this Government for what they, in the interval, will have done for agriculture.</P>
      <P>Senator Killilea seemed to suggest that the Government had been neglectful in relation to the price of fertilisers and foodstuff prices.  It was difficult to determine at some points of his contribution whether he was on the side of the consumer or the producer.  He knows that world factors determine the price of fertilisers in this country the same as anywhere else.  We have the option of paying the world prices or going without.  As far as this administration are concerned we will not ask people to give up using fertilisers. We will let them have the choice as to whether they want to buy fertilisers or not.  We believe that is the proper course, and that is why the National Prices Commission does not control fertiliser prices as such although they continue at all times to review the profit margins made by the producers and distributors of fertilisers and if these are seen to be excessive then corrective action will be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to remind Senator Killilea that for the first time in our history, in 1973, the Administration of which I have the privilege to be a member introduced a guaranteed price for potatoes.  They provided a <Col N="802" /> floor price for potatoes below which the price of potatoes could not sink. This guaranteed all producers of good potatoes that no matter what happened to the market the State would arrange to buy in the potatoes at the floor price.  That was a very significant guarantee to potato growers who knew at the time of sowing the potatoes that they were assured of a certain price.  I therefore have to rebut on behalf of the Government and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in particular the criticism which Senator Killilea was tempted to indulge in because Ireland has had some unique sunshine this year.</P>
    <P>Senator Killilea asked me to deal with the question of the budget loans. He accepted that short-term loans should be related to the production cycle itself.  He also approved the six-month period for millers and so forth so that they could purchase the grain when available and pay for it as they sold it off.  That budget loan system operates within a season.  It might run something like this.  I quote from a sample sheet which was issued by the Agricultural Credit Corporation:</P>
    <P>15th October 1974, store cattle for wintering, a loan of £4,000</P>
    <P>1st November 1974, fertilisers, a loan of £700</P>
    <P>14th February 1975, seeds, fertilisers and fuel oil, £900.</P>
    <P>That is a total loan of £5,600.  The repayment of that money would arise thus on the sale of cattle, which might take place on the 30th April, 1975.  The £4,000 cattle loan would be repaid and the proceeds of the harvest, which might reasonably be assumed to be for the year ended 31st October, 1975, would yield £1,600, plus, of course, profit.  There would be profit, of course, on the sale of the cattle also.</P>

      <P>We are greatly touched by the immense faith which Senator Killilea and his colleagues have in the almighty power of the Government but we recognise that in agricultural production in particular the laws of nature have a very considerable impact.  They can cause considerable loss in profits, unfortunately.  Until such time as we harvest everything under the roof in air-conditioned buildings, which would be rather costly, we will have to continue to experience those booms and those disappointments in agricultural produce west of the Shannon and anywhere else under God's good sky.  I was giving the dates which indicated that within a year, which would be the normal cycle, it would be within a farmer's capacity to repay.</P>
      <P>Senator McCartin and others referred to the need to decentralise the activities of the Agricultural Credit Corporation both to get cash from the farming community and also to have local needs understood by local officers.  I am sure he is aware that the Agricultural Credit Corporation have been diversifying their activities.  They now have a large number of local offices outside of Dublin.  At a rough count, I think they have 23.  They even cater for Senator Killilea and those who like him may feel that the world is full of disappointments and hardships and that no help is available to them, because, as Senator Killilea recognised, there is a fine office very well staffed in Tuam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was decentralisation of decision making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to decision making the local offices have wider powers now than they used to have, but they are related to the size of advances and the particular activities. When major advances are involved obviously the decisions have to be taken at headquarters.  I would like to assure Senators that, from my own personal knowledge, I know that no decision is taken at headquarters without <Col N="804" /> having very full discussions with the local officers and also, where circumstances require, with the applicants for the loans.</P>
      <P>Before I leave the point that Senator McCartin was making about the need to attract funds from farmers &mdash;Senator Whyte and others made the same point&mdash;I entirely agree.  It is disappointing that the percentage of depositors with the Agricultural Credit Corporation from rural areas is only about 30 per cent of the total number of depositors.  This is disappointing considering that the Agricultural Credit Corporation advance all their moneys to the agricultural community and get only 30 per cent from that community, whereas the private banking system get more from the agricultural community than it returns to it.  In fairness to the private banking system the fault does not lie entirely with them, but that is the situation.</P>
      <P>Clearly, if the Agricultural Credit Corporation were to multiply the number of offices throughout the country their administrative costs might rise beyond a point which the traffic could bear.  That, of course, would then have to be recovered in higher interest rates from the people borrowing from them.  One has to try and strike a balance.  There is a branch of the ACC in every letter box and if a person wants to deposit money through the post then the ACC will receive it.  The people who deposit with the ACC get quite an attractive rate of interest compared with other interest rates.  Today they get 10 per cent and tax is not deducted.  That ought to be of interest to the farming community, in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dolan and others questioned the placing of loans with meat factories.  Perhaps he was also querying the granting of loans by the Agricultural Credit Corporation in what might be regarded as an industrial or quasi industrial area.  I would like to assure the Senator and his colleagues that the ACC are mindful of their prime duty to make funds available for strictly agricultural activities. Where major sums are involved in what might be regarded as downstream agricultural activities they consult <Col N="805" /> with the Industrial Credit Company. Obviously it is difficult to draw the line between what is an agricultural and an industrial activity.  Even where the ACC advance money for food processing, whether it be a meat factory, a dairy factory or anything else, the principal benefit will go to the original producers who put their products into those plants.  Care is being taken to ensure that the ACC funds are not eroded by too great advances in areas which might fairly be regarded as industrial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely funds would hardly be granted this year to meat factories in view of what happened last year and the exorbitant profits that were made?  Would it not be better to give the extra funds to the farmers, the producers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Alternatively, would it be possible for the Government to distribute the EEC money direct to the farmer rather than give it to meat factories?  Which alternative will the Minister take this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come in a moment to the question of intervention beef.  As the Senators will appreciate, the board of the Agricultural Credit Corporation are the people who are responsible for the manner in which these moneys are distributed. Ministerial responsibility is quite limited to matters of interest rates and so forth.  While I certainly from time to time have had consultations with the board of the ACC and have found them receptive to my ideas or suggestions&mdash;indeed I have conveyed to the board suggestions that were made previously to me here and in the other House regarding agricultural credit&mdash;the final decisions lie with the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seventy per cent of the ACC advances are strictly to farmers and for the purchase of the working capital of a farm.  Other advances which they make are in activities which are directly related to the agricultural community.  I would expect that in this year, having regard to the profits which have been made by the meat factories last year, the ACC would <Col N="806" /> bear that in mind if they receive any applications from meat factories for credit at present.  We will certainly bring this debate to the attention of the board.  Senators may be assured that the ACC will be reading the reports of their own accord.</P>
    <P>I would like, at this stage to endorse all that has been said by Senators regarding the ACC, their operations, and the understanding and courtesy which Senators and their contacts have received from the ACC.  I have participated in no debate on the ACC, either as Minister or at any other time, without hearing this very strong approval of the ACC being voiced. It speaks very well indeed when a financial institution get praise from people who have to resort to them for money.  It is rather unique.  Where disappointments occur in relation to some applications&mdash;and, of course, they do arise&mdash;Ministers, Senators and Deputies who may make representations usually feel that the ACC are justified in most cases in not accepting the applications.  Often the reasons for not accepting them are very much in the interests of the persons applying for money.  The ACC must have regard to their own depositors.</P>
    <P>They also must have regard to the welfare of the applicants for loans. They do that by satisfying themselves that an applicant has the capacity to repay.  There is no point in a person incurring a load of debts if he is not in a position to repay and, as a consequence, has to sell off his farm.  The ACC are there to help farmers and part of the help they have to give is sometimes to make decisions which may cause temporary disappointment but in the long run are for the welfare of the applicants themselves.</P>
    <P>Senator Dolan may be assured that the small farmer is not neglected. The average ACC loan to farmers is only £3,000.  This is a fair indication that the small man is not overlooked and very often it is his only prospect of getting a loan because many a man who has not succeeded elsewhere has received assistance from the ACC.</P>
    <P>Loans for the purchase of land are restricted to 12½ per cent of the total advances of the ACC.  There are a <Col N="807" /> number of reasons for that.  Firstly, if the ACC were to advance a larger proportion of their available money for this purpose they would have less for other purposes.  It is easier to get loans for land purchase from some other financial institution than it is for other agricultural activities. Therefore it is desirable that people should be channelled into applying for loans from the banking system, which in any event is obtaining a great deal of money from farmers. In addition to the 12½ per cent restriction on their total loan availability, the loans which they advance for land purchase are limited to a maximum of £20,000 and they may only be given if the total of land held and bought does not exceed 125 acres. Apart from ensuring a fair and useful use of available moneys this policy can be justified on the grounds that, if capital was to be available too easily and too cheaply for the purchase of land, it would drive up the price of land and that would make farming less economic than it is.  I am satisfied that this policy works to the best advantage of farmers.</P>
    <P>One of the healthier aspects of the debate was to hear the number of what I might call common-sense, business-like statements.  They were in the main made from the Government side of the Seanad.  I think I am not making a partisan observation when I say that.  I hope that it will not be interpreted as such.  We had on one side of the Seanad speeches declaring that farming was ruined, expressing a lack of confidence in farming, encouraging people to get out of farming; we had the poor mouth.  We had a description of farmers which suggested that they were beggars and mendicants.</P>

      <P>Senator Butler may be assured that I will bear in mind his recommendation that the management end of industry, including people like those in his own profession, creamery managers, will be considered when appointments to the board of the ACC come to be made.  It is difficult, of course, to satisfy all needs, all personal preferences, when appointments come to be made to the ACC and indeed to any other State board, but I can see the advantage of having the management side of the agricultural industry adequately represented.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Garrett for saying that he had some information that he could give to me relating to an application for a land purchase loan.  If he would be good enough to let me have the particulars I would be only too happy to look into the matter.</P>
      <P>On the question of intervention beef, it would be inappropriate for me to make any comment at the present time because, as the House is aware, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, in agreement with the Irish Farmers' Association and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, has set up a review body to investigate the operation of the intervention and cattle slaughter premiums.  That body was established last March and I understand that it is expected fairly shortly to issue its report.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries invited the farming organisations to come forward with details of a draft scheme which would bring more benefit to the producer and less to the factories.</P>

      <P>It is important that all interests would get an opportunity to express their views and that is what they have had.  We like to make decisions having got the best advice and not to be operating in the dark.  This is the sensible thing to do.  I trust I have dealt with most of the main points raised in the course of the debate.  If I have not, I apologise.  I should like to conclude on this note. Any prices received for agricultural produce will have an effect on consumer prices.  Any charges that have to be met for borrowed money will be reflected in the overheads of farmers.  But unless money is borrowed in this country for farming and invested in farming we will not be able to achieve the growth which our economy needs, which the farmers of this country are capable of achieving and which, if they achieve it, will operate to their own benefit and to the benefit of the whole community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the reason this Government have given such a massive increase in the amount of capital available for agricultural credit.  This year, compared with last year, there is a tremendous improvement in deposits <Col N="810" /> with the Agricultural Credit Corporation. This is an indication that there is every confidence in the corporation and that the farming community in particular are enjoying a much better year this year than last year.  The deposits are on the increase and are expected to reach £25 million.  As a result of the policies of the Government, as a result of the activities of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, we are certain that the farmers of Ireland will go forward to even greater prosperity in 1975 than anything which they achieved in the past.</P>
    <P>The most recent adjustment of the Green £ in Brussels, which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries negotiated yesterday, will give the farmers of Ireland an additional £17 million a year.  Obviously, there is some concern as to whether or not this increase in agricultural prices will result in an increase in the consumer price index.  The Government's policy is, as far as it is possible to do so, to ensure that there will not be an increase in the consumer price index. Having regard to the fact that the adjustment in the Green £ will operate to the benefit of the agricultural sector the Government consider that it is appropriate that the Irish consumer would, as far as practicable, be insured against any increase which the adjustment in the Green £ might cause the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>The particular machinery to achieve this will be under active discussion in the course of the next couple of days. The end result of the whole process will be that there will be no significant increase in the consumer price index and that the agricultural community in Ireland will gain from £14 to £15 million as a result of the adjustment.</P>

In page 12, lines 16 to 19, to delete all words after &ldquo;deposition&rdquo; to the end of the section and substitute &ldquo;unless the justice is satisfied that such person cannot give any material evidence or, as the case may be, produce any document or thing likely to be material evidence.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggested amendment here would make the restriction in section 7 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, conform with the provisions of section 10 (1) of the same Act dealing with witness summonses.  Section 10 (1) says:</P>
      <P>(1)  A summons (in this section referred to as a witness summons) may, on the application of the Attorney General or an accused person, be issued out of the court to which the accused is being sent forward for trial requiring the person to whom it is directed to attend before the trial court and give evidence at the trial and to produce any document or thing specified in the summons, unless the court is satisfied that such person cannot give any material evidence or, as the case may be, produce any document or thing likely to be material evidence.</P>
      <P>Section 7 of the 1967 Act which is being affected by section 18 of this Bill deals with preliminary determinations and says that the justice shall consider the documents and exhibits. Subsection (2) says:</P>
      <P>The prosecutor and the accused shall each be entitled to give evidence on sworn depositions and also to require the attendance before the justice of any person, whether included in the supplied list of witnesses or not, and to examine him by way of sworn deposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 18 of the Bill proposes to restrict that by saying that this right shall not be available to the accused if it appears to the justice that the person is outside the State and that it is not reasonably practicable to secure his attendance before the justice for <Col N="813" /> examination under that section.  What I am suggesting is that the restriction should be modified by saying if &ldquo;the justice is satisfied that such a person cannot give any material evidence or, as the case may be, produce any document or thing likely to be of material evidence&rdquo;.  The situations seem to me to be the same, and I am merely using the wording in section 10 of the Criminal Procedure Act for the restriction which is proposed here.  It seems to me to be a much better wording and a more appropriate one than the one that is in the Bill.  It is preferable in a criminal prosecution where the accused is seeking to have a witness called that the onus should remain on the justice of being &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo;, as in section 10 of the Criminal Procedure Act, rather than &ldquo;appearing to the justice&rdquo;, which is less stringent.</P>
    <P>What is proposed here is merely that the right of the accused should not apply if the witness is outside the State and it is not reasonably practicable to secure his attendance. Surely a much more important thing is whether or not the evidence he could give is material to the charge. In the proposed amendment the onus would be on the accused to satisfy the justice that the witness was material to the charge.  If you look at this the other way around, that if on the one hand, the witness, the person to be examined, is a material witness but, on the other hand, is outside the State, justice cannot be done if the justice is, on the one hand, to find that the person in question is material to the charge and, on the other hand, is outside the State. Therefore, of the two, I think it is much more important for the justice to decide whether or not the person in question is a material witness and if he is, then obviously it is essential that he should be there, and that is the test which should be before the court and the test on which the justice should act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator says, section 7 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967 provides that in the course of a preliminary hearing of an indictable <Col N="814" /> offence in the district court, the prosecution or the accused is entitled to require the attendance of any person before the justice to be examined by way of sworn deposition.  I think that was to retain the old procedure of verbal deposition.  That Act introduced the new procedure of written depositions and did away with the long and tedious oral deposition procedures. Section 18 of this Bill endeavours to secure that the entitlement under the 1967 Act will not lead to a situation where parties exercise their right of having an oral deposition and seek to have brought before the district court a person who is outside the jurisdiction and whom it is not practicable to bring into the jurisdiction, because, of course, the court has no power to compel a person from another jurisdiction to come before it for the purpose of giving an oral deposition at a preliminary hearing.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan's amendment suggests the cutting off of this entitlement&mdash;which I think is no entitlement at all, because the court has no power to compel the attendance&mdash; that instead of the section as drafted there should be a proviso that involves the justice.  I gather from what he is saying that if a justice is satisfied that a person can give material evidence, then he should be summoned, although the amendment is phrased: &ldquo;unless the justice is satisfied that such person cannot give any material evidence&rdquo;.  I could not quite read that into the section because the word &ldquo;unless&rdquo; would appear to be a misprint for the word &ldquo;if&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  My amendment is wrong.  It should be &ldquo;if&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the justice is satisfied that the person has material evidence the justice cannot compel that person to attend.  The reality of the situation is that in cases of these preliminary hearings if there is a witness outside the jurisdiction who has not given a written deposition, there is no power under the law here to compel his attendance before the court.  Of course this point is basic to this entire Bill, that in such a situation, <Col N="815" /> when the actual trial is taking place, there is provision made for hearing on commission.</P>
      <P>I can foresee that it will be a very rare situation that there will be preliminary hearings before a District Court at all, that the procedure to get offences directly before the Special Criminal Court will be invoked when the Bill is passed.  We dealt with this on an earlier amendment, I think it was Senator Robinson who had the amendment or had a query dealing with the mechanisms proposed to have these offences made triable by the Special Criminal Court only so as to avoid preliminary procedures in the District Court.</P>
      <P>This section 18 is really precautionary that in the event of these proceedings involving a preliminary hearing before the District Court, they would not be stymied by a party to the preliminary hearings seeking to have a witness brought from outside the jurisdiction, because, of course, there would be no power to compel such attendance.  That is the reality of it.  We want to avoid a situation like that arising and styming any action that might be under way.  I think, with respect, Senator Ryan's amendment does not really remove that difficulty because it really says that the person will not be needed if the justice is satisfied that he cannot give evidence, but the justice is satisfied that he can give evidence we are no farther on because the justice has no power to compel his attendance.  This would not be really relevant to what we are discussing, which is essentially trials before the Special Criminal Court.  In fact that is where the trials will be taking place. And if it is known in advance that a witness is not going to come to give evidence, then the procedure of going before the Special Criminal Court will have to be the procedure adopted so as to enable evidence to be taken on commission.  What the section is intended to guard against is something very remote but it was thought prudent to put it in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is factually quite right in saying that if the person is outside the jurisdiction <Col N="816" /> the court cannot insist that he be brought before the court.  But that is just one aspect of the case.  The justice in this preliminary examination has to decide whether or not there is a sufficient case to put the accused on trial.  He has got to decide that on all the evidence and all the facts before him.  From the point of view of doing justice to the accused, how can a justice make a decision that the person should be sent forward if he is conscious of the fact that a witness who can give material evidence is not available before the court?</P>
      <P>It is very easy to say that it will be pleaded to him, the justice, that he will be told that there is an essentrial. He has got to decide that on all which will be material and which may have a very important effect in helping him to make up his mind whether a person should be sent forward or not.  Surely the important thing in that situation is not whether or not a person whom the accused wants to have called is outside the State&mdash;that it is a matter of fact&mdash; but whether he is a material witness. I do not see how the justice can make up his mind, how he can do justice, if he is going to make up his mind in the absence of a witness about whom it has been represented to the justice that he is material to the issue before the justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I was going to make, that if the witness is material or critical to the prosecution's case, the absence of the evidence of that witness will mean, in effect, that a <i>prima facie</i> case will not have been made.  That then will be in ease of the accused; if the State is not able to produce its witnesses to substantiate the charges it is making, then the charge falls and there will be no return for trial.  This is a risk that is inherent in every criminal case. Generally speaking, it is an unusual point to be raised, but it can happen that a defendant may allege that he has a material witness in England and <Col N="817" /> that he cannot get him to come over. It is then a matter for the court to decide whether in fact that evidence is material or whether the court will proceed to conclude the trial in the absence of that witness.  If the witness is material to the prosecution and is a critical element of the prosecution case, his absence may be fatal to the prosecution case.</P>
      <P>The court will decide, and the court inherently has powers to decide, whether there is this amendment or not, on the facts before it, and if those facts are faulty or lacking because of the absence of the material witness, then the court can only go one way and that is refuse information. If this is an actual trial, it will be in the Special Criminal Court and the commission procedure will be available.  This is only dealing with another point of preliminary hearings. The court has the inherent powers, as every court has, to decide on the evidence before it if it is adequate to sustain a <i>prima facie</i> case.  If the prosecution says: &ldquo;I have Mr. X, but he will not come here.  Mr. X's evidence is critical&rdquo; and the court will have to say: &ldquo;Too bad for you, Mr. Prosecutor, but as the evidence I have is not adequate, I am refusing information&rdquo;.  In the unlikely event of a defendant's counsel saying: &ldquo;I have Mr. X who will exonerate my client&rdquo;, the justice may decide: &ldquo;I will let this matter be tried; I will let the matter go on as a <i>prima facie</i> case here made before me.  That is all that I am concerned with.&rdquo;  If it is to be rebutted it can be rebutted by Mr. X in the other court and the other court presumably then would have power to have a commission and hear Mr. X in the other jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Again Mr. X is in England, and where there is no Commission procedure this is a difficulty that arises in criminal trials even as of now. That is a matter for the court to assess whether Mr. X is a real person or is a fictitious person.  This is something that we cannot provide for.  It is a problem that is inherent in every criminal trial, always has been and, I think, will continue to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that the justice <Col N="818" /> would take the course which the Minister suggests he would take. But what my amendment is seeking to do is make quite clear the test the justice should apply, because if a justice took a very rigid view of this section as it now stands, he would merely say that the person who was required to be called was outside the State.  In these circumstances his duty would be clear; the person could not be called and that is that, and to the argument that he was not material the justice could say was not relevant: &ldquo;The section says it is outside the State, I cannot call him and that is that&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My amendment would merely clarify the position and make quite clear the test to be applied.  I do not see that it would weaken the position in any way that would affect what would happen if the Minister is right in the way a justice will probably interpret it anyhow. As it stands, it is possible that injustice will be done if a justice interprets in too rigid a way, whereas if the amendment were adopted that danger would be obviated.  I submit that the amendment, particularly when I am merely suggesting the inclusion of the wording in the Criminal Procedure Act on a similar section should be adopted for this one.  If it is right for section 10 it is difficult to see how it is wrong for section 7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of the justice interpreting it in a certain way.  The question of interpretation by a justice will not arise.  The witness will not be called, Therefore, that evidence will not be before the justice.  Therefore, if that evidence is critical the case falls.  We have to rely on our courts to adjudicate on the evidence before them, not what might have been if that witness could have been called.  The point is that the witness's presence cannot be compelled.  If he comes voluntarily no problem arises.  If he does not come voluntarily his evidence is missing.  We are merely saying that the court cannot require his attendance. We are, if you like, putting into the statute what is a fact already.  Possibly the section was not necessary at all&mdash; that it is merely to spell out what is the factual position, that the courts here <Col N="819" /> cannot summon somebody from another jurisdiction.  If that person's evidence is part of the <i>prima facie</i> case and that person fails to attend because he cannot be called by virtue of the power given under this section, that does not entitle the justice to then say: &ldquo;If I had that man I would be happier.  I am going to return for trial&rdquo;.  That is not the position.  The court has an inherent obligation to do justice and only return for trial when there is a <i>prima facie</i> case made before it.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to say that it is necessary to spell out that the evidence must not be material, because then you would be implying that to spell out that the evidence must be material if a person can be summoned, because there is an implication there somewhere that a District Court might return for trial where material evidence was lacking.  That cannot be the case because a District Court can only return for trial where there is material evidence to find a <i>prima facie</i> case.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (1).</P>
      <P>It is appreciated that they should be taken together because they are both cognate and very fundamental in regard to our criticism here of the whole legitimacy and <i>bona fides</i> of this Bill. I said initially that this Bill was un-amendable, and our amendments here to delete subsections (1) and (2) are in complete consistency with this view, because what is briefly proposed in these two subsections we are now seeking to delete is that we give the power of arrest to any person.  I quote subsection (1):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any person may arrest without warrant anyone who is or whom he, <Col N="820" /> with reasonable cause, suspects to be in the act of committing an offence under section 2 (1).</P>
    <P>I will go back to that section.  Any person gets this omnibus provision of arrest.  I am aware and there is no point in the Minister making this answer to me, I am well aware that there is a common law provision for an arrest of this kind, but this is being written into the statute here in regard to offence under section 2 (1), and subsection (2) goes on to say:</P>
    <P>any person may arrest without warrant anyone who is or whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects to be guilty of the offence.</P>
    <P>You have the two subsections that we now seek to delete here, subsections by which any person with a reasonable cause may arrest anybody whom he suspects to be in the act of committing an offence or whom he suspects to be guilty of the offence. And what is the offence?  We will go back to section 2 (1) to see the offence:</P>
    <P>Where a person does in Northern Ireland an act that, if done in the State, would constitute an offence specified in the Schedule, he shall be guilty of an offence and he shall be liable on conviction on indictment to the penalty to which he would have been liable if he had done the act in the State.</P>
    <P>What we are giving here is power in the jurisdiction of the Republic to a private person to arrest a person whom he may suspect of committing an offence in the Northern Ireland jurisdiction.  This amounts to a very serious situation.  There always was a common law scheme of arrest by private persons, very seldom exercised indeed and usually on the basis of local knowledge or understanding of a situation.  The whole purpose of having this traditional common law system of arrest arose out of a local situation where somebody was aware of an offence in his or her locality and had the power of arrest.</P>
    <P>It is all very academic because the Minister cannot quote to me how often this power of arrest has been exercised without warrant by a private <Col N="821" /> individual.  I think it must be, if not zero, as near to zero as does not matter since the formation of the State.  Over hundreds of years both here and in Britain a country that is far more susceptible to this kind of exercise of private right, I would imagine the figures must be infinitesimal where this type of power of arrest has been exercised by private individuals.</P>
    <P>Here you are suggesting, and this is what the House is passing in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, that you are to have this power of arrest conferred on private individuals in the Republic in respect of offences committed in the North of Ireland as set out in section 2 (1) and the Schedule.  In the name of God, how daft can we get?  Sure that is not on. It is with a view to keeping the Minister right that at a stage when we decided to be reasonable, despite our total objection to the Bill as a whole&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We try to keep the Minister right.  We would wish him in all seriousness to confine himself, and the legislature to confine themselves, to paragraphs (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of section 19, which give this power to the Garda Síochána alone.  I do not have to elaborate on the history of our country and all the sensitivities involved in regard to the offences envisaged by the Minister.  I am only talking in the abstract because I regard this measure as completely nugatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis that this becomes an effective instrument of law and having regard to the circumstances that exist in the country and in regard to the offences to which this section relates, which are offences committed in Northern Ireland under section 2, surely it is total common sense to confine the power of arrest to the Garda Síochána who are the legitimately appointed force in this country.  The Minister could do without subsections (1) and (2) and could do well with, if he wants an enforceable Act, subsections (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7).  These are related to arrests carried out by <Col N="822" /> members of the Garda Síochána, without a warrant, on suspicion.</P>
    <P>I would trust a member of the Garda Síochána to carry out such an arrest, on suspicion, without warrant. I would have no qualms whatever&mdash; representing the main political party in this State which have always stood by the Garda Síochána and representing people who are concerned about having the enforcement of law and order within the State on a reasonable basis&mdash;about allowing the Garda Síochána, on reasonable cause, to arrest without warrant anybody whom they may suspect of being guilty of an offence under section 2 (1) or (3).</P>
    <P>I have a real objection, in the sensitive context of the relations that exist in this country, to giving that right to any person outside the legitimate recognised police force of the State, having regard to the para-military situation, the IRA situation, the UDA situation, right across the board&mdash;there are all sorts of labels attaching to them.  New labels are attached every day to the extremist organisations of the left and the right, extreme orangism or extreme greenism.  I have no time for any of them.  I wish to make that quite clear in case there is any misrepresentation of this aspect.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure that legislation is passed here that makes it quite clear that we do not dabble in any form of private investigation or private informing in regard to these particular people: that if those people are arrested without warrant on suspicion, it will be done by the legitimate police force in this State.  I feel very strongly about that.  It is a fundamental principle in the context of this Bill and having regard to the sensitivities involved here in regard to the offences that will be pursued under this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is no answer for the Minister to say that there is a traditional common law power of arrest.  That exists in regard to harmless offences. It has become an academic sort of power over the years.  It happened in the old days when only a minimum police force existed in these two islands where the common law operates, and it had a certain legitimacy. <Col N="823" /> It has not been administered very often.  Why have a right that has rapidly receded in the common law environment and which was largely exercised 50 or 100 years ago, to be exercised now in regard to a major offence scheduled in this Bill where para-military forces of all shades and kinds, of red and green and orange, rampage around the country to the detriment and destruction of property and the endangerment of life and limb?  The right of private arrest only arises in the context of this section in the south of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The right to arrest without warrant on suspicion people will be given to people outside the police force in the South in respect of an offence in the North of Ireland.  It does not require any imaginative person to elaborate on the sort of area into which we are going now.  I suggest to the Minister that he is doing harm to the objectives he has in the Bill by including these two subsections.  He would do far greater good as far as the intention he has in mind goes by limiting these particular powers to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I feel this Government could be brought to the European Convention on Human Rights on many issues involved in this Bill.  I have mentioned a number of other issues on which, in my view, the Government can be chargeable before the European Commission on Human Rights.  These two subsections are ones that very obviously bring the Minister into danger in that area.  Article 5 (c) of the European Convention on Human Rights refers to:</P>
    <P>The lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and continues:</P>
    <P>There must be a lawful arrest or detention of a person for the purpose of bringing him before the <Col N="824" /> competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence.</P>
    <P>That is the wording of the Article. I am not referring at all to the subsections in section 19 which deal with arrest by a member of our Garda Síochána.  They are the legitimately appointed police force, but read these subsections in conjunction with the subsections we seek to delete here. Subsection (1):</P>
    <P>Any person may arrest without warrant anyone who is or whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects to be in act of committing an offence under section 2 (1).</P>
    <P>This offence is an offence under section 2 which has been committed in a different jurisdiction.  So any person may arrest without warrant anyone who is or whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects to be in the act of committing an offence in a different jurisdiction.  This, in effect, is an extension of, or ridiculous ploy on, the existing common law right which was never designed to deal with this type of situation.</P>
    <P>The common law right that is written into statute here was designed to deal with a situation where people had local knowledge and understood a local situation.  Here we are talking about an offence committed in another jurisdiction, Northern Ireland.  If John A in any of our 26 counties feels he has reason to suspect B, his neighbour, of committing an offence in the Six-County area, he may arrest that individual. That is what it means.  I know the saver of &ldquo;with reasonable cause&rdquo; is included, but I would say that that sort of saver is best attached to people in uniform who are ascribable and subscribable to the organs of authority within our jurisdiction, people whom we appoint from this Parliament or who are under the control and management of the legitimately appointed Government of this State.  I suggest that they are the right people to arrest on suspicion without warrant in this type of situation.</P>
    <P>That is why we suggest that the subsections that deal with the Garda Síochána acting in this manner, subsections <Col N="825" /> (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7), should remain.  That is why we suggest that subsections (1) and (2) should be deleted.  I do not think that that type of arrest without warrant on suspicion as embodied in subsections (1) and (2), which we seek to delete, would be in accordance with, to use the words of the European Convention on Human Rights, &ldquo;the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonable to prevent him committing an offence or fleeing after having done so.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;lawful arrest or detention&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to lawful arrest or detention.  What we are suggesting here in subsections (1) or (2) amounts to prairie law, jungle law, banana republic law in the context of the situation I am talking about.  I realise that there is a traditional common law right of arrest residing in every citizen.  That is in regard to petty offences or local offences that are totally outside the ambit of the type of offence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am talking about the general principle of the private individual going in on a person's right as against the public authority, through its lawful force, doing it. What I want to get from the Minister is in how many cases under the traditional <Col N="826" /> common law code has the power of arrest on the part of a private citizen been exercised within this State since the formation of the State or over X number of years past. He has officials there behind him and they know well.  I happened to occupy the same chair as the Minister for a while, and the Minister knows that what I am saying is true: this right has hardly ever, if ever, been exercised. I should hate to get the figures because they are probably one or two, if at all.  I should like to get the figures since 1922 to bear out my point.  It is entirely an academic matter.  The Minister knows that himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will talk more now because the point has not got home sufficiently.  There are certain private rights that exist in regard to dealing with offenders.  There are private rights that exist for petty offences where people can bring a prosecution <i>via</i> the police authority.  There are private rights of arrest in regard to felonies.  These private rights are based on a real historical period and they have now become theoretical&mdash; when there were no organised police forces.  Hundreds of years ago people had this private right of arrest in regard to felonies, but this does not operate any more.</P>
      <P>I want to get from the Minister the reality of the situation.  Why import something that is unreal to a highly sensitive area?  This is the point I am trying to make if I can get it home: that there is this old-fashioned feudalistic common law right that predates the organisation of modern police forces, when there was this power of arrest in regard to felonies.  It is now suggested that this should be done in regard to the scheduled offences that are largely, not entirely, felonies in the traditional sense.  This particular right, in my estimation, has hardly ever, or if at all only once or twice, been exercised by private citizens since the formation of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say that the figures in Britain, a far bigger country with <Col N="827" /> greater problems of every kind, social and political, would show that the right has hardly ever been exercised there over a number of years.</P>
    <P>Then why give this right the garb of statute, in an important measure like this which is loaded, to put it mildly, with highly significant and sensitive political and social issues involving unfortunate disagreements between our people?  It is crazy.  Anybody who is concerned about this country must realise how crazy it is.  You are asking people by subsections (1) and (2) to be, in fact, informers.  That is what you are asking them to do and let us not put a tooth in it.  Anybody who knows Irish history knows that is what you are asking them to do.  It is a cod.  It should not be incorporated in a civilised piece of legislation by an Irish State in 1975.  It is not on.</P>
    <P>Nobody is going to do it anyway. Why invite them to do it in a piece of legislation?  Why invite people to be informers?  Why invite people to proceed in a para-military manner to deal with para-military people?  A civilised State in 1975 should deal with these people in a civilised way and win out through the normal exercise of law, the normal process of law and, if necessary, strengthen the police force, strengthen the security forces, strengthen the armed forces, strengthen every force we have within our control.  Let people in uniform, people under discipline, conduct the arrest and let them have the suspicion and let them do it, if necessary, without warrant.  Do not, in our sensitive situation, pass this right on to every Tom, Dick and Harry to exercise his or her grudge against this or that various shade of green, orange, or red which unfortunately exist in this island.</P>
    <P>That is all I am saying, and it is as simple and as straightforward as that. The Minister could solve all his problems in this particular area by deleting completely subsections (1) and (2) and concentrating the whole exercise of the power of arrest under section 19 on members of the Garda Síochána and let them act on suspicion and without warrant.  Let them <Col N="828" /> exercise the discretion to do so in regard to any particular people who they feel are guilty of malpractices. They are the people who should do it, and rightly so.  We should not in any way allow anybody outside the properly accredited forces of this State to arrest on suspicion without warrant anybody supposedly guilty of an offence outside the jurisdiction of this State in another part of this island. Otherwise we start to introduce the sort of &ldquo;eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth&rdquo; type of law that has operated, unfortunately, in the North of Ireland in recent years.  We do not want that here.  I respectfully suggest that these two subsections which we now seek to delete lean in the direction of people informing on people, making arrests without warrant, trapping people, paying off grudges, all the sort of things we abhor but which have happened in Northern Ireland.  All these things which we abhor could very easily be introduced here by the adoption of these two subsections. We feel very strongly that they should be deleted and that the section without them stand as a section that can exercise legitimate authority of arrest in the extreme case, without warrant on suspicion, with the Garda Síochána appointed by the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the case made by Senator Lenihan. I would have been surprised if the case was not made.  It is a pity he spoiled the case by the emotiveness of his language and the extreme manner in which he expressed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lenihan finished by putting his argument on the basis that the Minister could solve his problems by deleting these two subsections.  As I see it, it is not the Minister who has any problems in relation to this matter.  The Minister is quite clear and the Government are quite clear as to where they stand.  The only people who have problems with regard to this section and, indeed, with regard to this entire legislation, are those whose views with regard to the happenings in the North of Ireland may be ambiguous.  Before Senator Lenihan gets his hackles up. I am not suggesting that he is <Col N="829" /> ambiguous, but there is no ambiguity on the part of the Minister or of the Government.  Those whose views are tinged with ambiguity may very well have problems in relation to this particular section, to these two subsections of sections 19.</P>
    <P>There are some things to bear in mind.  First of all we should not dismiss so lightheartedly as Senator Lenihan seemed to do the question of the common law right of arrest.  I do not know that it is particularly relevant except that it is worth while noting that it does exist and that it is unimpaired by this legislation.  Senator Lenihan said that the common law right was never designed to deal with this situation.  Of course it was not. The situation which the people of this whole country are facing arising out of the events in part of the country is largely unprecedented and the legislation with which we are concerned and subsections (1) and (2) of section 19 are for the purpose of dealing with that unprecedented situation.  One of the things that must be noted is, first of all, that the powers in subsections (1) and (2) of section 19 are, of course, entirely and purely permissive. No one is forced to take advantage of the rights of arrest in particular circumstances which are given in these two subsections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>These two subsections do challenge everyone of us with regard to our sincerity and our determination in dealing with the problem which has been posed and which has been very acute and very much current for a number of years in part of this land.  Our willingness to accept the responsibility which these two subsections place on the shoulders of every one of us is a test of our earnestness and our determination to face and to overcome this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said in relation to an earlier section of this Bill, and it is just as relevant here, that practically without exception every section of the people in this part of the country condemn the offences which can be summarised as the scheduled offences so far as this Bill is concerned.  Everyone condemns <Col N="830" /> them but very few people have an opportunity of doing more than condemning them verbally.  These two subsections will challenge the seriousness of our people as to whether or not they are prepared to accept the responsibility which these subsections place on their shoulders or whether they are prepared merely to talk and merely to condemn and to funk accepting the responsibility that this legislation will place on their shoulders.</P>
    <P>Even when the legislation is passed, even if this section is passed unamended, the option is still going to be open to people either to accept the responsibility, to live up to it or to funk it.</P>
    <P>What is suggested by these two subsections?  Let us take a practical example.  It is suggested, in effect, that if I know&mdash;I substitute that expression deliberately for &ldquo;having reasonable grounds for believing&rdquo; as I think the courts would, certainly the individual would interpret it as being the same thing&mdash;that one of the scheduled offences, whether it be murder or church burning, kneecapping, or burning buildings, is taking place in the North and I know that someone down here is aiding and abetting that, is providing the sinews of war for that operation, these subsections are challenging me to do something about that.  Senator Lenihan interprets them as inviting people to be informers.  It is doing more than that.  It is telling me that in those circumstances I can if I choose do nothing, I can if I choose act as an informer and get to the Garda or, if that is not possible, if by an omission on my part I am going to encourage the person who is aiding and abetting, I am going to encourage the supplies going to the North in the example I have given, it challenges me to do something about it.</P>
    <P>If it is not possible to put a stop to it by taking my time and informing the Garda, if it is within my grasp to make an arrest, and put a stop to it, it challenges me to have courage to do that.  That is what these subsections are about.  We can flunk it if we want to, or we can face up to our <Col N="831" /> responsibilities not merly as legislators but as individual Irishmen who abhor the kind of things Senator Lenihan so rightly said he abhors seeing happening in a part of our country.</P>
    <P>We can look on this either way. We can look on it in the way which Senator Lenihan has chosen to look on it.  We can adopt the attitude that private individuals should not dabble in private investigations, that we should leave it entirely to the Garda, or we can adopt the attitude that there is a problem facing us which in all decency we have to try to play our part in solving.  We have to decide for ourselves in relation to our attitude particularly to these two subsections, which challenge us, whether we are prepared to do more than indulge in mere verbal condemnations, whether we are prepared to stand up and be counted, whether we have the courage to accept the responsibility which these subsections ask us to accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>These subsections enable a private person to arrest without warrant when he has reasonable cause to suspect a person to be in the act of committing an offence under section 2, subsection (1), where an offence under section 2 (1) or section 3 has been committed, a private person may arrest without warrant where he has reasonable cause for suspecting a person to be guilty of the offence.</P>
      <P>I intend to make the argument that these sections replace the common law power which was available to private citizens and is still available to private citizens in regards to a felony.  The offences under this Bill are not declared to be felonies as such and therefore the common law power of arrest that lies in the individual citizen with regard to felonies does not lie with regard to these offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lenihan anticipated that argument and sought to rebut it by making the point that the present common law powers apply only in a local way to a harmless range of offences, to petty matters.  It was only when I drew his attention to the fact <Col N="832" /> that this was an incorrect statement of the law that he mentioned that they do apply to felonies.  Of course they apply and they apply only to felonies.  There is no common law right in the individual to arrest in regard to misdemeanours and in regard to offences which are not felonies.  The right only exists in regard to felonies, and felonies, by and large represent the serious crimes in our criminal code.  It is in regard to those serious crimes that the common law power exists.  It is not a small or an insignificant power.  It is of a significant power of great social importance.  The reason is that it is up to us as individual citizens to protect our society.  Therefore we should have the power to take steps when a serious offence is committed against our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>How often has it been exercised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in order to protect ourselves that this power is there.  I do not know how often it has been exercised.  I have no statistics to tell me whether it has been exercised or not.  The point is that if we really believe in the wellbeing of our society and we as citizens want to protect our society, we should be jealous of this power and keep it, not sneer at it because it has not been exercised, because we have been fortunate enough to live in a society where we have a police force to do this job for us.  Our police force is only as effective as we make it.  One of the ways in which we can make it effective is to assist it and to exercise our legal rights and our legal powers when the opportunity presents itself.</P>
      <P>I make this argument to rebut Senator Lenihan's argument that the common law power was available only in regard to insignificant offences. That was a seriously incorrect and misleading statement of the law.  It is only available in regard to felonies, which by and large are serious crimes and it was there as a protection for society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much for Senator Lenihan's point that I might use this argument. <Col N="833" /> I do use it and I think it is a valid argument to use.  The heinous offences created by this statute are not being made felonies but I think it is important to preserve the right of the citizen to move against the felon, that that right be preserved by statute.  That is what these two subsections do.</P>

      <P>This again is getting to the kernel of this situation, which is that the only way in which subversion in this country can be beaten is when all citizens take it as their responsibility, relying on each and every citizen to do his part in the fight against subversion, not to close his eyes and turn his back and say, &ldquo;It is only for the guards: it is not my affair&rdquo;.  That is the very way in which anarchy and subversion will rule. <Col N="834" /> It is a cowardly way and a hypocritical thing to do.

He would have us close our eyes to their existence and say, &ldquo;All for the guards, let the rest of us do nothing&rdquo;.  He even goes so far as to say that a citizen who carries out his duty and who fulfils his obligation to protect his own society and who exercises his rights under this Act&mdash; that that citizen can be castigated as an informer.  It is a travesty of democracy. It is a citizen's solemn duty and his privilege to inform his police forces.  It was a revealing speech by Senator Lenihan, a disturbing and a disappointing speech, seeking to take away from citizens the obligation and the privilege of defending their own society and their own democracy.</P>
      <P>These sections are proper sections to have in this Bill.  As Senator Higgins said, it puts it up to us, are we prepared to fight for our society or are we not?  Are we prepared to be ambivalent and ambiguous and say, &ldquo;It is none of our business.  This is a thing special to Ireland and we must not interfere&rdquo;.  These matters are affecting the kernel of our democracy and the safety of our society, and these powers give each and every one of us the opportunity, if we care about our country and about the terrible things that have been done to prevent them and bring them to an end.  They give us an opportunity to act.</P>

      <P>The laws have never been used in 53 years because they are dead.  They are not related in any way to Irish law.  Consider how these common law powers started.  They started centuries ago in England at a time when there was no police force. Remember, the first police force on a regular professional basis only started about 1838 or 1840.  There was no police force.  The only way of dealing with crime was for the people of a particular locality to band together if they knew somebody had stolen cattle or committed murder or whatever the crime was and they had to apprehend him.  There was a reason then for these common law powers.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether in England today, perhaps for historical reasons &mdash;and they appear to have a great sense of history&mdash;they like to preserve the fiction that these common law powers exist, but that is their business. In Ireland under Irish law I am telling the Minister as a fact, and let him deny it if he can, that common law powers have been dead for 53 years. They have never existed in the Irish State.  It is no use pretending that they have existed, and that he is merely recreating them.  These are new powers which do not at present exist. Whatever the theory may be, the fact is that they do not exist.  They are now being brought into this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At least, let us be clear as to what we are doing.  We are giving new statutory powers, powers which have never existed in the Irish State, whatever about England, powers under which any member of the public can arrest anyone that he thinks, rightly or wrongly, has committed an offence or, indeed, there may have been no offence committed at all and he can still arrest because under subsection (6) of this section the Minister has provided that the provisions of this section shall apply to an attempt to commit an offence as they apply to the commission of that offence.  In other words, if a member of the public thinks, with reasonable cause, that some other person has attempted somewhere, sometime, to commit an offence, then he can arrest him, even though no offence may ever have been <Col N="837" /> committed.  These are very wide powers.</P>
    <P>It is simply not good enough for the Minister to say that any one who opposes these powers, therefore, is not willing to accept their responsibility for seeing that crime is ended and so on.  There is a very important point to be made here.  In any civilised country there ought not to be a position that every Tom, Dick or Harry who feels rightly or wrongly that someone has been guilty of an offence should jump out on that person and drag him off to the local police station.  If anyone suspects this, let him ring up the guards and say &ldquo;So and so is in this house down here and I think he has committed an offence&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with the section.  That does not need a section.  It does not need this Bill.  If I think a man has committed burglary or knee-capping, or church burning or any other offence, and he is in a certain house I can ring up the guards.  It does not take the Minister's statute to enable me to do that.  If I suspect that a man has committed an offence or even attempted to commit an offence, there may not be an offence committed at all for all I know but rightly or wrongly I have this opinion, I can go up and drag him off down to the Garda barracks, but that is not civilisation in the sense as I think we all know it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>That is chaos.  It is the rule of the rabble.  It has nothing to do with supporting knee-capping or church burning or murdering.  We do not support this.  None of us supports this concept that any private individual&mdash;and he may well be wrong, remember&mdash;who thinks that someone has committed an offence he should be able to arrest him.  If it is going to be brought in at all I cannot see any particular reason why it should be limited to this Bill.  There are other offences, many of them just as grave <Col N="838" /> as the ones listed in the Schedule to this Bill, and yet we do not have these powers of arrest, whatever about the mythical common law power that the Minister claims we have and that we know the inhabitants of Britain once had and indeed may still have.</P>
      <P>If this is to be brought into this Bill at all there is an argument, I suppose, for saying that in all cases where serious crimes are committed people should have the power of arrest.  This would be merely the rule of the rabble.</P>
      <P>In relation to the practical aspect does the Minister seriously envisage that members of the public will go after people who, by the very fact that they are suspected of these crimes, are suspected to be violent men, armed men?  Who will go after them and try and arrest them?  The thing is futile.  Until now I have been discussing this in principle.  It is a bad principle.  It is not a principle one should enshrine in a Bill&mdash;a principle of mob rule&mdash;when it will not have any practical effect.  Therefore we have this very serious breach of all the ordinary principles of the rule of law inserted in this Bill for actually no purpose.  These powers will never be used.  They could be eliminated from the Bill and it would not in the slightest degree weaken the effects of it.  That is why I urge the Minister in everyone's interest to accept these recommendations.  It will not, as I say, weaken his Bill in the slightest degree but it will eliminate a very serious breach of the ordinary rule of law which we in Ireland should not commit.</P>
      <P>I am not interested in the ancient, obsolete concept of the common law powers of private arrest.  I have made the quite definite point that this has never existed and has never been used in the last 53 years.  In the complete absence of denial of this, we may take it for the sake of this argument that that is so.  They have been dead for 53 years.  In a situation where nobody will be in a position to use these powers we should not resurrect this dead dodo of common law powers in this Bill in this way.  I urge the Minister to accept the recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>From the very beginning I have opposed every section of the Bill.  It is completely daft for any Minister to expect that citizens here would be asked to act as informers or place themselves in that position. Who would protect them if they were so brave, as Senator O'Higgins would suggest, that they would come along and arrest somebody who might be guilty of some of these crimes with which we all disagree?  Does the Minister really know whom he is dealing with in these cases?  Many of these people could be British agents in our country or part of the 50,000 British troops that are in the Six Counties already?  This is preposterous altogether. There is no sense whatever to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get this debate into perspective.  I am sorry that the Minister has brought a heated note into it because I regard this as a tremendously important matter.  Indeed the Leader of the House treated it in that manner.  It should be treated in a rational, sensible way.  If I, in any way, got emotive, I want forgiveness in that respect.  I did not think I did.  I was trying to get across here that the incorporation of subsections (1) and (2) in this section, which we are seeking to delete, involve the right of private arrest by people other than the people entitled to arrest by power of this Oireachtas&mdash;involve giving private people without the authority of this Oireachtas the right to arrest on suspicion for the very serious offences set out in the Schedule alleged to have been committed in a jurisdiction other than ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, as precisely as I can put it, is what is involved in subsections (1) and (2) and it gives rise precisely to the danger just mentioned by Senator Dolan.  I do not want to adumbrate or elaborate on that.  The scope is obvious in a country such as ours, because our country is a whole island.  In a country such as ours it is obviously open to massive malpractice and abuse, where there are, in part of our country, illegal paramilitary organisations of every <Col N="840" /> shade&mdash;orange, green and red.  I will not opt for one or the other.  They are all equally wrong, all operating as civilians on a guerilla basis, all operating on a hit-and-run basis.</P>
    <P>Somebody from some of these organisations&mdash;I was trying to get this home earlier on&mdash;who happens to be down here, will be given the right to arrest without warrant in regard to an offence scheduled.  The whole purpose of the Bill is to deal with political offences&mdash;let us be realistic&mdash;that are at the same time offences that offend against everything we believe in, are in fact criminal offences. Criminal cum political offences is what we call them.  The Minister is now inducing into that situation these two subsections.  I do not need to have any imagination, and neither does anybody else, to realise the dangers of that.</P>
    <P>I want to correct what I was saying. There are only areas heretofore where private people have had any participation in regard to the apprehension of offenders.  This is going right back into the whole tradition of the common law, going back hundreds of years.  One area is in regard to petty local offences, where people have had the right of private prosecution. They can go to a police station and lay a charge against A, B, C, D.  That is still exercised to a very limited degree.  It is becoming a reducing factor, even on that level.  It is practically gone but that right has been traditional, both in statute and in common law over the years.  The other right that has existed in common law is the larger right of direct arrest in regard to felonies&mdash;for example, serious crimes.  That originated&mdash;forgive me if I seem to be slow and schoolmasterly about it&mdash;in historical days when police forces did not exist or existed only to a paltry degree.  With the growing development of police forces as we know them that type of power of arrest practically disappeared.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister to name even one case of private arrest in regard to a felony since the foundation of the State, that is 53 years ago. <Col N="841" /> He has advisers there to back him. Senator Yeats asked him as well.  It is quite obvious that right has not been exercised even once in regard to a felony.  On the petty side, the right of prosecution in regard to a local or private offence, locally committed, that right of private prosecution is rapidly disappearing also.</P>
    <P>The whole system of law in sophisticated countries, of which we are one, has gradually become one where there is a separation in regard to administration, enforcement and so on.  You have the people, the administration, the enforcement authorities, the courts, the Army, the Parliament and so on.  That type of development has been the sophisticated development in every civilised State in our time and we are part of that development. We helped that development along and we ought to be very proud of the fact that we, and our people before us since 1922, have been participators in evolving here a civilised and sophisticated State where we do not have the right of private arrest. The right of arrest lies with the police force duly appointed under the elected Government of the people.</P>
    <P>This is what is involved here.  An old, forgotten, unused common law power of arrest is being reintroduced into statute, That could be covered with a cloak of legitimacy if it was merely reincorporating a situation supposed to exist legally.  That might be defended, although I would not defend it.  But in regard to any form of felony or any form of crime it could not be defended because the forces of law are there, paid for, under our control.  They are the professional people who are responsible and in the position to deal with the situation rather than encouraging all sorts of underhand, informing, mouth behind back malpractices of every kind.</P>
    <P>I am all for efficient professionalism in this whole area of detection, arrest, apprehension and bringing to trial of people.  That is, on the ordinary criminal side, where I think it is undesirable anyway.  Some argument might be made for it by a Minister on the <Col N="842" /> basis that it had existed over hundreds of years even though there is not a single trace of it having been operated in this country in its 53 years existence.</P>

At any rate, I think I am not being extreme in saying that in the two common law jurisdictions of the two islands very few prosecutions on the basis of private arrest have taken <Col N="843" /> place over the past 50 years in regard to felonies.</P>

Whatever justification there might be for such a right residing in a private citizen in the case mentioned by the Minister&mdash;I agree to disagree with him on it&mdash; where you have a private detective organisation within a supermarket, or something of that kind, where the right of arrest may or may not reside, it has not been fully cleared by the courts and that is the point made by the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If we are to have a Bill, to which we object totally in principle on various grounds, let it at least bear some civilised resemblance to a Bill that can be administered by a free democratic State.  Let us not have in it subsections such as I have mentioned that bring in an area of participation on the part of all sorts of non-professional people, in the police sense, in the type of crime that that is envisaged to deal with.  As Senator O'Higgins said this is &ldquo;crime dubbed political&rdquo; or &ldquo;crime-cum-political&rdquo;. This is a very seamy, tough area that is sought to be investigated and dealt with by the Government. I appreciate that.  They are going the wrong way about it. Assuming they are going the right way about it and assuming they want a measure of this kind I do not think they are doing themselves any good by having these two subsections incorporated in this section.  If the Irish State participate in dealing with this intractable and difficult problem let us do it with our own professional police, security and Army forces. Let us have arrests carried out by our own police force on suspicion and without warrant.  We trust the Garda Síochána to do that properly.  We do not trust individuals to do that sort of thing, particularly as it has very seldom been done&mdash;I claim never been done&mdash;since the foundation of the State.

The Minister has explained that as far as the common law rights of private arrest are concerned they apply in the case of felonies.  This replaces that right in the context of the scheduled offences in this Bill.  I wish to put this seriously for the consideration of those who feel, as Senator Lenihan has expressed himself as feeling, in connection with these two subsections. If there is a case where the commission of one of the offences could be stopped no other way than by a private arrest, is there anyone who will disagree with the proposition that in those circumstances the private arrest should be made?

We are giving him precisely the same powers as we give rightly in subsequent sections to members of the Garda Síochána. Therefore anybody can legally and legitimately exercise these powers. Senator O'Higgins is trying to quote the case where somebody comes on a crime.  This applies sometimes.  You do not want to clothe everybody in the State with the right of arrest merely to deal with an offender who is committing a crime.  If I come upon somebody who is committing a robbery or if a man breaks into my house or if I meet a fellow on the street who is after stabbing another fellow I will do what I can as an ordinary citizen to deal with that particular situation.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Higgins made the point that there was only one way of preventing a crime taking place and if you could take that way <Col N="851" /> then would you not do it?  As Senator Lenihan has rightly pointed out, preventing a man from committing a crime is not the same as arresting him.  Leaving that question aside, I am sorry that Senator O'Higgins is not here, but I can put it to the Minister in his place.  Another way of putting it would be, if the Minister thought that the result of this was going to be that mobs perhaps would go along and start trying to arrest whom they, rightly or wrongly, perhaps wrongly, suspected of having committed or attempted to commit a crime, in that case would he be in favour of the section?  One could always dredge up cases on one side or the other and say if this is the only way of doing it or if this is the inevitable result, would you be in favour of it or not?  I do not think we would get anywhere with that. The last point made by Senator Lenihan was that of course if he meets a fellow on the street trying to knife somebody else he would jump on him and stop him; and so he would, and the Minister says: &ldquo;Then you need the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister has not dealt with that situation at all.  The Minister, in a very limited sphere of the law, has brought in these rather curious provisions for arrest by private persons, but where it is a case of somebody knifing someone on the street or robbing a bank or murdering, in the normal sense of the word, he does not provide for this at all.</P>

      <P>The Minister, after a good deal of thought, suddenly dredged up out of his subconscious the example of store detectives.  After <Col N="852" /> all they are exercising their common law rights.  I wonder are they.  I think it is a branch of the law that the Minister might well consider dealing with, regularising the activities of these people in some sort of statute; it might be quite useful.  I strongly suspect that a store detective in fact has no legal right at all but uses a sort of moral power.  To begin with, he is very careful that he does not jump on anyone who is not clearly guilty of stealing stockings or whatever it happens to be and ask them to come back and discuss the matter with the Manager of the store and so on.  In such cases the person concerned, I take it, invariably comes back.  Supposing I were to meet such a person outside a store and he said to me: &ldquo;I have reason to believe that you have stolen a pair of stockings&rdquo;&mdash;or whatever it happened to be&mdash;&ldquo;Come back with me.&rdquo; and I told him where he got off, is he thereby entitled to hit me on the head and drag me into the store and arrest me? I am certain he is not.  If he tried that one I would soon show up his common law powers for what they were.  One of the great problems with this is that it is blatantly obvious and I have the highest respect, as Senator Lenihan has already said, for the amount of expertise the Minister has at his disposal.  It is patently obvious from this memorandum before us in relation to the Bill that the Department of Justice itself does not know what the common law is in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it is patently obvious that they do not know what the common law is, it must be an extremely vague and obscure section of the law.  I would refer the Minister to paragraph 58, page 13, of his memorandum.  It says that subsection (4) of section 19 empowers a member of the Garda Síochána to arrest without warrant anyone who is, or whom he, with reasonable cause suspects to be, about to commit an offence under section 2 (1), again including aiding <Col N="853" /> and abetting and attempts.  Then he goes on to say it is possible that the corresponding common law power in respect of felonies is enjoyed by private persons as well as members of the Garda Síochána, but the subsection follows British and Northern Ireland legislation.  It is possible they do not know whether this is covered by the common law or not.  Again I would refer the Minister to the following paragraph, paragraph 59, where it says that the common law as to powers of entry for the purpose of making an arrest under the powers of arrest for felony is not clear.  They do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in relation to the powers of entry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes but these are two branches of the common law that the assembled intellects&mdash;and they are very considerable&mdash;of the Department of Justice have suggested they do not know.  In other words it is as dead as a dodo.  It does not apply in this country. I suppose it could be said to be in Limbo together with a variety of other obscure statutes dating back to the 13th century and so on.  It is a branch of law that simply no longer exists.  It is doing no good for the Minister to suggest that he is merely re-enacting in this Bill something we have had before. It would appear, in so far as common law exists at all, which is doubtful, that in this section he has increased the powers of private arrest beyond what the common law used to provide. I refer again to paragraph 58 of the memorandum, which points out that subsection (4) gives a member of the Garda Síochána power to arrest anyone without a warrant who is, or he with reasonable cause suspects to be about to commit an offence under section 2 (1) again including aiding, abetting and attempts&mdash;&ldquo;attempts&rdquo;, mark you.  They do not know whether&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so. I think we can do it on this.  It is not certain that common law empowers <Col N="854" /> persons to arrest people who are about to commit an offence, which includes attempts.  The Minister is not certain as he says in his memorandum, whether a private person, in common law, could arrest a person who is attempting to commit an offence.  Yet that is exactly what he has provided in subsection (6) of this section.  It says that the provisions of this section shall apply to an attempt to commit an offence as they apply to the commission of that offence. That is not part of the common law and the memorandum expresses doubt as to whether it is part of common law, this mythical suppositious or historical common law.  But if it exists at all, subsection (6) goes beyond that and is adding to it in a way which it seems was not envisaged in common law.</P>
      <P>The reason for these sections, which are entirely wrong in principle and will quite obviously not be used, would appear to be, as stated in the memorandum in various places where it says that, while the provisions under common law are vague, doubtful and so forth, the subsection follows the English and Northern Ireland enactments of 1967.  Paragraph 55 says:</P>
      <P>The section follows as closely as is appropriate to the subject matter of sections 2 and 3 the provisions of section 2 of the English Criminal Law Act, 1967, and section 2 of the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland), 1967, which conferred powers of arrest consequent on the abolition by these Acts of the distinction between felony and mis-demeanour.</P>
      <P>We are for reasons which are not clear to me following in this respect British and Northern Ireland legislation. That is the reason it is inserted into this section.  Whether this is considered to be part of the parallel legislation which is supposed to be enacted here and in Britain, I do not know. The Minister is not doing this for any particular reason except in so far as he wanted the common law on this subject to be the same in Ireland and in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Listening to all the lawyers talking, one tends to get lost in the technicalities of this Bill, but Senator M.J. O'Higgins was the person who made one point clear to me when he used one extreme in his argument.  Now I would like to use a different extreme.  We have the situation today where political groups are having an inner fight.  Presumably this legislation will be used to stop this fighting.  The forces of the State are protecting certain members of those political organisations.  Using the other side of Senator O'Higgins' argument, we could have a situation under section 1 of this Bill where a direction could be given from the top for any of those organisations to go out themselves and arrest members of another organisation and use the law created by the Minister and the Government and enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  These are the people he is trying to bring into his jurisdiction. These are the people who can use this section to achieve an aim in their own party or in their own organisation. They can use this section to arrest any man, possibly of another organisation and perhaps of his own, for a vindictive purpose.  He can abrogate it solely for his own use.  Are people going to believe the person who makes an accusation or are they going to listen to the defence of the other man?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section can be used against the Minister, against the Government and against the law.  I fail to understand its provisions, as I am not a legal person. Take the instance of two people living down the country having a personal argument, perhaps about the division of land and having nothing at all to do with the contents of this Bill, and one says to the other that he will solve his problem.  One man can go out and arrest the other man and charge him with certain offences. What would happen if they came before the courts?  &ldquo;Any person may arrest, without warrant, anyone who is, or whom he, with reasonable cause&rdquo;&mdash;reasonable cause, mind you &mdash;but it could be a fabricated story. It can happen and it has happened in the organisations that are fighting with one another today.  They do not <Col N="856" /> know what reasonable cause is.  Even if they did know what reasonable cause was, the application of their reason would be entirely different from the application of reason intended by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) of section 19 says:</P>
    <P>Any person may arrest without warrant anyone who is, or whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects...</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that the application of reason by different people gives them power to arrest. This is a fact in my unlegal mind. Sections of these political organisations, for which I have no time at all, will be protected by the police.  The Minister knows how these organisations apply reason and he knows the difference between their reasoning and that of the Minister, who is a reasonable man, but the application of &ldquo;reason&rdquo; is in doubt.</P>
    <P>If the Minister, who says they are protected by common law without this Bill, then do not subsections (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) give authority to the professional people who are capable of exercising it and who are trusted by all sections of the community, and is it not clear that they are the people to do this job and not the &ldquo;willy-nillies&rdquo; who could use subsection (1)?  Why give it to people whose application of reason might be completely different to that of the Minister or, indeed, the vast majority of the people?  What reasoning do they apply when they take a gun from their pocket and shoot a fellow Irishman? None, in my reasoning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Yeats raised the question of the common law powers.  The common law is composed of a mixture of custom and precedent, mainly custom; but it lacks the precision of statute law. There are certain principles of the common law which are clear.  One of them is the right by the citizen to arrest for a felony which has been committed.  There may be some area of doubt, because of the imprecision of the corpus of the common law, as to whether that right extends to a <Col N="857" /> private citizen to arrest in anticipation of the commission of a felony. But certainly all the authorities would be well settled on this point, the right to arrest for a felony committed in one's presence or a felony that one has reasonable cause to believe has been committed.</P>
      <P>An example of that right is the person who is charged with the security of a store or indeed a bank.  If that person arrests a thief, that person is exercising the common law power of arrest.  The common law power of arrest is circumscribed by certain legal requirements that there must be reasonable cause to believe that an offence is being committed.  There must be no more use of force than necessary.  There must be a telling of the person who is being arrested what he is being arrested for.  These are things which circumscribe the arrest to ensure that it is a power which is not used in an arbitrary or frivolous fashion.  It is for the courts to decide subsequently if the power was properly exercised; and if it was improperly exercised, then the person who exercised it is up for assault and also imprisoned.  It is not just a simple matter to say that any Tom, Dick or Harry, as has been said by the Opposition, who takes a fancy can effect an arrest under this section without warrant and without fear of consequence.  It can only be done where there is reasonable cause and that imports all these sanctions that I have described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That power is present in our law, has been there for a long time, a power which has been used in the way I have indicated, admittedly possibly in a narrow way but nevertheless the power is there and has been useful. The very serious offences created by this statute, the extra-territorial offences, are not being made felonies. I have decided that it was as a matter of policy proper that the power relating to felonies should be transported to these offences so that a private citizen would have the power to arrest without warrant.  Again if he exercises that power, he is subject to all the sanctions for an improper exercise of that power or for an <Col N="858" /> abuse of that power, so that every Tom, Dick or Harry who decides to start arresting people arbitrarily and without having a proper and reasonable cause will be subject to legal retaliation for such an abuse of the powers given here.</P>
    <P>In any event the reality of the situation is that the vast majority of arrests that will be made as a result of this Bill will be made by the police force of the State.  It is only in the rare case that the private citizen will exercise the power that is given to him. But as Senator O'Higgins pointed out when he posed a hypothetical question to Senator Lenihan, which Senator Lenihan very honestly answered, there may be the extreme case where the only way to prevent a serious crime against some of our fellow Irishmen in Northern Ireland would be for the private citizen to move and use the power of arrest given to him here.  If it stops one case, the power is well justified.  It is right that it should be retained.  It is not going to diminish the use of the Garda Síochána.  They will be the first line of defence in our battle against oppression. Every citizen has a duty to protect his own society.  This gives him an opportunity to do it.  I hope and anticipate it will only be a rare opportunity, but it should be there for the important occasion when it might arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister just two questions.  If I am informed that a prominent member of the Fine Gael Party is guilty of escaping while under arrest by a British soldier in the Six Counties will I have the power under section 19 of this Bill to arrest that prominent member of the Fine Gael Party, possibly two weeks before an election? The second question is this.  If a person uses the right he is given under section 19 (1) to arrest without warrant anyone whom he with reasonable cause suspects to be in the act of commiting an offence, if that person resists arrest, if that person strikes his arrester and escapes possibly to Dublin, what action will be taken and what provisions are there in this Bill to deal with that person who escapes arrest by a private citizen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first question does not arise because no member of the Fine Gael Party would find himself in that predicament. The answer to the second question is that the person who escapes would be in exactly the same position as anyone who escapes from any other lawful arrest&mdash;he is liable to be arrested when he can be found again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Minister has just said.  There is only one Member of the Oireachtas who was ever found guilty of unlawful use of arms in the State and he is not a Member of the Fianna Fáil Party: he is a Member of the Fine Gael Party.  To add to that, I will give a perfect example of the problems that this subsection could create.  If I <Col N="860" /> or any other citizen of this State, who having been informed that another citizen&mdash;or without being informed&mdash; is guilty of an offence under section 2 of the Bill, we are given this power. We will be in a position to abuse this power.  We could use this power a few weeks before an election.</P>
      <P>Yesterday in England one of the gentlemen who is attempting to topple Reg Prentice in his own constituency was arrested, and charged with some offence.  I know that that is not provided for in this section but it is an example.  I should like to hear the answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if that was an abuse, but I submit that there certainly can be abuses under subsection (1) of section 19.  To me it is a typical example of the incompetence and the stupidity of this Government that they allow this subsection to remain.  The amendment of Senator Lenihan is a sensible and a reasonable one.  If we have a few examples here of arrests by private individuals, the Minister for Justice, if he is still here, and if the Government are still here, will very quickly introduce amending legislation to prevent what will be a despicable habit. The plain and sensible facts are that one citizen of this country who dislikes another citizen can misuse subsection (1) and can arrest the person that he or she dislikes, on suspicion of having committed a breach of this Bill.  It is stupid.  It is uncalled for and if the Minister has any sense he would accept the reasonable and intelligent amendment tabled by Senator Lenihan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the points made, I suggest to the Minister that subsection (1) is certainly open to abuse.  There is no doubt about it.  I itemised an instance which could be used tonight or tomorrow morning, if the Bill were in operation. Does the Minister, do the Government sincerely want a situation like that to be created just to be stubborn enough to insist on the hypothetical <Col N="861" /> reasoning the Leader of the House gave to us tonight?  It is so open to abuse and it is so wide and so far reaching that I feel that the sensible thing for the Minister for Justice to do is to withdraw and to agree with Senator Lenihan's amendment.</P>
      <P>I make that point in honesty because I have only listened to one reasoned argument, which is very hypothetical, by the Leader of the House.  I have listened to numerous arguments on how this subsection is so open to abuse, so open and so wide ranging and so far reaching that one could almost describe a situation where the law was taken out of the hands of the professional Garda Síochána and put into the hands of people whose reasoning is not compatible with that of the vast majority of the people of this island.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister in earnest to accept Senator Lenihan's amendment. If, as Senator Yeats said, the Department of Justice were not quite clear on the drafting of this section why create this new situation?  I am not a legal man, I have no legal training, but I can see the amount of abuse this subsection can create, and the only reason I can see why it is left in and why the Minister is so insistent on it being left in is the reason given by Senator O'Higgins when he threw up the most hypothetical question in answer to all the questions that have been asked by this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I cannot see for the life of me how any citizen can feel safe if these subsections are left in the Bill.  Irrespective of whether the citizen has committed a crime, even if he is a law-abiding citizen, any jealous neighbour or any mischievous person can accuse him and arrest him and say that he has knowledge that he committed such a crime.  He does not need to be true, as we all know.  By doing that he can downgrade that person, wreck his whole career, bring his whole family and all belonging to him into disrepute.</P>
      <P>That is a terrible thing to impose on the citizens of any country&mdash;to expect any people to live in reasonable security with a threat such as that hanging over them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> We have here an Army and a Garda force who are trained, the Garda in particular, in arresting people.  There is tremendous respect for the Garda.  We will bring the Garda into disrepute by doing this because many people will not know whether people who exercise this power are detectives, or whether they are informers.  It is a daft situation in which to place the citizens of any country.  I respectfully suggest that this whole phraseology has been translated from some old British Act or probably out of the British Bill.  It is nonsense to be shoving it in here.</P>

      <P>In a serious Bill of this kind dealing with a highly sensitive matter or area, we have to deal with these details on merit.  I will not elaborate on all the matters that have been mentioned and that I have mentioned myself, but it is a highly sensitive area in which the Minister is seeking, under these subsections which we want deleted, to give private individuals a right of arrest without warrant, on suspicion, which has not existed in practice in regard to the serious offences in the Schedule or of the like of which are in the Schedule, for numbers of years in practical terms.  Certainly it has hardly been exercised at all in the 53 years of the existence of the State.  To introduce these two subsections harms the Bill from the Minister's point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="863" /> Without any derogation from our attitude to the Bill as a whole, I feel that the Minister is doing himself a disservice in persisting with these two subsections.  I would ask him very seriously, between now and Report Stage or Final Stage here, and if not, between now and the Dáil debate, if it ever gets to the Dáil, or over the long hot summer, if he would have a hard look at the whole matter and withdraw the whole matter from the Dáil.  But if he persists in bringing it to the Dáil, assuming that with the machined majority in his favour in this House it passes through this House, if he wants to improve the Bill from the merits aspect, from his own aspect, that he will have a very hard look at these two particular subsections and confine the basic powers of arrest on suspicion without warrant to the accredited force held in high regard by the citizens of the Republic, i.e. the Garda Síochána, and confine these powers to them and not to any willy-nilly individual who for this or that subversive reason or strange reason or psychiatric reason or mad reason wants to fabricate or prefer charges against people in the whole murkey environment of a quasi-revolutionary situation which we unfortunately have in part of this island.  Rather than introduce that element into the law of this State I would ask the Minister to consider the deletion of these two subsections in the mature consideration of the matter and confine the operation of the section as a whole to the Garda Síochána in whom we in this State have the utmost confidence.</P>

      <P>No.  We have debated this at length and I do not consider the arguments put forward from the other side to be weighty enough to justify changing my mind or changing the provisions in the Bill.  They merely specify in explicit statutory form a common law right that has existed for many years and that never gave rise to the abuses of the type painted by Senators Dolan and Killilea.  The legal position is that these rights are circumscribed quite severely and they can only be exercised in a reasonable fashion.  I am satisfied that that is the position that will continue and that it is right that these rights should be reproduced here and that they should be given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of questions that I want to raise on the section.  First of all, I am not clear in relation to subsection (5), the first paragraph of it, precisely what safeguard is contained here for any person who enters the State on foot of a warrant of arrest endorsed in Northern Ireland, and so on.  The provisions would appear to be that if such a person is extradited to the Republic of Ireland, he cannot be faced with any other charge except in cases where according to paragraph (a) there is a warrant duly issued or in the case of paragraph (b) that he has been free to leave the State for seven days at the end of his sentence or the end of proceedings.  I am not making any issue of this, but it does seem to me simply that it does not bring in any real safeguard for such person being accused because whatever about the original situation years and years ago, nowadays police forces everywhere keep in touch with each other and if somebody is being extradited to Ireland on foot of an <Col N="866" /> offence the police forces in all the other countries know perfectly well, they been told that he is; and I take it that there would be a warrant duly issued in Northern Ireland in such cases long before he ever got here.  I am not making an issue in principle on this but I am a bit puzzled as to why it is felt worth while putting it in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an application to a limited extent of the rule of specialty which is a rule in international law to ensure that when a person is extradited he will be tried only on the offence for which he has been extradited, and it is a rather limited application of that rule to ensure that, as set out in the explanatory memorandum on pages 14 and 15, a person will not be proceeded against, sentenced, imprisoned or otherwise restricted in his personal freedom for an offence under sections 2 and 3, not being the one for which he was surrendered unless there is a warrant in force or he has had seven days in which he has been free to leave the State.  It is an application of the rule of specialty in this limited area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection in principle to this.  It does not seem to me that it is going to have any practical effect at all, because quite obviously under these circumstances the various police authorities concerned would certainly keep in touch with each other, I do not think it will have any practical effect because long before the accused arrives on our shores there will be the necessary warrants duly issued in Northern Ireland.  However, it is not an important point.</P>
      <P>In relation to this subsection there is, first of all, a small technical point I would put to the Minister.  In line 19 where it speaks of authorising the arrest of the accused for an offence consisting of the acts constituting the offence under section 2.  Surely that should be &ldquo;an offence&rdquo; under section 2 because there are many offences in section 2 and it seems odd to be putting it in that form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That refers back to the first paragraph.  It is referring to <Col N="867" /> the offence under section 2 referred to in the first paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have a look and I will see whether I am happy that it does that, between now and Report. Now we come to a more important issue raised here by a little word that we had a discussion on several times during the course of these debates and whenever we last considered these matters.  It is the word &ldquo;acts&rdquo;.  The problem which the word &ldquo;acts&rdquo; which appears in this particular paragraph and in other places through the Bill is that according to section 1 an &ldquo;act&rdquo; in the Minister's definition also includes an omission.</P>
      <P>We had a discussion about the implications of this last week and I made the point that an act under certain circumstances, particularly an act to impede someone's arrest, could involve merely a refusal to answer questions from the police.  This has important implications because of the fact that in parts of Northern Ireland the local population do not accept the legitimacy of the security authorities. One may regret that this should be so, but nonetheless it is so.  It also has important implications with regard to the position of a person who is in custody in Northern Ireland for the hearing of evidence on commission. He is immune from legal process and so on, but I made the point that he could be questioned.  I further made the point on July 9th that if he was questioned under these circumstances and refused to answer, as the Minister pointed out he could, he would thereby be committing an offence under section 2 of this Bill. The Minister in reply to this said on 9th July, column 213 of the Official Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Senator Yeats is saying in effect is that refusal to answer a question can amount to an offence under subsection (6) of section 2. In other words, it can be doing an act without reasonable excuse with intent to impede the apprehension or prosecution by the State.  I would ask Senator Yeats to quote where I said so.  What I am saying <Col N="868" /> now is that I have never heard of any legal proposition whereby refusing to answer a question in that sense could constitute an offence under this Bill.</P>
    <P>At column 214 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>A mere refusal to answer questions could not constitute an offence under that section.</P>
    <P>He said the same thing again later on.</P>
    <P>At the time I did not have all the debates with me that had taken place on this Bill.  However, I am now in a position to refer the Minister to the original discussion we had, one that continued at some length about this point.  On 10th June, column 893, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>There could be a situation where silence could be an offence.  For example, that it could impede a prosecution in that there would be a specific question asked: there might be a hunt on, we shall say for a gunman, some person might have knowledge of his whereabouts and deliberately tells a lie or refuses to answer.  That could be a positive omission which in my opinion would be an offence and rightly so because a citizen at that stage would have a duty to assist the forces of law and order.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister was quite categorical on the original discussion of section 2 that where someone who refuses to answer, as he put it, that is a positive omission, which in his opinion would be an offence and rightly so.  We have therefore a complete contradiction between what the Minister said on 9th July and what he said on 10th June.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should be clear in our minds as to precisely what the legal position is of this word &ldquo;acts&rdquo; which appears throughout the Bill and which in the definition section, section 1, includes also an omission, and the implications of this are very considerable.  It is important that we should have a definitive statement from the Minister as to whether he was right on 9th July and wrong on June 10th or <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <Col N="869" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat the position that refusal to answer questions in the course of police interrogation is not an offence and is not made an offence under this Bill or under any part of our law.  The word &ldquo;act&rdquo; includes an omission and that is a normal part of legal definition.  The Extradition Act of 1965 defines &ldquo;act&rdquo; as including an omission.  Perhaps the example I picked in the debate on 10th June at column 893 might not be a happy one.  The situation I was trying to describe was where an omission would be a positive act.</P>
      <P>I am trying to envisage a situation where a person by comporting himself in a certain way led the police to an expectation that that represented a certain situation and that the person knew that the police so interpreted his comportment.  If at some stage he did not comport himself in that way and deliberately changed his comportment or activity or his actions by not doing something he had previously done with a view to suggesting a certain state of affairs or which he knew would be interpreted as indicating a certain state of affairs, that if he changed that for the purpose of positively misleading people, who would make a positive interpretation from the way he comported himself, that would be an act of omission; that would be an &ldquo;act&rdquo; within the meaning of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Yeats' point is essentially a drafting point.  I can assure him it certainly does not extend to a person failing or refusing to answer questions. In column 893 I said, &ldquo;The suggestion is that mere passive silence could lead a person into a position of committing an offence.&rdquo;  I said that is not so.  There has to be a positive omission.  Again, passive silence would be the position of the person being interrogated.  He is entitled to remain passive in face of interrogation but a person is not entitled to positively mislead.  This is something that would depend on the circumstances of a particular case.  It is difficult to exemplify but I am sure if we thought about it we could think up examples in which there would be misleading of a positive nature which <Col N="870" /> would involve the omission of some action which could give a totally misleading impression and be an actual crime.  That certainly would not extend to passive silence as I said on 10th June at column 893.  It is something we can look at again to see if the dangers that Senator Yeats adverts to are there.  I do not think they are.  It is a definition of long standing in our legal code.  If it can be tightened up we shall do so.</P>

      <P>First of all I should say straight away that I am completely at one with the Minister that if somebody has lied to the police he commits an offence.  That is not an omission. That is a positive act designed to impede the prosecution or the arrest of somebody.  That is a positive matter, telling lies to the police.  Equally I agree with the Minister on this, that if the person does nothing at all there is no offence involved.  I am not at all certain that we can be clear on the position where the police come and ask a question and you do not answer. The Minister has confused the issue, first by two totally different explanations of this matter but also even now he conveyed to me the impression, whether he intended to or not, that if, for example, the police came to my house and examined me and I said: &ldquo;Look here, I know all about this matter.  I am not going to tell you now but I will come in on Monday and give you the details,&rdquo; if then on Monday they came along again and I said I would not answer, as I understood the Minister I would be committing thereby an offence, which I think is a very obscure format of events and would be one instance in which a mere refusal to answer questions would be sufficient to constitute an offence.  The Minister is saying that if the police have reason to believe that I will answer and give them information, when I do not do so I am committing an offence.  It seems to me to be entirely unsatisfactory that we should have this kind of vagueness in the law.</P>

      <P>If he is going to look at it between now and Report Stage I am happy.  I will try to devise a couple of amendments for Report Stage to deal with this matter.  The only point I would make briefly is that there is obviusly a problem and the Minister would be better off if he could devise a system&mdash;I will try to devise a system&mdash;whereby this business of an act including an omission did not apply to the specific questions of impeding. I have no objection to other cases where the word &ldquo;act&rdquo; appears but there are certain instances where we should delete this business about an omission.  I will see what I can do on Report and I hope the Minister will think about it between now and them.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 21 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 22.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), line 45, to add at the end &ldquo;after the coming into force in Northern Ireland of legislation guaranteeing the rights of an accused set out in sections 11, 12 and 16.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings us back to matters we discussed on various occasions during the debates on this Bill.  The second subsection of this last section of the Bill has the usual provision that the Act shall come into operation on such day as the Minister for Justice may appoint <Col N="872" /> by order.  I would put it to the Minister, as I have put it to him at various times during these discussions, that he ought not to bring this Bill in until he is satisfied that the various safeguards &mdash;we may feel that they are inadequate safeguards&mdash;in his own Bill are exactly reflected in the corresponding British legislation.  They are not at present adequately reflected in the corresponding British legislation.  I shall not go back over the long discussions we have had on this matter but in respect of the authority given to the accused to bring with him across the Border if evidence is being heard there, his own counsel and solicitor appearing in the court of trial which is in the Minister's Bill in section 16 is not in the British Bill.</P>
    <P>The provisions about the power of the commissioner to release an accused during intervals of taking of evidence are not reflected in equal terms in the Minister's Bill and the British Bill.  The Minister's Bill is more favourable there to the rights of the accused.  The Minister's Bill states that where the evidence is being taken in the Republic the accused shall be in charge of the Garda Síochána or in prison and it says that where he has been delivered north of the Border he should be sent into the charge of the RUC.  Whereas the British legislation says nothing about this and there is no limit at all on the various military and police authorities who could take the accused in charge.  These are the kinds of matters which differ in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is also the important point that the judges who travel to Northern Ireland to hear the evidence being given under the British Bill have no power at all to insist that a question is put to the accused whereas in the Minister's Bill it is specifically stated that where the evidence is being taken here it shall be the duty of the commissioner to put such questions to witnesses.</P>
    <P>These are matters of importance. Particularly they are important because in each case these discrepancies go to the rights of the accused himself. In the form that the Minister has them in his Bill they strengthen the possibility of the accused getting <Col N="873" /> an adequate defence.  In the case of the British Bill they are in each case leaning against the accused.  I would, therefore, put it very seriously to the Minister that he ought to accept this amendment which I would have the benefit from his point of view of enabling him to say to his British colleagues that he is simply not in a position to bring this Act in until such time as they incorporate in their Bill these very safeguards which already exist in his Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already debated at considerable length the points which are implicit in this amendment.  I do not see any point in repeating our arguments at this time beyond to say this to Senator Yeats, that I can assure him that this Bill will not come into operation until I am satisfied that provisions on all fours are contained in the British Bill to ensure a similar regime in both jurisdictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that the provisions are not on all fours in the two Bills.  There are these distinct differences.  I am not able and I have never been able to understand the Minister's extreme reluctance to write a note to his colleague in the British Government and say: &ldquo;Look here, these discrepancies have been brought to my notice.  Would you mind changing your Bill?&rdquo;  I cannot see there would be any problem unless the matter has been raised already and the British have refused to make these changes but I take it that that is not the position.  I certainly hope it is not the position.  If it is the position, the Minister should accept this amendment.  It seems to me that the Minister could without any real difficulty ask the British to make these changes.  The Minister may say they are not important.  I think they are important.  Whether they are important or not does not really matter; they are discrepancies in two items of legislation which are supposed to be parallel, supposed to be as identical as the respective parliamentary draftsmen can make them.  That being so and particularly in view of the fact that these go to the very ability of the accused to defend himself adequately, <Col N="874" /> the Minister has a duty to see that there are not discrepancies of this kind between the two Bills.  I have never been able to make out why he will not do it.  He has never attempted to say why he will not.  The Minister has on various occasions, and again now, said that in his view these matters are not important.  Important or not, I put it to him that it would be a very simple matter to write to whatever British Minister is involved in this and ask him to make these changes.  I have never had an explanation as to why he will not.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) of section 22 states that this Act shall come into operation on such day as the Minister for Justice may appoint by order.  The day chosen by the Minister should be one when he and the people on this side of the Border and indeed many people on the other side of the Border are satisfied that the security forces on the other side of the Border can be trusted wholly, fully and absolutely.  It would be wrong to implement this despicable legislation until such time as everyone in the Six Counties has equal justice as far as the security forces are concerned.</P>
      <P>It is not so long ago since Father Faul wrote to the British Attorney General and stated, and I quote from his booklet <i>The Triangle of Death:</i></P>
      <P>We need a police force that is completely impartial and painstaking in the pursuit of criminals&mdash;from whatever quarter they come.  I feel a police force without these qualities is not only useless but harmful.</P>
      <P>On 26th June, 1973, the British Attorney General's secretary, Mr. T.C. Hetheringson, replied to Fr. Faul and stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The A.G. has asked me to say that from the information he has received he is satisfied that the RUC in Portadown are impartial and painstaking in their investigations and this applies without regard to <Col N="875" /> the religious persuasion of the injured party or the offender.</P>

      <P>At any rate the date chosen by the Minister should be long enough away until he is satisfied that the administration of justice is equal on both sides of this island.  If he brings this Bill into operation on a day prior to that, the time will come when not alone will the vast majority of Irish people regret his action but the Minister will also regret it.  At this juncture it is difficult to know what date the Minister has in mind, considering the Bill has taken so long, I have no doubt that when it is brought to the Dáil it will be opposed even much more strenuously than it has been opposed here.</P>

      <P>A very valid point was made by Senator McGlinchey in reference to this section and the date of application of the Bill.  The Minister made reference to a statement I made as if I were the person who was trying to validate the reasons for all the obnoxious acts that are going on in this country.  I am positively opposed to all those organisations who take the law into their own hands for any reason.  I would not like to be identified in any way with those organisations.  I resent even a slight <Col N="876" /> remark by anybody towards me in that way.</P>
      <P>This Bill is obnoxious; there is no doubt of that.  Public opinion proves that.  When the Minister is applying this Bill he should be very careful to have regard to public opinion.  Senator McGlinchey spoke very clearly and fairly on this point.  There are many instances where people have been tricked into situations by those who are supposed to enforce law and order in the six north-eastern counties.</P>

We cannot have this House, or any other House, totally composed of legally trained people.  There must be people who will speak the common language of the vast majority of the people.  I will as long as I am in this House try to give the plain, ordinary interpretation that the plain, ordinary people will apply to this Bill or indeed to any other Bill.  The timing is the important thing in this order.  If I were in the Minister's position I would not order it at all because it is, in my opinion, obnoxious.  It is also obnoxious in the opinion of most of the people.  I submit to the Minister that, apart from the laughter that may come because of my inability to deliver the exact words, I am delivering to him the exact thoughts that go through the minds of the vast majority of the people of this island.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 15, to delete &ldquo;reform&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;amend&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Obviously an amendment of this nature to the Title, will not affect the meaning or result of the Bill, but I think that the Minister should consider accepting this. He has in the end of the long title the words &ldquo;to reform the criminal law in other respects and to provide for related matters&rdquo;.  I would have thought the invariable words to use on such occasions would be: &ldquo;to amend the criminal law in other respects and to provide for related matters&rdquo;.  The use of the word &ldquo;reform&rdquo; in itself has certain pejorative undertones.  It is raising implications which one might or might not agree with.  I am not making a big thing out of this.  In order to comply with the more normal wording of Bills the Ministers should consider putting in the neutral word &ldquo;amend&rdquo; which is obviously what he is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am following precedent in using the word &ldquo;reform&rdquo;.  In addition, having regard to the measures in the Bill, the word &ldquo;reform&rdquo; is justified.  For example, the criminal law is being reformed with regard to offences of robbery, burglary and aggravated burglary.  These offences in our criminal code by common consent are outdated in their present form.  The change in the Bill is updating them to take account of the needs of modern society.  That is a reform in the sense of a change for <Col N="879" /> the better.  I would define the word &ldquo;reform&rdquo; as being a change for the better, not a change for change sake. That is a positive reform.</P>
      <P>The Explosives Substances Act has been amended by the substitution of two new sections.  These are making it an offence for an Irish citizen outside the State to cause an explosion outside the State or to conspire outside the State to cause an explosion anywhere in the world.  This is not an extra-territorial provision, <i>per al</i>, although it may sound like that.  It is a substantive change in our law. Having regard to the changing pattern of society, the pattern of travel, and the ease with which people can hop from country to country, this is a desirable change and is a reform.  I suppose the words to be used are a matter of style but I think the word &ldquo;reform&rdquo; is apt in this case and there is ample precedent for it.</P>
      <P>The Civil Liability Act was described as an Act to reform the law and the Succession Act was described as an Act to reform the law.  This Bill does reform the law.  I consider that the changes made are for the good. It is a matter for the Oireachtas to decide whether that is right or wrong. Some people may disagree with that and may feel that the word &ldquo;amend&rdquo; is adequate.  I feel that the changes proposed are desirable, good and justify the use of the word &ldquo;reform&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister points out that certain sections of this Bill reform the law.  I suppose one can agree to that.  Obviously there are certain sections that we approve of. There are other sections that certainly nobody on this side of the House could say were reforms at all, which is the kind of reason one would feel that a neutral word would be better. The Long Title of a Bill is supposed to explain what is in the Bill, not to <Col N="880" /> make political points.  I am not particularly impressed by the Minister's reference to precedents.  I have no doubt that there are precedents for the use of the word &ldquo;reform&rdquo; and I am equally in no doubt at all that it is more usual and there are more precedents for using the word &ldquo;amend&rdquo;.  I have had a look at all the Bills that are present before this House, or have been in the recent past and in every case where the word appears at all it is the word &ldquo;amend&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;reform&rdquo;. Certainly I hope that any Minister, even in this Government, who brings any piece of legislation before this House would bring in reforms.  From that point of view every Bill is a reforming Bill.  Nonetheless, most Ministers and most legislation, even from the Department of Justice, use the word &ldquo;amendment&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;reform&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>However, this is not a thing that one fights to the death on.  I can tell the Minister that I have at least achieved an ambition of many years to find an amendment which was in order to a Long Title even though I cannot achieve my greater ambition of getting one accepted.  I would perhaps point out to the Minister that he will certainly have to change the words in the Irish version of the Long Title, which alas, I was not permitted, by standing orders to move an amendment to.  There it is clearly misspelled.  Anyway, I will withdraw this amendment.</P>
