      <P>It is proposed to take business as on the Order Paper, Nos. 1 and 2.  I think I might mention that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is delayed for the moment.  He will be here but I think we should carry on in any event.</P>

      <P>The headline on this morning's paper reads: &ldquo;Sterling Devaluation Hits Worst Ever Level&rdquo; and I wish to put in another plea for early consideration of Motion No, 28, which asks that a select committee be set up to consider the relationship between the Irish £ and the £ sterling. Each time I tried to underline the urgency and immediacy of this motion I have said that the best information available to me indicates considerable sterling devaluation just around the corner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question is whether we go ahead blindly and refuse to think about this problem or whether we actually consider this situation before it arises and decide on some steps that should be taken in that event.  With this in mind the nine or ten Senators who have signed Motion No. 28 are asking that we should consider this, that we should not continue to wait and that we should not try to close the door after the horse has bolted. I feel that, unless something can be done to recognise the urgency and the immediacy of this problem, to people outside Parliament we will appear increasingly less relevant.  This is a problem of such urgency that I would urge the Leader of the House to make an abnormal effort to have <Col N="956" /> this discussion; otherwise we will be faced with the situation in which there is sterling devaluation and the only people who have had any chance to think about our possible reaction to it are the civil servants and the Central Bank.  Parliament will have been denied an opportunity to try to think out in advance what should happen in a situation such as this. Therefore I would ask as a matter of the greatest urgency that this House be given an opportunity to debate Motion No. 28 and that it should be put at the top of the list.  Otherwise, as I said, the whole parliamentary process will become to outsiders more and more irrelevant and less and less in touch with the realities of the day.</P>

      <P>I really cannot say any more to the Senator than I have said already.  Possibly he might take the opportunity of making a similar suggestion tomorrow when we hope to have the Minister for Finance here on the Finance Bill.  As regards the work of the Seanad at the moment, it is a question of giving priority.  I think it will be possible to have the agricultural motion, No. 20, on tomorrow week; if Fianna Fáil are prepared to give way to Senator West we could see if the Minister for Finance would be available.  I cannot say whether he would or not.</P>

    <Title>Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1975: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his opening speech, introducing this Bill, I suppose with certain justification, certainly widened the possible scope of the debate very considerably by his long dissertation on the functions of the liberal democratic state, the function of the press, the function of journalists, the origin and historical justification for violence in our society and the special role of television and broadcasting in our special circumstances.  I criticised this rather narrow focus taken up by the Minister in introducing this very important Bill.  I know all Bills <Col N="957" /> are described as being particularly important but in discussing television and radio one is entering a totally new era of communication.  It is a platitude to say that but it will be momentous in its implications for society.  For that reason society is particularly frightened of it because it has no idea where the road will lead once the liberation of visual literacy supersedes the literacy of the printed word.  I quoted the last day the fears of the great Greek philosophers, writers, intellectuals and academics at the damage which would be done by the development of the printed word.  Of course they were right, because no doubt a totally new society, a new style of living, has been created, destroyed, recreated and destroyed again&mdash;a continual evolution towards we know not what.  On top of this marvellously liberating influence of literacy we now have the enormous power of television and radio and the electronic developments associated with scientific advances in the use of television which, within ten or 20 years, will bring developments which we hardly dare imagine.</P>
      <P>It is for that reason that I find this Bill so disappointing&mdash;because we had the advantage of a Minister having a particularly acute mind, who is wonderfully well honed by his own educational and professional experiences throughout his life and with a special knowledge of the great literary arts. For that reason one did not really expect the very mundane recapitulation of what was obviously a very advanced assessment of the function of television 15 or 20 years ago when the last Bill was introduced.</P>
      <P>Essentially, this is a standstill piece of legislation; it is very much the Bill of an imitator; it is not the Bill of a creative mind; it is not the Bill of an originator; it is a Bill brought in by a man who has completely missed a marvellous opportunity to give the Seanad a discussion document, full of originality with new ideas and proposals, which would provide some kind of stimulus for those Senators interested in these developments and aware of the remarkable advances taking place in social science generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill in its essence reminds one <Col N="958" /> of the 1936 Censorship of Publications Act.  It has about it that kind of Mrs. Grundy-Mary Whitehouse fearful apprehension, the sense of the dangers which are imminent for the uninitiated and the ordinary people&mdash;they are frequently mentioned in the Minister's speech&mdash;and the need for protection of the public interest, in respect of which so many appalling things have been done throughout history.</P>
    <P>This Bill conveys all the time this arrogant presumption that the Government, the creators of the Bill, have some sense of supercilious disdain for the wit and intelligence of those they govern.  This sense of disdain down through the ages has been the hallmark of the benevolent or paternalistic dictator.</P>
    <P>This Bill has for me the strange implication that either the Government believe or the Minister believes that they have some kind of God-given omniscience, a balance or sense of comprehension or, alternatively, that because of the excellency of the Minister's education, background and cultural surroundings he has derived this omniscience through the experience of his life.  Anyway, without a doubt, the content of this Bill puts the Minister above the rest of men; what he can be trusted with is not really suitable for anybody else.  I give as an example the Minister's and Senator Halligan's mock-horror condemnation of Henry Kelly's article about Cathal Goulding and how relieved they were that it only appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash;an élitist minority publication was, I think, the general implication.  It was safe with them because they are some of us, they can be trusted with this kind of information and it could not do much damage there.  But, Heaven above, if it had appeared in the <i>Independent</i> or <i>The Irish Press</i> or&mdash;horror of all horrors&mdash;if it had been broadcast on the radio.  Above all, say one of the interviewers had exposed Cathal Goulding to the full glare of the cameras on television.  We were all assured that the result of that would be armies of men and women would be marching to join the Republican movement, <Col N="959" /> heading towards the Border, streets running with blood, civil war and calamity.  The absurdity of this kind of insolent assumption of the intelligence of the ordinary public.  Was it not clear at the end of that article&mdash; I do not know if Henry Kelly wished it to be clear or not&mdash;that the impression was that Cathal Goulding was a particularly unfeeling person and not a very successful politician?  Most of us derived different impressions from it but did any of us feel like turning towards Cathal Goulding, or to the organisation he represents, and seeking to join it?  Why should we have done that?  Why should anybody have done that?</P>
    <P>One of the most disturbing things about the Minister and this Bill surely is the comparative ingenuousness of his uncomprehension of this whole question of communication and opinion-forming and mind-changing and the influence of television and the newspapers.  It is common knowledge that, in fact, newspapers are extraordinarily uninfluential. At the moment they are operated and controlled in the interests of the wealthy minority in our society and in socialist countries they are equally controlled by the State.  There has been an enormous amount of research into the question of how minds are changed, how minds are formed but the commonly accepted truth is, first of all, newspaper influence is relatively unimportant. The Labour voter in England reads <i>The Daily Express</i> but he still votes Labour.  Similarly, all the <i>Independent</i> readers do not vote right wing and the readers of <i>The Irish Press</i> do not necessarily vote Fianna Fáil and <i>The Irish Times</i> readers vote any way they want to.  It is not the case, as the Minister seems to think, that if Cathal Goulding is confronted with the camera and a compliant broadcaster he will set the country on fire with a fiery speech.  Sometimes I wish it were true, because sometimes I can make quite fiery speeches.  But the simple truth is that people's opinions are not changed that easily.  It is a much more complicated and intricate process and it is a wonderful thing that <Col N="960" /> it is so.  But it is not simply a question of confronting the cameras or the radio with a voice and the result will be that indicated, or that desired by the broadcasting system.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that change does not take place; of course, change takes place as a result of people looking at television of listening to the radio of reading the newspapers.  But the change is not the change looked for. What is likely to happen is that somebody, as a result of listening to a debate or a discussion, will change. They may begin wondering and questioning and they may begin to consider what their point of view is.  A discussion on &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; or some other programme may lead people to begin talking about mining, or gas, or oil or whatever it may be, or contraception or any other subject.  They do not necessarily take the point of view which was put forward on television. It is very much more complicated than that.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the position of the radical is that if he is exposed in discussion whether with Henry Kelly or Brian Farrell on television or John Bowman on radio, in fact, they are the masters most of the time.  They can create whatever end-product they wish to create.  I do not know whether Henry Kelly wanted to create the particular end-product he did about Cathal Goulding but certainly that was the impression I was left with.  We know quite well that in the organisation of a discussion questions are asked of particular people and not asked of other people; the manipulation is endless, not only in newspapers and on radio but also on television. We all know that there is no objective reporting in either the socialist countries or in so-called free, democratic countries.  I suppose the only broad difference between the socialist countries and the western democracies is the puritanical austerity of the socialist countries where one is given the surveillance of the society, the news, the commentary on the news and a very considerable amount of culture in the broad sense as well as in the specific sense in relation to music, opera, theatre or whatever it may be.  So, while there is not <Col N="961" /> serious democratic use of television in either the socialist countries or the western democracies, probably the person who finishes 20 years of watching television in the Soviet Union would in my terms, which are not necessarily correct, be a more cultured person, a more educated person, a person with a better understanding of the arts, literature classics and of music in particular.</P>
    <P>Is that a good thing or is it not? It is debatable&mdash;one has a right to decide whether this is the kind of end product society will be, the one that I decide it shall be.</P>
    <P>This is essentially what the Minister is trying to do in this Bill.  He is appointing a body and then he is providing a very definite authority or censorship power to manipulate this body in the way he thinks is desirable. Anybody in Telefís Éireann listening to the Minister in his many speeches, and particularly in this one, would be a brave man to go into Telefís Éireann and to do any programme he wanted to do; a pro-Provo programme, for instance, or a pro-Official programme, even if he thought it had a good interest value, or, in cultural matters, something that was, say, pro-Fianna Fáil, something that was clearly in direct conflict with what the Minister has laid down in words of one syllable in this speech.  This is the kind of way in which the directions are given in our society, in our culture.  Most journalists and most reporters know quite well what editorial policy is. They know the people who are &ldquo;in&rdquo; and the people who are &ldquo;out&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I remember a journalist friend of mine once telling me about a very distinguished Senator whom the Minister regards very highly indeed, the late Senator Sheehy Skeffington, who used to fight the most lost of lost causes with marvellous courage.  This journalist told me that as soon as Senator Skeffington rose to speak&mdash; in those days he was speaking on very unpopular causes&mdash;journalists simply put down their pencils.  This was blanket censorship of Senator Skeffington&mdash;he would not have minded that&mdash;but what was worse, of his fine, liberal ideas.  This was not any kind <Col N="962" /> of great finality on the part of the journalist, simply recognition of the fact that Sheehy Skeffington simply was not acceptable and the views that he had were not acceptable.</P>
    <P>If you take the socialist side, this is one of the defects that I find in the socialist countries.  At the same time, if I had to make a choice between the kind of material which we get on our television, which I find, beyond the news comment and political comment and discussions and so on, very little value in&mdash;it may be a defect in me more than anything else &mdash;I suspect that of the two, I would prefer the kind of material put out in the Soviet Union rather than in the Western democracies.  I do not know, I have no experience of it.</P>
    <P>We then come to another aspect of the Minister's approach to this problem, which is quite shocking because he is a man with considerable talent and intelligence, that is, his strange assessment of this business of violence, the origin of violence and the begetter of violence.  Violence, like the question of communication, is a particularly complicated question. Nothing is farther from the truth than that this is the responsibility of the broadcaster.  There was a phrase in the Minister's opening speech about the love affair that the broadcaster has and the attraction:</P>
    <P>The broadcaster's professional instinct inclines him towards exposure of what is exciting, even sensational, and to regard possible social effects of such exposure as conjecture and outside his sphere.  It is for this reason that the public interest has to be protected.</P>
    <P>That business of the public interest having to be protected is something I find very difficult to accept from anybody.  I dislike very much the idea of the talking down to the public or the talking down about the public.  I cannot understand this because whatever about myself who is very much an outsider politically in relation to public support in a minority in this country, that is not true of the Minister. He happens to be a Minister and has considerable backing from the public.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="963" /> I have never been able to understand why a person who has so much support from the public should have so little faith in their capacity to pass judgment.  Does he really feel that they are unwise in their decision to treat me as a minority and to give him their majority support.  Have they misjudged the situation and should they change their minds and make me Minister and put Deputy Cruise-O'Brien into the back benches?  Is their judgment faulty?  Can it be trusted?  Is it unreliable?  Can they make dangerous decisions?  Have they made a dangerous decision in relation to Deputy Cruise-O'Brien?  I slightly suspect they have.  That is another question altogether.  This idea of him making a decision as to what is in the public interest is remarkable.  It is remarkable how common this is.</P>
    <P>This is precisely what happened to Prokoviev, Khachaturyian and Shostakovitch in the Soviet Union.  They were accused of discounting the social role of music.  For that reason they were made to write a different kind of music.  It must be very difficult for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to do exactly the same thing with the broadcasters. He used practically the same words: &ldquo;The broadcaster's professional instinct inclines him towards exposure of what is exciting, even sensational and to regard possible social effects of such exposure as conjecture and outside his sphere.&rdquo;  In other words, they really did not appreciate the social implications of their function as broadcasters.  This is essentially completely impertinent.  I could understand it from, say, the Fianna Fáil Party, if they do not mind my saying so, a party which are not noted for their broad liberal conception of the function of politicians in society, or even Fine Gael, if they will equally forgive me for going back over their record and not seeing them as a particularly enlightened, expansive liberal influence in public life in our society.</P>
    <P>This Minister happens to be a member of the Labour Party, a socialist party, James Connolly's party, Connolly who had such faith in the <Col N="964" /> worker and the people.  The people are the revolutionary influence and the workers are the revolutionary class in society.  The Minister will not trust them with their television knobs because they may see Cathal Goulding or Tomás Mac Giolla and so on, who may do terrible things to them.  This Tomás Mac Giolla one is particularly interesting because we have all been told of the dangers of this exposure to these people.</P>
    <P>Senator Halligan began batting the ball back into the Minister's court and I am sure the Minister will deal with it in considerable length and that poor Henry Kelly will have pink ears tonight when he is finished about this monstrous piece of liberal journalism &mdash;getting this man onto the middle page of <i>The Irish Times.</i>  This is a marvellous tribute to the paper, this idea that one should not expose Tomás Mac Giolla or Cathal Goulding.</P>
    <P>This exposure is a particularly good example of the Minister's intolerable arrogance.  He does not seem to be capable of any kind of mitigation whatsoever.  I know I am wasting my time talking to him and talking about it, but I suppose that is what this place is for.</P>
    <P>Take the case of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and this question of Henry Kelly, and <i>The Irish Times</i>, and Cathal Goulding.  I recall well that we in the Labour Party, with Official Sinn Féin, took over the Aula Maxima. There was a public meeting and as far as I recollect the radio people were there.  I am not sure about the television people.  The important thing was that there was a debate between the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Tomás Mac Giolla who, as you all know, is President of Sinn Féin.  I have no objection whatever to Tomás Mac Giolla.  It is his own business if he is President of Sinn Féin.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has the strongest objections, as you know, to Cathal Goulding and Tomás Mac Giolla because they are members of the Sinn Fáin Party.  As the Minister has to a boring extent repeated to us, they have a political arm and a military arm and for that reason they are a bogus political party, a fraudulent political party.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> He said in his speech that in spite of the fact that they continually deny having this military element in their organisation, the truth is that they are a military, pernicious and dangerous organisation, an organisation which must be suppressed and kept off the newspapers.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> there is a scandalous extravagance by Henry Kelly and the Editor in putting in Cathal Goulding.  These people must be kept off the radio and, above all, off the television.</P>
    <P>Yet the Minister chose to arrange for a public discussion and debate with the same Tomás Mac Giolla in which we discussed all sorts of terribly dangerous subjects.  At least Deputy Cruise-O'Brien and Tomás Mac Giolla discussed the influence of the gun in Irish politics.  Many of us, although we did not know it, were in very dangerous company.  All sorts of things could have happened to us on the way home from that meeting.  I did not join Official Sinn Féin and I suspect many other people did not join them either.  In fact it made no difference to us.  It probably reinforced me in my belief that Sinn Féin are not the party which are likely to achieve a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister sees nothing wrong in his consorting with those people and in giving them publicity.  They got publicity because the Minister was kind enough to attach his distinguished name to the meeting.  He drew many people along to listen to Tomás Mac Giolla.  I think that was a very unwise thing for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to do, feeling as he does about Tomás Mac Giolla, Sinn Féin and violence.</P>
    <P>However, that is not really the question which I am concerned with.  It is a much more important question&mdash;the naïve innocence of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in his belief in the origin of violence or the ease with which one adopts violent causes.  It is a complete slander on the broadcaster to say that he is responsible for the violence on the screen.  The truth is that the broadcaster simply cannot put violence on the screen unless it will be looked at.  This is the important difference in relation to the danger <Col N="966" /> of whosoever is put on the screen by the broadcasters.</P>
    <P>The Minister is completely mistaken in believing that if he shows somebody on the screen who preaches or displays violence of one kind or another it will motivate people to violence.  It does not happen like that at all.  The tragic truth is that violence exists in all of us <i>ab initio</i>, from birth. We are all born essentially and necessarily with a certain streak of aggression in us.  Thereafter the development of that aggression and the way in which it develops, how partially or how strongly, is to a greater rather than a lesser extent an environmental one.  There are environmental detriments in relation to the origin of violence in people.</P>
    <P>Our culture is a violent culture. Right from the earliest years we are taught violence.  The sole nexus between the child and the parent, the child and the teacher and the child and its church is an excess of violence, punishment, retribution, anger, rejection and denial of love.  This is essentially the ethos of Irish society. This is where violence originates.  It is in us in varying degrees.  The obviously disturbed people, the parentless children and so on, have excessive degrees of this kind of thing.  The producer on television knows that we want violence and that we must have those dreadful detective things&mdash;the cowboys killing, the hunting and brutality.  These are continually on the screen because they are continually watched.  Television does not create the violence.  We must have the violence.  This is the great tragedy and the great sadness.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is seriously concerned with violence&mdash;the origin and genesis of violence&mdash;in society he has to look elsewhere than to the broadcaster. He is completely mistaken in his views on this question.  I suspect that he knows his mistake and that he is deliberately using the broadcaster as a whipping boy.  If the Minister wants to test this he should recollect &mdash;I do not know to what extent he is hung up on violence like so many of us are&mdash;how many times he would look or whether he would choose to <Col N="967" /> look at a bull fight or a boxing match or a wrestling match or a killing detective story.  Is he interested in these things?  I suspect he probably is not. I certainly am not.</P>
    <P>It is into the lives of the people who are interested in these things that a Minister of State should be looking and not this absurd narrow-focus preoccupation with whether Henry Kelly writes about Cathal Goulding or Brian Farrell talks to Tomás Mac Giolla about the Convention elections.</P>
    <P>The Minister is completely mistaken in his views on this.  He knows he is mistaken and he is deliberately using the journalists' profession, and the broadcasting people in particular, for the reason that the Minister knows quite well that the young IRA man did not simply appear out of a cloud.  It is not simply a question of a virgin birth, an appearance there where he was not before.  He is the product of a culture.  He is the product of home; he is the product of parents; he is the product of schools and, of course, of his religion.  All of these things the Minister knows as well as I do because I happened to have heard him discussing these questions.</P>
    <P>He knows quite well, by hearsay; I know because I am a product of these schools.  I have said this before and I am saying it again for the benefit of the Minister: if he had been to the Christian Brothers and to the Marist Brothers, as I have been, he would know that it was there that we learned about the activities of the British over seven centuries.  It was there we learned about their cruelties, about the appalling things they did to our people, of the imprisonment, the Famine, the whole litany which everyone knows very well.</P>
    <P>It was from our teachers, it was in our schools, that we learned about this violence.  It was there that we learned to hate the British.  It is as simple as that.  &ldquo;Hate&rdquo; is the correct word.  It is a long time since I was in school but there is no doubt that I left school with a very deep hatred of the British and of all that they had <Col N="968" /> done in Ireland to our people.  I learned it from my teachers who were Christian Brothers and Marist Brothers.  This is the truth, and the most interesting thing is that the Minister at one time used to give vent to this belief, used to express the belief that that is where we learned about the terrible things that have been done in Ireland, that is where we learned to hate.  We did not learn it from the broadcasters.  We did not learn it from the television.</P>
    <P>In hunting the broadcasters, in hunting the Henry Kellys, the journalists, the Minister is being the petty, cowardly, bully-boy poltroon which he expressed so much contempt for.  He knows quite well that what he should be doing is asking &ldquo;What is going on in our schools now?  Who made us into the gunmen, the bombers?  Are they still doing it?&rdquo;  If they are still doing it, what is he going to do to stop it?  A section in a broadcasting Bill is an easy way of doing nothing whatsoever because he said in his speech that the broadcasters could avoid it, they could get around his silly section and his silly Bill.  If he had any serious concern, if he was not afraid of the domestic consequences in terms of domestic politics of really dealing with this subject he would go to his Minister for Education and tell him that this had led us into civil war in the North, to the edge of civil war here in the South and in God's name do something about it.  He is afraid to.  It is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>Flog the broadcasters, accuse them, they are the whipping boys and they certainly cannot do him any damage electorally.  He is a cowardly man essentially.  One of the facinating things about people who condemn violent people so completely is that they themselves have resorted to violence in their own time.  We know that.  The Minister has believed in the gun&mdash;has he not?  I remember a picture of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, I think in his pyjamas, in a troop carrier during the bombing in Katanga.  It was politic to be a soldier then, a man of violence then. I do not object to him doing <Col N="969" /> whatever he did then.  It was not very clever, apparently, but it weakens the case of an individual who spends his time indulging in sentiments and sanctimonious homilies to these other men of violence who are men of violence for a very good reason&mdash; because they were educated to be men of violence.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister secretly and behind closed doors&mdash; presumably he will not do it in public &mdash;would be prepared to examine this position, what the position is at present in the schools.  It is a very much more powerful influence than the occasional broadcast on television.  I have a young grandson who tells me of the terrible things that the British did to us.  He is going to school in Connemara.  The Minister has young sons going to school.  What is happening to them?  Are they playing with guns?  Are they learning about guns? Some day would it not be a dreadful thing if one of us&mdash;myself or the Minister&mdash;were to hear a Minister, a thoughtless, callous Minister, describe my son or his son as a murderer, a product of these places, simply because we did nothing to stop it happening? That is all these youngsters are, but we taught them to do it. What have we done about the history books?</P>
    <P>Is it not a fact that the reason these young men feel that the only way they can achieve their objective of a united Ireland by violence is the failure of politicians of all parties? There are political solutions.  There are Bills we should be discussing here. I have mentioned them many times: divorce, contraception, marriage Bills, the organisation of society to provide for full employment, political solutions to the problem of the North, preconditions to the solution of the problems of the North, all of these things.  The Minister knows quite well that the most serious setback, I would imagine, to the whole cause of Northern unity occurred here or in the other House when the Taoiseach and Deputy Burke, the Minister for Education, supported the defeat of the Contraception Bill, not in relation to <Col N="970" /> the issue itself but in its implications, the total failure of the Government to initiate the steps towards pluralism in society.</P>
    <P>What marvellous opportunity the Minister has in relation to broadcasting? Should he not have seized the opportunity of using the whole mechanism of broadcasting to educate our people into acceptance of different standards, attitudes and values which would make it possible for them to see that if they want to see a united Ireland they must make concessions, difficult concessions for them?  The more I listen to Senators speaking on these delicate, sensitive issues, the more I appreciate how genuinely sincerely concerned people are.  But they are totally wrong if they believe we could move towards unity with the obscurantist views we have about these very important issues.  Above every other medium, the television could have been one of the most important in its educational function.  It could have made a really serious contribution towards enlightenment of our people in preparation for acceptance of the various legislative proposals which should have been introduced by this Government but which they have failed to introduce due to their simple cowardice, failure, their refusal to face the demands without a doubt implicit in politics in the Republic.  But this high sounding, high-falutin' sermon which the Minister goes on with ill becomes him in the light of his and his Government's complete and consistent hypocrisy on these issues.</P>
    <P>One continually hears of the uncompromising Northerners.  There is nobody more uncompromising than the southerners.  They make no concessions. The Minister gives a long sermon on the question of the liberal state, the democratic state, and the right of the democratic state to protect itself.  That would be all right if it were not for the fact that in his time the Minister has said the most dreadful things about the undemocratic, illiberal quality of our society.</P>
    <P>The Minister is astonished that people should not accept this as a democratic state.  Only two years ago <Col N="971" /> on a Bill which went through the Dáil and has not been repealed, he said: &ldquo;This Bill is a fraud.  It is not needed for the purposes it purports to be needed for.  These laws are now a mockery and an unnecessary encroachment on our ordinary lives... does not support law and order but in fact brings it into disrepute, because it obliges the court to convict people without what is regarded as evidence in common law&rdquo; and so on. Only two years ago, he thought this was a very illiberal, undemocratic state, and he is there on the record to prove it.  This continual talking with so many tongues is very confusing. It is obvious that one cannot really believe anything the Minister is saying at any particular time because it changes so rapidly and so unpredictably, that it is something which depends simply on the expediency of the moment.</P>
    <P>I do not know as much as I would like to know about it, but perhaps the Minister could tell us in his concluding speech about Holland and the system that is in use there.  I understand that the broadcasting facilities are available and all sorts of people with controversial, conflicting ideas are allowed to make a film and then allowed the use of the studio facilities in order to put their point of view across.  That strikes me as being a wonderful idea.  Of course, Holland is notoriously advanced in its views and is a very civilised and enlightened community.</P>
    <P>There are two small pinholes of light in that way here in Ireland. One of them is Bob Quinn in Connemara. He has a small telerecorder and he is able to go around and make films of different issues, a dispensary, or house, or someone's fishing problem or whatever it might be and it is possible for him to show the recording in a club, pub or hall.  That is one small toehold in democracy in relation to television in Ireland.  The other, of course, is Ballyfermot where they hijack the cable system and are allowed to put over their programme for an hour a week.  This is of extraordinary significance.  I wonder whether the Minister has either missed <Col N="972" /> its significance or recognised its significance. I would like to know, because this really is the beginning of the full implications of what broadcasting will be 20, 30 years from now.</P>
    <P>This attempt by the Minister and by the Soviets and other people to impose censorship cannot be done.  It will not be done.  There are no methods known to man in which you can continue to censor or suppress. Because of the advances in telecommunications it is not going to be possible simply to say: &ldquo;You may not show this programme and you may show that one.&rdquo;  It is very like the 1936 Censorship of Publications Act. Looking around the shops now is it not remarkable the wonderfully varied choice of books available to all of us by every author under the sun.  We can read anybody we want to now.  Those of us who have been any time at all in public life recollect the absurdities of the Censorship of Publications Act in which there was hysterical suppression. This is still true in some of the socialist countries and it is true in some other countries.  However, the fact that we have improved our technology and expanded industry, presupposes literacy, so that people can learn to become electricians, cabinet makers, engineers and so on; and because there is literacy, that is the end of the intellectual captivity implicit in censorship in the 1936 Act which is now in the wastepaper basket.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a real Mrs. Grundy, or Mary Whitehouse.  It is astonishing really for a man with the liberal pretensions of the Minister that he should allow his name to be associated with the proposals in this Bill.  He should understand the revolutionary changes, inseparable from the expansion of telecommunications, in understanding people.  The miniaturisation of the equipment, and the advances that allow you to carry 200 channels in the one cable will make big nonsense of the Minister's attempt at censorship. The sad thing is that he has not given the advantage of the enormous amount of information which must be at his disposal in order to tell us about these things.</P>
    <P>Unless I am mistaken&mdash;and I know Senator Robinson referred to it as well <Col N="973" />&mdash;section 17 is going to stamp on this tiny little shrinking violet of expansion of liberal thinking on attitudes in Ireland because section 17 will make it impossible&mdash;unless I am wrong and the Minister will, I hope correct me if I am wrong&mdash;for these private television stations to operate.  This is censorship again.  This is the appalling, oppressive censorship, the fear of Socrates that once they get to read, Heaven only knows what they will start thinking.  All of these dangerous socialist and communist ideas, liberal attitudes, subjects like therapeutic legal abortion, homosexuality, contraception, divorce, pluralist societies, will have to be discussed.  They are not discussed due to this total suppression upon our television.  They do not exist, as we all know.  They are invariably discussed in very tight blinkers, but they will come to be discussed.</P>
    <P>The Minister is suppressing this development instead of encouraging it, because it is of course a dangerous thing.  People like myself have dangerous beliefs which fortunately are sweeping through most of the countries in the world, Asia, Africa, and so on, and which will eventually filter through the Emerald curtain.  The public will get access to them, because the only thing that is stopping the public, in my view, accepting them is the fact that they are not allowed to hear them. They will eventually be allowed to hear them, but not if the Minister stamps on this very delicate development in relation to personal, private television. This is really like the prevention of the development of printing presses, the prevention of the printing of books, papers and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister is full of illuminating illustrations as to his private mind and his public mind.  Sometimes they are one.  Sometimes they are not, but this is another occasion in which they are one.  For instance, on his way to talk to us about the liberal ethic here and democracy the other day on the Second Reading, he took the trouble to vote in favour of the expulsion of a group of people who are running a small little leaflet called <i>The Liaison Bulletin</i> in his own party.  Again all it was doing <Col N="974" /> was putting out a different point of view to the Minister's.  This is something he felt should not be tolerated. It was only a few hundred but at the same time it was dangerous.  This kind of intolerance&mdash;which one hopes he did not pick up from his sojourn with Nkrumah and will not have a lasting impression on him&mdash;is something which is rather frightening, because the liaison document is relatively unimportant. The important point is this kind of intolerance of the dissentient point of view.  I was interested to hear Senator Halligan's dissertation on democracy and the liberal ethic too.  It was appalling humbug, because he was in the process of doing the same thing, stamping on this particular little document and also responsible for running a conference in which the dissentient voice is given two minutes and the others are given as long as they like.</P>
    <P>This, I suppose, is common form in political parties.  It can be particularly dangerous if the Minister abuses the enormous power he has, especially in the times that there are now in which I am sure, as things become more and more difficult, he will become more and more tempted to impose these kinds of strictures and sanctions.</P>
    <P>Then there is the broadcasting scheme in Ballyfermot.  Senator Robinson was worried about this point, too, and I have great respect for her beliefs on these things.  Would the Minister clarify that point?  Will it be necessary for other communities like the Ballyfermot community group to pay enormous sums for a licence in these circumstances?  It would be very retrograde if that was the case.  It would be just like the strictest of strict censorships.  I cannot believe, in the final analysis, that it would be effective.</P>
    <P>I believe that a broadcasting authority should be appointed and thereafter allowed to run the enterprise, and I do not think I am being unreasonable or unrealistic&mdash;that delightful word of the hard-headed politicians.  I find it difficult to understand why a broadcasting authority cannot be permitted to accept responsibility and to leave it at that.  I can understand the Minister appointing <Col N="975" /> one or two civil servants to the board, but thereafter I do not see why the Minister, as a politician, should continue to hold responsibility in this way.  I did not take that idea just out of the air.  No doubt everybody on the board will be scions of the Establishment, reliable, reputable people of the Establishment, and have <i>bona fides</i> beyond question.</P>
    <P>I have had occasion to deal with different but all very costly schemes, something in the region of £20 million or £30 million, £120 million or £130 million, I suppose, now.  I took this particular approach with the various bodies which I established: the Blood Transfusion Board, the Cancer Association, the Rehabilitation Board, the BCG Board, the Mass Radiography Board, St. Loman's Hospital Board, the Meath Hospital Board, and so on.  Many of them worked without interference.  We had civil service representatives on the board.  We drew up their articles of association, we gave them the authority, gave them the money and let them get on with the job.  They all performed their functions extremely well.  Some of them have gone out of business because they accomplished the task for which they were established.</P>
    <P>I do not see why the same procedure cannot apply in relation to broadcasting. This is the way I would have gone about the task, but with the added proviso that the members of the board responsible for television should be nominated from different representative groups, the trade unions, universities, public authorities, and not by safe place men nominated by the Minister.  The various groups, the professional bodies, journalists and so on, should, in an attempt to introduce democracy into the television service, be given the right to nominate their representative on to a governing body for television.  This would achieve some measure of evolution of the over-centralised authority which the Minister seems to favour so much.</P>
    <P>I do not see why the Minister could not adopt a scheme of that kind and thereby lay the complicated and difficult task of running a broadcasting <Col N="976" /> system on the shoulders of those various people.  There is virtue in the fact that, first of all, there is the responsibility of the individuals concerned and, secondly, that these people know what the public want and like. They do not have to depend on the university don sitting back in his chair and from time to time, tut tutting about what they are having or are not having.  The origin of power would come from the people.  Surely it is time that we did more than pay lip service to the whole idea of democracy, instead of this long speech which one gets from some poor young lad who has been through all the authorities, penned it and then got his girlfriend to type it out.  All these platitudes, clichés and great names and wandering through the world of telecommunications are totally irrelevant. I must confess that I do not think the Minister applied his sharp mind to this question.  I wonder if this is the same speech as the man read to us 15 or 20 years ago when he was introducing the same Bill except the rude words about journalists and the Provos&mdash;I suspect they were not included.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will think again about section 17 and be careful on the question of allowing community television services to develop. It is excellent certainly in Connemara and I am sure Senator M.D. Higgins and Bob Quinn will know that; the same can be said about Ballyfermot.  It is a wonderfully unifying force and is extremely stimulating and exciting for the community. Obviously television will develop along these lines.</P>
    <P>However the board, like the rest of the proposals in the Bill, is totally unimaginative and mundane.  Old Queen Victoria or the Vice Regal Commission could have produced something similar.  I do not know what the position is within the Cabinet but I suspect the Labour people have very little power, but once upon a time we talked about the virtues of the democratisation of these great institutions, and there was nothing more exciting or more fruitful in its repercussions on our society than this particular institution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> I am astonished about the proposal on BBC 1.  I cannot see why we should facilitate BBC 2 around the rest of the country.  If BBC 1 wished to be seen around the rest of the country, let them get on with it, but for a national television service to take over, <i>in toto</i>, the television service of another country and transmit it is the most remarkable proposal I have ever heard from a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  He comes up with the most bizarre proposals from time to time.  One would like to know the rationale for this extraordinary proposal.</P>
    <P>What on earth have these people in common with our people?  There are obviously some very fine programmes in BBC 1.  There are also very fine programmes on the French, Italian, Czechoslovakian, Russian and, above all, Irish radio&mdash;Radio Telefís Éireann.  Radio Telefís Éireann produce very good programmes.  They suffer from a shortage of money, but that is not their fault; it is the Minister's fault.  The technicians are there; the technocrats, the professional people are there; the artists are there. Anybody who watches Telefís Éireann knows that.</P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary that the Minister should lash the unfortunate broadcasters in Telefís Éireann for their love affair with violence when it has nothing to do with them at all.  It is like saying that the advertisers have a love affair with violence.  Why do the advertisers who want to sell soap powder or some other commodity like detective pictures? Because people like to look at these dreadful detective films.  It is the people who need to be examined when we study this question of violence, not the broadcasters.  The Minister's attack is totally misplaced.  He is completely misinformed in his allocation of blame in this respect.</P>
    <P>The odd thing is that the Minister appears to be prepared to facilitate BBC 2 programmes going out all over Ireland completely uncensored.  What is going to happen our censorship? Why should he censor Radio Telefís Éireann?  We shall have to debate this one of these days.  Why should he <Col N="978" /> censor Tomás MacGiolla or Cathal Goulding, or worse still, both of them together?  The absurdity of it; it is quite ludicrous.  However, this is what may happen one day.  The Minister would send his ukase across.  Telegrams would flash out all over Ireland. We would all be brought back from our various summer resorts.  We would have to come here to debate this appalling sin of commission by the broadcasters.  They had shown these terrible people on Telefís Éireann; they had spoken to them quietly and listened to their replies. As a result of this broadcast, we had the corruption of the community. Then there is the poor Minister for Posts and Telegraphs attempting to mop up the disastrous consequences of the exposure of the community to ten minutes of this kind of viewing.</P>
    <P>What happens with BBC 1?  What happens if Mary Holland gets a job in BBC 1?  Suppose she decides she would like to talk to Ó Brádaigh, or Daithí Ó Connaill or Cathal Goulding or even myself?  I might even get on from time to time.  What happens then?  The poor Minister would sit in frustrated impotence in his Cabinet office or in his ministerial room watching this frightful stuff&mdash;much worse than he would see in <i>The Liaison Bulletin</i>, the Ballyfermot Community Service or Bob Quinn in Connemara.  There would be dreadful stuff coming in from BBC 2&mdash; Mary Holland talking to all these people and putting terrible ideas into the heads of poor Irish simpletons, the ancient and historic Irish people and he not being able to do anything about it.  Should we put a section in this Bill which would allow us to call Parliament together should Mary Holland get a job on BBC and ask for her removal so that we do not have this exposure to seditious and subversive groups on our television?</P>
    <P>What is the Minister going to do about this?  We cannot be sure that the BBC will stay as it is.  If Enoch Powell becomes Minister, anything can happen.  The Minister, I am sure, is very surprised to see himself where he is.  Anything can happen in politics; that is the marvellous thing about it. <Col N="979" /> Suppose he becomes all racialist and says the Irish are all Paddys and Micks and should go home.  Suppose this is what we get out in Connemara, Limerick or Kerry or wherever it may be, what is the Minister going to do about it?  It is a very dangerous step to hand over authority to a foreign country to shower our people with anything they want to produce on dangerous subjects such as contraception, therapeutic legal abortion, divorce, free love, pluralist societies. What is the Minister going to do about all that?</P>
    <P>It is not very logical for the Minister to behave in this extraordinary way. The interesting thing about BBC is this, as I said last week.  Sir John Reith made it quite clear that BBC was an institution within the Establishment. When there was any trouble, there was no question of anything except the conventional attitudes of the English Establishment getting across.  I am sure the Minister knows that and does not have any illusions about it.  I am also sure he does not believe for one moment that the BBC is a democratic or liberal institution. It is the most hidebound, rigidly conventional right wing establishment of all the television establishments.</P>
    <P>As a Labour man, a socialist and a trade unionist, the Minister might like to know that there is no democratic control within the BBC.  It is very much an elitist, middle-class, bourgeois establishment in its control and in its operation.  No attempt whatever has been made to get any kind of democratic control in television in Britain.  The ACTT, the television and cinema operators' trade union, is attempting to do something about that.  At present it is very hard to know why the Minister should lean out from our shores and pluck out of the air this television service at great cost.  Some other Senator dwelt on the point of what it will cost.  It will be an enormous sum for what I consider to be a very mediocre fifth rate service.  That is merely my judgment and it may not be a good one.</P>
    <P>The Minister is going to do this. What are its merits?  What has it to <Col N="980" /> offer?  In January, 1971, the ACTT were worried about both ITV and BBC.  Mary Holland apparently was at fault on that occasion from the union point of view.  They monitored a certain period when they were fighting the Industrial Relations Bill.  I am sure everyone remembers that.  The texts of the protests, the strikes, the lock-outs, the pickets and so on and the commentary by the commentators were monitored, recorded and analysed in terms of content and language.  This was motivated by their earlier experience of similar strikes when the power workers were involved.  They came up with the unsurprising conclusions that the newscasts had been used to produce an emotional bias against the workers by concentrating on interviews with doctors using kidney dialysis machines, incubators and so on.  There was no attempt whatever to give a fair coverage to the trade union and workers' side of the story.  One could make the same charge about the programme on tanker drivers the other night.  The unofficial people should have been on that programme but I suspect they refused to appear.  It was a very good programme.</P>
    <P>The ACTT found that this is a very partisan television service.  And this is the television service&mdash;BBC and ITV &mdash;which the Minister proposes to make available, in spite of the fact that we have the most highly talented writers, artists, cameramen, producers, announcers in the world.  They are first class people.  They went away and learned their jobs.  All they need are more opportunities to make more programmes, and they will do it with pleasure if they are permitted.</P>
    <P>Our broadcasters are simply ordinary people.  Although many of my left wing friends do not agree with me, I think we are rather lucky here.  For various historical reasons we have a classless society.  I know they are doing their best to try to create one but broadly speaking this is true.  We are all first generation peasants.  We all had an ordinary education through the national schools.</P>
    <P>The same criticism cannot be made of Irish broadcasting as of BBC broadcasting. BBC broadcasters are mostly public school people and middle class. <Col N="981" /> Without meaning to be, they are hostile to workers' interests.  This is what they learned in their public schools. I know because I was in both public and national schools.  I know every side of the story.  They were educated to believe that the worker is always wrong.  Whatever the reasons for it, this is the truth.  The Minister is now proposing to give us this kind of a service.  I do not see why he should go to the trouble or expense.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give Telefís Éireann the opportunity of going around the world, not just Europe, and getting a block of the finest programmes from the States, the socialist, African and eastern countries, and above everything, telling our own people to maximise the home content and giving them the money to do it.  Above everything, do not squander on imported programmes the money which is in such short supply.</P>
    <P>I must apologise to Senators for having taken up so much of their time.  I happen to be particularly interested in this subject because I consider this medium of broadcasting and television to be potentially the great determinator for the future character of culturist societies.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not give us an opportunity to discuss the technical possibilities as well as the intellectual and cultural opportunities of giving a lead, even in this component of our society, to other countries.  In common with virtually everybody else, except the Dutch, he has a fear of the people, a fear of democracy, this pitiful use of words like the &ldquo;preservation or the protection of the public interest&rdquo;, &ldquo;concern for the public interest&rdquo; and &ldquo;the public welfare&rdquo;, which essentially is preservation of their own position within society, their sense of insecurity, their inability to recognise that the public is much more capable of advanced and enlightened thinking than they gave them credit for.</P>
    <P>That could have been acceptable in the old days when the level of illiteracy in our society was very high. For that reason one had to appear to be the father figure, pat people on the head and tell them what <Col N="982" /> was and was not good for them. That is no longer so and is completely out of place with the Minister, who purports to be a member of the Labour Party.  He shows a reluctance to discuss this.  I referred last week to the general failure of the Left throughout the world to try to come to terms with the fearful challenge of television and broadcasting generally. This has been dismissed as a rationalisation of their own fear&mdash;the fear of the Left&mdash;that they are dealing with something beyond their capacity to handle.  This is a powerful force with a multiplicity of differing ideas which in some way have to be controlled.  We have seen attempts made by different countries to introduce socialism&mdash;the eastern bloc countries, central European, middle eastern, African and Indian countries.  Relatively speaking&mdash; perhaps this is something which may take centuries&mdash;they failed to give the people the real power to control their own destinies.</P>
    <P>This was an opportunity for the Minister to allow us to discuss the possibilities of creating a democratic type of governing authority and to try to let go the power he is retaining to himself.  It was there in the old Bill and was acceptable at that time when he was dealing with a different people, society and culture.  Standards and values have completely changed, largely because of the influence of television.  It will be changed even further in the years ahead.  It is complenty retrograde of him to have attempted to keep this enormously powerful medium tethered.</P>
    <P>I will conclude with one remark. Man knows himself only as much as he knows the world.  He knows the world only within himself, and he is aware of himself within the world. Each new object truly recognised opens up a new organ within ourselves. This is what Goethe says.  The true meaning of the enormous power of television is implicit in this comment. It is sad that the Minister failed to recognise it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>After so many hours of debate on this subject, I do not think there are any new points of <Col N="983" /> significance I can introduce at this stage.  I compliment the Minister because he introduced this Bill in the Seanad.  As a Senator I feel proud we got the first opportunity to debate it. It is not the first time a Bill has been introduced here, but nevertheless it adds to the status of this House that the Minister has introduced this Bill which is getting the consideration that it deserves.</P>
      <P>The Minister was very honest and open in his introductory remarks.  He asks us to comment truthfully on what he had to say.  For that reason, I intend to leave politics completely apart and tell the Minister what I honestly believe on this subject.</P>
      <P>Having listened to so many hours of debate, one could easily get the impression that this subject possibly was bigger than it is.  It is an important subject.  It is another aspect of our existence.  It is another important means of communication and education. While the Minister approached this subject with the importance it deserves, nevertheless I do not expect him to cover every facet of our existence. This is just another cog in the wheel.  The Minister in his introductory remarks has accepted it as such.</P>
      <P>I am most concerned about open broadcasting.  Whether we have one, two or three channels is a separate question.  I would ask: What is the value of the extra channel?  What could it do that our television station will not?  What will be the cost of providing that extra channel?  As a nation, can we afford it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Senators have pointed out that we have in some areas a choice between four stations while in other areas they have only one.  I would not place too much emphasis on this.  I do not see this as an inequality crying out to be remedied.  I see many much more serious inequalities.  Geography did not divide up things equally here leaving us all, from the south of Ireland to the north, in the same position. They have better land in some areas.  They have good harbour facilities in other areas.  They have the advantages of minerals and employment and such things in other areas. <Col N="984" /> There is not a serious obligation on this State to provide the people of one area with a second channel just because the people of another area happen to have it.  I would consider a second channel on its own merits&mdash; what it would cost us, what the result is likely to be, and whether we can afford it.</P>
    <P>Going back to the question of open broadcasting, the most important problem we have at the moment is the disunity that exists within our country. When I think of television and the media the first question that comes to my mind is how we can solve some of our problems through this most powerful means of communication. That, to me, is the most important question to be answered.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his introductory remarks that negotiations with the British authorities were at present going on to see if we could have open broadcasting.  I wish the Minister well in his efforts to secure this.  I think it is most important.  Many of our problems are due to an appalling ignorance on the part of the average person, and particularly the majority within the Six Counties, of what exactly life is like in the 26-county areas, what our social attitudes are, what our economic position is, what sort of freedom we have, and so on.  Many problems in this country stem from the gross ignorance on the part of the majority in the Six Counties as to what life is really like down here.  I am not saying that we know much more about the situation in the Six Counties but in the Twenty-six Counties, we have closed our eyes to many facts of life in the North, to the reasons for our separation.  Nevertheless, we could achieve much if we could, for a few years, succeed in providing the people of the Six Counties with a service through which they could learn more about us.</P>
    <P>Some speaker mentioned this aspect and referred to the situation in the United States with regard to racial segregation.  I have noticed, in the areas of the Six Counties that are closest to us and where they have Telefís Éireann available and in the <Col N="985" /> northern area of the Twenty-six Counties where there is a choice of channel, that people with Unionist tendencies will be much more informed about programmes and happenings on UTV than they will about what is on Telefís Éireann.  This is very noticeable and well worth considering. I am not blaming them for this.  I do not say that they should look at Telefís Éireann and not at UTV.  I do not say that it is disloyal of them to adopt this attitude.  I am just pointing out that in a situation of open broadcasting, where we seek to bring about the sort of conciliation that I would hope for, we must take into consideration the danger that each group of people will watch what it wants and listen to what it wants to hear.  For this reason, this subject must be very carefully considered and fully discussed.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a solution arrived at.  But we are not making any contribution along these lines by providing the BBC with the facilities to be heard and seen in every part of the Twenty-six Counties.  I have watched the various programmes; I do not see myself or the people in my own area at any risk.  I am surprised that the Minister, when introducing a Bill of this sort, has not some comment to make on what he thinks the effects of open broadcasting in sizeable areas over the past number of years have been.  We have a different situation if there is a section of the country with BBC available than if BBC were broadcast to all the country.  It must, necessarily, change the attitude of the people in charge of that station to know that they have an audience in an entirely new country with less competition than in Britain.  Because of this, the views and attitude of the BBC may not be the same.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne has pointed out that there is no control in the BBC and he regards it as a highly-biassed station.  I am not sure about it being biassed but the fact that there is no control certainly concerns me.  I am not the type of person who would come in here and tell the Minister that there should be no control in <Col N="986" /> Telefís Éireann, that there should be no control in the press, and so on.  I do not believe that.</P>
    <P>There are many things we could do in broadcasting in common with the people of the Six Counties.  In a recent private discussion with farmers of the Twenty-six Counties the leader of a farming organisation in the Six Counties pointed out the disadvantage they were under when they had interests which conflicted with the British who negotiated terms on their behalf in the Common Market.  He suggested to our farmers that he knew that he was not in a position to put any pressure on his own politicians to bring about the sort of situation that would be more favourable to the farmers of Ulster.  He hoped that Irish farmers would put the pressure on our Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to get these things.  This is a situation where people have much in common. In this respect many educational programmes in the field of agriculture, marketing and so on could be shown. There is a situation where the farmers of the Six Counties and the farmers of the Twenty-six Counties have much more in common than the farmers of the Six Counties and those of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The same applies to entertainment. When one listens to UTV one must remember that it is not an Ulster station.  It is really Independent Television. Listening to some of the programmes which originate in Ulster one can sit back&mdash;speaking as one who comes from the west of Ireland&mdash;and enjoy the music and songs from the Six Counties area.  I know of no farmer in the rural areas of the west of Ireland&mdash;and I am sure the same applies to the people of the towns&mdash; who would not sit back and heartily enjoy a programme of songs and music from the Glens of Antrim.  The people of the Six Counties could likewise enjoy the sort of programmes which are produced on RTE if they were available to them.  Not only culturally have we so much in common but economically there is every reason why a station servicing the two areas could be very successful.  It would require very careful negotiations. <Col N="987" /> It would require much effort and tact on behalf of our Minister. This sort of effort is what I would have in mind if we were to talk about open broadcasting rather than what the Minister is suggesting here.</P>
    <P>As I said previously, I do not believe the journalists, the television authorities, those who write and produce our television programmes should have the ultimate right to decide the type of programme we should see.  It is all very well to say that we are a classless society, but I do not believe that a farmer or a businessman from a small town in the South, will feel, in the company of these people&mdash;journalists and so on, from Montrose on a social occasion that he is meeting the same type of person, that he is listening to the same points of view, that these people hold the same attitudes and beliefs as people at, say a meeting of a chamber of commerce in some of the smaller towns of Ireland or at an IFA, an NFA or a Muintir na Tíre meeting.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable difference between the attitude and the outlook of the people who run our newspapers and television and the ordinary people throughout the country.  They are powerful forces about which we are speaking&mdash;the press and television &mdash;and let nobody deny that.  Some people have sought to deny it and at the same time tell us they are powerful forces.  I have listened to Senators say that television or the media are not responsible, that they do not change anybody; next minute they blame the biassed programmes. I am consistent in this and believe that the media and the press change attitudes.  If there is not proper control over these things and these people a situation could develop where not the elected representatives of the people but those in the media could condition, control and direct public opinion.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised the question of violence and the IRA and I will speak on these later.  In recent months, we had a man escaping from custody with the aid of a pistol that was found <Col N="988" /> in a cistern and I believe this idea came out of a very well-known film. I saw a film where explosives were used to blast out doors.  This was before the prisoners escaped from Portlaoise in that way.  I know films and television have a great effect on patterns in our society and particularly on violence.</P>
    <P>The question of freedom of the press arises not only in regard to violence.  I went to a county council election and to by-elections, one in Cork and one in Galway, one in Monaghan.  I knocked at many doors and I was asked by many people about different subjects.  People are not shy or bashful, when you knock at their door on election day, in raising the point that they want you to consider.  If somebody here or outside raises a subject like &ldquo;the pill&rdquo;, the chances are, ten-to-one, they will make the headlines on every one of our national papers the next day if they are of any importance.  Yet, during those elections, on all those doorsteps nobody ever mentioned the subject to me.  Judging by the attitude of the press on this subject, one would think it was something everyone in the country was concerned about, that every housewife, young boy and girl were waiting to see when the Government would make this facility available to them.</P>
    <P>This is only an example of the sort of campaign that I honestly believe the press and the people associated with it can run on behalf of a particular cause.  I do not say they are dishonest or wrong in their attitudes, but they are quite prepared to&mdash;and have in the past&mdash;push and fight for causes the majority of people do not believe in, do not want and were not concerned about.  The press have led people to believe the country was on fire with zeal about causes when, in fact, nobody at all was concerned about them.  This is one of the reasons I feel obliged to reply to the debate which argued for complete, unfettered control of the press.</P>
    <P>I know that more abuses than the kind I am talking about arise.  For instance, I was meeting some very level-headed, shrewd people in a producers' <Col N="989" /> organisation recently.  These people produce a product which is scarce and dear at the moment.  There is no need to advertise it, no problem at all about selling it.  Somebody suggested we ought to launch a publicity campaign and have press coverage, and radio and television advertising for the particular product. When somebody questioned it, he said: &ldquo;Look at the situation we had two or three years ago.  Who ever heard of a beef promotion campaign?&rdquo; Nobody had heard of it.  The fact was that the media in Britain and the United States attacked this product and forced down the price of it.  Our friend was advising that the other producers' group should run a campaign in case the product would be attacked by the media.  That sort of situation exists.</P>
    <P>I do not know who reads <i>The Irish Times, Irish Independent</i> or <i>The Irish Press</i> but I know the average person, reading a particular article, sometimes has not sufficient experience or scope of knowledge to make him wise to what is behind some of the headlines. I have heard many thousands of people say: &ldquo;Such is a fact; I read it in the paper&rdquo;.  One is inclined to retort: &ldquo;Who wrote it in the paper?&rdquo; They will admit they do not know; it was said in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, or <i>The Irish Press</i> or it was on television.</P>
    <P>This is an example of the fact that the media are powerful.  People can write under assumed names&mdash;The Jobber, The Drover, the Deputy, the Senator&mdash;we hear of all these names. But behind all these articles there is somebody.  In the most recent Seanad by-election campaign, I had experience of a particular paper setting out to further the cause of a candidate. I read the article and it shored up the cause of this candidate while at the same time pulling down a section of Senators in this House.  I knew who wrote that article; I would not have to be told who wrote it; I would know the cut of his hatchet, as we say in rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>Our friend, the writer, set out to make a case for a Senator who was not of his party but seeing that he was not writing under his own name, nobody knew who he was.  They did not know he had been at one time a candidate himself and got only three or four votes.  They did not know he was a personal friend of the Senator whose case he was pushing.  This is the kind of abuse I am talking about.  I only give this as one of thousands of examples I know about.</P>
      <P>I heard about two years ago a bank manager quote to a businessman the situation in a particular trade.  When he proceeded to make his case why money should not be given to this particular business he quoted a particular paper on a particular date and again this was a journalist speaking to a man who had a very vested interest in that particular business.  I will not elaborate on that but privately I would love to tell you, and you would laugh, at what the true situation was. Yet, it was a businessman confronted by a bank manager with what he had read in a paper from a journalist who had got it from a man who had a complete and total interest in the subject and had every reason to be biassed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For all these reasons, I believe the media, the press, television and radio, are in a very powerful position.  I never want to see the day when these people would take precedence over the elected representatives&mdash;the people who run the country.  We say the Minister ought not to have a say or to interfere.  But the Minister is answerable to somebody: the Minister has to be elected and he has his Government to answer to.  He has the people to answer to.  The people of the press, for whose freedom and rights to say what they like and when they like we are fighting, are answerable to nobody.  In the final analysis, the only <Col N="991" /> thing they are answerable to is finance &mdash;if the paper fails to sell, if the advertisements do not come in and so on.</P>
    <P>It is very rash to say these people do not affect public opinion.  Only three or four months ago at the time of the Portlaoise hunger strike I was listening to an interview with a journalist on the subject of what was going on and the danger of somebody dying on hunger strike and what was likely to be the people's reaction if there was likely to be an outbreak of violence.  The journalist replied that he did not think there was likely to be large-scale violence but there could be attacks on isolated Garda stations and such things.  I would regard that as detrimental to law and order, as encouraging people to commit acts of violence.  It was nothing short of putting violence into people's heads.  It was not a question of putting an idea in a man's head that was dangerous; it was giving people the impression that such violence was imminent.  This was what was dangerous about it.  It is not merely a question of putting bad thoughts into somebody's head.</P>
    <P>The Minister dwelt, as was only right at this time, on the special political situation with regard to the Six Counties, the question of violence and the IRA and so on.  That was only natural.  At another time the Minister might introduce a Bill similar to this and the problems might be very different. Nobody is so wise that he can legislate for any period into the future. We must always be in a position to reconsider and review our laws.  The Minister is taking this specially into consideration at this time and I think he is quite correct in doing that.</P>
    <P>He talks about the whole question of violence and the IRA.  It was interesting to hear the comments of some of the Senators on this subject. Some of them blamed our educational system and some people blamed the media, I would say, in that they said &ldquo;These things have happened in Asia and Africa.  What do you expect our young men to do?  They have seen examples of what has happened and it is only natural that they should <Col N="992" /> take this particular line of action.&rdquo; I do not purport to be an authority on the IRA but I purport to know as much as anybody about the average fellow who stands outside a polling booth on behalf of the IRA at the times when they decide to participate in the democratic system.  I have often met them and talked to them. If there is anything I am completely convinced about it is that the vast majority of them have not really studied the situation.  I do not say that they are all thugs and murderers. I do not, but listening to the people who support the Provisional IRA I am completely convinced that the vast majority of them have only a remote idea of what Irish history was about. They think that Irish history consisted of the Battle of Kinsale and the Battle of the Boyne and the Rebellion of 1916 and that in between all these things we were lying under the British yoke, that they were oppressing us.  There may be an element of truth in that, but you need not blame any educational system and say that is the reason why we have the Provisional IRA in existence at the present time.  It is not because they have learned the lessons of history or observed what is going on around the world, because I am completely convinced that the people who support the Provisional IRA at the moment are not aware of what is going on around the world or its significance and I am also convinced that they have a very poor knowledge of Irish history.</P>
    <P>But if I were to blame the educational system and say that the educational system in this country was completely responsible for what has happened, what conclusion could we draw when only 1 per cent or 2 per cent of our people support the Provisional IRA?  Where were the others of us educated?  I think the vast majority of us certainly were subjected to a very brief and very inaccurate outline of Irish history, but nevertheless most of us are able to weigh up the situation at the present time in the light of history.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about calling a spade a spade and says that a murderer <Col N="993" /> is a murderer.  This is a subject that always interest me.  If I might just for one minute give the Minister my views on this, I do not believe that every man who joins the IRA is a murderer.  I do not believe that everybody who kills in the name of the IRA is a murderer, any more than the people who have fought in wars and executed criminals and done all the other horrible things down through history were murderers.  I know there were murderers among them.  I know definitely that the taking of human life is murder to some degree but I believe that there are people in that movement who genuinely and honestly believe in what they are doing.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with them.  I would agree completely with the Minister about what should be done with them, that they should be controlled, locked up and kept out of harm's way and prevented from doing damage to themselves and their fellow men.  I know they are wrong.  I could quote here the Rev. William Arlow who took part in the Feakle talks.  I would not call them all murderers and I think it is naïve and dangerous to say that.  I do not quote him because I am not convinced in my own mind that my views are correct.  I quote him because if anybody might accuse me of having any sympathy with those who kill in any circumstances, they certainly cannot accuse the Rev. William Arlow of being irresponsible in any way.  I would only say that much to the Minister with regard to the whole question of violence and the IRA.</P>
    <P>Far too many people in our society have some sort of regard for what can be achieved with a strong arm, by the gunman or the physical force people.  I do not know whether this is a weakness in our human nature, part of our educational system or just that history has led us to believe these things.  I believe that there is a great combination of reasons why such is the case and I know there is in the vast majority of people&mdash;most of them will not admit it&mdash;a sort of a sneaking regard for the physical force man, the man who can achieve things with the strong arm, the man who can bring about things by the power of the gun. <Col N="994" /> This is quite common throughout society, probably not only here in Ireland but throughout the world.  In our evolution, in our educational system, in television and broadcasting we should seek every possible means to take people along the road to civilisation away from this attitude and further away from this sneaking regard.  People condemn the IRA today and tomorrow if they bring off something brave or bold, people are inclined to smile behind their own backs at it and be convinced that it was a very brave thing to do or it was well done.  In our media and television we have an obligation to correct this sort of weakness.  It is a weakness and most people here who have pointed out that television has a responsibility in this regard have been quite correct.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of rebroadcasting the BBC, I do not believe that this is the right thing to do. For all the reasons which I have stated I believe there ought to be some control on broadcasting.  If I believe that there should be control on our own journalists, or our media within our own State, how much more must I believe that there must be some control and some supervision on what is broadcast and what is published in this country from outside of this State?</P>
    <P>Since the trouble in the Six Counties began I have observed what has been said and the attitude that has been adopted on some of the British stations and papers.  I am not convinced that the British media are disposed to be completely fair and unbiassed. There are several considerations: we have conflicting interests as far as Europe and European policies are concerned at the moment.  We can have and have had conflicting interests as far as the Six County situation is concerned and we can have conflicting interests from an economic point of view.  For all these reasons I believe the free and uninhibited broadcasting of BBC is not the best thing.  I greatly admire many of their programmes: they do so many things well.  I am not in the slightest afraid that they will squeeze out our own <Col N="995" /> television station because, while they may have more money and resources at their disposal, our people can equal them in anything.  Furthermore our own people have the advantage of knowing to a far greater extent what Irish tastes are and what the Irish people are likely to want to see and listen to.</P>
    <P>But giving the BBC leave to broadcast whatever they wish to this country is not a good idea.  Where economic or political matters are concerned the United Kingdom can be quite biassed.  We all know that they will defend their own at all times whether justified or not.  I have been very annoyed at some of the programmes shown on BBC but I should like to see some of the programmes being transmitted.  If we are to make any moves towards open broadcasting I would be more concerned to have the co-operation which would result in a sharing of ideas and cultures between the Twenty-six Counties and the people of the North than having a station transmitted directly from England.  Whatever funds are available at present should be channelled towards providing a broadcasting service which would bring Irish people closer together.</P>
    <P>With regard to the control which the Minister proposes to take, it is reasonable that he should have it. There could be many proposals on this matter but I am sure those of the Minister are as good as other ones. However, I disagree with the Minister on the subject of rebroadcasting the BBC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to begin, like other Senators, by thanking the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for introducing this Bill in Seanad Éireann and allowing us to debate broadcasting, communications and technology.  I also want to join with other Senators in paying tribute to the Minister, not only for his decision but for his personal commitment in the past to a belief in the plurality of culture.  Indeed the Minister has also gone on record on many occasions as believing in the essential and great <Col N="996" /> necessity for the tolerance of a multiplicity of views of reality.</P>
      <P>I share the view of the last speaker, Senator McCartin, in that what I wish to say is not in any way party political. They are my own views on broadcasting, communications and on decisions which must be taken in the very near future.</P>
      <P>This has been a magnificent debate. Many of the contributions have been of a very high quality.  However, there are two conditions which affect the debate.  The first is that most political theorists and a majority of political practitioners, both generally and in this country, have not sorted out for themselves the relationship which must exist between applied science, technology and political systems.  Indeed, as I reflect on legislative instruments, not only in this country but in most&mdash;and I use the word in a qualified sense&mdash;modernised countries, one must remark that legislation in the area of communication is essentially reactive.  It is as if science produces an ability to develop a content or form of technology, which is perceived unproblematically for a certain period and then, somehow or another when one seeks access to influence on a general audience a certain problem is presented for society.  Put more simply, if I might give an example, two people are playing with the idea of inventing wireless; wireless to such people might consist of trying to communicate with canisters and string.  They are regarded as merely cracked; successfully cracked if they imagine they are hearing each other.  There is no problem yet.  But suddenly it is possible for an individual or individuals to make generalised comments to a generalised audience.  Society reacts.  What right has he to say what he likes to all these people?  What is the effect of what he is saying?  We must have control.  Is he dangerous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is then a reflection on the area of political science that our political thought is reactive.  It is, in fact, one of the sad conditions of political practice that when you abstract a general opinion from the particular area of communications you see then <Col N="997" /> that man, in legislative practice, has been able to take away freedom, constrain, strip away freedom rather than create freedom.</P>
    <P>Broadcasting must be considered within the general context of communications. And in turn discussion of communications must take into account the attitude which society has adopted towards technology.</P>
    <P>We have avoided any discussion over the years on the relationship between science and technology, a subject discussed by Raymond Williams, for example, in a distinguished fashion in his recent work <i>Television.</i>  It has also been discussed by a number of recent writers.  The questions raised are&mdash;Is the communications network neutral? Should the communications network be useful?  Should the communications network be subversive?  When I use the word &ldquo;subversive&rdquo; I use it in its more general application in critical theory, that is, an attitude of mind which calls into question the general or the orthodox point of view; that is the seeking out of elements in the orthodoxy which might provide an alternative concept of life in any form of art or practice. Indeed, that argument has gone on with regard to art for some time.  Is art manipulative?  Is art an expression supplied for entertainment or is art subversive?  Bourgeois art is to my mind inescapably and hopelessly irrelevant. Revolutionary art, art that is rooted in social experience, is of its nature subversive, critical and relevant.  It engages thematically the contradictions of an age.  Where we have faced these questions what have we said?  What might we say?  If, for example, my colleague, Senator M.J. O'Higgins, were answering them, I am not being unfair to him if I said that his view of communications, even technology in general, would be that it probably should be useful.  He would be dubious about it being neutral and he certainly would not have communications be subversive.</P>
    <P>The reason is that he holds a view of life as defined by a single reality. He is a conservative, and I respect his viewpoint, he believes in a version of reality&mdash;referred to frequently in his speech which I reject.  Indeed Senator <Col N="998" /> Russell in his contribution developed this point in his assault on that paragraph to which I shall return in the Minister's speech in which he referred to the concept of philosophical anarchy; anarchy in any of its forms is not acceptable to Senator Russell.</P>
    <P>Well as someone who has a more lingering relationship with the concept of philosophical anarchy and its manifestations than the Minister and Senator Russell, I want to say that I believe in a world of multiple realities. If you believe in that, in a culture which allows for multiple realities, then you would want the broadest possible expression of opinions.  I believe as well a point made by Senator Horgan in the notion that truth will out in an atmosphere of the dialectical exchange of views.  Perhaps I am taking a chance.  You will say: Indeed I am. Given the choice of living with opinions that make me unhappy or an unarticulated acceptable point of view which will guarantee order and peace at any cost, I would come down on the side of the former.</P>
    <P>I must say I was extraordinarily impressed by the peculiar insight which Senator Killilea has into society and human nature in general.  He said that not only Irish people but all people at all times were affected by television and that it was the simple purpose of television to entertain.  It is just as well that he is not present because undoubtedly what I have to say would bore him&mdash;and appear tedious.</P>
    <P>I believe it is legitimate in a discussion on communications technology to discuss the uses of communication. For example what particular weight do we give to entertainment, explication, exposition, education or critique in Irish television?  These are not petty questions.  Neither are they discrete, separate from one another.  If I might give an example, entertainment and education; it is only in a world that does not really believe in the dignity of experience that these are divided, that you have people locked in schools for part of the day watching films or playing football for the rest of the time&mdash;the notion of let education take up one part of <Col N="999" /> one's life, recreate oneself in another is based on the division of labour forced on us by the social demands of the economics of greed.  Then, if one asks must there be a division of personal circumstances from social circumstances, of course not, one must ask the fundamental question as to why things are like they are at a particular time.  This is the exercise of critique to attain relevance.  You might at some particular time want to exercise your critical ability to ask the question what kind of norms are influencing my own behaviour, are influencing the class to which I belong, are influencing this period and will influence people in the future?  Criticism of course has been driven away from the educational sphere.  Education is not only divided but is a challenge to entertainment.  But even in a world divided in all of these things, there are alternatives.</P>
    <P>Before television and before broadcasting we had to rely on conversation. People in a conversation respected one another.  They entertained one another.  They told one another about challenges in the past, the prospects for the future, all in a dignified way.  It was very friendly.  The institutionalised expression of a mad division of labour that satisfied the greed of an accumulating elite through history drove people to this insane division, as Max Weber referred in 1920 to the cage to which people would be confined.  He was looking into the future.  His rather depressed view suggested that capitalism is our inescapable condition.  Socialism is the enemy in his opinion to rationality, and rationality of course becomes bourgeois rationality.</P>
    <P>Again, in a later passage in <i>Economy in Society</i> he said that total bureaucracy is an inescapable reality. Yet we have accepted total bureaucracy unquestioningly, and many of the repressions of capitalism have thus become an inescapable reality for us. We cannot judge the role of our television network outside of that great intellectual capitulation.  These questions have not been examined in any great depth.  We have thrown away <Col N="1000" /> the blueprint of our prisons, our mental prisons.</P>
    <P>Another question not examined in the debate so far has been the role of creativity.  What kind of person is the artist, the creative person who works in radio, television, newspapers? What kind of person is the journalist?  There are a number of opinions on this.  For example, Senator Browne who has been speaking referred to where the Minister in one part of his speech, said that the journalist had a leaning towards what was sensational.  I am anxious to debate that.  This leads to consideration of what influences the professions in life generally.  There are at least two divergent views concerning creative people in journalism, in radio, in television.  One is that the craft itself creates certain norms which affect behaviour.  Therefore if you are in a condition and a place for a certain time, there are norms associated with the craft which influence your attitudes, your behaviour, your life in that area.</P>
    <P>There is the suggestion that the practice of journalism generates norms which become the practice of the profession properly understood. I reject that view.  I believe in the alternative view of the professions expressed by critics and by conflict theorists.  For example, at any time a person with a particular skill is explicating through his individual consciousness the themes that are current in our society, the position of classes in relation to one another at a particular time.  I reject the notion of there being a specific professional consciousness.  There is a class consciousness, articulated, avoided or ignored.</P>
    <P>To return to my four introductory questions: should the communications industry and radio and television within it and technology itself in the broader sense, be neutral, useful or critically subversive?  The second relates to communications in Ireland now in the context of how you answer these questions; thirdly, the divisions and uses of communications themselves; and fourthly, our definition of the role of the creative artist <Col N="1001" /> within the communications industry. All of these are real questions.  They are the basic questions, prior to questions of management.</P>
    <P>These kinds of questions will irritate a number of people.  It is not my intention to make a very long speech because you would suggest I make it elsewhere, but I ask these questions at the outset of what I have to say on this debate because I believe such questions to be crucial.  If we do not answer such questions and we are forced to legislate, deciding that they are either unimportant or that they may be brushed aside or that they are not worth an answer, what are we doing?  We are drifting and we are merely responding in a rather hopeless way to situations as they might develop.</P>
    <P>But worse than that, we are doing something else.  We are tacitly moving ourselves even further, more centrally into the great drift of domination that is going on in the world.  To ignore those questions in a Third World country at the present time would be an act of total irresponsibility.  Not to ask them in a country that is more developed materially, but not in other ways, is also irresponsible.</P>

      <P>Before the tea break I had been speaking of four areas in which I suggested society had not sufficiently raised questions, questions that were crucial.  These were questions concerning the role of technology, as to whether technology was neutral, useful or, as I mentioned, critically subversive.  Secondly, I mentioned that any discussion of communications had to take place in the context of how you answered those questions.  I mentioned the unfortunate social-historical circumstances in which a division had come between the entertainment, explicative, expository, educational and critical functions of communications.  I had also been discussing the role of the artist in communications, the principles of creativity, and suggested indeed that there had been two views on this: one, that the craft or profession generated <Col N="1002" /> its own norms from atmosphere or conditions and, secondly, that an individual was a product himself of social history and that his individual expression and consciousness was a mere expression of social consciousness, of the great thematic contradictions of a period.  I had suggested that I held the latter view.</P>
      <P>I had said that we had avoided all of these questions but that they were really unavoidable.  In the absence of such questions the kind of answers one developed would be irresponsible. For example, questions concerning the role of communications in the Third World could never be answered adequately unless you could answer those other questions I mentioned as well that we would be equally irresponsible if we avoided them.  It is not my intention to go into detail on these.  I want to say something tonight about the kind of attitude which ignores such questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was my pleasure last week to listen to Ivan Illich speak on the role of institutionalised education in society.  To hear him speak to the medical profession about the future of their profession was an interesting experience.  It was as if a man had come amongst us speaking about diseased institutions of which we knew nothing, that we really did not care.  Indeed, a number of people who came along to listen appeared somewhat to me as people coming for therapy, teachers who wanted to be reassured.  After all a teacher is a teacher, and they were not doing anything very injurious, that a doctor really healed people and so on, and that Ivan Illich really did not mean all he said and having asked a few questions they could go home more comfortably.  They did not.  I want to say that that kind of visit, the idea that you have a visiting scholar to regularly jog you into asking questions that you should be asking all the time yourself, is an example of the insult that society structured as it is, has given itself.  I mentioned the manner in which a previous society had collapsed all of these divisions into one, these divisions of entertainment of explication, exposition, education <Col N="1003" /> and critique.  I said that these activities unified and indistinguishable were the principal components of a dignified conversation in society at other times and still are where societies have not been vulgarly subverted into an acceptance of an unquestioned consumer society.  It is a great pity that we would brush aside questions like this, that we would never ask, will we become the victims of technology or control technology? Will we not ask, what is the role of communications or will we become merely people reacting or responding to communications?  We are lazy, perhaps.  More accurately we are afraid.  This is irresponsible.  The visit of Ivan Illich was rather like a visit of a circus to a rural area.  Circuses are wonderful things.  When adults go to circuses they laugh; they remember what it was like to be free from care. I myself enjoyed circuses when I was a child.  I still do.  Ivan Illich is one of those people who asks questions that strike at society so deeply that he has taken on not the image of a rogue sociologist but rather the image of a clown.  He is the travelling circus clown among the world of the intellectuals. We will never ask these questions but we will import people like that regularly to entertain us. This is the kind of society that has been developed.  It is absolutely useless to my mind to discuss communications and broadcasting without facing up to these kind of values questions.</P>
    <P>At an oil and gas seminar recently, because I questioned the utility of leaving untapped resources under the sea until we knew what kind of a world in which we would use them, it was suggested by an economics correspondent that I was playing at God. It is not my intention or inclination to play God.  I would ask why the questions I raise&mdash;I am not suggesting that they are majority questions; they are questions of the minority of people and a minority to which I belong&mdash;are ignored in a discussion on broadcasting and communications.</P>
    <P>In my tribute to the Minister at the beginning, which I sincerely meant, <Col N="1004" /> I said if you have to throw away a great deal of what one might have hoped and if you have to make pragmatic decisions it is best that they are made by a man with intelligence rather than by a man unencumbered by intelligence. I do not agree with the Minister in the way that he faced his task, but I thank him again for making this debate possible.</P>
    <P>The last reference I will make to the neglect of crucial questions concerns communications at a basic level. The wireless came from nowhere and had to be contained.  Television happened and had to be governed.  Schools were built and have to be run and heated.  People have to be transported to and from them, sometimes on narrow roads.  Institutions happen.  Human thought must adjust itself.  That kind of society is not accidentally created. It is created on the necessary demands of an elite philosophy that human potential must be written off in the interest of the narrow, short-term greed of the few.  It is the hard price to be paid.</P>
    <P>This creates a great vacuum in your life.  You all of you will never know fully what it is to be a person.  Classes of people will be written off for all of their lives because a few insist on retaining their position.  For that reason people translate what might have been magnificent human beings into fictional figures.  They become the regular characters in fiction.  We read books, fiction, about what might have been a liberated people in an alternative society.</P>
    <P>The question of cause and effect between a technology and a society, a technology and a culture, and a technology and the psychology of creativity, I have been discussing.  Why are these connections not discussed?  Some people would say there are huge difficulties involved of a historical and social kind.  Some people will say there are pressing matters of the day affecting control, operation and content of radio and television which must be made.  As people have said to me on many occasions, there is a time and a place for everything: Let us get on with the business of legislating for radio and television and you can discuss these somewhere else, some other <Col N="1005" /> time.  The deeper questions are regarded as a luxury for analysis, an analysis which must take second place to immediate demands.  I wonder how one can discuss the operation, control and content of broadcasting in such a vacuum.  I suggest it is not only inappropriate but intellectually absurd to make the attempt, an exercise in social irresponsibility by omission.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of these difficulties. In an interesting speech he seemed to me to have answered many of the questions about the connections between society and the State, culture and technology, and the place of these kinds of questions within the general area of social values.  His resolution for himself of these tensions becomes more apparent in the assumptions underlying his answers to the seven crucial questions he poses himself rather than in the selection of the seven questions which he does not explain adequately to me.</P>
    <P>The questions as selected are questions concerning vital matters in the State.  They are questions concerning continuity and order rather than social change.  My own views, being freer from many of the constraints that are on the Minister must form on the kind of questions I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister's seven questions are crucial ones in a number of ways.  His questions are: Has the democratic State the right to pass repressive legislation?  Has it the right to restrict freedom of expression? What limitations should apply to such rights?  Should the State have greater rights in relation to broadcasting than the press?  What limitations should there be on the State's rights to intervene in broadcasting, and when we speak of freedom in broadcasting, whose freedom do we mean and how is it to be defended?  Finally he asked, what are the present circumstances which affect the prudent application of these principles?</P>
    <P>These are seven crucial questions and the Minister has in a very lengthy speech answered them in a particular way, but might I draw attention as <Col N="1006" /> to how my four questions affect his answers?  The Minister speaks on the question of repression, without having considered who will control technology and, in question 2, concerning freedom, can one speak of freedom without addressing oneself to the question as to who is affected by, who is in control of, and who initiates technological innovation?</P>
    <P>In turn, concerning rights, is it not necessary to ask before that question can be adequately answered of the relationship between society and science, how can he speak of freedom when he the Minister, has operated in a vacuum, a vacuum not of his creation? In the history of this State when people tried to tease out the meaning of freedom, they were told those questions belonged somewhere else: &ldquo;We want pragmatic decisions of the day,&rdquo; we were told.</P>
    <P>There are people in society who have a vested interest in not answering the kind of questions I mentioned earlier, indeed who have a very strong vested interest in ensuring that they will never be asked.  They are the people for whom society rolls along with its inevitable degrading effect, degradation for the many, wealth and profit for the few.  There are others who experience our own passion for freedom and dignity in social relations and our demand for the use of resources in the interest of genuine human aspiration.</P>
    <P>We, at any stage, regularly can ask ourselves the questions ignored for so long.  But the questions recur in a simple way regularly.  There are versions of these in the ordinary conversation of people in the street.  When a woman, for example, says that she does not understand what is happening any more, when some character in a play asks the meaning of all things, it is not a despairing, philosophical utterance but rather the expression of a loss of relevance in their own world.</P>
    <P>What the Minister inherited, then, is a situation really where all the questions in technology and communications concerning freedom had been ignored.  I am not so sure that he is <Col N="1007" /> right to have restricted himself to these seven questions that he picked. In his place I should have begun with a general discussion of technology and communication.  I should then have moved to these other questions.  Let me turn to where this Bill speaks of such norms as objectivity.</P>
    <P>Why are we now discussing the objectivity of journalists rather than the objectivity of, for example, teachers?  In the beginning I was speaking about the role of criticism. It is our essentially insufficient and reactive attitude to the technology of communications which has allowed the journalistic profession to become professionalised; as they would refer to it, institutionalised more accurately described.  Therefore, it now needs to be contained.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the teaching profession by comparison, of course, is that teaching has been made irrelevant by the private enterprise system we have.  Teachers are really people who operate in institutions to which other people send their children to get them out of their homes so that they can get on with whatever they do during the day or in the evening. I say that with respect for teachers, because I am one myself.  In third level education we face this question of relevance.  Regularly young university teachers like myself teaching sociology for example, and looking at a vast assembly of pupils, have asked ourselves how relevant we are.  Perhaps it is just a matter of age. We have had access to the books and journals before them but then they have their energy against that and some day we will slow up and they will be able to move faster to the library and they will have had access to the well, the source, before us, and at that time it is time to resign.  That is if we practise the traditionally defined role.</P>
    <P>This is, of course, a model of conventional university behaviour.  There are all sorts of people who suggest that this is not what happens.  We know very well that this is so.  Of course, if one speaks a few languages it helps.  Confuse the students a little more.  Regularly we realise that education, <Col N="1008" /> as traditionally, institutionally conceived, is in crisis.  People are not swallowing all the old stuff any more. They are simply saying that they want to hear something relevant.  But they only ask that for a while and they go away and acquire mental comfort. They become useful.  Leave some teachers with their terra, some like me with our questions for comfort. People ask me what sociology is or how does what I have to say in a classroom relate to their own social experience. I have to take that question seriously.  The same thing arises in relation to journalism, but what I dislike intensely is the setting down of hard norms for the operation of a practice like journalism, teaching or the like.  The easy way out is to presume a single reality.  One Senator reminded us of Original Sin.  There is a great benefit in Original Sin for mental comfort.  Having established Original Sin as a major explanatory variable in the world, it is very easy to make things follow along from there neatly.  There is a formal logic which will help in most areas.  We must be repressed from our potential.</P>
    <P>There are others than who will suggest that not only is Original Sin an inescapable reality but that the people who defend it have a calling and that this House should regularly go through the motions of making itself look ridiculous posturing for a particular religious viewpoint&mdash;one whose principles I respect, incidentally, but not its caricature.  There are people who presume that the world is given, that there is a single reality in the world.  If one has a systemic view of the world the function of teachers, of communicators, then becomes rather like one of introduction.  Sociologists tell people the social effects of something or other, social effects of industrialisation, of agricultural living.  In schools people will learn what it is like to do certain other things.  People will be brought through these Houses and will be told that this is where they sit and talk and make decisions.  The world is explored but behind it all there is a system in existence; systems thinking has been a particularly interesting fetish in <Col N="1009" /> modern western philosophical thought. It is not new.  There are other versions of it in older times.  It has received its greatest expression in modern management thinking.</P>
    <P>The alternative approach is the thinking which I mentioned at the outset&mdash;critical thinking.  In that the notion of the dialectic is central.  For example, if a student asks me if I am relevant as a teacher in university, I can ask him how relevant he is as a student.  If a musician is asked what he is playing, he may ask what the person thinks he is playing.  Similarly, too, in relation to journalism.  If there is a free exchange of views, if there is a continual dialectic, if there is a continual atmosphere of critique in society, the power of everybody is enhanced.  That is why I have always to come down on the side of the dialectic in thought, the important principle that from it springs life as an integrated experience.</P>
    <P>There is no distinction between thought and practice.  Senator Browne referred to people being poltroons. He was referring to people saying one thing in private and saying another thing in public.  There is worse than that.  There are people who say particular things and do other things. This is the distinction between analysis, theoretical analysis and practice. The universities in Europe, with few distinguished exceptions, have lived and done very well out of the division between analysis and action.  Max Weber, the most noted exponent in economic theory and social science of this division knew very well what he was doing.  Indeed his own great personal despair was brought about by that.</P>
    <P>The condition of society was to be one of total bureaucracy.  His suggestion was that we must prepare for that, that our condition is inevitable. What he suggested in his methodology was simply that we discuss the more general abstract questions in the academy and then in our own practice do something else.  It is rather like the idea that you can be one kind of a person for one part of the day and you can be another kind of person for <Col N="1010" /> another.  There was a reaction to that from two sources.  There was a reaction in western socialist theory to the bureaucracy of which Weber spoke.  It still presents a challenge for Marxists as well as for private enterprise, and the capitalist thinker.  It presents the kind of challenge that the principles of domination of which we spoke in the past are not based on any class relations.  Technology itself is seen as the basis of domination.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I thought Senator N. Browne in an otherwise fine, sensitive speech seemed to some extent to be falling into that trap, almost having an awe for the mystique of technology.  We know this is nonsense. Habermas has demonstrated Marcuse's error in this regard.  Technology is an instrument of domination and not the principle of domination itself.  To put it simply, using an example used elsewhere by someone else, you can use a hoe to remove weeds from a garden or to split your neighbour's head.  Depending on how you do it the hoe is a hoe.  What is important is why you did it, the idea that precedes the instrument.  Indeed, the usage of such an instrument to split your neighbour's head is not an excuse for the abolition of agriculture. Neither is the potential abuse of freedom an excuse for regression. What uses can be made of technology, the media, radio, television, communications, the printing presses of the world?  Certainly they can print anything, say anything or show anything. I am in favour of that kind of atmosphere, because critical rationality will oust bourgeois rationality in the end, above all rationality will prevail.  What masks as rationality and reason at present is a terrible distortion of what was meant by reason in earlier critical philosophical formulations.  When Max Weber, the best analyst of modern industrial society, mentioned reason I think he was using a notion he had derived from his study of philosophy.  He confused reason with rationality defined as the manipulative, self-predicting nonsense of the private enterprise capitalist system.  When he spoke of &ldquo;rationality&rdquo; he did not <Col N="1011" /> fully understand perhaps that it would become the vulgar limited bourgeois rationality of the private enterprise society or did he?  His despair perhaps indicates that he did.  The argument that takes place between socialists and their opponents in the modern world concerns the exercise of rationality. The argument that takes place between socialists concerns the content of rationality.  The underlying principle of all this is that the principle of the dialectic must be allowed and must be sustained.</P>
    <P>To summarise what I said at the beginning is very true.  It is a sad commentary on our social history to date that we now find ourselves once again legislating away some of the expression of &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; and being unable, because of the social and economic circumstances into which we put ourselves to create the conditions of freedom.  Creating the conditions of freedom is a tedious task for many people.  It is one which will never be shirked by some people who share the conviction of a decent alternative and a more dignified society.  It is a task that will always be opposed by people who have a vested interest in this society.  We need to regularly examine where we stand on this question, because our economy is getting less and less powerful in relation to the tentacles of the multi-national corporations. If some want us to be a small-time, irrelevant group of consumers in a world of manipulated consumers, it is our business to flush them out. We should come regularly into the open ourselves and examine these questions.</P>
    <P>When the Minister speaks of &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; in the Bill, I hope he will reconsider the wording of the section in which it occurs.  Senator Horgan referred to it at some length, and quoted professional opinion on the use of disorder.  It is wide open to abuse. The one thing that characterises all I have said so far, is that it is entirely disorderly to many people.  I believe in the principle of disorder as an alternative to an order which has been defended not very well by a number of people and that has been shown to <Col N="1012" /> be cruel and vulgar.  It is necessary that we be able, outside this Chamber, to express our distaste and abhorrence of institutionalised violence&mdash;the violence too of capital.  So far as I am concerned this is no abstraction.  I have had a lot of experience of meeting and talking to poor people.  They are not an abstraction.  They were not invented by the Labour Party.  The Labour Party have been trying, to their credit, to improve the condition of such people for a long time.  You do not have great divisions in wealth and society accidentally.  It happens because of certain, clear historical reasons.  These divisions in society will have to be regularly protested in a number of ways.  We will not be constrained in our protestations concerning them either.</P>
    <P>I can imagine a situation in which a Government might, some time in the future, be returned which might have friends in what will then be the most relevant structure of capital&mdash; international capital.  They might decide it was upsetting to them to have lunatics like myself protesting against the use of our natural resources in the interests of international falsely created consumer greed.  It is as much to defend that kind of protest in the future that I ask the Minister to seriously reconsider this term.  To move to the Bill again and what is left out, the use of broadcasting in adult education, for example, is not discussed so far.  I would have liked to see an expanded discussion on education in the regions, in the Irish speaking areas, and among other natural communities. I spoke earlier of what happens when technology is allowed to develop or is not very well analysed and is not being consciously used to advance clearly established social aims.  I go further now and say that communications technology has been allowed to erode natural community, to strip away many important aspects of identity, and many valuable expressions of personality.  In the same way as technology by our omission was allowed to do this, we could make a conscious decision and say that by design we will use technology to recreate the spirit of community, to <Col N="1013" /> give back to the people a sense of relevance, a sense of identity, a sense of belonging in a world of alienation. For that reason I would like to see expressed as a hope for the future at least, that we would invest in community radio, that we will allow, for example, even children to make their own programmes on radio and television and that we will allow communities to experiment.  What magnificent relationships would exist in such delightful chaos, this application of philosophical anarchy, philosophical anarchy translated into social affairs?  It might be something like this.</P>
    <P>If you allow children to experiment with a radio programme or make their own television programmes, they would learn to laugh at some of the professionals, because they would say &ldquo;You are so poor.  We made a better programme than that years ago&rdquo;. Similarly in other communities the pressures would come on people to create better quality.  This would be for the right reasons.  Even if they make mistakes, they should be allowed to do so.  There is nothing like people understanding their mistakes.  At the moment they are the victims of mistakes perpetrated by forces over which they have no control.  That is one of the fundamental relations in a dominated society and an economy like ours in a world of international capitalism. We should decide to redress the balance and enlist technology in our aid.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes reference to the norm of objectivity.  Objectivity has been bandied about by a number of people in speeches on broadcasting over a number of years.  I am not quite sure as to what is meant by &ldquo;objectivity.&rdquo; Anyone who knows anything about communications and the sociology of communications, will tell you that the idea of a person expressing or making external to himself all of his values is an absurdity.  It is a fantasy in the history of the social sciences as mentioned.  It is a nineteenth century German fantasy which blossomed in twentieth century social science, because it suited people who believe in a schizophrenic division between the <Col N="1014" /> world of reflection and the world of practice.  It had a very long innings in scholarship and in the universities.  But if it be difficult to lay bare one's values in scholarship, how much more difficult it is for a broadcaster or for a journalist.</P>
    <P>An appeal to objectivity may be a good professional aim, but it makes bad law.  It lacks the certitude of expression which is required of a legal norm.  It may be an appropriate professional norm but it is not a good legal one.  Then too there are other words used in the Bill and other Bills of this nature such as &ldquo;privacy&rdquo;.  It is extremely difficult to define an invasion of privacy.  If what may be regarded as admirable professional norms are translated into legal requirements, what may happen is that the atmosphere of creativity which is so essential in the world of communications, may well be lost.  I would ask the Minister to consider these points when he replies.  Let us have spontaneity rather than fear in the structural conditions of communications practice.</P>
    <P>I mentioned adult education earlier. A number of people are interested in adult education in one form or another. If education be repressive, what is the point in extending it to everyone in the population?  It could be suggested that I contradict myself.  But I will comment on that in detail when we take the motion on education.</P>
    <P>There are a number of difficulties in the Bill concerning cultural preservation. I share many of Senator McCartin's views concerning the uses of a second channel.  With a second Irish controlled channel we could contribute a great deal to the future of Irish broadcasting and television.  For that and other reasons mentioned earlier, I would ask the Minister to reconsider his proposals.</P>
    <P>I was astounded by the very interesting omission from this debate of the dispute which took place in RTE which led to the resignation of Jack Dowling, Leila Doolin and Bob Quinn. In their book <i>Sit Down and Be Counted</i> a number of questions were raised which seem to have slipped out of the public mind.  That was an extremely <Col N="1015" /> important book.  It asked very important questions.  One question, which is basic to a consideration of legislation of this kind, was the nature of authority in a creative context. How can you leave the communicator, for example, to be free and at the same time manage a modern communications centre?  In fact, one of the authors had a long discussion on the distinction between different modes of authority, for example, the kind of authority which is demanded, and another kind of authority which is the authority of people who share aims concerning the purposes of broadcasting.  One is an imposed hierarchical authority, an &ldquo;authoritarian paternalism&rdquo; as it was referred to on page 305 in the text.  The second is the kind of authority which is accepted because one realises the job has to be done.</P>
    <P>Too little attention is being paid to the appropriate participatory structures in the communications world, particularly in areas where creative people are involved.  And when I use the word &ldquo;creative&rdquo; I mean people from whom a demand is placed to innovate more than is normal.  How sad that those great critical minds such as Quinn's and Dowling's are ignored. Quinn still may become if allowed a great regional communicator.</P>
    <P>The two main purposes of the Bill give one to clarify and define the obligations of the authority to spell out the maximum freedom within certain limits which will be allowed.  I would like a greater elaboration on &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;.  I was impressed by Senator Horgan's speech, which I thought to be a careful response to the Minister's speech.  Indeed, many of the points which, if I had been speaking earlier I might have made, would have dealt with&mdash;for example, the idea of local culture, were covered by Senator Horgan.</P>
    <P>To turn to the idea of control when we speak of keeping control, the decisions basically facing us in legislating in the area of broadcasting both for television and radio, of course arise in other areas of legislation but in communication they are located <Col N="1016" /> around the possibility of critique, the ability to criticise, the ability of self-criticism.  RTE has been tampered with in the past, in a sinister way. Sometimes it could have been avoided easily; at other times, it could have been avoided less easily.</P>
    <P>Senator McCartin said he would like to give the Minister his own views.  I should like to tell the Minister my views on one kind of interference with broadcasting, that is, the interference of advertising.  It is perfectly clear to anyone who has any sensitivity that to speak of freedom as if it is possible to legislate for freedom of course that cannot be done if it has structurally been given away in economic and social terms&mdash;that is only speaking of certain kinds of freedom and in a limited context. Senator should ask themselves this more often.  How free are children when they are bombarded by the advertising industry?  How free are working-class women who are bombarded with advertisements aimed at them involving aspiration to consuming middle-class consumer items represented as part of upper social mobility?  How free are the parents who watch a children's advertisement during the children's hour on television? That parent is put into competition with the parent of different means.  In order to supply their child with a particular commodity, for example, shoes, they may have to purchase or lose as a parent.  How free is a society which at one time produced its own food, ate non-processed and non-poisonous carefully produced food, from the advertisements which suggest that certain food must be eaten if you are to be a happy person, nicely smelling, suitably deodorised, likely to get married and produce hordes of children.  The nightmare world of consumerism is institutionalised in broadcasting.  As I said, there are things we could have avoided easily, other things we could have avoided less easily.  Anyone who reads about the international structure of the communications world knows this. Many countries&mdash;for example, in South America&mdash;are considering avoiding having television stations in <Col N="1017" /> order to avoid some of this nonsense, this dangerous debasing nonsense.</P>
    <P>I refer people to what was said in <i>Sit Down and be Counted</i> by Jack Dowling, Leila Doolin and Bob Quinn, when people's practice was interfered with because of threats, and some more tacit than others, of advertisers on television.  Advertising is a terrible interference on radio and television.</P>
    <P>There is another type of interference&mdash;I do not want to score any petty point&mdash;which arises because some people can take criticism better than others.  Some people have arrived at such a perfectly convinced version of the truth that they would have us all listen to it regularly.  I am perfectly convinced, with the utmost confidence, that Senator Quinlan would with alacrity, take over the job of Director-General of Radio Telefís Éireann and run the station in perfect accordance with his principles.  The problem is establishing his principles. Apart from illumination from an outside source would we ever have a referendum on them?  I do not know. For my own part, I would be a very bad Director-General.  It is a job I will not apply for because I would be too worried about the problem of multiple realities.</P>
    <P>My reservations concerning the Bill are the same as those of the type of person referred to in the Minister's introductory speech on the Second Stage, as being a philosophical anarchist of a sort, but who was perfectly willing to translate that philosophical commitment into a political view.  Of course it may be just as well to be humorous, as we see the vulgar tatters of private enterprise capitalism fall around us.  It is just as well to smile and keep one's sense of humour as you see it give its last few gasps, overthrown everywhere.  But we must ask ourselves why we were so late in realising that this vulgarity is moving to a collapse.  It is sad, of course, that we have been unable to convince people of that fact.  People in this island, due to the absence of ideology in political parties and their history, have lost their ability to criticise events. <Col N="1018" /> There was a time when a person would not have said: &ldquo;I do not understand any longer why we are discussing this.&rdquo;  They would know.  This was when people retained power; now power has been taken from them.</P>
    <P>In relation to objectivity, I have asked the Minister to look again at section 3.  Many aspects of section 3 are impractical&mdash;for example, what constitutes giving a person a hearing on radio, exposure on television?  What is a legitimate interview?  I have also mentioned the second channel.  What I have said tonight could be summarised in two or three simple sentences.  The first is that the supply of broadcasting and communications facilities in general preceded the demand for it.  That means of communication preceded their content and, certainly, any debate on their content; and legislation to date has been of a reactive, even if of a curiously humorous sort.  Secondly, given that, if one is to be rescued and placed in a new relevance; and if community is to be restored by technology as it was stripped away by technology, it can be best done in the maximum conditions of freedom.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the constraints on broadcasting and television, if we decide not only to become slaves of the advertising world but to subject our population to it on a regular and continuous basis, it is useful every now and again, even if it be to the more politicised countries of the world a matter of wonderment and entertaining, to discuss the conditions of our slavery.  We are merely debating the communicative content of the conditions of our slavery when a huge area of the world is winning its freedom economically, socially and politically. I hope for hope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister breathed a sigh of relief when he heard Senator M.D. Higgins say he would not be a candidate for the post of Director-General of RTE.  He will recall with sadness his efforts to ram the name of the director of his propaganda machine down the throats of the RTE Authority with no success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With due respect to the Parliamentary Secretary, it would appear that I <Col N="1019" /> have the happy knack of scaring Ministers out of this House.  We should examine this legislation before us this evening minutely, if for no other reason than it has been introduced by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, a man who only a few hours ago was described by the Leader of Fianna Fáil as &ldquo;the darling of the British Conservative press&rdquo; and a man who, over this weekend, was described as &ldquo;the darling of the Loyalist groups in the Six Counties&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister opened the debate with a long and interesting speech although admittedly most of it was irrelevant to the Bill before us.  I would like to begin by asking the Minister&mdash;I am sorry that he is not here for the question&mdash;why he considered it necessary to produce a brochure of this speech.  While the Minister is entitled to express his views and while he is entitled to publish a brochure which consists of the subject matter of his Second Reading speech, I want to know is he entitled to spend £366 of taxpayers' money in doing so? Is the man so presumptuous that he felt that there was a demand in this country for the full text of what he had to say on the Second Stage of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1975?  Is money so plentiful in this country that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs thought it necessary to spend £366 on nonsense of this kind? When one considers that £366 could have provided a substantial meal every day for a year for one starving constituent of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs I feel that I am justified in protesting very strongly at this gross extravagance on the Minister's part.</P>
    <P>The Bill before this House this evening is an opportunity for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to take even greater control of one of his propaganda machines.  He has been aptly described as the present day Dr. Goebbels of Irish political life.  He is not content with increasing the cost of the Government Information Services by 33 times more than they cost under Fianna Fáil: it would now appear that he is seizing this opportunity to give him an even greater propaganda right.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> As we prepare to examine this legislation I feel that I am entitled to ask, in presenting this legislation to this House, is the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs speaking with the authentic voice of the National Coalition Government?  Is there a majority in the Coalition Government in favour of the legislation before us? I have my doubts, particularly in view of the statements made by the Minister over the last week-end.  As I was driving to this city today I listened to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and he gave me the impression that he did not agree with the statements made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs over the last week-end.  Naturally, therefore, I wonder if, in presenting this legislation to the House the Minister is in fact speaking with the authentic voice of the National Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>We were given to understand for quite some time that a radical liberalising Bill was being conceived which would afford to professional broadcasters infinitely more freedom to get on with their work without undue interference from Government. It has been delivered: it is an extension of censorship from the area of State security to that of light entertainment, drama and just about every discussion programme that one could mention.  Such is the sum total of section 3.</P>
    <P>I have always had some sympathy for broadcasters operating, as they are, a State service with all its attendant checks and restraints, something which newspapers, on the one hand, and live entertainment on the other, do not have to contend with.  If the record were available it would not surprise me to discover that broadcasters have been subject to much more restraint within the RTE organisation than from Government. The exercise of legal restraint is often a matter of interpretation. The present Bill does nothing to make this any less likely.  In fact it appears to be designed to make the broadcaster's task more difficult and confusing than ever before.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when he was in <Col N="1021" /> Opposition, was seen to create the impression that he was a shining liberal doing battle with hidebound and ruthless establishments the world over, including Ireland of course.  The element with which he identified would always appear to champion the cause of freedom&mdash;&ldquo;appear&rdquo; is the operative word because some of these groups, when they actually attain power very soon make it clear that they are not quite so keen to publicise opinions other than their own.</P>
    <P>Many people, including journalists, must have been eagerly awaiting this Bill in the firm belief that this was to be the Magna Carta of the broadcasting media.  They must have been sadly disillusioned, however, when they read sections 3 and 16.  The Minister has referred to the BBC.  Its Current Affairs programmes seem to enjoy a fair measure of editorial autonomy as compared with those of RTE.  I would have thought that a man of the Minister's professed liberalism would have made an effort to apply to the Bill some of the principles enshrined in Article 40 of the Constitution.  This Article sets out the right of such organs as the Press and radio to freely express their opinions and to criticise Government policy. Even though these sentiments are not spelled out in the Act of 1960, I think it is fair to say that these rights were more freely exercised during the lifetime of the Fianna Fáil Government than they are at present.</P>
    <P>One can only surmise the reason for this.  Television is not mentioned in Article 40 of the Constitution even though it had been invented at the time.  Perhaps the draftsmen of that document, in their wisdom, foresaw the peculiar impact which this type of broadcasting would have.  We all know too well that television can give a frightening twist to news or expressed opinion by the simple expedient of editing films or video tape recordings.</P>
    <P>The Minister savagely criticised his predecessor for giving a certain directive under section 31 of the Act in spite of the fact that he knew that in exercising his power at the time the <Col N="1022" /> Minister was clearly motivated by a concern for the security of this State and not by any possibility of personal or political advantage.  His assumption of office, however, has not caused the Minister to refrain from doing what he criticised then.  Indeed it has caused the Minister to dilute his so-called liberalism.  The Minister reminded us two years ago, following the dismissal of the RTE Authority, of the Labour Party's policy in this matter.  He read a document which was the unanimous decision of the Labour Party.  It is interesting to study that document now that we have the Broadcasting Authority Bill, 1975, in which the Minister and the Labour Party had an opportunity of putting into action the words they expressed in November of 1972.  The Labour Party claimed then that the Government's ultimatum to the RTE Authority was a bad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am quoting from Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien, column 2472, Dáil Éireann Official Report, Vol. 263, 23rd November, 1972.  On that date the views of the Minister, then plain Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien, were as follows:</P>
      <P>The Government's ultimatum to the RTE Authority is a bid to place broadcasting and television in this country under the control of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The authority is to be made either to toe the line or to be dismissed.  The degree of autonomy RTE has hitherto enjoyed is to be destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real reason for all this is Fianna Fáil's desire to monopolise television and broadcasting before the next general election.  The pretext taken is the coverage given by RTE to Sinn Féin and IRA activities.  It is the Government and not RTE which is responsible for law enforcement in this country. The Government is punishing RTE for its coverage of a situation which arises from the Government's own policies.  If the Government succeeds in muzzling RTE it <Col N="1023" /> will next turn its attention to the Press in order to put this country permanently and totally under the control of a single party.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party calls on all its members and on all concerned citizens to join in exposing this move towards totalitarianism and to join also in the democratic struggle to put this Government out and substitute for it a Government which will defend democracy, the rule of law and freedom of expression.</P>
    <P>The Minister had an opportunity when preparing this legislation to put into action what he so ably put into words when an Opposition Deputy. Perhaps we should ask him now if he has in any way changed his mind.  In column 2479 he is reported:</P>
    <P>The idea that television and broadcasting shall be under the control of a single party prevails in Eastern Europe under various Communist régimes and prevails in parts of Southern Europe under Fascist or military autocratic systems. Our Government claim to abhor these systems, particularly the Communist system, especially when they think they can smear an opponent with Communism, which is one of the things they do rather well and to which they devote a lot of attention.  On the actual substance of the matter, which is whether you put a monopoly of power over broadcasting and television, they see quite comfortably eye to eye with Mr. Brezhnev, or whoever it may be.  They would bring that into line and this application of a power which the Government undoubtedly legally possess, the actual delegation of it, if we are coming to that, through what was referred to in the Press as this ultimatum of purge and so on, is a major breakthrough of a very sinister kind in relation to what kind of country we have.</P>
    <P>Another brief quotation from column 2480:</P>
    <P>This all hinges on the nature of the Minister's directive of the 1st October.  It is a sinister directive. <Col N="1024" /> The Minister invoked section 31 of the Act.  I will not discuss the Act. I am discussing an action taken by the Minister under the Act.  He said he invoked section 31 and directed the authority in writing:... to refrain from broadcasting any matter of the following class, i.e., any matter that could be calculated to promote the aims or activities of any organisation which engages in, promotes, encourages or advocates the attaining of any particular objective by violent means.  That directive could be interpreted as debarring Fianna Fáil from participating in discussions on RTE.  It could have been so invoked in the past. People rather dislike historical references but, if that rule had existed in the 1920s, it certainly would have excluded Mr. de Valera from the air or any reference to the Fianna Fáil Party, because it refers to any matter that could be calculated to promote the aims or activities of any organisation which engages in, promotes, encourages or advocates the attaining of any particular objective by violent means.</P>
    <P>The Minister could have cancelled the supposedly offending directive in this legislation.  Instead, he has maintained it in force and is intending in this amending legislation to give it even more teeth than it has at present. Instead of playing around with words in the present Bill, the Minister should state honestly and clearly that he is incapable of improving or replacing what he so enthusiastically condemned in the past.  The State must retain the power in certain circumstances to restrain what may be broadcast.  We can only hope and trust that integrity will be the order of the day and that this power will be seldom used if at all.</P>
    <P>Section 13 contains ample advice to the authority, but, in the absence of something more specific, I cannot see how it can produce any tangible results. The section which it seeks to amend has not succeeded up to now.  In both cases what is expressed is merely a pious hope which pays lip service to an ideal.</P>
    <P>The portion of the Bill which causes <Col N="1025" /> most concern is section 6, which gives to the Minister the power to direct the authority to rebroadcast programmes from unspecified sources.  This is intended to give effect to the Minister's much publicised open-broadcasting concept.  The word &ldquo;open&rdquo;, as interpreted by the Minister, reminds one of the host who offers his guest anything he wishes to eat provided it is bacon and cabbage.  When the Minister advanced his theory I understood it to mean a completely free exchange of programmes between the two parts of this island and between Ireland and Great Britain, all dedicated to better understanding between our two peoples.</P>
    <P>Admirable as this theory may sound, I have always regarded it as pie in the sky.  It would entail the erection of a series of transmitters in the Six Counties and in Britain at the Irish taxpayers' expense or, if not, at the expense of the British authorities who would consider this outlandish.  It is now clear that the Minister's conception of open broadcasting is the provision at Irish taxpayers' expense of a chain of transmitters to be handed over lock, stock and barrel to the BBC and which would not in any way be hindered by sections 3 or 16 of this Bill.  The proposal is so monstrous that I find it hard to believe that we are even discussing it.</P>
    <P>Much has been said recently about the rights of people living in one-channel areas to a freedom of choice of television.  The fact however that the accident of geographical location and, in the case of the Border counties, the tragedy of Partition, allows some people to poach television programmes from BBC or UTV does not confer upon the remainder of the people the right to demand similar facilities at public expense.  The provision by private commercial interests of piped television is another matter entirely. I am in favour of a second RTE channel if and when the public purse can afford it.  How this channel is to be used is the crux of the matter.</P>
    <P>I find it inexplicable that the Minister should suggest the course he has outlined.  The question of the cost of this extraordinary venture has already <Col N="1026" /> been mentioned.  The standard contract between the BBC and every single artist includes a clause which guarantees payment of a specific fee, which is reckoned as a percentage of the original fee in all cases where a programme is distributed or rebroadcast by other organisations.  In our case, almost any percentage would be too high.</P>
    <P>In his reply the Minister should tell us how he proposes to pay this fee&mdash;where he proposes to get this money to compensate those artists for a recording fee to which they are legally entitled.  There is the possibility that the Minister, who has already acknowledged he is not working actively towards the reunification of this country, is working towards the return of the Act of Union which among other dubious benefits would give us free access to everything British.  Judging by the Minister's comments in recent times, I would not be surprised if this is his approach.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a second channel, then for Ireland's sake let us use it wisely.  Let us have a genuine choice of programmes and not direct competition between &ldquo;I Love Lucy&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Odd Couple&rdquo;.  Let it not be a case of &ldquo;Our American programmes are better than your American programmes&rdquo;&mdash;a battle to see whether RTE in order to keep their advertisers can reach the lowest common denominator which often secures a place in the TAM ratings.  Both channels must be controlled by RTE so that the authority can have some chance of properly achieving the aims of section 13.</P>
    <P>It is not alone the standard and choice of programmes which makes it necessary that we should control the second channel.  There is also the employment factor.</P>
    <P>All Members of this House in the last week will have received a letter from the Dublin No. 7 Branch, ITGWU, and in that letter they state:</P>
    <P>Alternative A which is favoured by the Minister, Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien and which that using <Col N="1027" /> the second TV network now under construction in the Republic to rebroadcast simultaneously BBC Northern Ireland.  This alternative is being opposed by the ITGWU for the following reasons:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  That it would have a detrimental effect on RTE's financial income and would create large scale redundancy&mdash;600 to 800 jobs or 40 to 50 per cent of the total.  Approximately half of RTE's income comes from advertising, consequently any major drop in audience would have an adverse effect on advertising revenue.  We estimate that RTE faced with direct competition from BBC 1 could manage to hold more than 50 per cent of the available viewers.  This would mean a drop in advertising income of £1½ million to £2 million per annum.  This would be followed by programme cutbacks and lay offs.  A redundant spiral at the end of which BBC 1 would become <i>de facto</i> the national channel and RTE would be a complementary reasonable service.</P>
    <P>This of course is bound to please the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs:</P>
    <P>(2)  The whole concept of one State rebroadcasting <i>in toto</i>, another State's TV service is to our knowledge unprecedented.  The principle is extremely dangerous from a Trade Union point of view.  With the onset of satellite communication it could lead to the decimation of jobs in the industry.</P>
    <P>(3)  It would limit choice in the present single channel area to RTE and BBC Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>(4)  It would require a licence fee increase of £8 to £10 per annum although it would bestow no extra benefits on most of those paying the increase, i.e. those in the existing multi-channel area.</P>
    <P>(5)  It is impractical&mdash;film renting companies would be unlikely to agree to the rebroadcasting of their material in this way.  Resulting gaps <Col N="1028" /> in the schedule would be difficult to fill at short notice.</P>
    <P>(6)  As RTE already uses quite an amount of BBC material there would be considerable duplication.</P>
    <P>(7)  The proposals entail a major loss of independence for us in the important area of television communications.</P>
    <P>(8)  Because RTE would be forced to compete with BBC 1 in order to hold viewers the two channels would tend to become a mirror image of each other, thus reducing the real alternative to viewers.</P>
    <P>The Labour Members of this House in particular should give serious consideration to the objections registered to this measure by the Dublin No. 7 Branch of ITGWU, and in particular to the claim that 600 to 800 jobs could be lost in RTE as a result of the legislation before the House this evening.</P>
    <P>While the loss of 600 to 800 jobs is something that this Government are well used to and nothing new, nevertheless it should causes concern for at least some Labour Members of this House accepting that every day in every newspaper we open we read of job losses.  The figure was 300 in today's papers and 300 in last week's papers.  The Government may be used to jobs being lost and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may not be unduly concerned about the threat in RTE to 600 to 800 jobs.  The ITGWU letter, on Alternative B, refers to the using of the second network to carry a second national channel providing complementary programming alongside the existing RTE and allowing the development of cable television in areas where it would be commercially and technically feasible.  It states:</P>
    <P> (1)  It would provide real alternative complementary viewing while safeguarding the national broadcasting system and jobs in the Irish television and film industry.</P>
    <P>(2)  The second national channel would draw on material from BBC 1, BBC 2, ITV, home produced material and programmes from other sources.  Programmes <Col N="1029" /> produced by the British regional stations particularly those in areas with a close cultural affinity to Ireland could be used effectively.  No major copyright problems would arise as the procedures for same between RTE and the British TV companies are already well established.</P>
    <P>(3)  It would facilitate the development of co-production between RTE, BBC Northern Ireland and other British stations.</P>
    <P>(4)  Cable systems could be used to develop community broadcasting.</P>
    <P>(5)  The cost would be no greater than rebroadcasting BBC 1.</P>
    <P>I think that is the kernel of the point, that the cost of the second channel under the control of RTE would be no greater than the rebroadcasting of BBC 1.  But perhaps the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was looking to the day when RTE will not broadcast many of the outlandish statements that he is in the habit of making that annoy not alone the vast majority of the people living in the Republic of Ireland, irrespective of their political views, but annoys in particular the minority living in the Six Counties.  Only this afternoon I listened to the radio, to the chairman of the SDLP, Mr. Seamus Mallon, castigating the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for his actions.  Is it possible that the Minister realises that the day will come when the only network which will broadcast his observations on Six Counties' affairs will be BBC 1?  Is this the reason he is so anxious to ensure that this is the type of programme we will have?</P>
    <P>There is already machinery under which RTE can pick and choose and negotiate for programmes of a high cultural and entertainment value from many countries, including Britain. The use of a second channel would give them much greater scope in this area.  One channel could and should be complementary to the other, instead of having both compete for the same audience.  The decision is a luxury which we cannot afford.</P>
    <P>The field of education is an <Col N="1030" /> obvious one to explore.  The standard and sparse nature of our population in many rural areas makes second level and third level education an impossible goal for too many people. Why not have a college of the air? This idea has worked with tremendous success in other places.  Would the Minister for Education submit a claim that he will not in the foreseeable future resolve the problem of the high pupil-teacher ratio?  The provision of complementary courses on television would be of enormous benefit to students who are labouring under the harsh difficulty of trying to learn in classes which are too large and from teachers who find it impossible to deal effectively with the child who is lagging behind the rest. That is the tremendous advantage. The parents if they so wished could become more involved in the field of education.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister foresee the possibility of acquiring funds to finance the purchase of BBC 1 programmes? I would suggest that instead of doing this that he ease the dilemma of his colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy Burke.  One cannot condemn an idea simply because it has no precedent in any part of the world.  The fact that there is no precedent in this case merely underlines the fact that the Minister's proposal in regard to the second channel has no merit whatsoever. The time has come when Members of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties should look very closely at what this Minister is trying to do.  I would describe the Minister as an exalted leftist turning conflagration into Irish political life just as on one occasion he boasted when he was described as an exalted leftist who carried conflagration into Katanga.  He also boasted in his book that he was described by a Portugese newspaper as follows:</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Brien's lack of political ability is disastrous.</P>
    <P>That was the opinion of the Portugese 12 years ago.  I suggest that after 12 years&mdash;five years in Irish life&mdash;his lack of political ability is becoming more disastrous day by day; that this fact was recognised by Fianna Fáil many <Col N="1031" /> years ago and that it should be recognised now by the grassroots of Labour and Fine Gael.  To see how disastrous his political ability is one must study this legislation.  The question I should like to ask is: why should the Minister hand over practically a second channel to the British Broadcasting Authority?  In section 4 of the Bill the Minister provides for a complaints board.  Yet the BBC cannot be subject to this complaints board.  In other words, anyone who wishes to complain about a programme which appears on RTE has that facility once this Bill becomes law.  However, if the programme is a British propaganda one, broadcast through the second channel, the Minister's friends, the British, are excused from any complaint whatsoever. The Minister tries to convey the impression that he is more liberal than Fianna Fáil.  According to the 1960 Act the Minister had power to dismiss the RTE Authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>Now this liberal Minister is taking that authority from himself.  To whom is he giving it?  He is giving it to the Oireachtas.  It is natural to expect that a Minister becomes a Minister in the Government because his party or parties enjoy an overall majority in Dáil Éireann.  It is natural to expect that, when that Minister brings an order, a motion or a Bill before either House of the Oireachtas, that overall majority which he controls will see to it that his wishes are fulfilled.  If the Minister were to bring before this House a motion calling for the dismissal of the RTE Authority, even Senator O'Toole would admit that he would have no trouble whatsoever in this House or indeed in the other House in attaining his wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I mention this point is that it is another example of the Minister's and indeed the Government's <Col N="1032" /> eyewash, call it what you will, to give the people the impression that what they preached in Opposition they are carrying out in Government. Senator O'Toole knows as well as I do that there is absolutely no difference whatsoever in what the Minister proposes in this Bill and what Fianna Fáil proposed in the 1960 Bill.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs wishes to dismiss the RTE Authority he will do it with the same ease under the new legislation as under the old, and to suggest that the RTE Authority could be removed from office only by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, to suggest in fact that this legislation is in any way different, is absolute nonsense. Indeed, I would say that the 1960 Act is more honest than section 2 of the Broadcasting Authority Bill.  It was more honest in that it said to the people that the Minister of the day would dismiss the Authority.</P>
    <P>There are some people who may feel that the dictatorial authority of the Minister has been taken from him.  There may be some people who will think that, but Senator O'Toole and I know that that is not, in fact, the case.  Under the old legislation the Minister could not dismiss the RTE Authority without the sanction of the Cabinet.  In fact, the Minister could not dismiss the RTE Authority.  The Cabinet had the collective responsibility under the old legislation and the Minister could not dismiss the Authority without that sanction. Under this legislation the Minister could not introduce a resolution into either House of the Oireachtas without the authority of the Cabinet. What is the difference between this legislation and the previous legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator well knows.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">

    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs wishes to <Col N="1033" /> dismiss the RTE Authority under this legislation he first of all must get approval from the Cabinet, and then he enters Dáil Éireann with a resolution and will receive the support of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties, irrespective of their feelings.  That is our system of Government, our system of legislation, and the majority of people in a political party accept the majority decision of their party. Having got the resolution through Dáil Éireann he then comes into this House.  Is Senator O'Toole telling me that if he disagreed with the dismissal of the RTE Authority he would vote against this resolution?  If he did he would not be Senator O'Toole for many more elections, and he knows that perfectly well.</P>
      <P>Therefore, instead of signing his name dismissing the RTE Authority, the Minister has to go through the two Houses; he may have to listen to a debate&mdash;I do not know the procedure when resolutions are introduced. Having listened to the debate and having gone through the vote, the RTE Authority is dismissed.  The only difference between the old legislation and the new is that it may take a few weeks longer.  Senator O'Toole knows that as well as I do.  I will conclude by quoting Senator Alexis FitzGerald, who finished up his contribution on a very important line.  He said:</P>
      <P>If we Irish fail to put things Irish first, nobody else will put them first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I naturally expect that Senator Alexis FitzGerald will take the opportunity presented to him on the Second Reading of this Bill to ensure that we Irish put things Irish first.  I expect that Senator Alexis FitzGerald will demonstrate in no uncertain manner his contempt for anyone who dares take from the Irish the opportunity of putting things Irish first.  He can do that by voting against the Bill, which proposes to entrust to the BBC the task of putting things Irish first.  If Senator Alexis FitzGerald is sincere he has the power, when it comes to the vote on the Second Reading of this Bill, to vote against a proposal put forward in this <Col N="1034" /> legislation by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Doctor Conor Cruise-O'Brien, entrusting to the BBC the task of putting things Irish first.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is fresh in my memory I should like to mention what has been referred to at the close of his speech by Senator McGlinchey. It is the difference between the present legislation and the legislation now proposed with regard to the removal from office of the Authority. Senator McGlinchey well knows, but fails to pursue the thing to its conclusion, in the knowledge that it would be defeating his own argument, that the main difference between the present legislation and the proposed legislation in this regard is that when the Minister has to bring a Motion into both Houses of the Oireachtas, he must give reasons and, presumably, valid reasons.</P>
      <P>I see Senator McGlinchey smiling at this.  He may smile but this is the way democracy works, whether he likes it or not.  The Minister must give valid reasons which will be debated at length, and then and not until then can a vote be taken, after which the authority can stay in office or be removed. Compare that with the closed door, private discussion which went on, presumably, when the last Authority were removed.  There were no reasons given to the Authority, the people directly involved, and I would put it to Senator McGlinchey that this is a fundamental difference.  It is heartening to note the interest shown by all sections of the House in this the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his opening statement gave us a very comprehensive outline of what was involved.  He also gave his own philosophy on broadcasting and the media in general. Indeed the substance of the Minister's statement was both interesting and stimulating.  It is a most important debate in that the subject matter being discussed and the decisions which will finally be made will affect us all both in the late seventies and into the eighties.  This all-embracing aspect of broadcasting was dealt with at length <Col N="1035" /> by the Minister in his statement.  It is only right that we recognise the importance of it.  One cannot ignore the importance of the media in general and, might I say in present-day terms, of television in particular in that it is an agent reforming public opinion.  It can have very far-reaching influence both on the young and on the old, and one does not need to have any great scientific proof in order to believe that this is so.  They have only to look at the advertising companies who use the media of television, radio and the newspapers to realise the power of the press and of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Television can be a vehicle for good or evil.  It can inform.  It can also exploit.  In an age when many people have increasing leisure time at their disposal, we as legislators have a very important function in that we have an opportunity of providing for the community in which we live a means by which that community can use that leisure time to their benefit.  This is a very heavy burden, and I am glad that this House has seen fit to take such an active part in the discussion on this very important Bill, Perhaps it is because of that realisation that they have done so up to now.  We should try to ensure that the content of programmes, the standards of production, and balance are all maintained in the national television service.  This Bill, the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, plans to update and replace in part the 1960 Act.</P>
    <P>At first sight one might well ask whether the new Bill will meet the demands made by the public or whether it will fulfil the obligations which most people regard as the functions of the national broadcasting service.  On closer scrutiny, however, it becomes evident that the Minister envisages an Act which, while ensuring certain controls will, to a large extent, give autonomy and freedom of action both to the newly proposed authority who will be responsible for broadcasting and to individuals within that service.  The main benefits that I can see in the Bill are that many things which were vague and undefined <Col N="1036" /> have now been clarified.  The functions of the Authority will be spelled out.  The autonomy with its restrictions will be clearly stated, and many shady areas which are in the present legislation will be brought into the sunlight and clarified.</P>
    <P>To many people and indeed to many speakers who have already contributed to the debate in this House the Authority has been regarded as having a trustee status.  The service as provided since its inception some 13 or 14 years ago has always been regarded as a public service.  It is not envisaged, as far as I can see and as far as the Bill states, to alter that concept, and this being so, this still being a public service, it should be open to public accountability.  In this respect the Authority must be the body which will be answerable to the public.  It is logical to see why the tenure of office of that authority or the subject matter of any specific programme should no longer depend, as the Minister stated himself, on the whims of any one individual.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that the members of the authority may not be removed from office by the Government save by a resolution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In this way the national service is open to public accountability because it is here, in the Houses of the Oireachtas, that the public are collectively represented and it is the Members of the Oireachtas who can speak on behalf of the public.  This is a very important provision and must be seen to be a vast improvement on the present legislation.</P>
    <P>Another very important provision is the Broadcasting Complaints Commission. We will now have an arbiter which will decide questions of objectivity and impartiality in an independent fashion.  Indeed, the existence of the Commission can be seen as a safeguard which will benefit the public and the authority.</P>
    <P>What I have said concerning controls and the way in which the authority may be improved, might be construed as implying that the authority should not be constantly watched because it could be a dangerous agent <Col N="1037" /> of some sort.  That is not so.  Because of its nature and because it was put there by the Minister of the day who is responsible to people, that Minister must ensure that the authority in charge of broadcasting must satisfy certain criteria.  In discussing control, the Minister stated in his introductory speech that any legislation on broadcasting, even limited amending legislation as at present, necessarily raises very fundamental issues, essentially those of freedom in our democratic State and the limits of such freedom. He obviously realises the very sensitive area in which he is prepared to tread and, indeed, to offer his own personal opinion.  Further on in his statement he mentioned that he was making his speech in order to invite comment and motivate Senators to express their opinions, and presumably in the end we might get a consensus and see what can be worked out to the satisfaction of all.</P>
    <P>Controls, restrictions and restraints cannot be taken for granted.  It must be established whether controls are desirable or necessary.  The Minister made a very convincing case.  What he said can be summarised in the following question, the answer to which is obvious.  Do we have a democracy safeguarded by controls which allow it to flourish, or do we allow controls to strangle democracy?  As I said the answer is very, very obvious.  Any legislation, by its very nature, must impose some form of control.  That is what legislation is about.  The moment one tries to bring some order into society under any heading, one must lay down some ground rules.  Just like the First Commandment, you say &ldquo;Thou shalt not&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Legislation in any shape or form must have some element of control. Furthermore, legislation of the nature now being discussed must go even further and take into account prevailing conditions, for example, the political, social, economic and cultural conditions.  The state of those conditions will be reflected in that legislation. This point has been dealt with in depth by the Minister.  He concentrated mainly on the political situation in our community as it is today. <Col N="1038" /> I can envisage that same Minister ten years ago, or in ten years time, introducing this kind of legislation, but with a different emphasis on different sections because as I said the conditions of the times would be reflected in it.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out, and rightly so, that this area of control and restriction is very sensitive.  No matter what one does, he will not satisfy everybody, because in any community worthy of the name there are diverse opinions and various views are held very strongly.  That diversity in culture, as the Minister has stated in another context, only leads to an enrichment of the culture in that community.</P>
    <P>Some people would hold the view that freedom of expression is an absolute, from which nothing but good can result.  This is an extreme view and, because it is extreme, it is dangerous.  On the other hand, there are those who hold that there cannot be sufficient control.  Again, this is an extreme view which is also dangerous. Somewhere in between, in that grey area, the truth lies.  Somewhere in that grey area the Minister is forced to walk a tightrope and produce a Bill which will not be too restrictive &mdash;to the extent that it will stifle creativity and objectivity&mdash;but must be controlled to ensure that the other extreme element is not allowed influence impressionable minds to any substantial degree.</P>
    <P>Up to now&mdash;and I do not propose to cause any dissension&mdash;this has been a very civilised debate.  One of the advantages of introducing a Bill like this in this House is that we are free, to a certain degree, to speak our minds.  In fact, we are free all the time to speak our minds.  But there are times when one must be prepared to say things in a different way than he might have said elsewhere.  The Minister has invited honest comment. I hope that if I make some criticism of the Bill he will take it as honest and constructive criticism.  He said that he expected that some suggestions might come from this House on section 16, subsection (1) and section 3.</P>
    <P>Section 16 is more a matter for <Col N="1039" /> Committee Stage so I will not go into detail.  This section 16, subsection (1), states that:</P>
    <P>Where the Minister is of the opinion that the broadcasting of a particular matter or a matter of a particular class would be likely to promote, or incite to, crime or to lead to disorder, he may by order direct the Authority to refrain from broadcasting the matter or any matter of the particular class, and the Authority shall comply with the order.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to many of us concerning a phrase which could lead to some confusion, and that is, &ldquo;or to lead to disorder&rdquo;. People in the business of journalism, the members of the NUJ, have made strong representations with regard to certain words in that section.  It may be that the English language is at fault.  I have not had any legal training but to my simple mind the word &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; could be interpreted very broadly and lead to the ludicrous position where a very simple thing could ultimately lead to disorder.  People could be using their democratic right to make certain demands such as housewives marching or blocking a road to draw attention to pedestrian crossings, or the dangers for their children on a busy road.  That could lead to disorder and, in turn, could lead to trouble.  If that incident is broadcast the people responsible could find themselves in court because of the actual wording of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is not so naive as to think that this is what is <Col N="1040" /> meant in the word &ldquo;disorder&rdquo;.  I am sure he has in mind much more serious acts than the one I mentioned.  It is conceivable and possible that a very simple thing, like an orderly protest march, a sit in or a sit down, could lead to disorder.  In the event of that being so the broadcasting authority could find themselves defending their actions in broadcasting that protest under this legislation, if this section is not amended.</P>
    <P>The same point applies to section 3, subsection (IA), where the same phrase is used.  Again, depending on the interpretation, the word &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; could lead to difficulties.  Section 3, subsection (IC) is also rather vague.  It states that:</P>
    <P>the Authority is hereby prohibited from unreasonably intruding on the privacy of any individual.</P>
    <P>That is a very fine sentiment and is, no doubt, adhered to.  We are very fortunate in this country to have people involved in the media who apply very high professional standards and bring a very high moral standard to bear on their work.  That cannot be said for other countries at the present time.  If the influence of other countries can be strong in other spheres, there is no reason why the influence of the press and the type of journalism we see in other countries, will not come to us here.  This would result in the lowering of standards.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10 p.m. until 11.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 7th May, 1975.</P>
